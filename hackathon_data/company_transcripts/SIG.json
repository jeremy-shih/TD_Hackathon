Welcome to the Signet Jewelers Limited Q3 Fiscal 2018 Results Conference Call. During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded today, November 21, 2017 at 8:30 AM Eastern Time.","I would now like to turn the meeting over to your host for today\u2019s call, James Grant, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, James.","James Grant","Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. On our call today are Signet\u2019s CEO Gina Drosos; and CFO, Michele Santana. The presentation deck that we will be referencing is available under the Investors section of our website, signetjewelers.com.","During today\u2019s presentation, we will in places make certain forward-looking statements. Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. We urge you to read the risk factors, cautionary language and other disclosures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. And we also draw your attention to Slide #2 in today\u2019s presentation for additional information about forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures.","I will now turn the call over to Gina.","Virginia Drosos","Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. Today, Michele and I will discuss Signet\u2019s third quarter results, provide an update on the progress we\u2019re making on our strategic initiatives, share insight into our plans for the holiday selling season, and provide a detailed update on our credit transition. Then we will open the line for your questions.","Beginning with the third quarter results we reported this morning, Signet had a challenging third quarter. We experienced a sequential decline in our comp sales, which was largely anticipated in what is our smallest quarter with an absence of gift-giving holidays.","We also faced headwinds from weather-related incidents and disruptions in our systems and processes during our credit outsourcing transition. These events further pressured our results and impacted our comp sales by 60 basis points each. I\u2019ll discuss credit in more detail in a few minutes.","Lower sales on fixed costs and the inclusion of R2Net, which has a different business model and carries lower margins, resulted in a decline of 170 basis points in our gross margin. However, excluding R2Net, we delivered higher gross merchandise margins despite a heavily promotional environment.","We saw improved effectiveness from our streamlined promotional strategies and sharper customer targeting. We also continue to focus on cost control. We\u2019ve reduced expenses and improved our SG&A rate by 10 basis points, despite the 70 basis point unfavorable impact of R2Net transaction costs.","In total, for the third quarter, we recorded a loss of $0.20 per share, including transaction costs of $0.25 and a $0.10 negative impact of the weather and credit-related events that I mentioned moments ago. As you can see, $0.35 of the loss was related to transactions, weather, and credit disruption.","Importantly, I\u2019m encouraged that we advanced our strategic initiatives during the quarter and they are beginning to deliver tangible results that I\u2019ll discuss in detail in a few minutes. But first, I\u2019d like to take a moment to provide more insight into our credit outsourcing transition.","As you know, in October, we completed the first phase of strategic outsourcing of our credit portfolio to Alliance Data and Genesis Financial Solutions. This was the right strategic decision for Signet, as it allows us to derisk our balance sheet, streamline our organizational and capital structure, and place a greater focus on what we do best, delivering an outstanding OmniChannel jewelry shopping experience for our customers.","This was a very complex transaction involving over 2 million credit accounts. And therefore, execution of the transition has been a priority for us since we announced the transaction in May. We\u2019ve had a multifunctional team working in concert with our new partners, testing systems, and working through all aspects of the transition.","Unfortunately, we experienced significant executional disruptions related to the transition. These were primarily related to the conversion of IT systems and the magnitude of in-store process changes related to the new program. And in the first several weeks, the issues had a compounding impact.","For example, server interruptions and downside \u2013 downtime resulted in an overwhelming number of calls to our partners\u2019 customer service centers, leading to extraordinarily long wait times. This resulted in a sub-optimal credit experience for our store consultants and customers. We have been working with urgency to resolve these issues.","We\u2019re confident that we\u2019ve fixed the critical majority of the systems issues and our internal process metrics have improved in recent weeks. However, we haven\u2019t seen a full recovery yet, and so we expect credit sales to continue to be impacted in Q4, negatively affecting our fiscal 2018 guidance.","I want to assure you that the credit situation has the full attention of our leadership team, partners, and team members and will remain one of my personal top priorities until the entire issue has been resolved. This level of disruption to our customer service is unacceptable. We will remain resolutely focused on improving the reliability of our operations to be able to drive sustainable and predictable growth at Signet.","Finally, on the positive side of credit, I will note that we are in advanced discussions with potential buyers for the remainder of our credit portfolio, and are increasingly confident that phase two will be completed in the first-half of 2018.","Now moving to Slide 4. As I communicated previously, we are focused on three key strategic priorities to improve Signet\u2019s competitive advantage: Customer First, OmniChannel, and building a culture of agility and efficiency. We achieved some early wins during the third quarter across these three pillars, which I will discuss on the next slide.","Starting with Customer First. Having spent almost my entire career in the consumer sector, I\u2019m acutely aware that the backbone of a customer-driven organization like ours is a deep understanding of what the consumer wants. This is particularly important for Signet, as we engage with consumers to help them celebrate the most memorable moments in their lives.","Over the last year, we\u2019ve tested a number of promotional strategies, and heard loudly and clearly that our customers want simpler focused offers. We successfully implemented these strategies around Labor Day and our October bridal event, which resonated well with our customers, and we aligned our plan accordingly heading into the holiday season. We strengthened our competitive positioning in the fashion category with an enhanced assortment at key price points and saw improving results in these updated collections.","Next, we significantly ramped up our digital and social media efforts, which has high influence with our target audiences. We are now active on all six of the most popular social media platforms, and we more than doubled our impressions year-to-date reaching nearly 1 billion impressions and we\u2019ll continue to build on this growth. We also launched our first-ever influencer campaign in Q3, which we\u2019re extending to over 100 influencers in Q4 from whom we expect over 100 million impressions.","Our social media efforts are proving highly effective, with three times the number of impressions per invested dollar than traditional media, while allowing us to deliver more targeted and personalized messages. We\u2019re reaching people five times more likely to be married soon than through traditional marketing efforts.","To further accelerate our focus on the consumer, we\u2019ve been making investments in advanced data science and analytics. A great example is the data management platform we launched in October. This system allows us to identify fashion and bridal customers and analyze their prior activity on our websites, so we can better target them and enhance their shopping experience.","Taking this information, we\u2019re now delivering personalized content on our websites, providing smarter browsing and pairing recommendations and customizing our marketing messages to better align with customers\u2019 personal journeys.","To put it into perspective, last year, less than 3% of our customers were served a personalized page on arrival to our websites. This year, it will be around 20%. We\u2019re already seeing double-digit improvement in our conversion metrics. We\u2019ve also taken an important step to build our first-ever customer data analytics team of data scientists and hired a new executive leader in Q3. This team will focus on deeper customer insights and engagements to drive our Customer First priorities.","Moving to OmniChannel. As you know, we\u2019ve been working tirelessly since last year to improve our eCommerce capabilities, in Q3, we added several important functionalities to our Sterling websites to better integrate the store experience with online.","These include the ability to search for inventory in local stores; online appointment booking to meet with a diamond consultant in a store; a proactive live chat functionality; and the OmniChannel bag which sinks the products customers add to their cart online or view in-store into one virtual shopping bag that can be accessed anywhere. The enhancements we made on our OmniChannel platforms combined with the acquisition of R2Net resulted in 56% eCommerce sales growth in the quarter.","On the Zale side, we upgraded our eCommerce sites to the new hybris platform, which has a more user-friendly design and functionality. We experienced some expected conversion in SCO issues during the launch, but traffic has rebounded coming out of the quarter. The website is now functioning at improved speed and performance and it\u2019s ready for the holidays. We\u2019ve already seen our key metrics ahead of the same period last year, including conversion up a 11% and traffic up 21%.","As you know, we recently completed the strategic acquisition of R2Net. The transaction enabled us to rapidly enhance our digital technology capabilities. We have already started to implement a number of synergies.","Starting with the high-quality diamond imagery and content technology, we\u2019re building a Segoma diamond photography center in Akron, scheduled to start production in Q4. We\u2019re also installing Retina Display screens in select Jared stores, dedicated to showcasing this technology. The diamonds are all photographed in stoning 360 degree high-definition and 40 times magnification, allowing our customers to truly see each and every detail in the diamond they\u2019re purchasing.","Next, we rolled out an impressive diamond console technology on our Jared Design-A-Ring platform this month available online 24\/7 to offer real-time diamond consultation to customers, including the ability to share their screens and provide expert guidance on everything from the specs to the grading certificate.","Finally, we\u2019re uniquely styling R2Net\u2019s Ring Try-on App for Kay, the ability to virtually try-on and experience the rings on your mobile phone, as if they were on your finger will inject more fun into the jewelry shopping journey. Beyond Q4, we are already working on a number of projects to further leverage R2Net\u2019s technology and innovation capabilities.","Finally, I will talk about some results on building a culture of agility and efficiency. As I mentioned last quarter, we are executing on several productivity initiatives. In fiscal 2018, we drove expense reductions related to corporate overhead, as well as from advertising expense associated with a shift from traditional to higher ROI digital advertising.","We have nearly completed the consolidation of our distribution centers to service all of our U.S. store brands from Akron. This new and upgraded facility will position us for growth, expanding capacity to three times prior levels upon completion and will reduce our distribution costs by 13% over the next two years.","We are also exploring ways to simplify and streamline our processes to drive faster and more efficient execution. For example, during Q3, we streamlined the responsibilities of our store associates releasing over 80,000 hours per month from administrative tasks that can be reinvested in customer service and training.","On the next slide, I will briefly discuss our holiday initiatives. First, we fully analyzed last year\u2019s holiday performance and addressed the gaps, which we estimate accounted for approximately 400 basis points of the comp to decline in Q4 of last year. That is the estimated combined impact of last eCommerce business, as well as business to the stores.","As I mentioned, we made important enhancements to our Sterling eCommerce platforms and are pleased to see that our efforts have been paying off evident from the 34% year-over-year growth we delivered in Q3. Another miss we had last year was our fashion assortment, in the $200 to $700 price range, which we strengthened this year and has already shown positive results for Q3.","We introduced our new Interwoven collection earlier this month, which is targeted for the gifter, especially younger couples. It is a beautiful diamond collection that symbolizes two lives interwoven to become one with a single diamond. We launched with a 36-item assortment, most of which are below the $1,000 price point together with a digital-led marketing campaign.","This new collection works well with the stacking and layering trend, which is currently one of the hottest trends in jewelry. Capitalizing on this trend, we added one to two display cases in each of our North American stores devoted to stacking and layering and have been expanding our assortments throughout October and November.","We also expanded assortments in our exclusive collections with new colors, shapes and sizes. I\u2019ll highlight a few that we\u2019re very excited about. We\u2019ve been testing Disney enchanted bridal and fashion exclusives in our Zale division since last spring. And based on strong feedback from our customers, we expanded the distributions to all Zales and Peoples stores.","In Vera Wang, we are driving newness and shapes and colors in the engagement category and expanded the fashion line to more stores with a greater assortment. We also added beautiful new items to our LeVian collection, another Jared exclusive that comes in unique color gems and styles.","Another new collection, we are excited about is Emmy London that launched last month at Kay with a 50-item assortment at price points that range from $60 to $2,000. Emmy Scarterfield is an accomplished luxury British shoe designer, that\u2019s known for her inspired bridal and special occasion styles. With these initiatives and more, our fashion assortment this year contains over 50% new items this year versus last year.","Our bridal offer also remains comprehensive and highly compelling. Product and pricing tests during this summer have led to line extensions, more solitaire designs, additional carat weights and fancy shapes and the continual development of our key brands, as I mentioned.","Moving to marketing and promotions, we will have a simpler and more focused marketing strategy this holiday. This applies to both our promotional offers, which will be consistent for longer periods of time and the number of ads we will have on TV. We nearly halved the number of TV commercials for the holiday season, and are focused on brand equity building instead of purely promotions.","We also continued to better integrate our messaging across channels and shift our marketing dollars to digital from traditional. In fact, our digital marketing spend in Q4 of this year will make up nearly 30% of our overall spend compared to only 19% last year.","And finally, we\u2019re increasing our focus on targeting her and millennial consumers in addition to him. We added female and millennial focused content in our ads and realigned the scheduling of TV commercials. The robust digital and social media plan I discussed earlier also supports our enhanced reach among these key demographics. This is a strong and much improved plan for the holidays to help our customers celebrate this exciting season.","Before I turn it over to Michele to provide more details on our Q3 performance and fiscal year outlook, I\u2019d like to reiterate a few key points. We\u2019re aggressively transforming this company. We completed two strategic and complex transactions during the third quarter, the acquisition of our R2Net and the first phase of our credit outsourcing.","On Customer First, OmniChannel, and our Culture, we delivered a number of very important wins. We significantly improved our eCommerce sales; made critical shifts in our digital marketing, data analytics, and targeting; and added numerous new features in our websites to connect with our in-store experience.","We also implemented some important R2Net synergies ahead of plan. Yet on the credit transaction, it\u2019s clear that our change management processes weren\u2019t fully ready to absorb this level of complexity. And while the identified systems issues are behind us, the process changes are still cycling through our field operations and will take sometime to be fully absorbed.","I\u2019m disappointed that we underestimated the magnitude of this change. But we will keep working tirelessly to handle issues and learn from this, as we continue to drive needed transformation of Signet. I and Signet\u2019s leadership team are committed to drive all changes necessary, strategic, cultural and executional to deliver stronger and more reliable results going forward. This will take time and we have more work to do.","However, we believe we are on the right track to create a more competitive Signet that is positioned for sustainable profitable growth. Michele?","Michele Santana","Thank you, Gina. For the third quarter, Signet\u2019s total sales were $1.2 billion, down 2.5% year-over-year, or 2.8% on a constant currency basis. Comp sales decreased 5% compared to a decline of 2% in the prior year period. The acquisition of R2Net contributed 40 basis points of favourability to comp sales, well an estimated 120 basis points of negative impact was attributed to adverse weather and disruptions in our systems and processes associated with a credit outsourcing transition that occurred in mid-October.","From a banner perspective, across the majority of banners, higher average transaction values were more than offset by a decline in the number of transactions. However, in Kay, we did see both the decline in ATV and the number of transactions due primarily to bridal and in part due to the impact of credit disruption.","In looking at category performance, fashion jewelry and select categories in key price points performed well with some encouraging signs from the newness in our assortment. Bridal was challenged during the quarter, particularly in our Kay banner, as I just mentioned. And it was disproportionately impacted by the issues related to the credit transition that launched a week later than our three-week October bridal promotion. October was a strong performance period for a Zale banner who exited the quarter on positive comps.","On a channel basis, eCommerce sales grew 56% over last year and represented 7% of total sales compared to 4.4% in the prior year, primarily driven by the recent acquisition of R2Net. Excluding the 47 days of sales related to R2Net, eCommerce growth was 10.5% and represented 5% of sales. We saw strong growth in our Kay and Jared digital sales, driven by the number of enhancements we have made to our sites combined with investments in digital marketing.","As Gina mentioned, eCommerce performance for Zale was affected by the transition to the new hybris platform. This new technology has replaced previous website architecture with a more user-friendly interface, enhanced features and improved functionality. As is the case with any website relaunch, we experienced a post implementation decrease in traffic during the third quarter following the change. As we head into the holiday season, recent trends have shown the traffic and conversion have resumed to the levels that we would expect to see.","So moving on to the income statement. For the quarter, gross margin was $321.1 million, or 27.8% of sales. The decline of 170 basis points includes 30 basis points of deleverage related to R2Net, which carries a lower gross margin rate. The residual decline of 140 basis points in gross margin is attributed to lower sales leading to deleverage on fixed costs, higher inventory disposition costs associated with the distribution center consolidation, and offset in part by higher gross merchandise margin rate and lower bad debt expense. The lower bad debt expense rate is attributed to the decline in our receivables portfolio associated with the sale of our prime account.","SG&A expense was $375.9 million, or 32.5% of sales, and that compares to $386.6 million, or 32.6% of sales in the prior year quarter. Total SG&A declined by $10.6 million, or 2.7% over prior year and leveraged 10 basis points in rate. SG&A includes $8.1 million of transaction-related costs associated with the R2Net acquisition, which unfavorably impacted the SG&A rate by 70 basis points. Excluding these transaction costs, the SG&A rate would have been 31.8%, which includes 30 basis points of leverage related to R2Net who has a lower SG&A rate.","Further, as previously communicated, we remain focused on streamlining our organization and optimizing our cost structure. In the quarter, we continue to realize cost savings for payroll and payroll-related benefits in both stores and corporate, including a 4 million non-cash gain related to curtailment of our UK pension plan, as well as other select corporate expenses.","Additionally, we continue to enhance our marketing efforts with higher return investments through an increased mix of digital advertisements with a more prudent spending through traditional channels. This mix in marketing efforts has resulted in efficient spend and savings.","Upon the close of the credit transaction with Alliance Data Systems or ADS, we\u2019ve recognized a $10.2 million pre-tax non-cash gain, reflecting the future profit-sharing agreement on the receivable balances sold to ADS in the third quarter.","In addition, $22.4 million of credit transaction costs related to legal, advisory, implementation and retention expenses were also recognized. On a net basis, the aggregate of the two items unfavorably impacted operating income by $12.2 million and margin rate by a 110 basis points.","Other operating income was $72.5 million, a $3.9 million increase over prior year. Operating margins declined 220 basis points, which includes 170 basis point unfavorable impact related to the net credit transaction cost of $12.2 million and the R2Net transaction cost of $8.1 million. R2Net virtually had no impact on operating margin rate.","The third quarter included an income tax benefit of $7.2 million, compared to a $2.4 million expense in the prior year. The benefit for the third quarter represents the adjustment required to provide for taxes at the expected annual effective tax rate of 22%. We recorded a loss per share of $0.20, compared to earnings of $0.20 in the same quarter last year. The quarter included a $0.25 loss related to the net credit transaction costs and the R2Net transaction costs.","In addition, the combination of weather impact and credit disruption negatively impacted our earnings per share by an estimated $0.10. Note that in Q3, we utilized our basic share count to calculate EPS in the third quarter.","So turning to working capital and free cash flow. We continue to drive improvements in working capital during the quarter. We ended the third quarter with $2.5 billion in net inventory, which is down 6.9% year-over-year. Reductions in inventory continued to be driven in our Zale division by continued enhancements in how we manage Zale stores, carrying less product per store and focusing on displays of our most successful collections. We continue to view inventory levels as an area of opportunity to further drive working capital efficiencies.","At the end of our quarter, net accounts receivable was $640 million, compared to $1.6 billion last year, reflecting the sale of our prime receivables of $960 million to ADS. I\u2019ll share further details on portfolio key metrics momentarily. The proceeds of $960 million received from ADS were used to fully repay the $600 million ADS facility and $350 million short-term bridge loan that was used to fund the acquisition of R2Net. We ended the quarter with $256 million borrowed on a revolver and $732 million in debt related to our term loan and senior unsecured notes.","Free cash flow generated in the year-to-date period was $1.3 billion, compared to $165 million in the prior year. Excluding the proceeds received on the partial sale of our receivable portfolio, free cash flow was up nearly $200 million over last year. The increase was driven primarily by working capital efficiencies through inventory reductions, as I just previously discussed, and lower capital spend year-over-year. In the quarter, no share repurchases were completed. However, year-to-date, we have repurchased 12% of our shares.","So moving on to our credit portfolio on Slide 9. Our third quarter credit sales in the Sterling division were $402 million, a decrease of 15.3% over prior year. Credit participation was 59.6%, down 7.2 percentage points from prior year. Similar to our second quarter, we continue to see a decline in the application volume of approximately 15%, thereby resulting in a lower number of approved applications.","Prior to the mid-October credit conversion, our credit penetration rate was running about 300 basis points unfavorable to the prior year as a result of lower applications. Additionally, October applications were negatively impacted by technical interruptions, as well as process change associated with the credit transition, as store personnel were to become more accustomed to the new procedures.","As I mentioned, we ended the quarter with overall receivables substantially down from the prior year due to the sale of our prime receivables. The average monthly payment collection rate for the third quarter was 10.2%, compared to 10.6% last year. The decline in collection rate is primarily the function of increased usage of extended payment credit plans, resulting in lower required scheduled payments.","Interest income from finance charges which makes up virtually all of our other operating income on our income statement was $70 million, an increase of $3 million, or 4% compared to the prior year period.","Net bad debt expense was approximately $52 million, or $5 million lower than last year, attributed to lower ending receivables, and when taken together with finance income generated an operating profit of $18 million. The net combination was up $8 million versus last year. The allowance related to the residual part of our credit portfolio not sold was $109 million, or 15.3% of gross receivables.","For comparative purposes, had the portfolio been bifurcated in the same manner in the prior year, the residual receivables would have totaled $714 million with an allowance of $111 million, or 15.5% of gross receivables in the third quarter last year.","As it relates to residual back book, we\u2019re very pleased with the progress related to phase two that includes the sale of this portfolio. Also in June, we had fully rolled out our merchandised leasing program to all U.S. store banners. We are still early in the implementation of this new program and are focused on execution and adoption across all banners.","Lease sales for the quarter were $16 million and continue to grow gradually as a percent of all tenders. As we have previously noted, effective with Q4 and through the end of the year, we\u2019ll only underwrite about 50% of our lowest tier accounts that represented 7% of total Sterling credit sales and expect leasing sales to replace this population. In addition, we are no longer underwriting credit insurance as a result of the credit transaction.","So now turning our attention to guidance. As we think about the fourth quarter of 2018 versus the fourth quarter of 2017, we have worked diligently to fix the issues that negatively impacted results during the holidays last year.","As Gina had detailed, we\u2019ve invested in our eCommerce platforms to improve stability, as well as the user experience, and we\u2019ll have an exciting assortment in the important $200 to $700 fashion price range. However, the disruptions related to the outsourcing of our credit portfolio has impacted our view for the year. We have revised our fiscal 2018 outlook and now expect same-store sales to be down mid-single digits and earnings per share in the range of $6.10 to $6.50 with the low end assuming no improvement in our credit performance.","As Gina mentioned, we have resolved the critical maturity of the technical issues that impacted our ability to extend credit, but will continue to be impacted by process and change management-related issues, particularly in Kay that will take longer to resolve. We expect our Q4 results to be impacted by this transition. So where we had previously expected Q4 to resolve in a positive comp, we now believe that comps maybe down low to mid-single digits and Q4 earnings per share to be $3.86 to $4.28.","To also further issue a model in Q4, we expect gross margins to be relatively flat due to the inclusion of R2Net and SG&A to delever over prior year due to lower sales. I also remind you that Q4 operating income as guided includes the net impact of credit outsourcing of $22 million, or $0.16 per share dilution, which consists of the elimination of bad debt, late fee income, finance charge income, SG&A savings, and net servicing costs. We anticipate no further transaction costs to be incurred in Q4.","Due to profit shift mix, we are updating our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 to 22%. Our weighted average share count will drop materially by the year-end due to the Q2 share repurchases of 8.1 million shares and our CapEx in square footage guidance is slightly lower than previously guided.","And with that, I\u2019ll open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Simeon Siegel of Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. Hi, good morning, guys.","Virginia Drosos","Good morning.","Simeon Siegel","Can you elaborate a little bit more Gina on the credit transition issues? I know you mentioned wait times, were more people rejected that they just walked out of the door before finding out. So any color there? And then you\u2019re obviously making a lot of changes this quarter, you called out credit, the DC, Zale, eComm, et cetera. Just given the changes generally bringing about disruption, which we\u2019re seeing, what do we need to think about for next year? Thanks.","Virginia Drosos","Sure. Thinks, Simeon. So let me start with credit. So we\u2019re all disappointed that this didn\u2019t go more smoothly and have all hands on deck working on it within our multifunctional team, our leadership team, and partnered with our customers. And the disruption that we\u2019ve experienced can largely be characterized into two buckets: technology issues and process and change management.","So I\u2019ll give you some examples starting with technology. In the last week of Q3 and the first week of Q4, so and the first two weeks of Q4, so our first three weekends of the transaction, we experienced slowdowns or outages on servers, each due to different causes that had discrete negative impacts on sales. We have fixed each one of those.","But in the mean time, we saw longer than usual new application process times and slow account lookups, which frustrated customers and did cause some customers to abandon the application process. It also led to sub-optimal experience for our store associates, which has caused our store associates to question how quickly they can process credit applications, so these process issues we believe will take longer to normalize, but we will continue to make this a top priority until all the issues are resolved.","In terms of overall transitions, here\u2019s what I would say. The execution issues around credit have been related to specific credit systems and processes, and the huge amount of change management that we were undertaking. I think we\u2019ve learned a lot from this, and it is absolutely a key priority for us to capture those learnings, so that as we move forward on additional transformation that we bring to Signet, we will do that with an eye toward training, toward fully understanding all of the impacts throughout our organization, and how we work with our partners in an even better and more upfront way to anticipate any issues.","So we\u2019ll be undergoing a full post-transition review, and we are committed to building a culture of agility and efficiency and continual learning that will help us to transform this company very successfully as we move ahead.","Simeon Siegel","Okay, thanks. And then either Gina or Michele, you did call out positive merch margins and despite the comp pressures, any color you can give there in terms of your expectations for maybe the competitive landscape and your ability to continue, or how you\u2019d view the merch margin trajectory?","Virginia Drosos","So we expect the competitive landscape to remain highly promotional during the holiday season. The great news is that we got out in front of learning about how to optimize our promotional offerings and how to target those promotions to customers more effectively. And so, we\u2019ve been able to be competitive in this highly promotional environment, but still improve our gross merchandise margins.","Simeon Siegel","Great. Thanks a lot. Best of luck for the holiday.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Virginia Drosos","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Virginia Drosos","Hi, Lorraine. Lorraine?","Operator","Mr. Hutchinson.","Stephen Albert","Sorry, I was on mute. This is Stephen Albert on for Lorraine. I just had a quick couple of follow-ups on the credit disruption. So how confident are you that that the disruption that you\u2019re experiencing quarter-to-date is done by the end of 4Q? And then I guess, just to clarify, so since this credit servicing functions on the non-prime book have already been outsourced to Genesis, is this a one-time disruption or would you expect maybe some similar disruption in processes when you outsource sub-prime book in the first-half of next year? Thanks.","Virginia Drosos","So, as I said, we have all hands on deck on this credit transition, our partners, our leadership team, our team members are working through all the issues that we\u2019ve identified to date. We\u2019ve been having daily calls and we are systematically fixing issues every day as we go, and so we have rapidly responded to each issue as we have uncovered it.","The fact is, we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know, and there are also process and behavior-related issues that may take longer to resolve. So for now, we know that our Q4 performance will be impacted, so we\u2019re being prudent and revising our guidance for the full-year.","Michele Santana","Yes. I guess, in terms of your second question, which I believe was, could we see maybe something similar when we close out phase two of the outsourcing on the residual book and underwriting the forward funding for those receivables? And what I would say is one, first, I would start with that, we\u2019re very pleased that we are making great progress as it relates to phase two.","We\u2019re very much in advanced discussions with our potential funding partners and feel very confident in terms of being able to complete this in the first-half. A lot of the more complex heavy lifting is done as part of phase one. There will still be work that we need to do in phase two. And I think, going back to Gina\u2019s earlier comments, definitely lessons learned in terms of change management, process changes will be utilized to ensure that we have a much smoother transition as we look to phase two.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Tunick of RBC. Your line is open.","Brian Tunick","Thanks. Good morning. I guess, wanted to understand a little on the Zale comments you made. Obviously, understanding you didn\u2019t have any credit disruption. Just curious what you saw in the quarter, obviously you\u2019re commenting about, I think, positive comps coming out of October. So wanted to hear your thoughts about the Zale performance opportunities. Could they even get better into the holiday quarter?","And then back to Kay just your confidence now in progressive, I guess, ramping up to take that 7% of the underwriting that you guys won\u2019t be doing this year. Just what\u2019s your confidence that progressive will step up for that number? Thank you very much.","Virginia Drosos","So starting with your question about Zale, we\u2019re seeing strong performance in our Zale division, which as you said, has not been impacted by the credit transition. So we saw sequential run rate improvement at sales from September to October, driven primarily by bridal sales, as well as eCommerce. Fashion also ended the quarter with a strong trajectory. And we have seen strengths continue into November, where our run rates on Zale are very positive.","We\u2019re very excited about the Disney collection and the exclusive items we have on that. We\u2019re doing great on solitaires. Piercing Pagoda is off to a terrific start on gold, which is a major trend for this holiday season. So in place \u2013 in a place where we were purely able to implement all of the strategic initiatives that we\u2019ve talked about, which is getting eCommerce to a great place, getting our fashion assortment aligned, strengthening our bridal, we\u2019re really seeing that payoff and work. So we\u2019re very, very excited about the progress to date on Zale.","In terms of leasing, just as a reminder of leasing, when people apply for credit, we decline about 45% of those customers. And so we are able then now in a way that we weren\u2019t before to offer them a new financing alternative, which is leasing. It\u2019s a new muscle, we didn\u2019t ever do that before. And so our team is learning how to present multiple finance options, but we\u2019re seeing a good pick up of that. We\u2019re seeing in the 20% to 25% range of pick up on the leasing and it is improving quarter-on-quarter. So we are continuing to be able to leverage that as a new and strong financing option for our customers.","Michele Santana","Yes, and I would just also add that, we\u2019re gradually pulling back on that bottom 7% of the portfolio that we talked about for the holiday period. So think of it about 50% of that. So with that and combined with the comments that Gina said, I feel fairly confident that we can cover that population.","Brian Tunick","Great. Thanks and good luck for improved performance.","Virginia Drosos","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lindsay Drucker-Mann of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Bill Schultz","Hi, everyone. This is Bill Schultz on for Lindsay.","Virginia Drosos","Hi, Bill.","Bill Schultz","Just had a question for you guys. I wanted to sort of leapfrog off Simeon\u2019s question on merchandise margins. I think, you called out, excluding R2Net the underlying merch margins were up in the quarter. What are the drivers of that? Was it a function of a mix shift away from bridal in the quarter?","And sort of second question is, your inventories look pretty lean exiting the quarter. Do you anticipate a continued improvement in merch margins around holiday? Thanks.","Virginia Drosos","Yes. So let me take your question on the merch margins in terms of what some of those drivers were during the quarter. I\u2019d say, it\u2019s a combination of items. Definitely, there was a favorable impact with mix. The other item I would add is, particularly we see on the Zale side synergies. If you recall, the synergies that we\u2019re looking to achieve this year, a substantial portion of them resulted were related in terms of our gross merchandise margins, whether it\u2019s sourcing-related, discounting controls, et cetera. So it\u2019s a combination of those items that\u2019s driving favorability in the merch margins. And then your second question was related to inventory levels, I think that\u2019s\u2026","Bill Schultz","Yes, correct.","Michele Santana","Yes. I would say that\u2019s an area that I\u2019ve been very excited about, because I think, I continue to see opportunity to optimize the inventory levels. And when you start thinking about technology, particularly with the R2Net and technology that we can start to deliver into our stores, I think, it just enhances the opportunity we have to further optimize working capital, particularly related to inventory.","Bill Schultz","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rick Patel of Needham and Company. Your line is open.","Rick Patel","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I also have a question on some of these lingering credit issues. So a credit participation fell 720 basis points last year. And it sounds like 400 basis point of this was related to disruptions and processes. So once some of these challenges are resolved, do you expect to recapture that 400 basis points all else equal, or do you think it will reset at a lower level? Basically, I\u2019m a little unsure ADS has tightened their lending standards. And if they did, to what extent that would remain a headwind going forward?","Michele Santana","Yes. So why don\u2019t I take that? In terms of \u2013 keep in mind that with ADS whatever applications they don\u2019t approve that flows through over to Genesis, which currently Signet continues to perform the underwriting on that. So when you look in terms of Q3, the 720 basis points and if 300 bps was kind of the pre-trend prior to conversion, we definitely with the disruption we saw, we saw a follow-up in credit applications, as well as a fall off in the actual approval rate and that was really hindered by the downtime with the systems, call center times, frustration with the customers and store associates.","What \u2013 as we think about going forward and what we continue to see in the first three weeks of November is that, the application volume is running similar to the pre-trend. And each week, we continue to see those approval rates getting better to the point that we\u2019re largely in line. However, what we are seeing is a mix impact between in-store and eCommerce, more applications on the eCommerce side and that has a disproportionate impact in terms of approval rates.","So I think, as we continue to work through the process change management that Gina talked about, we definitely should be able to get back to where we were, sense the 7% of the portfolio that we talked about that will gradually start to decline the underwriting in that group.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. And so the third quarter impact was 60 basis points of the implied fourth quarter drag based on your guidance revision is 700 basis points. So is that because we\u2019re talking about a full quarter of this being a headwind or are there other things coming into play that would create a bigger impact on 4Q?","Virginia Drosos","Yes, what I would say, it\u2019s a full quarters \u2013 full fourth quarter and it really is worst case scenario.","Unidentified Analyst","I got. If I could squeeze in one more. Any initial reads on interwoven, whether that\u2019s able to capture the millennial customers that you\u2019re going for? Any initial thoughts on success by banner would be great? Thank you.","Virginia Drosos","Yes. We\u2019re really excited about interwoven, it\u2019s largely our first ever initiative targeted to millennial consumers. And it represents a good consumer insight, which is that millennial consumers don\u2019t necessarily follow the same traditional relationship journey as their parents, often, they\u2019re weaving their lives together in different ways long before marriage. So they might move in together, even have kids together before they\u2019re buying an engagement ring.","So for the first time what interwoven offers them is an opportunity to celebrate that journey together with a new item that represents how their lives have come together. And I love to sell line actually on it, but wherever we go, we go together. What\u2019s also very exciting about this initiative is how we\u2019ve surrounded it with millennial targeted marketing.","So it\u2019s our first-ever social media influencer campaign. I mentioned, we have about 100 influencers lined up, who will create over 100 million impressions. These are largely couple influencers, and we\u2019ve done a very interesting ad campaign for interwoven that features a couple deciding to go on a trip together and doesn\u2019t matter where they go, they\u2019re going together and we\u2019ll be replicating the idea of that with sweepstakes offering to send couples on a trip. And what\u2019s featured in all of our marketing to date is the necklace, which is really the most important part of that item launch that we\u2019ve rolled out and the sales on that are encouraging.","So we\u2019re excited overall about the opportunities to speak to a new target audience through new mediums in a different way and continue to learn and grow in that area of our business.","Operator","And our next question comes from Omar Saad of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. This is [indiscernible] on for Omar. I have a question about the overall environment just, I know earlier in the year there was a lot of independent liquidation, it seems like that has settled out, department stores were getting a little bit more aggressive. And I know you were looking to change your promotional cadence in the back-half of the year to step up and reach a different customer. Can you just talk about where you think the environment is today and how your strategy is looking forward to?","Virginia Drosos","Sure, so I\u2019ll start. Michele, you can fill in any other details. So first on the promotional environment, as I said, we expect the strong promotional environment, particularly in mall stores and department stores to continue. We\u2019re expecting aggressive promotions not only for Black Friday, but also through the holiday season. We\u2019re also very pleased about the offerings that we\u2019ve put in place and believe they are well tested with our customers and transparent and really create, I think, a high value shopping experience along with our high-quality merchandise and the great service that we offer customers in store.","So we are very open eyed about what we think the promotional environment will be, and believe we\u2019ve constructed a good plan in that context.","Michele Santana","Yes and I mean, I would just add for sure, our overall goal is to grow share and do that profitably and meet the mid-market with strong bridal position and also strengthening our fashion assortment. And I think the comment that Gina had mentioned earlier show that we really have planted the roots in all of those areas. So when we think about the strategy and going forward, I just offer that perspective as well.","Just one other thing speaking about independence, an area where independence have been particularly strong in the past is on solitaire diamond ring. Our loose stone volume at Jared is higher than it\u2019s been. We\u2019ve put more larger carat weights and high-quality diamonds into Kay and Zales. Solitaires are doing extremely well for us. So again, very open eyed on the competitive environment and finding opportunities to grow our business and achieve positive market share in those bridal, as well as fashion.","I don\u2019t want to miss the point I made earlier, our fashion assortment is very strong this year in the $200 to $700 price point, which is the key price point we missed last year, and in total in fashion, we have 50% more items in the right price point range than we did a year ago. So good analysis by the team and we\u2019re feeling like we\u2019re well-positioned for holiday.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Lejuez of Citi. Your line is open.","Paul Lejuez","Hey, thanks, guys. Hi, Can you tell us specifically what was the performance of bridal on a year-over-year basis, just the percent change in 3Q versus non-bridal? And also what\u2019s the mix of bridal in 3Q versus 4Q?","And then just second, as you focus more on eComm and digital, even excluding R2Net, if you think about the core business, how you\u2019re thinking about the impact to EBIT margin as more business shifts to online? Thanks.","Michele Santana","Yes. Let me start with bridal and then we can talk about the R2Net business model. I don\u2019t actually read it, we have the bridal stats in terms of percentage this quarter versus last quarter, or Q4. But what we do know and as I mentioned on the call, we did decline in bridal. Now that was in large part we had a major bridal promotion in October and that overlapped, at the same time we saw the credit disruption as we are going through conversion.","And when you think about our bridal sales, 75% of bridal sales are usually done using our form of credit. So that really disproportionately impacted what we saw in the bridal during the quarter.","Virginia Drosos","Yes, that promotion actually was off to a very strong start before the credit transition issues hit.","Michele Santana","And then in terms of your question on the R2Net model, so what\u2026.","Unidentified Analyst","[Multiple Speakers] R2Net, actually more of the core business?","Michele Santana","I\u2019m sorry, what?","James Grant","More of the core business.","Unidentified Analyst","[Multiple Speakers]","Virginia Drosos","\u2026as we shift.","Michele Santana","Yes. So the shift on \u2013 yes. So as we think about the shift online more sales being done online, to some extent, that benefits us in terms of our margin rate, because we don\u2019t carry, even though we have shipping cost et cetera associated with the online orders, you don\u2019t have the heavy burden of the full store cost associated with that. So that is actually a benefit to us.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Virginia Drosos","Thank you.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kara Szafraniec of Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Kara Szafraniec","Hey, good morning, everyone. Just two quick questions. First, understanding there was a weather impact in the third quarter due to hurricanes. Just wondering if you could touch on how some of those hurricane impacted regions have rebounded post-hurricane? And if you\u2019re foreseeing any impact into the fourth quarter due to these weather events?","Second, hoping maybe you could touch quickly on the performance of mall versus non-mall source in the quarter? Thanks.","Virginia Drosos","Sure, so I\u2019ll take weather and then Michele, you can talk about mall. So we have a very strong footprint actually in both Florida and Texas. We saw frankly more of an impact on our sterling business than we did on our Zales business from the weather-related issues, and we are seeing consistent improvement of those stores. They didn\u2019t fully improve to pre-weather levels prior to the end of the quarter. So are we still seeing some impacts from that? Yes, albeit small. And so we haven\u2019t really called that out as a big fourth quarter impact, but small.","But the teams are working very hard to regain that. And we \u2013 we\u2019re hoping that consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in the past that as customers begin to get their insurance checks back in and be able to put their lives back together and are looking to celebrate and express love this holiday season that we\u2019ll be able to see some positive impact in those markets from increased buying power on consumers.","Michele Santana","Yes, and in terms of your question on the performance between mall and off-mall, if we look at our off-mall, excluding the outlet, they had performed substantially better than what we saw in terms of the mall, I\u2019d say, in the tune of about 600 basis points better.","Virginia Drosos","All right. Well, thank you so much, everyone. That\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. We appreciate you all joining the call, and we look forward to updating you in January. Happy holidays.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s call. You may disconnect."],"18958":["Signet Jewelers Ltd.

Please go ahead, James.","James Grant","Good morning and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. On our call today are Mark Light, CEO; and Michele Santana, CFO. The presentation deck we will be referencing is available under the investors section of our website, signetjewelers.com.","During today\u2019s presentation we will in places discuss Signet\u2019s business outlook and make certain forward-looking statements. Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. We urge you to read the risk factors, cautionary language and other disclosures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We also draw your attention to slide number 2 in today\u2019s presentation for additional information about forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures.","And now I will turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Light","Thanks, James, and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to start by discussing some of our key points that we would like you to take away from our third quarter financial results presentation. While we are never pleased with lower year-over-year results our sales and earnings exceeded our expectations. In a challenging environment our team delivered some solid results, especially in the fashion jewelry categories, our outlet locations, our online business, our UK stores and finally our kiosk business.","We also managed our SG&A and inventory well, which not only helped earnings but also increased our free cash flow substantially year-over-year. We initiated fourth quarter guidance consistent with our thinking in August. That is, when we gave fiscal year in third quarter guidance on our August call, we obviously implied a fourth quarter guide. And today, we are formally guiding the fourth quarter consistent with our thinking back in August. Our fiscal year earnings guidance is updated to reflect only the flow-through of our third quarter earnings.","Our Zale division delivered a variety of wins in the third quarter. Our sales increased on an inventory decrease, which was driven in part by our continued focus on our integration efforts. Piercing Pagoda delivered nearly a 10% comp sales gain. We saw unfavorable impact to sales lessen in the energy regions where the Zale division stores have a large presence.","And lastly, and perhaps most importantly, our holiday and seasonal initiatives are numerous, well tested and our team members are well trained and prepared to deliver a wonderful customer experience. ","Now let\u2019s get into this more detailed behind these high-level takeaways. We achieved some wins in the third quarter starting with the diamond fashion jewelry category. Our Ever Us two stone diamond jewelry collection produced significantly more sales year-over-year. We also saw contribution from bracelets as we continue to lean into the bracelet trend of stacking with fresh looks and innovative fastening systems in both branded and non-branded collections and our earrings of all types are resonating with customers including the growing trend in earring climbers.","Third quarter sales were also driven in part by select bridal collections. Vera Wang and Neil Lane led the way and a variety of other bridal collections also contributed. We continue to drive forward on our omni-channel initiatives to deliver a seamless experience to our customers. In the third quarter our omni-channel selling approach continued to deliver results. Our e-commerce sales increased, but more importantly, we continue to connect with our customers through enhanced digital experience.","Our new Clienteling system was launched in our Kay and Jared locations. The system provides a single view of the customer with the capability to holistically capture customer information. This enables our team members to improve their interactions with customers before, during and after their visits to our stores or our sites. We have also broadened our affiliate and marketing relationships with other retail shopping sites.","And, finally, the diversity of our real estate footprint served us well. The UK division delivered a 3.6% comp sales increase. Outlets were up 2% with very broad-based gains and Piercing Pagoda delivered strong results in diamond and gold jewelry and we continue to see growth opportunities in the children\u2019s jewelry classification. In the third quarter, our team did a nice job of continuing to drive synergies on the Zale integration. To review a synergy as we define it is a net contribution to operating profit. I won\u2019t go into depth on each of the examples listed here on Slide 5 and the work stream detail behind each one, but as you can see we have got a lot of energy, a lot of activity going on to fully optimize the business operation.","Due to the synergy work being done on our Zale division store inventories they are operating at a much more productive basis, which is assisting in increasing our free cash flow. We also continue to enhance our organizational structure and this has led to leaner, more efficient teams delivering consistent execution of processes. Some of the departments that have streamlined operations are human resources, e-commerce, inventory management, real estate, legal, finance, supply chain, distribution and repair. These are just some examples of the many other projects that are positioning us well to build upon our long history of growth and improving profitability.","Now let\u2019s discuss the fourth quarter where we have historically made about half of our annual profit. As I mentioned, the team is prepared and focused on the opportunities in front of us and we are ready to serve and delight our customers. This is the season when our competitive positioning and our ability to invest in growth enhancing, innovative new products and initiatives really allow Signet to capture a profitable market share.","One of our biggest initiatives is year two of the Ever Us collection. In our experience beacon or industry trend driving strategies like this tend to perform even better in their second year as compared to their first. We are selling additional jewelry categories and styles, higher carat weights and more inventory supported with greater digital, print, social and TV marketing of the Ever Us collection. We also expanded the Vera Wang Love bridal collection into the fashion jewelry category in Zales. This collection includes diamond jewelry as well as pearls, supported with new in-store displays.","Zale is also introducing the new iconic Vera Wang Kindred Heart collection. This holiday season bracelets are sure to continue their momentum. We have beautiful new collections, which include the Le Vian Ombr\u00e9 exclusive which is pictured here which is exclusive in Jared on the slide. Also all eyes are on the ear this fourth quarter as we continue to drive the trend in earrings, earring climbers, studs and hoops. We also see a lot of promise in our Radiant Reflections and our Endless Brilliance collections, which create bigger looks with smaller stones and innovative settings.","In all of our Jared stores, we have reset our Pandora presentation with beautiful new Pandora store-in-stores or boutiques managed by our Pandora specialists. We are selling a broader collection of Pandora products and fashion jewelry, including exclusive products and exclusive collections. It is all supported with new TV advertising creative. The new Chosen Diamond is now in all Jared stores also, which shows customers each stage of the diamond\u2019s journey from a rough diamond to a finished piece of beautiful jewelry.","This is in total alignment with the Jared customer who tends to value this type of product and information. We also designed a brand new TV ad to support the Chosen. We significantly improved websites for Kay and Jared, which incorporates fully responsive design to work seamlessly across all devices. We also significantly increased investment in digital marketing across all of our channels and all of our store banners with more effective targeting and personalization than ever before.","And lastly, we have many targeted marketing plans tying in the 100th anniversary of Kay Jewelers. We have contests, promotions and awareness campaigns using all forms of media. You can get a great sense of the power promotion behind each of our store banners\u2019 TV advertisings. By viewing them at signetjewelers.com just click on the media and you will see our ads.","Now moving on to the strategic review of our credit portfolio. I will focus on a few very high level points. As you can imagine, this is a very intense and complex process to analyze. We are motivated to move as quickly and as prudently as possible in order to remove uncertainty around this issue for all of our constituencies. But we must make a thoughtfully analyzed decision, taking into account near-term and long-term economics as well as our ability to continue serving our customers.","We are analyzing opportunities to create shareholder value by optimizing or monetizing our credit portfolio and we are confident that we will deliver shareholder value regardless of the direction that we choose. Importantly, we are pleased with the interest expressed by several different financial institutions. That concludes my prepared remarks.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Michele.","Michele Santana","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. So let me just start by putting the third quarter in perspective. Our third quarter represents less than 20% of sales and about 5% of operating profit on an annual basis. So as a result of the relatively small size of the quarter this can have some distortion on our ratios. Now with that in mind, I\u2019ll cover our operating performance starting with sales.","For the third quarter, Signet\u2019s comps decreased 2% against an increase of 3.3% in the prior-year third quarter, and that compares to a two-year comp hurdle rate of 7.5%. Of our comp sales decline, about 80 basis points was driven by oil and gas reliant regions. Total Signet sales decreased 2.5% and on a constant exchange basis total sales decreased to 0.5% for the quarter.","Sales on an operating segment basis were as follows. In Sterling Jewelers total sales declined 2.9% to $712 million. Comp sales decreased 3.8% compared to an increase of 3.5% last year and compared to a two-year comp hurdle rate of 10.3%. Sales weakness was more pronounced in the non-core regional store brands, Jared to a lesser extent and energy-dependent regional economies across all store banners.","Fashion jewelry, including select branded diamond jewelry, performed relatively better than the rest of the merchandise portfolio. From a channel perspective, outlets and e-comm performed a little better than the rest of the selling channels. The Zale jewelry operating segment\u2019s total sales increased 0.2% to $282 million and that was flat on a constant currency exchange basis. Comps were down 1.4% against a two-year comp rate of 0.7%.","On a geographic basis, our Zale U.S. total sales increased 0.3% while comps decreased 1.5% and that compares to a two-year comp hurdle rate of 0.7%. In Canada, total sales declined 0.4% or 1.7% on a constant currency basis. Canadian comp sales declined 0.9% against a two-year comp rate of 0.3%. For the Zale jewelry operating segment the modest increase in total sales was driven primarily by select diamond jewelry collection with fashion jewelry in total slightly outperforming bridal.","Q3 results in both U.S. and Canada were also unfavorably impacted by energy-dependent reliant regions. Piercing Pagoda total sales increased 11.3% to $53 million with comp sales of 9.5% on top of a 10% comp rate last year and a two-year comp rate of 8.5%. Sales increases in Pagoda were driven primarily by gold chains and diamond jewelry. In the UK, our total sales decreased 12.8% to $130 million but increased 4.2% at constant currency rates. Comp sales grew 3.6% on top of a 4.1% in the prior year and a two-year comp hurdle rate of 7.8%. Diamond jewelry and prestige watches were the primary drivers of the UK comp sales increases.","So moving on to Signet\u2019s consolidated and adjusted results. On Slide 9, we are continuing to present this reconciliation through the end of fiscal year 2017 to reflect the impacts of purchase accounting as well as IT implementation expenses associated with global systems that will drive future efficiencies and cost benefits. The difference between Signet and adjusted Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and integration cost.","So starting in the lower left portion of the slide on a GAAP basis earnings per share was $0.20. Our third quarter EPS benefited by $0.02 due to a lower tax rate of 12.4% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 31.5%. The Q3 rate is attributed to a lower annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2017, which I will discuss further prior to wrapping up my commentary.","In the next column over purchase accounting adjustments were worth $0.03 of EPS dilution. This was driven primarily by deferred revenue adjustments related to acquisition accounting. The next column over reflects our integration cost, which relate to consulting cost related to information technology implementations. Integration costs were responsible for $0.07 of the EPS dilution. On an adjusted Signet basis in the far right column by adding back the $0.10 worth of adjustments our adjusted EPS was $0.30 for the third quarter.","So looking below the sales line of Signet\u2019s adjusted P&L results, our adjusted gross margin was $352.5 million or 29.6% of adjusted sales, down 100 basis points. The lower rate was due principally to lower sales, higher bad debt expense and deleverage on store occupancy. This was partially offset by favorable merchandise cost and merchandise mix. Adjusted SG&A was $377.3 million, down $10.3 million. The rate was 31.7%, which is flat to prior-year rate. The decline in dollars and steady rate was driven by lower variable compensation and a few other factors, which I will elaborate momentarily.","Other operating income was $68.6 million to 5.8% of sales. This increase of $7.7 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. Adjusted operating income was $43.8 million down 7%. Our adjusted operating margin rate was 3.7%, which is down 20 basis points due primarily to lower top line. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.30, which compares to $0.33 last year, a decrease of $0.03 or 9.1%.","So moving on we will take a closer look at SG&A. Our teams continue to focus on cost control and savings. Our SG&A expense declined $10.3 million as I mentioned or 2.7% in the third quarter. Although the dollar reduction in SG&A wasn\u2019t quite enough to leverage our SG&A rate on lower sales volume, it does reflect prudent use of expenses nonetheless.","Within SG&A, the biggest expense component is payroll. Our store and corporate payroll declined due in part to a variety of factors, which also include lower variable compensation, which flexes with sales and a lower corporate incentive compensation. A one-time accrual reversal that I had briefly mentioned on our last quarter call related to harmonization of Signet\u2019s compensated absent policies and lower merchant fees in the Zale credit program.","Also embedded throughout SG&A is favorability from foreign exchange. Our Q3 advertising expense was also slightly lower and that\u2019s due primarily to a timing shift of spend out of Q3 to post-election period in Q4. Other expenses increased driven predominantly by information technology projects. So moving off the P&L, we will hit a few balance sheet highlights before touching on capital considerations and guidance.","Our strong third quarter ending inventory position reflects the success of our continued focus on inventory optimization. Net inventory ended the period at $2.6 billion. Our teams did a good job of managing inventory levels in a slower sales environment. The decline of 2.8% in inventory compared 30 basis points favorably to Signet\u2019s decline in total sales of 2.5%. We saw sound, prudent management of inventory across categories and divisions. And it\u2019s worth noting that the Zale division inventory declined at a faster rate than Signet overall. This is directly related to the synergy-producing initiative that Mark previously discussed which we call our inventory turnover improvement. Finally, Signet benefited from foreign exchange on inventory procured in currencies other than the relatively strong U.S. dollar.","So now let\u2019s move on and turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Our third quarter in-house credit sales in the Sterling division were $476 million and that\u2019s down 2.3%. Although lower the in-house credit sales were more favorable than the division\u2019s total sales decline and, therefore, gained relative share in the mix of tender. In-house credit participation was 66.8%, up 40 basis points. This was due to faster growth and higher spending among our highest quality cohorts. As a result, we continue to see growth in the credit sales mix within our best credit tiers.","The average monthly payment collection rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was 10.6% compared to 11.1% last year. Our monthly collection rate is calculated as cash payment received divided by beginning accounts receivable. The decline in the collection rate is due principally to credit plan mix and an increase in the average transaction value of what is getting financed. As a result, monthly payments are higher in dollars but lower as a percent of balances, thereby resulting in higher receivables outstanding to be collected.","With that said, our credit plan mix is driving a higher FICO score customer with the rollout of our 36-month bridal plan to select customers. The combination of collection rate decline and a growth in credit participation contributed to an increase in our accounts receivable of $109 million or 8% to $1.55 billion. Interest income for finance charges, which makes up virtually all of the other operating income line our income statement, was $67 million compared to $61.3 million last year.","The increase of $5.7 million was due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables base. Other net bad debt was $57.2 million compared to $53.1 million last year. As a percent of receivables the nearly flat bad debt allowance, which you will see on the next slide in just a minute, was driven primarily by low receivable growth, which was a symptom of the overall sales decline. The net impact of bad debt and finance income generated operating profit of $9.8 million and that\u2019s up $1.6 million.","So now let me take you through some of the key Sterling division allowance for doubtful account metrics. Our total valuation allowance as a percent of gross receivables was 7.9% in the third quarter. The slight increase of 10 basis points for the prior year was driven by a variety of nearly offsetting factors. The impact of lower sales leading to lower receivables growth as well as a lingering effect from the Q2 IT glitch slightly offset the impact of higher quality new borrowers.","On a sequential basis, the ratio was up 50 basis points, the same as prior year reflecting seasonality changes. For the non-performing portion of our receivables as a percent of the gross AR Q3 was 4.9%. This was flat to last year and better by 10 basis points on a sequential basis. In summary, we remain confident in our ongoing credit portfolio performance based on the visibility that we have into our daily collections, weekly roll rate and other key performing metrics. Our portfolio continues to enable responsible and profitable growth of our merchandise sales and earnings.","So just a few highlights in terms of our capital allocation. Year-to-date through the third quarter we repurchased nearly 10 million shares of our common stock, albeit all of our Q3 activity was related to offsetting dilution from our preferred stock issuance. As mentioned in the release, our buyback activity is in line with our expectations and our $525 million accelerated share repurchase program is continuing. Regarding cash and borrowings, the significant increase in free cash generation was driven primarily by favorable changes to working capital and higher net income.","Separately, we\u2019ve borrowed from our revolving credit facility for seasonal working capital needs during Q3. This was normal activity and also within our expectations. Finally, our capital allocation policies remain unchanged. Signet maintains a balanced approach to investing in the growth of its business as well as returning capital to our shareholder via a growing dividend and share repurchases.","So with that let\u2019s turn to our financial guidance. As Mark indicated our fourth quarter guidance is consistent with the guidance implied on our August call. Signet\u2019s fourth quarter comparable-store sales are expected to decrease between 2% to 4%. We feel well-prepared and focused for the fourth quarter and what remains a relatively uncertain environment. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $4 to $4.20.","The weighted average common shares outstanding is expected to be about 76 million. The increase in our fourth quarter shares from third quarter is driven by the inclusion of the effect of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion of our preferred security. In the third quarter, these shares were anti-dilutive and, therefore, were not in the calculation. EPS guidance for both Q4 and the full year implies a flow-through of synergies, general cost controls and higher finance income, partially offset by unfavorable FX.","Below the operating profit line our earnings per share guidance also is favorably impacted by, first, a lower tax rate of 25% to 26% due primarily to profit mix and, secondly, fewer shares from repurchase activity in the first half. The fiscal year earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share increase in guidance are attributed solely to the third quarter actual results exceeding our previous expectations.","Again, we are reaffirming the multi-year synergy guidance. In fiscal 2017, we intend to deliver $158 million to $175 million cumulatively. That means the $60 million from last year plus another $98 million to $115 million this fiscal year. Then by the end of fiscal 2018, we expect to deliver $225 million to $250 million of cumulative synergies. That concludes my prepared remarks.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark Light","Thank you, Michele. I want to conclude by thanking all the Signet team members for their hard work and their dedication in the third quarter and for their preparation and training to deliver a wonderful customer experience for all of our customers this holiday season.","And with that, we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. A solid quarter, congrats in a challenging environment. So we had a question regarding the comp in terms of the dynamic between higher sales in terms of selected branded diamond product versus lower prices and down transactions. Do you expect that dynamic to continue and did that play through how you expected? I also wanted to ask you just about Jared and where you feel like you are in the selling process and the journey and which you have been engaged in terms of just ensuring that you\u2019ve modernized the approach to selling in line with what you\u2019ve been thinking it should be? Thank you.","Michele Santana","So Oliver why don\u2019t I start with your first question in terms of what we saw in Q3 with select diamond fashion jewelry. And you saw the release, we continue to see a higher ATV, lower transactions. Let me talk about that and then I will flip the call over to or the question to Mark and he can add and then talk about the Jared.","Our initiatives as Mark talked about on the call for fourth quarter we are fully loaded with initiatives. And those initiatives are really aimed at driving both transaction value and transaction count. So we feel good and we feel very well prepared as we move into the Q4 in terms of what the comp sales will consist of.","And then Mark, do you want to add anything in terms of\u2026","Mark Light","Jared? Hi, Oliver. Thank you for the kind words. Our teams are well trained and well prepared for the fourth quarter. We have a lot of exciting initiative that we\u2019ve been discussing with you and have introduced to our managers whether it be the Chosen Diamond or the new Pandora shop in shops and a lot of other programs that we have out in Jared including a new wonderful system called Clienteling that I mentioned. So all those initiatives are all built into the guidance for the fourth quarter and we believe Jared is prepared to deliver within our guidance.","Oliver Chen","Okay. And in-house credit has been an incoming topic amongst investors and you have done a good job really laying out the retained optimize versus monetized. So what has been a little bit different in terms of the last few months and when we last checked in with you on this topic, and I think the question on peoples\u2019 minds is a little bit regarding timing, just being respectful of really making a decision that prepares your business model for the long-term.","And, Michele, you did a great job kind of giving us the parameters around 3Q being a smaller quarter, but it seems like this bodes really well for fourth quarter. If you could just help us understand how we should think about expectations for fourth quarter relative to what you just printed, which was a better comp for third quarter, that would be helpful. Thanks a lot.","Mark Light","I will start with a credit question, Oliver. As you can imagine, this is a very important and a very complex decision for us. And we are literally analyzing all the opportunities. And what\u2019s changed is we have several interested bankers involved and we are analyzing the opportunity through all those bankers and the review is going well and these take time. As we said previously from other companies that have gone through a similar review, it can take anywhere 10 months to 12 months to do a good job in analyzing the information. But we are motivated to move as quickly and as prudently as possible in order to move the uncertainty around this issue for all of our constituencies. We firmly believe with either outcome we will create shareholder value and we will provide an update in due course. Michele?","Michele Santana","Yes. Oliver in terms of your question on the Q4 expectation, what I would say is really our Q4 guidance as you saw is no different from our earlier thinking that was implied on our August call. And so we\u2019re really just bolting on our better-than-expected results in Q3 in terms of the full year EPS guide. We are very confident in terms of our team executing in a very important Q4. Mark talked about the initiatives that we have in place and given the investments that we\u2019ve made to drive growth. Therefore, we feel our expectations are very reasonable for Q4.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Krasik from Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Krasik","Yes, hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just sort of following on top of Oliver\u2019s last question, I mean you always have an expectation for an acceleration in comps 3Q to 4Q. I think you do have a shift in advertising from 3Q to 4Q. So is there anything from a competitive perspective or is it the consumer at large? Maybe we could just dip into that a little bit deeper?","Michele Santana","Yes. So I did mention on the call there is a very small shift, I would characterize it, from advertising into Q4. But at the end of the day, I will just repeat what I mentioned to Oliver, our guidance on Q4 really is no different from our earlier thinking that we had on our August call. And we feel very confident and the teams feel very well prepared, focused on the initiatives for the all-important fourth quarter and holiday season and we just believe it\u2019s very, our expectations we have out there are very reasonable given the environment that we are in.","Scott Krasik","And then is there anything just given the election, I guess, and some of the other uncertainty in November, would you characterize this November as maybe a little bit more controversial or confusing for customers? And maybe you could see a bigger snap than you normally see at the holiday season?","Mark Light","Scott, we are glad the election is behind us. That being said, it is an interesting environment out right now, which we believe it is all of our best thinking is built into our guidance that we have in place for the fourth quarter.","Scott Krasik","Okay. And can you just remind us, I know in some of this recent communication with the SEC you talked about it\u2019s not constructive to deliver sort of contractual metrics on your portfolio given the way you lend. So can you just remind us what are the biggest differences and how you would lend if you were reporting under a contractual accounting basis versus recency accounting basis?","Michele Santana","Yes. So let me first start with what we said in the past as part of our credit strategy review. If we are in the optimized scenario optimization not only considers how we would further leverage our receivable portfolio, but it also would include disclosures and changes from the recency over to the contractual. So I just want to kind of start there, that if we are in the optimized scenario we will move from a recency over to the contractual. With that said, the prior comments of what we said is that the financial statement impact really would be immaterial moving to contractual. Your net realizable value is the same under recency or contractual basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Simeon Siegel","Hey guys, good morning.","Mark Light","Good morning.","Simeon Siegel","Mark, I know the market tends to be difficult to track from our seat. So can you just talk to your view on your market share and maybe thoughts on how and when you would expect to get that return to positive comps? And then just looking into next year and beyond, any update to the thoughts around segment margins and long-term margin opportunity? Thanks.","Mark Light","Thanks, Simeon. I just want to remind everybody on the call that the jewelry industry has been a growth in industry for the past 25 years. If you look at the jewelry industry as a whole it has increased about 3% to 4% on a compounded annual growth rate for the past 25 years. Through that 25 years there are some up quarters and some down quarters, but it\u2019s been a very consistent performer. And Signet has outperformed the industry consistently over those past 25 years in the most recent times.","So we believe once the jewelry market comes back to normalcy, which it will, that we will continue to gain market share like we have in the past due to our strength in marketing, our strength in supply chain, our strength in training our people. So that\u2019s our perspective, Simeon. If the jewelry industry has grown and then we believe it will continue to grow. Most importantly, from all of our research consumer still find jewelry as a wonderful way of expressing emotion and love. And we are going to be able to maximize those opportunities what\u2019s out there.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. Michele, any update on the margins, segment margins looking out longer-term?","Michele Santana","Yes. So we are still confident in terms of the long-term margin rates that we had previously issued at our IR Day two years back. So we are confident in achieving that. Obviously, as one can imagine in terms of mid-term goals if you are in a lower sales environment might have some implication in terms of how quick we reach that. But from a long-term perspective, we are a growth Company and we are confident in being able to achieve our goals.","Simeon Siegel","Great, thanks a lot guys. Best of luck for holiday.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Stephen Albert","Hi guys, this is Stephen Albert on for Lorraine. A couple of questions. Number one, could you just walk us through your holiday marketing strategy in greater detail? I know you really make a big push around the holidays. How is it different from last year? Are there more impressions, greater spend? And then also on the transactions piece, I know you talked about transactions decreasing, particularly within the Sterling division and that being due to lower sales on lower-priced collections, which are more transactional. What about actual foot traffic? How much of a headwind are you experiencing from fewer people in your stores?","Mark Light","I will start with the marketing question. Michele, you can take the traffic.","Michele Santana","Yes, sure.","Mark Light","As far as marketing, the big difference this year and it\u2019s an important one is that the more we focus our efforts on understanding these segmented customers that relate to each one of our different banners is what we are trying to make sure that we take those segmented, understanding those customers and we are developing marketing trend to talk and communicate to those customers more specifically and more uniquely. So our impressions are somewhat comparable, but more importantly the communication to the segmented customer for Jared, Zale and for Kay is more refined this year than it was last year and even our media bias is more targeted as it relates to those segmented customers.","Michele Santana","Yes. In terms of traffic, and I will speak to the mall side because Jared is different and we have actually very pleased with our Pandora and the sales associated with our Pandora and our Jared, but from the mall side it really is hard to tie mall traffic measures to our own. We don\u2019t have store traffic counters in the mall. I think we all see the traffic reports that are out there, and we are definitely not immune from traffic and we see that as you had mentioned in terms of our lower-priced items, particularly the beads and charms that tend to be more reliant on the traffic.","With that said, what helps is that with our exclusive brands and with the national marketing and advertise that we have going on we do become more of a destination purchase rather than an impulse purchase. So we will continue to focus on driving both ATV and transactions as we move forward into Q4 and beyond.","Operator","You next question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Ike Boruchow","Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I think maybe for Michele, just wanted to talk about the Q4 plan you guys have. So it seems like whether I look at the high end or the low end of EPS range you are looking for much better margin flow-through relative to the past quarter or two. Is there just a much more meaningful impact from the Zale synergies and Zale EBIT relative to the first nine months in Q4? I\u2019m just trying to understand the dynamic that kind of plays out there for you? Thank you.","Michele Santana","Sure. So yes, I\u2019ll keep in mind with Q3 I mentioned being relatively small quarter it does distort some of the metrics. But when you go to Q4 you got two things going on, right. Just the size, the relative size of the quarter representing about 50% of our annual profit. And then, secondly, as we talk before, given the size of Q4 you do get a share of the synergies flowing through. And as we\u2019ve talked in the past a lot of the synergies, about half the synergies are focused on gross margin initiatives.","Ike Boruchow","Okay, thank you.","Michele Santana","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rick Patel from CLSA. Please go ahead.","Rick Patel","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the better-than-expected results. I was hoping you can talk about bridal. How would you characterize performance in 3Q versus 2Q and I guess where your expectations were coming in? And can you also update us on what you see as the primary headwind in that channel? Do you think it\u2019s people delaying marriage or people just buying less expensive products? And when you have been in this type of soft patch in the past how long has it taken before it recovers?","Mark Light","Thanks, Rick. The bridal category is the consistent performing category and again similar like our overall jewelry business over the past 20 years, 25 years, we see very consistent performance in the bridal categories. There are some quarters that will decline over the timeframe, but as a whole the bridal performance category is very consistent. We believe we are well prepared to have good bridal category increases this fourth quarter. We\u2019ve done some wonderful enhancements in our Vera Wang collections, our Neil Lane collections. We have the Now & Forever collections in our Kay brands. So we believe we are well prepared to maximize the opportunity of the bridal customers are out there for this holiday season. And, again, it\u2019s all built into our guidance that is there for the fourth quarter.","Rick Patel","And Michele, can you give us some color on your tax rate, just some help on what\u2019s going on there in terms of the mix changes and what\u2019s the right go-forward rate to assume beyond this year?","Michele Santana","Yes, definitely. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks the tax rate, we expect that annual effective tax rate to be in a range of 25% to 26%, predominantly driven just by profit mix between U.S. and our UK. And I think as we move forward I\u2019m not going to give long-term guidance on the tax rate. But we had always projected that our tax rate would continue to be a little bit favorable year-over-year.","Rick Patel","Great, thank you and good luck this holiday.","Mark Light","Thank you, Rick.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Stein from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Jeff Stein","Good morning, guys. So a couple of questions. First of all, looking at the sequential performance of Jared and Kay between Q2 and Q3, it looks like Jared got a little bit better and Kay got a little bit worse. And I\u2019m looking at year ago and it looks like Kay had tougher comparisons, Jared slightly better. But as you look at the business internally is one getting worse and one getting better or is it just the year-over-year comparisons that are distorting results a little bit?","Mark Light","Thanks, Jeff. It is worth keeping in mind if you actually look at Kay on a two-year comp hurdle rate they are actually up against almost a 15% comp on two years. So Kay is definitely hurdling much higher rates than any of our other brands no question about it. And Kay also, if you think about our guidance we gave for the third quarter Kay did come in the high end of that guidance. That being said, we are very pleased where Kay is positioned right now. We believe we have a lot of initiatives out there to maximize the opportunity that presents itself out there. And we also feel our Jared stores are also well prepared for the fourth quarter. So, again, Jeff it\u2019s all built into our guidance, but Kay had some very strong hurdle rates to go up against.","Jeff Stein","And how about Jared? Did you see any deterioration in their performance Q2 to Q3?","Mark Light","Well, you see the comps are from Q2 to Q3. We do believe some of our initiatives are taking hold. And we still feel confident that those initiatives will help deliver our guidance for the fourth quarter with Jared.","Jeff Stein","Okay. And one last question. You guys have been focusing a lot of your advertising on Ever Us. Are you taking away any advertising from your bridal collections and could that possibly be hurting sales of bridal over the short-term?","Mark Light","You are correct, Jeff. We are advertising Ever Us well. We are not taking away from our bridal category. We see Ever Us is definitely a gift-giving type of product, which is perfect for the fourth quarter. And so the long-winded answer is no, we are not taking away from bridal to go to Ever Us. We see Ever Us is predominantly being in the gift-giving category.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Tunick from Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.","Brian Tunick","Thanks. Good morning. I guess three quick questions. One, just on the energy markets, is your impression that the worst is behind us? I think you\u2019ve called out you guys have some big volume stores in Texas. So just curious about what you are seeing there. Secondly, Michele, on the real estate front I think Simeon had asked if you think you will return to positive comps next year. But just curious what your initial thoughts on a real estate lease signing or growth for square footage next year? And the third question on Zale synergies, maybe can you give us some thoughts on are there any buckets for potential additional synergies for next year even assuming if Zale is not a positively comping business? Thanks very much.","Michele Santana","Thanks, Brian. So on the energy front, and you could see from our Q2 results compared to Q3 that we did ease up in terms of the comp impact in the energy reliant. In terms of how that plays out going forward, that\u2019s, I guess, anyone\u2019s speculation. But we are going to start getting into territory that we\u2019re comping. And I think it was a good sign of what we saw from Q3 compared to Q2 eased up a little bit. From a real estate perspective, we are not at a point that we are ready to guide what next year\u2019s square footage space is.","But with that said, I would go back to we are a growth company and in terms of how we are going to achieve that growth, it really is through organic growth or to the potential that we see acquisitions that fit well within our core. So that should obviously imply that we expect our square footage to continue to grow into next year at least comparable to what you see in terms of the guide this year, that 3% to 3.5% of square footage space growth.","And then on the Zale synergies, I\u2019m not going to get ahead of ourselves on the Zale synergies. We are very confident in terms of achieving our $225 million to $250 million on synergy range by the end of next year. We will continue, as we go through the synergies there\u2019s a list, a significant list of initiatives that we are continuing to work through. But I think it would be premature to start calling out if there is anything incremental or if there are new buckets to add to it.","Brian Tunick","Great, thanks and good luck.","Michele Santana","Thanks, Brian. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Armstrong from CL King & Associates. Please go ahead.","Bill Armstrong","Good morning, everyone. So your same-store sales for the third quarter were obviously better than your original guidance. What divisions outperformed your expectations and do you see those divisions continuing to show additional strength in the fourth quarter?","Michele Santana","Yes. So I\u2019m not going to go down into in terms of how the divisions performed compared to how we guide all in. You could see we delivered a negative 2% comp, and although as Mark said in his comments we are not overly pleased with the negative 2% comp it was better than what we had originally guided or expected during Q3. Right now we are just focused and prepared on our initiatives for all of our divisions for the Q4 period.","Mark Light","And as I said in my prepared comments, Bill, our Piercing Pagoda division did very well in the third quarter, our outlet business did well across the Board, our UK business did well and our e-commerce business did well. So those are the ones that performed well in the fourth quarter \u2013 or the third quarter, excuse me.","Bill Armstrong","Got it, okay. And then just housekeeping, in terms of modeling EPS you mentioned the 76 million average shares for the fourth quarter. For preferred dividend should we be modeling about 7.8 million per quarter, is that about right?","Michele Santana","That\u2019s absolutely correct. The 5% rate, yes.","Bill Armstrong","Got it, okay. Thank you.","Michele Santana","You\u2019re welcome.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Operator","And our final question in queue at this time comes from Paul Lejuez from Citi. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey guys, it\u2019s Jennifer on for Paul. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what you see going on in the U.S. jewelry industry. Do you think jewelry total sales are down or do you feel like maybe department stores are taking share or are there more mom-and-pops closing that might be pressuring your stores near-term or is there something larger going on with jewelry in general? And then I was just wondering if you exclude the energy space would Zales Jewelers have comped positively? Thanks.","Mark Light","Hi, thanks, Jennifer. Again, I\u2019ve said this earlier, but the jewelry industry has been an industry has consistently grown for the past 25 years, consistently grown. Again, not every quarter is up but on a compound annual growth rate I think it\u2019s anywhere from between 3% and 4% that the industry has grown. As far as new information that we have, there was just a report out for the Jewelers Board of Trade that there was an increase in stores that closed during the third quarter year-on-year. I think it was a 14% increase year-on-year store closures.","So there are stores are closing at a faster rate this year versus the prior year at the same time frame. That being said, we just believe that just gives us an opportunity to continue to gain market share in the long-term.","Michele Santana","Yes. In terms of your other question on the Zale side, would they have, what would the results have looked like excluding the oil and energy region? I\u2019m not going to get down into the numbers or the level of impact. But as we know Zale, two things on the Zale side. Canada where you still see a relatively large impact in the Western Canada region and then they do have a heavy concentration in Texas. So if you were to pull out that impact I think we would\u2019ve been closer to probably flattish.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then quickly, could you talk about synergies you\u2019ve seen year-to-date? I know you said $98 million to $115 million for this year. Just trying to get an idea of maybe how much you\u2019ve seen year-to-date and how much we should expect in the fourth quarter? Thanks.","Michele Santana","Yes. So again in terms of the synergy front, they are progressing well. The integration is going well and we are very confident in terms the guidance that we\u2019ve issued both for achievement of this year as well as our three-year cumulative total. We don\u2019t go through and disclose or quantify the synergies by quarter. We really think you just got to take the full year view. And so when we get to our year-end reporting we will break out more detail in terms of the achievement of synergies and where the synergies are coming from.","Unidentified Analyst","All right, great. Thanks and best of luck.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Light.","Mark Light","Thank you and thank you all for taking part in this call. Our next call is on our holiday sales, which is scheduled for January 11. I wish all of you a very happy and healthy holiday season. Thanks again everyone and goodbye.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today\u2019s call.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.  At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Jackson.  Please go ahead, sir.","Tim Jackson","Thank you, Operator.  Good morning and welcome to the conference call for Signet\u2019s fiscal 2012 results.  I am Tim Jackson, Investor Relations Director.  With me are Mike Barnes, CEO and Ron Ristau, CFO.  The presentation deck we will be talking to is available from webcast section of the Company\u2019s website, www.signetjewelers.com. ","I will now give the Safe Harbor statement.  During today\u2019s presentation, we will in places discuss Signet\u2019s business outlook and make certain forward-looking statements.  Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially.  We urge you to read the risk factors cautionary language and other disclosure in the annual report on Form 10-K that will be filed with the SEC on today, March 22, 2012.  We also draw your attention to this slide.","I will now hand over to Mike.","Michael Barnes","Thanks Tim, and good morning to you all.  I\u2019ll begin with the highlights of our excellent fiscal 2012 results.  Same store sales were up 9%.  The U.S., which represents about 80.9% of our sales, delivered same store sales results of 11.1%, which was outstanding after an increase of 8.9% last year.  In the U.K., we\u2019re pleased with the return to positive same store sales for the year in a very challenging environment.  ","Income before income taxes was $502.1 million, an increase of 67.1%.  After a tax grade of 35.4%, this gave diluted earnings per share of $3.73, up from $2.32 last year, an increase of 60.8%.  I\u2019d like to thank all the team members at Signet for their contribution to these great results.","As most of you know, the Board approved two forms of shareholder distribution during fiscal 2012.  First, a $0.10 per share quarterly dividend was initiated and we\u2019re very pleased to announce today that the Board has now approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.12, representing a 20% increase.  Second, the Board authorized a $300 million share repurchase program effective from January 16, 2012.  By January 28, we had already executed $11.8 million under the program, which continues to remain in effect.","Now looking at the U.S. performance in a little bit more detail \u2013 U.S. total sales were $3.341 billion, up $289.9 million which was an increase of 10.6%.  Kay increased same store sales by 11.8% in fiscal 2012, an acceleration from the 7% growth achieved in fiscal 2011.  Jared had another outstanding year with comps up 12.1% for the year following an increase of 15.7% last year.  Overall, U.S. same store sales increased by 11.1% in fiscal 2012 compared to 8.9% last year.  Operating income was $478 million, and that was up $135.3 million or a 39.5% increase, and the operating margin increased by 330 basis points to 15.8%.  This great performance was driven by all parts of the business working successfully together, but I\u2019d like to highlight some of the major drivers for you.","First merchandising, where performance was driven by initiatives in all categories.  For example, in bridal we rolled out Neil Lane Bridal and the Tolkowsky Diamond, and we began training our store associates using our enhanced bridal program in the second half of the year.  In fashion, Charmed Memories continued to shine and was a non-comp for the first three quarters.  Le Vian also performed very well.  Our core collection showed great performance, in particular in the earring category.  Overall, our differentiated ranges now account for about 26% of U.S. merchandise sales, which is up 400 basis points from last year.  We\u2019ve also been working strategically with our watch partners and we\u2019ve been very pleased by the results achieved.","We were successful in maintaining gross merchandise margin rate in the U.S. despite the significant increases in commodity costs.  This reflects our ability to carefully execute price increases and build a pricing architecture that continues to provide attractive opening price points and hits other key price points along a broad spectrum with appropriate merchandise.","Second, marketing \u2013 our marketing investment last year reached $188.4 million, up 16.7% and continues to be a driving force for the business.  An important feature during the year was an increased focus on marketing support for the bridal category, including campaigns for the Leo Diamond and Neil Lane Bridal.  We also started a multi-year investment in the digital environment with major upgrades to both the Kay and the Jared websites that were implemented for the holiday season.  As a result, we saw a 45.7% increase in U.S. ecommerce sales in fiscal 2012.","A third major driver of our performance was our in-house customer financing.  The ability to offer customer finance is a must in the jewelry category, and to be able to manage it in-house is an important competitive strength.  By carrying out this function in-house, we can tailor our scorecards to the jewelry customer which has different characteristics from when they make other credit transactions.  Our in-house customer finance program was used by our customers for 56.1% of all U.S. sales in fiscal 2012, up 190 basis points.  This, aided by the reduction in net bad debt, was an important contributor to the increase in operating margin in fiscal 2012.","Now turning to the U.K., total sales were $715.1 million, up 21.9 million, an increase of 3.2%.  At constant exchange rates, they were little changed.  Same store sales were up 0.9% following a decline of 1.4% in fiscal 2011 with H. Samuel slightly outperforming Ernest Jones.  The same store sale performance was comfortably ahead of non-food retailers in the U.K. as reported by the British Retail Consortium, a great performance in what remains a challenging retail environment for us.  Operating income was $56.1 million, down $0.9 million which was 4.8% decrease at constant exchange rates.  the operating margin decreased by 40 basis points to 7.8%.","Some of the key drivers were branded jewelry, fashion watches and bridal.  The customer also showed a preference for promotional merchandise in this market.  We increased marketing by 21.7% and we were smarter and much more precise in targeting our core customer.  We continued to invest in ecommerce, for example by launching iPhone apps in the fourth quarter, and ecommerce sales increased by 15.5%.","In fiscal 2012, we\u2019ve started rolling out a new Ernest Jones store design that creates a much more exclusive shopping environment with a greater focus on branded jewelry and watches.  As part of this, we\u2019ve been working with our prestige watch partners to create branded watch boutiques.  We also tested a new design for H. Samuel in Westfield Stratford City.  The store has a more contemporary feel with an improved presentation of bridal, diamonds, and branded fashion jewelry.  We\u2019re testing the use of digital media in-store at this location as well.  We\u2019ll continue to test this new design for further locations in fiscal 2013.","Fiscal 2012 was another year of very impressive results and clearly demonstrates Signet\u2019s successful strategies, which are being extremely well executed.  Our mission going forward is to further enhance our position as the market leader in both the U.S. and the U.K. specialty retail jewelry markets by offering a unique customer experience and driving customer loyalty.  Therefore, our strategic imperatives are to develop and train our team members to consistently enhance the retail experience of our customers, grow and develop new and existing brands and categories to delight customers, drive competitive strengths and infrastructure to enable this growth, optimize the capital structure to manage risk and make investments to drive long-term shareholder value, and increase market share and maximize sustainable profit levels.  ","Our team members are very central to our success, so we seek to recruit and retain the best and to motivate and reward them accordingly.  As a result, we continue to build on many years of training rather than having to keep relaying the foundations.  This makes training much more productive.  Examples of our training focus in fiscal 2013 would include focused support on merchandise initiatives; for example, additional training in how best to serve the bridal customer.  Second, as we roll out customer-assisted selling systems into our stores, it\u2019s very important to train our store team members on how best to use this technology when interacting with the customer; and third, supporting our initiative in the digital environment online.  As important as growing ecommerce sales is the customer experience across an increasingly wide range of touch points.  This requires well trained and knowledgeable people to support the greatly increased interactivity that is now expected by our customers.  We\u2019re able to deliver this by leveraging many of the existing skills, knowledge and systems that are already within the business and by recruiting and training new team members to build on this base as we further enhance our ecommerce platforms and drive our social media initiatives.","Let\u2019s dig just a little deeper into the branded merchandise.  In the bridal category, we continue to develop a variety of brands, including the Leo Diamond, Neil Lane Bridal, and the Tolkowsky Diamond.  The Leo Diamond, which is our longest running exclusive brand and we continue to evolve the range, it\u2019s marketing and the in-store presentation, both in the U.S. and in the U.K.  As of October 2011 and based on successful trials, we had rolled out Neil Lane Bridal to all our U.S. stores.  We continue to test new executions of this collection and we\u2019re still at an early stage of this brand\u2019s ongoing development.  The Tolkowsky Diamond is still in rollout in both the U.S. and in the U.K.  While already seeing success, as with Neil Lane Bridal, we continue to test new executions as well.","In fashion jewelry, we\u2019re developing our portfolio of brands in the same way.  For example, it\u2019s very important to keep these ranges regularly refreshed and relevant to the consumer by introducing new designs.  This is particularly so with a brand like Charmed Memories, which has a much higher frequency of purchase.  In the U.K. where we have a substantial fashion watch business, we\u2019re also having success with branded jewelry from partners such as Guess, DKNY and Gucci.  In the watch category, we continue to work closely with the major brands and are pleased with the boutiques and shop-within-shops that we\u2019ve trialed with a number of the prestige watch brands such as TAG Heuer, Omega and Breitling.  ","I\u2019ll now look at some examples of how we\u2019re driving competitive strengths and infrastructure to enable this growth.  First with regard to strengthening our supply chain, we have built what we believe are sector-leading merchandising systems and supply chain capabilities, and more importantly the team members that use them to provide our customers with the right merchandise at the right time and in the right place.  But our investments continue.  In the fourth quarter, we added additional senior level management to the team.  We\u2019re now in the process of establishing permanent international capabilities in a limited number of very carefully selected locations that are planned to give us even greater expertise in our supply chain, enabling us to execute more efficiently and effectively.  In fiscal 2013, we will incur 5 to $7 million of up-front costs as a strategic investment to establish this capability.","Two further major examples of where we\u2019re investing to build our competitive strengths and infrastructure for future growth are in technology to enhance the customer experience; first, in-store where we began using a screen-based selling system in Jared more than five years ago.  This technology uses a flexible but structured selling system for our sales associates, ensuring best practice is followed as well as the ability to offer our customers merchandise selections outside our typical store assortments.  We began introducing this system to our Kay stores in fiscal 2012 and we will roll it out further this year.  We\u2019re also testing in-store digital technology in the U.K. market.","While all of our stores have access to the respective brand websites through their POS system, the deployment of these screen-based selling systems enables the customer and the store associates to access them much more readily.  This is opening up exciting new opportunities for us even as we speak today.","The second major area is the digital online environment.  In fiscal 2012, we made major upgrades to all of our websites and we\u2019ll be making further significant improvements to them this year.  We\u2019re also increasing our social media and our mobile capabilities.  We\u2019ve been testing online video advertising on premium content sites utilizing our TV adverts and media buying leverage.  We expect a further significant double-digit increase in ecommerce sales in fiscal 2013.","For fiscal 2013, capital investment of about 145 million to $165 million will be directed to projects that are intended to build upon our competitive strengths and drive sales growth.  The level of store investment in fiscal 2013 is planned to be 95 to $105 million, up from $62 million last year.  It is planned to increase the number of store openings in the U.S. to 45 compared to 25 in fiscal 2012 and to carry out a total of 110 major store refurbishments or relocations across both divisions, compared to 85 last year.  Of these, about 90 will be in the U.S. market and 20 in the U.K.  In addition, we intend to invest 40 to $45 million, up from about 28 million last year, in information systems, supporting sales enhancing technology both in-store and in the digital online environment and to enhance information technology operating infrastructure.  About 40 million of this will be in the U.S. with the balance of about 5 million in the U.K.","I\u2019ll now hand it over to Ron to go through the financials in a little more detail.","Ronald Ristau","Thank you, Mike.  As Mike stated, total sales for Signet increased 9.1% to $3.7492 billion compared to $3.4374 billion last year.  Total company comparable store sales increased 9% versus an increase of 6.7% last year.  In the U.S., total sales increased by 10.6% to $3.341 billion, primarily reflecting a comparable store sales increase of 11.1% versus an 8.9% increase last year.  In the U.K., total sales increased by 3.2% to 715.1 million, reflecting a comparable store sales increase of 0.9% compared to a decline of 1.4% last year, and the favorable impact of currency fluctuations which more than balanced the 1% adverse impact of reduced space.  In total, ecommerce sales were 92.3 million, up 24.7 million or 36.5% in the year.","Now looking at the reconciliation of income, income before taxes increased by 201.7 million to 502.1 million, up 67.1%.  I\u2019ll now explain the major factors driving this increase.  Gross margin was 1.4376 billion, an improvement of 194.7 million.  The gross margin rate was 38.3%, up 210 basis points.  Key drivers of this improvement were as follows.  The main driver was leverage on store occupancy expenses, both in the U.S. and the U.K.  We experienced improvement in the U.S. net bad debt to total sales ratio, which came in at 3.4% of U.S., down from 4.2% last year.  There was also improvement in inventory-related costs.  These items offset a slight decline in gross merchandise margin which was down 10 basis points, with the U.S. being up 10 basis points and the U.K. down 60 basis points.  Gross merchandise margin was little changed despite record increases in commodity costs.","Selling, general and administrative expense was 1.567 billion for fiscal 2012, up 76.3 million or 7.8% from last year.  As a percentage of sales they were 28.2%, which is 30 basis points favorable.  I will go into this in more detail on a following slide.  ","Our other operating income was 126.5 million, up 16.5 million on last year, reflecting the higher level of accounts receivable.  This was a 30 basis point favorable impact on our operating margin.  Fiscal 2012 operating income was 507.4 million, an improvement of 134.9 million or 36.2%.  Our operating margin was 13.5%, up from 10.8% in the previous year or 270 basis points.","In fiscal 2012, our net interest expense was 5.3 million, a decrease of 66.8% of sales that was a fall of 200 basis points.  47.5 million reflected the absence of the non-recurring make-whole payment from 2011, and the balance reflected the resulting elimination of interest payments on private placement notes.  Income before income taxes of 502.1 million, an increase of 201.7 million as a percentage of sales that was 13.4%, an improvement of 470 basis points.  Our tax rate in fiscal 2012 was 35.4% resulting in net income of 324.4 million and diluted earnings per share of $3.73, up 60.8%.  Please note that in fiscal 2011, our results did include a non-recurring make-whole payment due to the prepayment in full of our private placement notes of 47.5 pretax and 29.5 million post-tax, or $0.34 per share.  This all occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.  Our growth in diluted earnings per share, excluding this item, was 40.2%.","Now looking at SG&A in more detail, as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2012 it improved to 28.2% as compared to 28.5% in the prior year as we effectively leveraged our SG&A.  The major reasons contributing to the increase in the level of the expense of 76.3 million were as follows:  we increased our net advertising investment by 30.1 million, we experienced 26.9 million of an increase as a result of store staff costs which flexed with the increased in sales, 6.5 million was attributable to higher 401K contributions, and 6.2 million attributable to currency fluctuations.  The balance primarily reflected increased investment in IT and credit infrastructure.  We believe our SG&A remains well controlled and effectively managed.  ","Now looking at the customer finance statistics, our credit participation rate showed an increase to 56.1% of U.S. sales in fiscal 2012, up from 54.2% last year.  Our average outstanding balance at year-end was $1,068, up about 3.8% with the number of active accounts increasing 11.9% to just over 1.1 million.  Our monthly collection rate accelerated by 10 basis points to 12.7%, therefore the average credit account maturity remains less than one year.  As a percentage of U.S. sales, the net bad debt ratio improved by 80 basis points to 3.4% from 4.2 in fiscal 2011, and this improvement was driven by our consistent credit practices, the quality of our collection practice, as well as a more stable rate of unemployment in the United States.  The closing level of receivables was just under 1.16 billion.  Our credit portfolio is performing very strongly.","In fiscal 2012, net cash provided by operating activities was 325.2 million compared to 323.1 million last year.  This was after an increase of 152.5 million in our receivable balance compared to a 78.7 million increase in fiscal 2011.  The receivable increase reflected both the strong sales performance in the U.S. and the increased credit participation that I mentioned.  ","Our year-end inventory increased by 115.2 million.  This was driven primarily by commodity price increases and some opportunistic commodity purchases that we made at year-end.  Our underlying inventory turn improved significantly in fiscal 2012, reflecting our focus on efficiency.","Our capital spending totaled 97.8 million, up from 55.6 million in fiscal 2011 as we increased both our store and IT investment.  We ended the year with cash at $486.8 million.","Now I\u2019d like to provide you with an update on current trading.  In the month of February, which covers the important Valentine\u2019s Day trading period, our overall same store sales were up 7.6% in the U.S. with the U.K. down 3.1%.  Overall, Signet\u2019s same store sales were up 6.2%.  Let me point out that for Kay, the balance was 8.4%, Jared was 8.1%, our regional brands were 1.2%.  At H. Samuel, we were negative 2.3, Ernest Jones negative 4.1, and total U.K. down 3.1, with the total consolidated comp at 6.2.","I\u2019d now like to cover two calendar shifts in fiscal 2013 which are important in financial planning.  First, Mother\u2019s Day, which this year is on May 13 and last year was on May 8.  As a result, a key marketing event which normally falls for the Company in the first quarter in April will switch to May this year and will be reflected in our second quarter results.  We estimate that this will reduce same store sales in the first quarter by $25 million or about 400 basis points in the U.S. and 300 basis points overall for Signet.  The shift is EPS between Q1 and Q2 is estimated to be between $0.03 and $0.04.  We are providing first quarter guidance due to the complexity of these changes.  Due to the impact of the calendar shift, we expect first quarter same store sales in the low single digit range and earnings per share ranging from $0.88 to $0.93.","Second, this year is a 53-week year.  This last occurred in fiscal 2007.  As a result, an extra week of sales estimated at 48 million to 52 million will be added to the year.  Although we are still finalizing our plans, we currently believe this additional week will result in an operating loss of 2 to $4 million, reflecting the timing of advertising expense and a shift into fiscal 2014 of a key promotional event relating to Valentine\u2019s Day next year.","Now I\u2019ll speak briefly about the financial objectives for the year.  In setting the financial objectives for the year, consideration was given to the current operating environment with developments in the U.S. and U.K. economies continuing to be divergent.  The U.S. economy is showing signs of strengthening, and in fiscal 2012 there was growth in the jewelry market.  We plan to continue our leadership performance in the U.K. market, although we are operating in an economic environment that is not projected to show any short-term improvement, and I will point out that both economies could be adversely affected by developments in the euro zone.  ","Signet\u2019s goal in fiscal 2013 is to deliver record results, building on our recent performance while making strategic investments necessary for future growth.  Therefore in fiscal \u201913, management\u2019s financial objectives for the business are as follows.  First, we intend to increase sales and gain profitable market share.  We actually anticipate that the gross margin ratio, while expected to be broadly similar to fiscal 2012, will benefit from improved store productivity and increases in prices which are expected to primarily offset the impact of changes in the cost of commodities, in particular the cost of diamonds and gold.  Note we will be investing in fiscal 2013 to drive the future supply chain capabilities Mike spoke of, and in this initiative we expect to incur start-up costs estimated to be between 5 and $7 million.  We do expect to leverage our store occupancy expenses and maintain strong performance in our credit portfolio.  ","In selling, general and administrative expenses, we plan to increase advertising to drive sales and continue to build customer equity in our store concepts and merchandise brands while maintaining the selling, general and administrative expenses to sales ratio at a minimum.  We will invest 145 to $165 million of capital in new stores, enhancing our infrastructure to drive future growth.  Of this, 95 to 105 million will be spent opening 45 new stores and remodeling 110 stores, and 40 to 45 million in IT supporting sales and enhancing technology.  We recommend using 36% as a tax rate for planning in fiscal 2013.","Thank you.  I\u2019ll now hand it back to Mike.","Michael Barnes","Thanks, Ron.  We would now be pleased to take any questions that you have at this time.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you.  If you would like to ask a question at this time, please press the star key followed by the digit one on your telephone.

Again, please press star, one to ask a question.","We will now take our first question from Ike Boruchow from JP Morgan.  Please go ahead, sir.","Ike Boruchow \u2013 JP Morgan","Hi guys, good morning.  I guess just a couple questions.  First question on the current trading statement you gave us.  Since you gave us the EPS range, Ron, can you help us\u2014how should we think about gross margins and SG&A balancing out for Q1?  And then also, could you guys help us understand just how important Valentine\u2019s Day is, what percent of sales for the quarter Valentine\u2019s Day represents, especially in the U.S.?","Ronald Ristau","Well, I would say that we\u2019ve given the guidance ranges.  You know, we\u2019re not getting into extensive detail.  We believe that, like we said, our gross margin ratio will be broadly similar to that of last year and that our SG&A will be similar.  It fluctuates somewhat by quarter but those broad statements, I would think, still hold in the first quarter as well.","Michael Barnes","And as far as the importance of Valentine\u2019s Day, obviously it\u2019s one of the most important holidays that we have during the year, and it\u2019s a very strong selling season for us so it\u2019s a very important part of the quarter.  I don\u2019t think we break out the exact percentage of what it usually means to us.  It probably is important to note, though, that it\u2019s much more important in the U.S. than it is in the U.K. as a holiday.","Ike Boruchow \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay.  And then I guess Mike, broadly speaking on the industry and commodity costs, can you help us think about the timing of when peak costs kind of flow through the P&L?  Is that kind of happening right now in the first half, and kind of you guys\u2019 strategies on how to help offset that with price increases and increasing the mix of higher margin products.","Michael Barnes","Well, I\u2019ll let Ron talk about the flow of the costs and how that affects our average costing system.  In terms of how we control it, we\u2019re doing the same things that we\u2019ve talked about in the past, and that is our plan is to broadly maintain our gross merchandise margins going forward.  We feel that we can do that.  As appropriate, we will increase prices to make that happen as well as we do see these costs flow through our system and increase in average costing.  One of the great things is we\u2019ve got an unbelievable product line-up.  We\u2019ve got great brands, great products, great designs, and because of that our customers are willing to accept the price increases as they have been over the years.  It\u2019s really been a competitive strength to us that we have such a strong line-up, we\u2019re able to do that.","Ron, do you want to talk a little bit about how the costs flow through?","Ronald Ristau","Yeah.  As you know, our costs flow through on average so that there is some time delay between commodity price increases and them being reflected in our margins.  We will incur additional\u2014we\u2019re working on price increases in the first quarter.  They will not have much impact in the first quarter, so I don\u2019t really know what else to say about it other than for the year, we will price to more or less maintain our gross merchandise margins.  There will be some fluctuations by quarter.  Primarily, benefits usually come in the second and third quarter, and then by the fourth quarter they tend to be diminished somewhat as the costs begin to flow through, and you see this every year so that our margins tend to accelerate a little bit in the second and third and be a little bit lower in the fourth and first on gross merchandise margin.","Ike Boruchow \u2013 JP Morgan","Great.  Thanks guys.","Operator","We will now go to our next question from Bob Drbul of Barclays Bank.  Please go ahead.","Bob Drbul \u2013 Barclays","Hi guys.  Good morning, good day.  Two questions that I have for you \u2013 first one is on ASPs.  Can you talk a little about the ASP trends from Q4 and Q1 and sort of your expectations around it and heading into \u201912?  And the other concern or question that I would have for you is are you seeing price resistance to any of the price increases, and do you sort of have a plan for any further price increases around the diamonds and the gold as the higher costs do work into the P&L?","Michael Barnes","Well on the first question for ASPs, I guess in Kay we saw slightly declining ASPs.  A lot of that is because we were mostly non-comp with our bead program, Charmed Memories, last year; and so obviously as beads are counted one at a time and carry a lower average price point, you\u2019re going to see the ASPs slightly decline.  In Jared, the ASP went slightly the other direction as we have totally finished comping the bead program in that concept store \u2013 Jared \u2013 and so we\u2019re seeing just more of a normalized increase in ASP over time, and especially as prices are increased to offset the commodity prices out there. ","I\u2019m sorry, what was the second question you had?","Ronald Ristau","Customer resistance.","Michael Barnes","Oh, customer resistance.  As I said earlier, we have been able to price to broadly maintain our gross merchandise margins historically.  We continue to anticipate that we\u2019ll be able to do that; and again, the great line-up of products and brands that we have allow us to do that because it still presents a great value for our customers.","Bob Drbul \u2013 Barclays","Great.  Thank you very much.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Jennifer Davis of Lazard Capital Markets.  ","Jennifer Davis \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets","Hey guys.  Congratulations on a great 2011 and on your continued solid execution.  I remember at the beginning of 2011 there were doubts about your ability to increase sales and gross margins on top of strong 2010 results and increasing commodity costs, so definitely a job well done.","So I have a couple of questions.  First, Mike, did you say how much bridal increased, and could you talk about margins on bridal versus the rest of the assortment?  And then I was hoping you could elaborate a little more on the 5 to $7 million investment to drive future supply chain capabilities.  I think you said you were establishing some permanent international capabilities.  Just wondering if you could elaborate on that.  Thanks.","Michael Barnes","Sure.  On the\u2014I\u2019ll let Ron answer the question on the margins for bridal.  Bridal, I don\u2019t think we mentioned it in the call, but it continues to be about 50% of our jewelry merchandise sales and continues to be a very strong part of our business.  As we did mention, we have focused very heavily on that and focused heavily on training our store staff to really drive that part of the business going forward.  So we think there\u2019s a great opportunity for us in that area.  Margins on bridal\u2014","Ronald Ristau","Yeah, bridal margins are similar to perhaps, depending upon the mix, just a touch lower than the Company average.  Don\u2019t forget, there are a lot of\u2014there are loose solitaire stones in our bridal mix, and that is a lower margin business for us.  So the total bridal mix is broadly similar, perhaps a little bit less.","Michael Barnes","And as far as the supply chain initiatives, Jennifer, we\u2019re moving in a very exciting direction.  As the leader in the specialty jewelry industry in both the United States and in the U.K., supply chain is very important to us.  So we continue to look at new initiatives that will help us secure our supply chain for the future growth of our company and allow us to supply the right products, the right prices, the right qualities of both diamond-related and other products to our customers.  So we\u2019re very focused on that.  We really haven\u2019t outlined exactly what those initiatives are.  They are international in nature.  They\u2019re not really material, as we stated, in terms of investment.  We expect up-front investments of 5 to $7 million to really get started there, but there are some exciting initiatives that we have planned that we think are going to really give us competitive strengths for the long-term future of our company.","Jennifer Davis \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets","Okay, thanks.  And then one quick clarification, if I may \u2013 on the Q&A, you guys both said that you were planning on maintaining, or broadly maintaining gross merchandise margins.  ","Ronald Ristau","No, I said gross margin.","Jennifer Davis \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets","Okay.  All right.","Ronald Ristau","Yeah, we said gross margin.  I\u2019m sorry.  We were trying to get away from one little piece of the margin; so broadly speaking, gross margin.","Jennifer Davis \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets","All right, thanks.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Bill Armstrong of CL King & Associates.  ","Bill Armstrong \u2013 CL King & Associates","Good morning Mike and Ron.  What are you seeing in terms of new retail center development in the U.S.?","Michael Barnes","We\u2019re not seeing a lot of new retail development still.  What we did is we appropriately challenged our team to go out and open more stores this year than they did last year, and really hunt for those spots that they hadn\u2019t found yet and try to make it happen.  Most of those, or a great majority of those, are going to be off-mall locations.  We are finding the occasional mall location, but certainly we\u2019re much more penetrated with Kay in the malls.  So if you look at the new store openings that we\u2019ve outlined for this year, there is 45 new stores and we\u2019re thinking about approximately 11 of those will be Jared, so that will be off-mall location; and the other 34 would be Kay, but a significant number of those would also be off-mall as we found a lot of success opening Kay off-mall as well as Jared.  In some areas because of the demographics, Kay is actually a better fit; so we\u2019re taking it as they come.  We wish there was more development out there.  We look forward to the day, hopefully, when there will be because we would love to open more new locations with the success that we\u2019re having with our stores right now.  That would be our best hopes and wishes, but we\u2019re taking it as we can and we\u2019re being as aggressive as we can with the environment that\u2019s delivered to us.","Bill Armstrong \u2013 CL King & Associates ","Okay, great.  That\u2019s helpful.  Second question on your guidance, typically in the past your guidance has included same store sales and free cash flow, and I see that\u2019s not included in your guidance currently.  Would you care to share that with us, and if not, why the change?","Ronald Ristau","First of all, we\u2019ve never included same store sales in our outlook, so I would just have to correct that statement.  From a free cash flow perspective, we\u2019ve made the decision not to focus on free cash flow.  We think that, number one, it\u2019s not a standard measurement for most U.S. companies, and we also believe that that was a focus during the recessionary time frames and that at this point in time it\u2019s not as important.  We didn\u2019t give a number, but I\u2019ll tell you we expect the number to be position to $200 million, so it will be over $200 million.  This year, our free cash flow came in at around $228 million, so rather than give these broad ranges we were giving, we just would like to\u2014it\u2019s kind of an incidental measurement, not a primary driver, so that\u2019s why we did not provide it.  But the range will be over $200 million.","Bill Armstrong \u2013 CL King & Associates","Got it.  Okay, thanks.","Operator","We will now take our next question from David Wu of the Telsey Advisory Group.","David Wu \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group","Hi, good morning everyone.  First question \u2013 with respect to your new merchandising initiatives that you have planned for this year, are you planning at all to develop any new exclusive brands, or is the focus really on introducing new styles within your existing differentiated ranges?","Michael Barnes","That\u2019s a great question.  We definitely are focused on creating new designs and styles with our existing, very successful ranges.  That\u2019s always important to us, and we\u2019ve got some great new products coming out in those ranges.  In addition to that, though, we\u2019ve got some exciting tests going on.  I\u2019m not going to characterize them exactly for competitive reasons, but we\u2019ve got potential line extensions and we\u2019ve got some new brand tests going on as well, so there\u2019s a lot of exciting things happening.  In fact, we\u2019re testing a lot of things in the spring that could very well be rolled out or begin starting a roll-out in the back half of the year.","David Wu- Telsey Advisory Group","Excellent.  On the price increases this year, could you quantify the magnitude at least directionally if they will be higher or lower versus last year?","Ronald Ristau","We don\u2019t like to get into specifics on a level of price increase for competitive reasons.  Suffice to say that we said that the price increases will be sufficient to cover the inflation in commodity costs that we are forced to deal with, but we\u2019d like not to be more specific than that, David.","David Wu \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group","Okay, that\u2019s fine.  And then also, can you give us a little bit more color on credit sales over the quarter?  How have approval rates been trending, and are you still seeing improvement in the average customer credit score in the fourth quarter?  ","Ron Ristau","Well, I would say that you can see the penetration went up to over 56% versus 54% for the year.  The fourth quarter was strong.  We are seeing that our approval rates remain, I would still say, relatively consistent.  The approval rates in and of themselves have not been changing dramatically.  We have seen that people who have been granted credit are behaving very responsibly and continuing to make more than the minimum payment, and all of this is reflected in the overall performance of the portfolio and the improvement in bad debts that we\u2019ve seen.  So the credit portfolio is performing very well.  There has been no real change in the level of approvals or disapprovals, or no change in our scoring mechanisms, and it just seems to all be working well.  It\u2019s very supportive, of course, of the bridal business and important as we deliver some of the higher priced merchandise, such as the Neil Lane and Tolkowsky lines, which are slightly higher prices; and our consumers are using some additional credit to help finance those purchases.  So everything is working very, very well and supporting the business to our satisfaction.","David Wu \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group","Perfect.  Thank you very much.","Operator","We will now go to our next question from Rick Patel of Bank of America.","Rick Patel \u2013 Bank of America","Can you help us understand the February comp decline in the U.K.?  I\u2019m just wondering if the consumer sentiment there is getting worse, or if there was a change in perhaps your promotional cadence.  What exactly is driving that change in trend there?","Michael Barnes","Hi Rick.  That\u2019s a great question too.   You know, if you look at the February comps in the U.K. and you look at them compared to last year, what you saw was lower single digit declines both last year and this year, so there\u2019s a little bit of a trend there.  A couple things that I would say about that \u2013 one is to reiterate that while it is important, Valentine\u2019s Day is not as important in the U.K. as it is to U.S., and it doesn\u2019t carry the same weighting on that.  The other thing that I would say is I wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect to see that exact same trend in either the first quarter or the full year for the U.K.  It seems to be a little bit of a trend for February, but that\u2019s a very short time frame.","Ronald Ristau","And Rick, just to add to that, remember the comp last year in the U.K. was also a negative 2.6%.  February just isn\u2019t a very strong month over there.","Rick Patel \u2013 Bank of America","Okay, got it.  And can you also maybe give us an estimate of how many store closures we should expect this year; and taking into account your 45 new stores, what should we expect the net change in square footage to be like?","Ronald Ristau","The square footage will be positive and I believe the closure number is approximately 25 stores.  You know what, Rick?  I just don\u2019t have the number at my fingertips.  I\u2019d be happy to give you a call after the meeting, okay?","Rick Patel \u2013 Bank of America","Appreciate it.  Thanks, and good luck on the new year.","Operator","We will now go to our next question from Jeff Stein of Northcoast Research.","Jeff Stein \u2013 Northcoast Research","Okay, good morning guys.  A couple of questions here.  First of all, Ron, can you discuss the other operating income line, which was up slightly in Q4 but it looks like the rate of growth year-over-year dropped relative to the first nine months.  Anything there we should be focused on?","Ronald Ristau","No, I wouldn\u2019t think you should be focused on anything in particular.  We did make some small internal changes in some processing of cycles in February, which had a slight impact on that number; but I wouldn\u2019t think you should read anything dramatic into it.  The receivable portfolio was up, and operating income when we look forward into next year will continue to grow as the receivable portfolio goes.","Jeff Stein \u2013 Northcoast Research","Got it, got it.  And the 5 to $7 million of supply chain investment, is that going to be run through gross profit or SG&A?","Ronald Ristau","It will run through gross profit because it\u2019s the nature of manufacturing, so we\u2019ll be including it in our gross profit line.  It\u2019s included in our guidance, Jeff, when we talk about being able to\u2014you know, we\u2019ll be able to accept that charge and still we believe be relatively similar in our gross margin ratios, so we\u2019ve included that in our thinking.  It\u2019s not incremental to, so I don\u2019t want you to think that it is, okay?","Michael Barnes","Yeah, it\u2019s all built into the bulk.","Ronald Ristau","It\u2019s all built into the guidance we\u2019ve talked about.","Jeff Stein \u2013 Northcoast Research","","Understand, okay.  And your SG&A leverage point, any change there this year relative to last year?","Ronald Ristau","My favorite question always, as you know.  The leverage point really depends on what we decide to spend in advertising and how it moves around.  The leverage point on occupancy expense, which was a very successful point for us last year, remains very low single digit comp to start to leverage occupancy costs.  Both of these things move around as we open up new stores and as we decide to change our advertising investment, so it\u2019s hard to pick just one particular number.  Generally if it comped at mid-single, we more than adequately leveraged many things.","Jeff Stein \u2013 Northcoast Research","Okay, very good.  Thank you.","Operator","We will now go to our next question from Anthony Lebiedzinski of Sidoti & Company.  Please go ahead.","Anthony Lebiedzinski \u2013 Sidoti & Co.","Good morning.  Just a follow-up on the advertising question.  Can you give us maybe some color on how much you expect to increase your advertising expenses by, and also give us a better understanding as to the breakdown between TV and radio and other media, whether that\u2019s going to change significantly from the past?","Ronald Ristau","Well, what I would say is that we don\u2019t like to go into too much detail of exactly what level of advertising increase we would realize.  It depends upon the performance of the business, it depends upon advertising rates that we are experiencing, it depends upon competition this year from the presidential election and all of the money that will be spent.  So I don\u2019t really want to give you a specific number, nor would I tell you specifically how the mix is going to shift.  I would tell you that TV advertising remains primarily our number one approach, but social media and direct-to-consumer marketing are also important in our mix, as is radio to a certain extent.  So I would still say to you that TV will be predominant, but the other mix factors are moving as the market develops.","Mike, I don\u2019t know if you had anything to add?","Michael Barnes","No, I was just going to say it\u2019s something that we track very carefully.  We take a very scientific approach to it.  Yes, we are increasing our advertising this year, but as Ron said, we like to think of it as a cumulative number.  In all of those different categories Ron called out are still very important to us, whether it be online, radio, or TV, which is still the major part of the advertising.  The reason that we\u2019re continuing to increase it is because it drives sales, it works for us.  ","Ronald Ristau","And again, I\u2019d point out that while we\u2019re increasing it, we\u2019re also committing that at a minimum we\u2019ll be able to maintain across the year our SG&A ratio.  So we\u2019re watching it \u2013 while we increase one, we\u2019re making sure that the business performance justifies and that we\u2019re getting the return on investment necessary to continue with spending.  So we watch it and balance it very effectively.","Anthony Lebiedzinski \u2013 Sidoti & Co.","Mm-hmm, okay.  And as far as current trading, the February comp in the U.S., how much is that driven by ASPs?","Ronald Ristau","Well, it\u2019s driven by both ASPs and by volume.  Remember what\u2019s going on, as Mike alluded to, is the fact that we have the bead programs, which are high volume driven but low price, and then we have the diamond programs.  I would say that they\u2019re both driving.  I would say that pricing continues to be slightly more important than volume on a net basis.","Anthony Lebiedzinski \u2013 Sidoti & Co.","Mm-hmm.  And as far as the store remodels, do you have a breakdown between the Kay and Jared stores?","Ronald Ristau","I did not provide that level of detail on an overall basis.  It will be close to 110 stores across the enterprise.","Michael Barnes","And that\u2019s about 90 in the U.S., but we didn\u2019t bring the breakdown between Kay and Jared on that.","Anthony Lebiedzinski \u2013 Sidoti & Co.","Okay, that\u2019s fine.  Thank you.","Operator","As a reminder at this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star, one on your telephone keypad.  We will now take our next question from Rod Whitehead of Deutsche Bank.  Please go ahead.","Rod Whitehead \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi there.  Three, if I may.  One very quick one \u2013 I missed the figure you gave for ecomm growth in the U.S.","Ronald Ristau","Well, I didn\u2019t.  I gave an overall basis.  I said it was 36.5%.  It\u2019s around 45% in the U.S., I\u2019m sorry.  On an overall basis, the growth rate was 36% and the total ecommerce sales were 92.3 million.","Rod Whitehead \u2013 Deutsche Bank","For the group?","Ronald Ristau","Yes, sir.","","Ronald Whitehead \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Brilliant, thank you.  And secondly on\u2014you mentioned at one point, Mike, that you were working strategically with the watch brands.  I wonder what that meant, and in particular one of the things you trialed last was the Michele watch brand, and how that has performed and whether that would be rolled out.  And then finally, just on your buyback program, you said at the investor day that you ideally wanted a balance of 7 to 9% of sales, which is roughly $300 million; and you\u2019re currently at 500 and your free cash flow is going to be at least 200 for the next couple of years.  So if you only buy back 300 in the next two years, then your cash balance is actually going to go up from 500 to 600.  So I was just wondering whether there is an intention for a further buyback program within the next two years?","Michael Barnes","Okay, well we\u2019ll start with the watch question first.  Now, we\u2019re very excited with some of the partnerships that we have with a lot of the major brands out there.  I just got back from the Basel Fair with both the U.K. and the U.S. teams a couple of weeks ago, and we had some great meetings.  We\u2019re continuing to get closer with our partners.  We\u2019ve got some exciting things going on, including building major boutiques for people like Omega and Breitling in the U.K., and TAG here in the U.S.  So we think these are very important partnerships.  We think that they\u2019re going to be great business drivers for us in the future, and we continue to work with them in a very positive way.","We are testing and trialing some other brands \u2013 Michele, as you mentioned.  We started with that in about 26 Jared doors.  We\u2019re actually going to increase the trial a little bit.  We\u2019ve seen some good pockets of success there, and it\u2019s also done very well for us online so we know that we have the customer out there, but it is a new brand for us.  So all in all, the brands are doing extremely well for us in the watch category, and it\u2019s something that we would expect to see continue for the future.  We look forward to continuing to build those partnerships.  ","As far as the stock buyback, as we mentioned, it continues to be in force; and we had just gotten started January 16, so it\u2019s still very new.  We intend to continue on with it as appropriate, and we will address--the Board will address our balance sheet and our cash balances on a regular basis, and as it is appropriate we\u2019ll look at doing other things.  You know, we increased our dividend by 20% from $0.10 a quarter to $0.12 a quarter, so that\u2019s another move.  That\u2019s what we intend to do \u2013 we intend to take very thoughtful measures from quarter to quarter and year to year to make sure that we\u2019re delivering the best value we can for our shareholders.  So it\u2019s not like a one and done necessarily on the stock buyback or the dividend or whatever it may be.  We\u2019re always going to take it very seriously and analyze our situation and make those appropriate decisions.","Ronald Whitehead \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you very much, Mike.","Operator","We will now go to our next question from David Jeary of Investec.","David Jeary \u2013 Investec","Yes, good afternoon gentlemen.  A couple from me if I may, please.  Coming back to the supply chain investments, Mike, I still don\u2019t fully understand what you\u2019re looking at.  I know you used the words exciting initiatives, so I\u2019m just wondering if you could help us to become a bit more excited by giving a bit more insight as to what exactly they were.  And secondly, re your comments on marketing, I know you take a very holistic view of SG&A and returns.  I was just really going to ask a question on that point specifically on U.K. marketing.  I mean, the spend was up 22%, so sales and profits obviously not up by anywhere near those same metrics.  I just wonder how you look at that in the context of what is obviously a difficult market and how you justify making that kind of investment relative to the returns, please.","Michael Barnes","Sure.  Good morning or afternoon, David.  As far as the supply chain initiatives, the reason I haven\u2019t kind of lined that out a little bit more clearly, I want everyone to understand that we are appropriately investing in the future of our company and that includes making sure that we secure our supply chain better, we build better partnerships.  There\u2019s a lot of different things that we can have in the works, but until it\u2019s the appropriate time I really can\u2019t get into a lot of detail on that because\u2014and quite frankly, I don\u2019t want to tip our hand to the competition on everything that we\u2019re working on.  So we want you to know that we\u2019re working diligently to do the right things and to secure the future of our business needs, and we will give you some more details on that as soon as we can.  ","In terms of marketing in the U.K., one of the things we said we were going to do\u2014we\u2019re very pleased with our business in the U.K. and especially when you look at the retail environment and the overall economic environment in the market, which I\u2019m sure you know extremely well.  We\u2019ve done very well in that market compared to a lot of the other non-food retail companies out there.  In fact, we have consistently beat the non-food retail on a regular basis, and we are going to continue to invest in our business.  We believe that when it comes to taking market share and taking a leadership position and being the leader in the market, we need to appropriately invest.  We\u2019re going to remodeling stores in the U.K.  Out of that 110 major remodels or relocations we talked about, about 20 of those are in the U.K., and that\u2019s a big part of that when you look at the split between the U.S. and the U.K.","So the important thing to us is, yes, we did increase our marketing and we feel like that will help us drive long-term value and sales in the U.K.  That\u2019s why we\u2019re doing it.  This is not the time to shy away from investment.  We believe in the marketplace.  We think that we have a bright future there, and it\u2019s tough times right now but hopefully it won\u2019t always be that way, and we are preparing ourselves for the future and making sure that we make the correct investments to get us there.","David Jeary \u2013 Investec","Okay, thank you very much, Mike.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Andrew Hughes of UBS.  ","Andrew Hughes \u2013 UBS","Yes, hi guys.  It\u2019s Andrew Hughes from UBS.  This is obviously the U.K. section of the call.  I had a question about the U.S. business and the EBIT margin up at 15.8%.  Looks to me like it\u2019s an all-time high, certainly a 10-year high.  Can you just give us some sort of thoughts about how you look at it now?  I mean, clearly there may be some that get concerned about over-earning with an EBIT margin that high.  The flip side of the coin is that the structure of the industry is completely different from the past.  So do you think that you can continue to push on with that EBIT margin?","Ronald Ristau","I would say that, number one, of course we\u2019re very pleased with that EBIT margin, and I believe you are correct \u2013 it is a record.  It also\u2014the business is performing very strongly in the U.S. and it continues to set new records.  So just because we\u2019ve established a record doesn\u2019t mean we intend to stop there, nor do we think it\u2019s a limitation.  As we focus on improving the productivity of the store chain, which even though we\u2019re opening up 45 new stores, the main driver is improving the productivity of sales within the Kay and Jared and regional brands that are already established.  That is a very profitable way to grow sales because obviously we don\u2019t have to make the capital investments or have the maturation of store issue that we deal with, so that we believe that the stores will continue to gain market share, continue to improve in productivity, and as they do that, they will continue to move higher in terms of the operating margins of the U.S. business.  ","So I think it is wonderful that it\u2019s a record.  We do not think it is a limitation.  We believe that we can continue to push forward, and that\u2019s what we are planning for in 2013.","Andrew Hughes \u2013 UBS","Okay, but the guidance you\u2019ve given broadly is flat gross margin, flat cost ratios for this year, so the implication is that you might sort of pause for breath this year before continuing onwards and upwards in outer years.  Is that a sort of fair assessment?","Ronald Ristau","Well, I think we always try to be reasonable with any statements we make relative to future guidance, because it\u2019s always difficult to predict.  But this year we probably wouldn\u2019t have predicted getting to 15.8% if we had made a prediction, so I think that we always strive to get better while maintaining a conservative outlook so that we can not disappoint our investors.","Andrew Hughes \u2013 UBS","All right, good.  Thank you very much.","Operator","As there are no further questions in the queue, that will conclude today\u2019s question and answer session.  I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Tim Jackson for any additional or closing remarks.","Michael Barnes","Thank you, Operator, and thanks to everyone for taking part in this call.  We really appreciate it. Our next scheduled call is on May 24 when we\u2019ll review our first quarter results.

For a discussion of the non-GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, investors should review the press release we posted on our website.","I will now turn the call over to Gina.","Gina Drosos","Thank you Randi. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining today's call. To begin, I would like to thank all of our team members for their passion in helping each and every one of our customers celebrate life and express love and for leading bravely as we accelerate Signet's transformation plan. In my remarks today, I will first discuss the progress of our transformation and our priorities for fiscal 2020. Then I will wrap up my comments with our financial guidance, cash flow and capital allocation.","In fiscal 2019, we launched a three-year comprehensive transformation plan, Signet's Path to Brilliance to reposition the company to be the omnichannel jewelry category leader. The goal of our transformation plan is to drive sustained growth by delivering inspiring products and ideal online and in-store shopping experiences to our customers, funding for the improvements we need in systems capabilities, product and stores comes from driving out costs that customers don't see to invest in what they care about. This transformation will be a multi-year journey that we believe will position the company to drive long-term sustainable, profitable sales growth and create value for shareholders.","Over the last few months, we have performed a detailed review of our fiscal 2019 performance and the foundational capabilities developed in year one of Path to Brilliance. Additionally, we have restructured parts of the organization and made leadership changes aimed to position us for success. It's clear that though we believe Path to Brilliance is the right strategy, we must move faster and more aggressively to achieve our goals. The learnings from this last year have been incorporated into our forward plans to improve both execution and financial performance.","Year two of Path to Brilliance will build on the foundational capabilities developed during year one while accelerating growth initiatives to drive customer relevance, aggressively addressing our cost structure and bolstering our balance sheet. We have plans under each of our strategic pillars of customer first, omnichannel and culture of agility and efficiency to change the trajectory of our same-store sales, stabilize and expand margins and improve our cash generation as we progress through our transformation.","Beginning with same-store sales. Everything we do at Signet will continue to be focused on driving and inspiring full-service seamlessly connected customer experience. Our fiscal 2020 plans include improved product assortment and differentiation, upgrading our websites and mobile platforms to deliver double-digit e-commerce growth through a better customer experience and expanding our services businesses. We have made significant progress understanding the key customer journeys of bridal, gifting, self purchase and repair, which allows us to tailor new product, marketing and promotional strategies based on why and how customers are engaging with us.","In product, our strategy involves building bigger iconic and inspirational flagship brands offering a highly competitive assortment for value-oriented shoppers during holiday periods and making Signet a leader in on-trend product. This will be a multiyear journey with fiscal 2020 expected to continue to see some headwinds from legacy brands which we expect to begin to ease as we move through the year. Jamie Singleton, who has led our Zales and Peoples banners has recently added Kay to her responsibilities. Jamie has a strong merchandising background and track record of driving growth and together with our new chief merchant who started last spring, I am confident their expertise will help us deliver an inspirational customer focused product assortment that is differentiated by banner.","In bridal, we intend to innovate and grow our flagship brands, Neil Lane, Vera Wang Love and Disney Enchanted, build on fiscal 2019 wins in fancy shapes and color and continuously upgrade our assortment with fresh designs. We have built new capabilities to enhance our innovative product development and testing to better qualify customer inspired ideas. Flowing from this, we plan to expand and grow our in-house designed Love + Be Loved collection beginning at Mother's Day, expand testing of several new collections of flagships and fashion lines to impact holiday and will launch new anniversary and gifting products later in the year to help replace Ever Us, as it nears the end of its lifecycle. This will start to result in a competitive and differentiated product assortment that is more exclusive to Signet, which will improve customer relevance. We will also build on our fiscal 2019 success in gold with a pipeline of new on-trend core assortments.","Turning to marketing. We plan to transform our marketing model in fiscal 2020 by rebalancing the timing and mix of our media investments, leveraging a more personalized journey-based approach and modernizing our content and messaging. In fact, fiscal 2020 will be the first year that Signet spends more on digital and social marketing than on television advertising. Building on successful always-on bridal tests at Kay, we plan to grow our share of gifting occasions with a targeted focus on special occasion milestones like birthdays and anniversaries. We will also aim to significantly improve the effectiveness of our creative campaigns building on the banner differentiation work launched in fiscal 2019. Within the past year, we have brought on new creative agencies for every North America banner, as well as a new data savvy media buying agency. Together, we are evolving our campaigns with more sophisticated journey-specific content and leveraging our competitive advantage in jewelry category data analytics to more efficiently target our spend.","Building a best-in-class mobile experience and driving digital innovation as we progress on our Path to Brilliance is another key component to improve our same-store sales trends. We delivered mid-teens growth in e-commerce in North America in fiscal 2019, driven by investments in design your own customization tools. increasing the number of high quality proprietary 360-degree images and personalization and curation initiatives.","In fiscal 2020, we are substantially increasing our investment in platform and mobile technology. We plan to convert Kay and Jared to the Hybris platform, a significantly more contemporary dynamic platform already in use on Zales, which enables better customer experience through faster speeds, higher quality images and improved curated search. In addition to leveraging learnings from the Zales implementation, the Kay and Jared transition is expected to be much less complex than Zales' Hybris implementation, because it is only a change in technology platform. We expect the platform change to be in place by the end of Q3, ahead of holiday.","Additionally, we are continuing to build best-in-class customization capability, including the launch of a new Vera Wang Love tool at Zales.com and enhancements to make our current design your own programs more mobile-friendly. Mobile experience investments will include faster load speeds, search and browse functionality and personalized curated product pages. We believe that these changes set us up for driving higher traffic and creating a much stronger online experience.","Another important aspect of improving our long-term sales performance is services. We plan to increase competitive advantage by using our full-service jeweler capabilities to drive traffic and create higher frequency relationships with our customers. We are continuing to develop new tools and tracking technology for our repair business and expect to begin marketing our repair expertise to customers later this year. We will also leverage our Piercing Pagoda expertise to begin testing piercing in several Kay stores in the second half of fiscal 2020. We expect services to be a meaningful revenue driver for Signet over time and a small contributor to sales growth in fiscal 2020 as we learn and scale our efforts.","Turning to margins. A key component of our Path to Brilliance plan is reducing costs customers do not see or care about to fund growth initiatives and improve our profit margins. In fiscal 2020, we expect to generate higher gross cost savings to fund increased investment in omnichannel and innovation, resulting in net cost savings of $60 million to 70 million. These include direct and indirect procurement savings, workforce reductions, consolidation of facilities and a lower corporate cost.","We continue to optimize real estate working toward a portfolio of fewer better stores that deliver a fully connected, omnichannel journey that delights our customers and generates higher financial contribution. By the end of fiscal 2020, we expect we will have reduced our store base by 13% over a three-year period, materially reduced our exposure to lower grade malls and simplified our portfolio by exiting most of our regional banners. We expect overall store count at the end of the transformation plan to be lower than fiscal 2020 year-end levels.","As the store footprint is strategically reduced and repositioned, we believe we can increase productivity and make more focused, impactful investments in compelling, digitally enabled new store designs as well as targeted store experience updates across the portfolio. In addition to our sales growth initiatives, cost savings and real estate efforts, we expect to drive operating margin expansion through adding more differentiated exclusive merchandise, modernizing and simplifying IT systems and generating a greater mix of higher margin service revenue.","Moving on to cash generation. Our fiscal 2019 adjusted free cash flow was below prior year trends, driven by lower operating income and primarily due to higher levels of inventory. In fiscal 2020, we expect to improve our cash generation and are highly focused on lowering our inventory levels as we work through legacy product and implement a more enhanced planning process under our new leadership. We also expect our capital expenditures to reflect lower investments in new stores as we rationalize our physical store footprint somewhat offset by continuing investment in IT to support e-commerce and systems upgrades.","And now, I will briefly discuss our fiscal 2020 financial guidance. We expect same-store sales to be flat to down 2.5%, non-GAAP operating income of $260 million to $300 million and a lower non-GAAP EPS versus fiscal 2019, primarily due to a significantly higher tax rate in fiscal 2020. While we expect to make bolder and faster progress on our Path to Brilliance initiatives in fiscal 2020, some headwinds remain. We face a very competitive retail landscape, an uncertain macroeconomic and political environment in our U.K. market, continuing pressure from the implementation of sales tax across several additional states for our James Allen online banner and some margin pressure related to the need to clear excess inventory. However, we remain favorably positioned as the largest specialty fine jewelry retailer. We have seen some signs of improvement in our mall-based banners and we expect more transformation initiatives to take hold in fiscal 2020.","I will now wrap up my comments with some thoughts on capital allocation. We are committed to building a more durable balance sheet to support our growth priorities for the business and continue to return cash to shareholders. In fiscal 2020, we are maintaining our current quarterly dividend per share of $0.37. Our fiscal 2020 guidance does not embed any share repurchases as we intend to build cash on our balance sheet. We now expect our leverage ratio to reach approximately 3.5 times by the end of fiscal 2021.","In closing, as I look back at fiscal 2019, we made meaningful progress improving our capabilities and laying the foundation to change the trajectory of our operational and financial performance. Our transformation remains a multiyear journey to bring new customers into our stores and keep them engaged with us, improve our profitability and invest in short and long-term strategic initiatives. Our team is highly engaged and work is well underway to move us along the path to sustainable profitable growth and improving shareholder value.","I will now turn the call over to Michele.","Michele Santana","Thanks Gina and good morning everyone. I will begin with some brief comments on our fourth quarter results and then move on to our fiscal 2020 guidance and our outlook for the first quarter.","As we indicated in our holiday press release, fourth quarter results were impacted by lower traffic in key December holiday gifting weeks, some success in new merchandise that was offset by a faster than expected decline in legacy product collections and a highly competitive promotional environment. Same-store sales of down 2% for the fourth quarter was in line with our guidance. Slight deceleration in January reflected tougher prior year comparisons and the shift of a promotion into the holiday period at Zales.","The fourth quarter GAAP operating loss of $84 million reflect a goodwill impairment, restructuring charges related to our Path to Brilliance transformation plan and a charge related to our previously disclosed regulatory matter. We recognized a $287 million non-cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter, of which $261 million is related to the R2Net acquisition with the remainder primarily associated with the Zales trade name. The R2Net impairment is a result of revised long-term financial projections for James Allen as well as an increase in the discount rate driven by a higher risk premium used to value this business.","While the R2Net acquisition has enhanced Signet's digital innovation capabilities, the growth of this business has been lower than our initial expectations and has not yet reached profitability. A significant driver of the revised projections is sales tax implementation, which had a larger impact than we initially modeled in combination with a more competitive online marketplace.","Our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income of $241 million was in line with our expectations and declined $82 million or 290 basis points year-over-year. The decline over prior year reflects the following, one, the impact of lower sales, two, higher levels of clearance and promotion, three, a $13 million unfavorable year-over-year net impact related to the outsourcing of credit and four, an $8.8 million charge related to unproductive inventory. These factors were somewhat offset by transformation net cost savings.","Non-GAAP EPS of $3.96 was slightly ahead of our guidance primarily due to a lower than expected tax rate. For further details of our fourth quarter results, please see today's press release.","Moving on to fiscal 2020 guidance. Our same-store sales are expected to be flat to down 2.5%. This guidance reflects continuing headwinds from our U.K. and James Allen banners and softness in Jared. Changes implemented in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 related to the timing of revenue recognition on our extended service plans will have an unfavorable impact of 20 basis points on our fiscal 2020 same-store sales.","Turning to operating income. We are aggressively addressing our cost structure and expect to deliver $60 million to $70 million of net cost savings in fiscal 2020, recently balanced between gross margin and SG&A. Our gross savings are expected to be higher versus fiscal 2019 with higher levels of reinvestment in e-commerce and innovation, resulting in somewhat lower net savings versus fiscal 2019.","The first quarter will be the smallest quarter for net cost savings as payroll and facilities consolidation savings do not begin to impact our results until mid-second quarter and procurement savings are more second half weighted. We continue to expect $200 million to $225 million in net cost savings over the course of our three-year transformation plan, inclusive of the $85 million we achieved in fiscal 2019.","Due to the significant increase in our tax rate this year, we are providing non-GAAP operating income dollar guidance of $260 million to $300 million to assist in fiscal 2020 modeling. Our operating income guidance range embeds, one, incremental clearance activity to drive cash and lower inventory levels, two, sales banner mix and three, the profit impact of timing adjustments due to the recognition of high-margin extended service plan revenues. Additionally, we expect advertising expense to be slightly lower year-over-year for the full year with variability in the quarters as we move our spend to a more always-on model.","In fiscal 2020, we expect the year-over-year net impact of credit outsourcing to be flat to a modestly headwind. As a reminder, our credit expenses have a variable component driven by the level of credit sales for the year. Our estimated net operating income impact from credit reflects our fiscal 2020 sales guidance with a slight decline in payment plan participation rate. As a reminder, the credit outsourcing business model change is fully anniversaried when we lap the nonprime credit outsourcing late in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.","We also expect interest expense of approximately $42 million to $46 million. Our GAAP EPS guidance of $1.86 to $2.66 includes $55 million to $70 million in charges related to our transformation plan. Non-GAAP EPS guidance of $2.87 to $3.45 excludes these charges. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance embeds a tax rate of 16% to 17.5% including discrete items. As Gina mentioned earlier, our fiscal 2020 guidance assumes no share repurchases.","Now moving on to the first quarter guidance. In the first quarter, we expect same-store sales to be down 0.5% to down 1.5%. The same-store sales guidance reflects a favorable impact of 40 basis points related to a planned promotional shift into the first quarter from the second quarter at Jared and an unfavorable impact of 45 basis points related to the extended service plans that I previously discussed.","With respect to profit, we expect bob-GAAP operating income of $3 million to $10 million. Operating income in the first quarter will be impacted by, one, incremental clearance sales, two, significantly higher year-over-year advertising expense, three, the extended service plan headwind I discussed earlier in my remarks and four, the year-over-year net impact of credit outsourcing is expected to be slightly positive in the first quarter due to a comparison against two months of bad debt expense in the prior year quarter.","Our GAAP EPS guidance of a loss of $0.54 to a loss of $0.78 includes expected restructuring charges of $22 million to $28 million. Excluding these charges, our non-GAAP EPS guidance is a loss of $0.17 to a loss of $0.28, driven by lower levels of operating income and higher year-over-year interest expense. Given the small expected tax expense for the first quarter, we have provided a dollar range of non-GAAP income tax expense of $0.4 million to $1.4 million, which is inclusive of discrete tax items anticipated in the quarter.","Finally, turning to cash flow and capital allocation. In fiscal 2019, we generated adjusted free cash flow of $119 million, excluding proceeds of $445.5 million from the nonprime credit outsourcing transaction, driven by lower operating income versus prior year and investments in bridal inventory and the new fashion merchandise. We ended the year in an elevated inventory position and do expect inventory to be up year-over-year in the first quarter. As we continue to work through legacy products, we do expect to reduce our inventory position by the end of fiscal 2020.","Our capital allocation priorities are to invest in the business for strategic growth and support our dividend. In fiscal 2020, capital investments $135 million to $155 million will consist of limited new store openings, targeted store remodels and IT investments. This morning, we announced that we are maintaining our quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share and do not expect to repurchase shares in fiscal 2020.","With respect to leverage, we ended fiscal 2019 with a leverage ratio of 4.3 times. We now expect our leverage ratio at the end of fiscal 2021 to reach approximately 3.5 times.","And now, I will pass the call back to Gina for some closing remarks.","Gina Drosos","Thanks Michele. As you may have seen from our announcement a few weeks ago, we are very excited that Joan Hilson will be joining us as our new Chief Financial Officer effective tomorrow. Joan has significant financial and operational experience working at a number of retailers, most recently as the CFO of David's Bridal. I am confident that she will bring valuable perspective to Signet and our transformation efforts. I would like to thank Michele for her many contributions to Signet and wish her well in her future pursuits.","We also filed an 8-K this morning announcing the departure of our President and Chief Customer Officer, Seb Hobbs, on June 30, 2019. I would also like to thank Seb for his very many contributions to Signet.","And now we are ready to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. Hi guys. Good morning. Gina, just recognizing the significance of Q4 in the business model, what is the Q4 EPS you are embedding in the full year guide, maybe help at all with the cadence of the first three quarters? And then just a question we get a nice amount, what percent of sales did the CarVal and Castlelake tranche represent this year? And maybe what do you think that will be this coming year? Thanks.","Michele Santana","Hi Simeon, it's Michele. So maybe I will start and then if Gina has anything incremental to add, she can. In terms of, it sounds like you are looking for some color or numbers in terms of the fourth quarter EPS guidance and clearly we are not at a position that we are going to do that. We provided our full year guidance and we also provided the guidance for Q1 and including the EPS guidance, we did provide, as I mentioned on the call, operating income to also help facilitate the modeling.","But maybe what I can do is provide some strategic color on how we are thinking about Q4 this year relative to last year. So as I mentioned in my remarks, we did a deep dive analysis on all of fiscal 2019 with particular emphasis on the holiday period. So we saw some slight improvements versus the previous year, but obviously did not deliver the results that we were expecting or that we wanted to in Q4. And we have a lot of learnings that will come through in this year.","So for example, we think one of our competitive advantages is in being able to understand customers and how they shop, particularly around key holiday periods. And we have identified that there are different shopping behaviors that are occurring in those periods and we are targeting in a better way this year, both our products and our promotions in order to help to access those more value oriented shoppers.","I think another thing that we are doing is really building our off-holiday business through, again, our proprietary jewelry category data analytics. I mentioned targeting customers at important gifting times of the year like birthdays and anniversaries. We call those more milestone gifting occasions as opposed to just holiday gifting occasions which are areas where we think that we have a right to uniquely win.","Simeon Siegel","Gina, maybe just taking a -- yes, sorry.","Gina Drosos","Go ahead. No, go ahead, Simeon.","Simeon Siegel","I was going to say, just maybe taking a step back and reflecting on the work that you have done, just thinking about the comp declines, do you have a view on where the customer, is the customer going somewhere else or simply not making a purchase?","Gina Drosos","You know, it's more and more a highly competitive environment. I mean we have seen that escalating over the last number of years with a fair amount of deep discounting, particularly during the December holiday period. But our data is indicating that the jewelry category remains a growing category that customers are continuing to look at jewelry as an important holiday purchase as well as a purchase for some of these other milestone occasions and one of the growing parts of the category is women buying jewelry for themselves. And so all of these are things that as we think about our product assortment and our revised marketing plans we will be going after as growth opportunities in fiscal 2020.","Simeon Siegel","Okay. Thanks. And then Michele, were you going to follow up on that CarVal and Castlelake tranche, if at all possible.","Michele Santana","Yes. I believe, Simeon, your question was, what percentage related to Zales? And so, we had said at the time, that transaction was really focused on our Kay and Jared banners. As I think, if you go back and you look at -- I am sorry, on what?","Simeon Siegel","Sales, not Zales. Just how large of that business.","Michele Santana","So it's sales, I thought you were saying Zales. Yes, I would just refer you back to the information we said at that time and we are not going to get into, you know, pursing out you know, the percentage of sales. But I think if you go back through previously comments that we made related to the transaction, you can get to an idea of what that percentage was.","Simeon Siegel","Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Best of luck for the year.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Gina Drosos","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Ike Boruchow","Hi. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, Michele, a question for you. I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about elevated inventory position to start the year. I guess can you help us understand, a little bit more color around that, maybe what type of merchandise are you referring to? Is it weighted to any one banner? And then how should we think about your inventory position at the start of the year in relation to gross margin in Q1 and then maybe gross margin progression through the year?","Michele Santana","Yes. So I will start with some comments. You are correct. In my prepared comments, I had discussed the inventory levels that particularly related to Q1 and embedded with the guidance we gave, we do anticipate year-over-year to have higher inventory as we are working through some of the legacy product collections and selling through. We do anticipate to have some higher clearance level and that's all factored into the guidance that we gave as part of Q1 and embedded into the operating profit numbers we have provided as well.","And then I also mentioned, though, as we progress throughout the year, we will be working through and selling down that inventory. So by the time that we do end our fiscal 2020, we expect that our inventory levels will be in a much better position. And that's been a key focus as we move throughout the year. One, in part of, just moving through inventory, but also focusing on the cash side of it.","Gina Drosos","Yes. I will just add a little color on that as well. So we spoke previously about two areas in which we were investing in inventories, kind of coming into the holiday season. One was in bridal. We began that investment over the summer and we saw bridal growth across the business in fiscal 2019. We believe that we are getting to a much better mix of offerings on-trend and in our big flagship brands, Neil Lane., Vera Wang Love and Disney Enchanted.","And then the second area that we made some investments are in more proprietary fashion designs. And those performed well over the holiday period. The example I gave in my prepared remarks is the Love + Be Loved collection, which we rolled out in a limited number of stores. It performed very well. And so that will become a focus of some of our marketing around Mother's Day. Just continuing to build those exclusive and proprietary lines that differentiate the offering that we have at Signet.","Ike Boruchow","Got it. And then just to reconcile the Q1 and full year guide. Is there some help that you can give us on how this impacts the gross margin? Or how we should be thinking about gross margins?","Michele Santana","The comment I would make is, we don't give guidance. The color that we provided, as we had called out, particularly in Q1, elevated levels of clearance, all of that is factored into our guidance. And that also, in part, why we did provide you the EBIT to help in your modeling.","Ike Boruchow","Got it. Okay. Fair enough. Just on the second question, it looks like the credit losses or the impact on EBIT from credit in Q4 was a little bit worse than what you had planned. And the outlook for next year is again just a little bit worse than what you had said prior. Just help us understand the moving pieces there? Why exactly did that take place? Just kind of what's going on there? And what are the drivers of that?","Michele Santana","Yes. So in terms of the costs related to the outsourcing of the credit, there is a number of variables that go into that consideration and factors that influence that. One of them being that I called out on the call, it really becomes a variable cost and is depending on the level of credit sales. So if our credit sales over performed compared to our expectation, you are going to have some incremental expense as well as it can also relate to promotional mix with [ABS] [ph] as well as just mix between our prime and our subprime. So all of those factors have been considered as we have given the guidance out into FY 2020. And I did mention that in FY 2020 that we do anticipate the payment participation rate to be a slight decline over fiscal 2019.","Ike Boruchow","Got it. Thank you.","Michele Santana","Thank you Ike.","Gina Drosos","Thanks Ike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","David Buckley","Hi. This is David Buckley, on for Lorraine this morning. Thanks for taking our question. Just move quick back to the gross margin, can you quantify the benefit that you expect to see in the first quarter from lapping bad debt expense? And then can you also comment on James Allen's performance in the fourth quarter and your outlook for 2020? Thanks.","Michele Santana","Yes. I will start with the first one in terms of the gross margin and we did call out that we are getting the benefits that the prior year Q1 had included two months of bad debt expense. I don't have that with me, but if you go back and if you look at our Q1 filing, you will see a bad debt expense and you can probably come up with the impact and the positive impact that we have in Q1.","Gina Drosos","And then I will take your James Allen question. So we did see James Allen growth slowed substantially as we came through the year and began collecting sales tax in a number of markets. By the end of fiscal 2019, we were collecting sales tax in just under about 50% of sales as states that represent about half of James Allen sales. We expect that headwind to continue as we pick up some additional large states during fiscal 2020 and by the end of fiscal 2020, we will be collecting sales tax in states probably representing around two-thirds of James Allen sales.","We do have though, say, a couple of things. We have some really important efforts going on, on James Allen right now. We are adding jewelry fashion products to our lines and that is a now growing part of the business that is a higher margin business for us. So we feel excited about the opportunities that we have there. We also have added some service plans on James Allen, so another opportunity for us to add value for our customers.","And we are doing a lot of work on our algorithms in the technology and customization tools which really are the competitive advantage of James Allen to make sure that we have a best-in-class customer experience. So its' a combination of the headwinds we expect to continue to see on sales tax, somewhat offset by some of these growth initiatives that we are very rapidly putting in place.","David Buckley","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citi Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Lejuez","Hi. Thanks guys. Can you maybe break down the $60 million to $70 million of savings? Of if you can, maybe even talk about it on a gross basis? And then, what are those offsets of investments that y plan to make? What are the buckets there as well? Also curious on the James Allen business, what is the current carrying value of that asset? This write-down that you just took, does that basically write-down the James Allen asset to zero? Or is there still a carrying value on that asset? And then last, any changes for this upcoming year on the discount rate on the subprime receivables? Thanks.","Gina Drosos","So why don't I take the first question on cost savings. So we don't guide to gross cost savings. But you are absolutely right, we said that we will have net cost savings of $60 million to $70 million in fiscal 2020. That's on top of the $85 million of net savings that we delivered in fiscal year 2019 and on track for the $200 million to $225 million that we expected across the three years.","Our real focus this year on cost savings is direct and indirect procurements, consolidation of facilities, payroll, savings and lowering our corporate costs. All of these are areas where we have identified opportunities that fit very well with our strategy of building a culture of agility and efficiency, simplifying decision making, so that we can move bolder and faster on our initiatives.","And our cost savings has always been targeted to allow us to fund growth, right. I mean to get back to growth is a key cornerstone of Path to Brilliance. So the investments that we will be making are really in driving e-commerce, innovation and the mobile experience that customers have. So we move ahead on our first two strategies, customer first and building our seamless omnichannel experience for customers.","Michele Santana","Paul, maybe I will pick up your two other questions. I think the second question you had related to James Allen and the non-cash impairment charge we had recorded in Q4 and was that a 100% of the goodwill and intangible balance we had or is there a residual piece?","It is not 100% of the intangible value that we had recorded prior to the impairment charge. You will see, we will be filing the K at some point later today. So there is a residual piece. It was a substantial portion of it, I want to say, maybe 80% or so of the balance was written off based on the revised projections and the higher discount rate driven by the risk premium.","Your third question, I believe, related then with the MDR rate related to our credit outsourcing. So again, just what I mentioned in the prepared remarks is that, we do expect credit outsourcing to be flat to modest year-over-year headwind to our operating profit for fiscal year 2020. That guidance embeds our view on the MDR rates, as well as you would imagine, there are several other variables, including the overall credit sales, the mix between prime, subprime as well as that promotional mix within our prime.","And we have said previously, the MDR rate, it is subject to period adjustment and it could change. But everything has been factored into the guidance that we provided.","Paul Lejuez","Michele, how often does that change?","Michele Santana","It's a periodic adjustment. So as I said before, I mean it's not subject to monthly changes. And there's a number of factors that are involved, if that rate was going to change.","Paul Lejuez","Thanks. Good luck.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen","Hi. Thank you. We had a question about the product assortment ahead. Where do you see the most opportunities? And how will this interplay with traffic? And your thoughts on the best strategies to prioritize driving more consistent traffic? Would love your views there. Thank you.","Gina Drosos","Hi Oliver. Thanks for that question. So on product, we really have taken a good hard look at our product strategy and there are three key areas that we are prioritizing as we go into fiscal 2020. We laid some of the groundwork for this in fiscal 2019. But we will be able to move, I think, bolder and faster into it this coming fiscal year.","Those three strategies are building iconic flagship brands. Good examples of ones that have been working for us are Vera Wang Love, Neil Lane and Disney Enchanted and also some of the proprietary brands that I talked about. We have developed a new customer testing methodology, so that we are screening more new ideas faster and that will allow us to bring more of these iconic flagship brands that we can holistically market through a digital, social and TV program as well as new fashion initiatives.","And then if I just kind of shift into fashion a bit we also, as the two other points of our merchandising strategy, see how important it is for us to have good offerings, really competitive offerings for the value-oriented shopper, especially around key holiday periods and to have a higher mix of on-trend product.","So we have excellent vendor relationships. We are looking across the world for great trends to be able to bring to our customers. And I think we haven't been leveraging that competitive advantage historically as much as much we will going forward.","Oliver Chen","Okay. And I know you have really dedicated a lot of effort thinking about Generation Z and millennials. A couple of trends we are seeing is, is the arise of the on-demand economy and Jewelry-as-a-Service as well as added transparency from search engines online. Could you just give us your thoughts about how you are thinking about those as they are part of the new customer and how Signet can remain agile in a time of change?","Gina Drosos","So bridal remains an incredibly important part of our business and while we see customers of all ages getting engaged, it really does skew to that younger Gen Z and millennial target audience. So it's one that we spend a lot of time with. One of the great foundational capabilities that we got in place in fiscal 2019 is really understanding the details of the customer journey. So being able to dissect that in a bridal context and how our customers are acquiring information, what they expect from selection, the kind of curation that they expect in store and online.","Time is an incredibly important commodity to these customers. And so how do we make sure that we are fast and allowing them to get the information and the selection that they really want. So I think that's very much part of it. That's a lot that's behind our shift to a more digital and social media platform and leveraging our data to better target messaging to people when and where they need it. We also, given our size and scale, have developed some proprietary relationships with a number of the different social media channels and believe that we can leverage those to make sure, again, that we are creating community among these target audiences.","And then the final thing that I will mention is, Signet continues to be a leader in corporate and social responsibility. We will be publishing our CSR report next week and I hope you all take a chance to read it because I am very, very proud of the stance that we have taken on responsible sourcing, on environmental sustainability, on diversity and inclusion in our organization and also on philanthropy. And we know that this generation of consumers is voting with their pocketbook for companies that really represent their values and I believe that Signet is uniquely that company within the jewelry industry.","Oliver Chen","Thanks for those comments. Best regards.","Gina Drosos","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.","Dana Telsey","Good morning everyone. As you think about the legacy products and the weakness there, how do you plan to up for fiscal 2020 new collections or introductions we should be watching for? And then on your real estate portfolio and the shift from mall to off-mall, impact of occupancy costs, what percentage of your real estate do you expect to be in off-mall going forward? Thank you.","Gina Drosos","Hi. So let me take both of those questions and then Michele chime in with any details. I think one of our biggest learnings over the last year-and-a-half since I have been here, has really been the pace of change and customers' appetite for new and different. So product life cycles that might have been four or five years in the past are shorter than that now. And so what we are really developing is better predictive capabilities so that we can more quickly understand where we are in that product life cycle and move through it and have other new offerings in place.","I mentioned, for example, that one of the legacy, actually two important kind of legacy product collections that negatively impacted our business in fiscal 2019 and particularly holiday were beads and Ever Us. Those are examples of things we did not move through fast enough from a product life cycle standpoint and we have learned from that and we will be better prepared to do that in the future.","I think from a real estate footprint standpoint, we have been aggressive in optimizing our real estate portfolio. And as I mentioned in my remarks, it's really to meet customers where they are and create that ideal omnichannel experience for them, but as we rationalize that store footprint, we are better able to target investments in creating a more digitally-enabled and more curated store experience.","More and more, our customers are getting and understanding our selection online before they ever come into our store. About 70% of our customers now have already shopped one of our online sites before they walk in the door. So they understand already a bit about our selection. What we want to do is help them understand more about our expertise and our service to really help them find the right products once they get in store and we can do that through a combination of our outstanding store staff and expertise, but also more digitally-enabled footprint.","We have seen better performance from our off-mall locations. And so we have been moving systematically out of lower performing malls and simplifying by moving out of regional banners. So I am feeling very good about the work that we have done moving out of over 260 stores in fiscal 2019 and we are guiding to moving out of another 150 in 2020. Some of those that will be replaced by great off-mall locations that we have identified based on our trade market data analytics.","Dana Telsey","Got it. Thank you. And just one quick follow-up. Given the impact of store closure on sales, how did that help or hurt operating income? And how do you look at it go forward? Thank you.","Michele Santana","So Dana, it's Michele. When we think about the impact of store closures from total sales and how that flows to the bottomline, one of the items that we have talked about is our sales transference rate that we have been very focused that when you look at the stores that we are closing and the geographic ring that surrounds it where we have either another banner or a sister banner, we have been pretty successful in capturing a sales transference rate to mute impact to the bottom line.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

Thank you, Operator. Welcome to the conference call for Signet\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2013 results. This is Tim Jackson, Investor Relations Director talking. With me are Mike Barnes, CEO and Ron Ristau, CFO. The presentation deck we will be talking to is available from the webcast section of the Company\u2019s website, www.signetjewelers.com.","I will now give the Safe Harbor statement.

Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. We urge you to read the risk factors cautionary language and other disclosure in the annual report on Form 10-K that was filed with the SEC on March 22, 2012. We also draw your attention to this slide.","I will now hand over to Mike.","Michael Barnes","Thanks Tim, and good morning to everyone. We delivered strong financial results in the first quarter, and increased our earnings per share by 10.3% to $0.96. We anticipated the impact of the calendar shift as discussed on our last call and managed our business including expenses accordingly, leading to this double-digit earnings increase.","I\u2019d like to thank all at Signet who contributed third-party these record results. In the second quarter to-date, which benefited from the calendar shift our same-store sales including Mother\u2019s Day, were up strong double-digits reflecting the customers broad acceptance of our merchandised offerings, our great customer experience and the effectiveness of our advertising, all of which we consider to be core competitive strengths. I will speak more specifically about Mother\u2019s Day in a moment.","Our results year-to-date and our consistent ability to execute our initiatives, leave us well positioned to meet the challenges of the current economic environment and achieve our objectives for this year.","Same-store sales were up 1.2%. The impact of the calendar shift reduced first quarter sales by an estimated $32 million or by about 370 basis points. In the U.S. we delivered same-store sales of 1.2%, after an increase of 12.5% last year with the promotional shift having an estimated 440 basis point impact. In the U.K. we\u2019re pleased to again report a positive comp and again it was 1.2%, and what remains a challenging environment. This reflected as expected, a significant improvement from the February performance, which we discussed in our last call. Income before income taxes was $128.5 million or an increase of 9.1%.","Now let\u2019s look at the U.S. performance in a little bit more detail. U.S. total sales were $751.5 million, up $13.5 million, an increase of 1.8%. Kay same-store sales increased by 2.9%. During February which includes the important Valentine\u2019s Day period, same-store sales were up 8.4% with April being adversely impacted by the calendar shift.","Jared comps were 0.2%. Jared also had a similar trading pattern with February comps up 8.1% and April adversely impacted by the calendar shift. Overall, U.S. same-store sales increased 1.2% in the first quarter.","As we moved into the second quarter, including the Mother\u2019s Day trading period, we\u2019ve seen strong double-digit comps. A very strong all round performance for this major gift giving period for our U.S. division.","Our operating income was a $137.7 million, up $11.5 million or 9.1%, reflecting the tight management of expenses in anticipation of this calendar shift. And the operating margin increased by 120 basis points to 18.3%, a record level for the first quarter.","Now let\u2019s turn to Mother\u2019s Day because as we know its all about Mom. We had a very strong Mother\u2019s Day in the U.S. with May month-to-date sales of approximately 21% following a 16% increase last year. Adjusted for the Mother\u2019s Day related timing shifts, same-store sales were up approximately 9% following a 14% increase last year. We are very pleased with this performance month-to-date encompassing this very important holiday period.","Now turning to the U.K. The total sales were $148.5 million, a constant exchange rate that were up 1.4%. Same-store sales were up 1.2% with H.Samuel leading the way. The same-store sales performance continued to be ahead of nonfood retailers in the U.K. as reported by the British Retail Consortium.","The growth was driven by new product initiatives, particularly in H.Samuel, the strong performance from store investments made last year and our success in competing in a promotional environment. There was an operating loss of $3 million, down $2.8 million which was inline with our plan. The performance was primarily due to a lower gross merchandise margin. We are focused in the U.K. on initiatives, such as testing new merchandise, staff training, and planning for Christmas. With the objective of driving costs in this key holiday season, while identifying further opportunities to control cost.","We expect sales in the U.K. to continue to outpace the broader retail market, that currently believe that operating income will be under pressure primarily due to the promotional environment. Just as a remainder, in the U.K. Mother\u2019s Day was in March.","The drivers of our performance are our sustainable competitive strengths. In particular, broad customer acceptance of our merchandised offerings, our great customer experience and our investment in marketing. Brand is differentiated and exclusive merchandise continues to perform well and Neil Lane Bridal, Le Vian, Tolkowsky and Charmed Memories have all been particularly strong.","The customer experience remained central to our success and we remained focused on training and development of our store teams, including the best use of in-store sales enhancing technology that is currently being rolled out. Our marketing investment for Valentine\u2019s Day and Mother\u2019s Day again proved very effective with increased impressions helping to drive strong sales performances and building the value of the brand equity, both our store concepts and our merchandised collections. Also ecommerce performance strongly again with sales up $4.8 million to $22.1 million, an increase of 27.7%.","We continue to focus on our strategic imperatives to drive growth in fiscal 2013 and beyond. To manage the business appropriately including tight expense control, while continuing to implement initiatives that drives long-term shareholder value. The recruitment, training, development, motivation, and retention of our team members is key to sustaining our ability to deliver an outstanding retail experience for our customers.","The customer acceptance of our merchandising initiatives remained very positive and we\u2019re always looking for opportunities to grow both new and existing brands and categories to delight both existing and new customers.","Our ability to further enhance our competitive strengths through investment in our people and infrastructure to enable growth in sales and operating margins helps us stand out from our many competitors. A great example of this is our commitment becoming world class in the digital environment.","We remained committed to increasing our share of the jewelry market and maximizing sustainable profit levels. I\u2019d also like to point out in this quarter, on a \u2013 of a particular note, the progress we made in optimizing our capital structure, through the execution of the share buyback program, which we began in mid January.","We completed 90.7 million of purchases this quarter, bringing the total repurchase to $103.4 million through the end of the last quarter. At that time, $196.6 million remained available for future purchases under the program. I\u2019m pleased with the execution of the plan to-date and we continue to maintain a very strong balance sheet as well.","Now I will hand the call over to Ron to go through the numbers in a little bit more detail. Ron?","Ronald Ristau","Thanks, Mike. Total sales for Signet increased 1.4% to $900 million compared to $887.3 million last year. Our total company comp store sales increased1.2% versus an increase of 10.2% in the prior-year. In the U.S., total sales increased by 1.8% to $751.5 million, reflecting comp store sales of 1.2% and a positive contribution from changes in space. I again point out that the promotional shift adversely U.S. sales by an estimated $32 million in the quarter.","In the U.K. total sales decreased by 0.5% to $148.5 million, reflecting a comp store sales increase of 1.2%, a small benefit from changes in space and the unfavorable impact of currency fluctuations in the quarter.","Income before taxes increased by 10.7 million to 128.5 million, representing 14.3% of the sales versus 13.3% last year. The major factors driving this 100 basis point increase was as follows. Gross margin was $353.7 million, an increase of $4 million. The gross margin rate was 39.3%, down 10 basis points.","Gross margin in the U.S. was up by $0.8 million on last year, driven by favorable gross merchandising margin improvement of 40 basis points. Leverage on store occupancy expenses an increased income from credit related fees. This was offset by an unfavorable impact of $4.7 million on U.S. net bad debt charges. This charge was due to a change in a number of credit billing cycles included in the quarter, a change made for purposes of internal efficiency.","This expense is expected to be offset by a broadly similar benefit in other operating income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, with little overall impact expenses expected on fiscal 2013 results. The U.S. net bad debt to sales ratio excluding this charge, was 1.8% compared to 1.6% in the first quarter last year. This small difference is attributable to the increased participation rate on credit sales leading to growth in the overall receivables portfolio.","Gross margin in the U.K. was lower than last year by $1.8 million, primarily as a result of the decline in gross merchandised margin of 170 basis points, attributed to the unfavorable exchange rate impact and primarily the level of promotions in the market. This was partially offset by favorability in store occupancy and store operating expenses.","Selling, general and administrative expense was 264.5 million, down $0.7 million and as a percentage of sales, it was 29.4%, 30 basis points favorable. This reflect a tight control of expenses and is primarily attributed to lower store staff costs.","Our other operating income was $40.2 million, up $7.4 million on last year, reflecting the higher level of accounts receivable. This had an 80 basis point favorable impact on the operating margin. As a result our operating income was $129.4 million, an improvement of $10.7 million or 9% and our operating margin was 14.4%, up from 13.4% or by a 100 basis points as I indicated.","Our net interest expense was unchanged at $0.9 million and our income before tax is a $128.5 million, again an increase of $10.7 million and as a percentage of sales that was 14.3%. Our tax rate in the quarter was 35.8%, resulting in net income of $82.5 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.96, which is up 10.3%.The weighted average fully diluted number of shares for the quarter was $86.3 million.","We ended the quarter with cash of $399 million and maintain a very \u2013 continued to maintain a very strong balance sheet. In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, net cash provided by operating activities was $34 million compared to a $105.3 million last year. The difference between the two quarters primarily reflects favorable net income, depreciation, and declines in accounts receivable balance compared to year-end offset by increases in payments for inventory expenditures and income taxes in the quarter.","Our total net accounts receivable at the end of the first quarter was $1,025.1 million, up by 13.4% from $904.3 million a year-ago, primarily reflecting the higher rate of in-house customer financing and the prior-year billed.","Credit participation showed an increase to 55.8% of U.S. sales in the first quarter, up from 53.8% in the comparable quarter last year. Our average monthly collection ratio was similar to last year at 13.8%, compared to 13.9% in the comparable quarter.","Our net inventories at April 28, were $1,335 million, up by 9.3%  from $1,221.1 million a year-ago. The increased inventory levels reflected the U.S. promotional calendar shift related to Mother\u2019s Day approximately $20 million and the impact of the higher diamond and gold prices, partially offset by our actions to improve inventory turn.","Our capital spending in the quarter totaled $18.6 million, up from $12.9 million as we increased our store and IT investment as previously described. In the quarter net cash used in financing activities primarily included dividends of $8.7 million and the repurchase of approximately 1.9 million shares at a cost of $90.7 million.","I would now like to address the outlook for the second quarter. We are providing guidance for the second quarter due to the complexity of the calendar shift. Same-store sales for the second quarter are expected to be in the mid to high single-digit range and fully diluted earnings per share are expected to range from $0.78 to $0.84 based upon an estimated $84 million weighted average shares outstanding.","In this guidance there are three issues to concern. One, we anticipate approximately $0.06 decline in U.K. earnings versus last year as a result of the pressure on gross margin due to the competitive environment. Second, approximately $10 million in advertising shifts move into the second quarter related to Mother\u2019s Day. This of course is offset by sales, but the SG&A ratios in the second quarter will adjust slightly due to this fact. Third, in the second quarter of last year we had an effective tax rate of 33.6%, which reflected the favorable recognition of $1.9 million in previously unrecognized tax benefits or about $0.02 a share.","We anticipate the tax rate in the second quarter this year will be 35.8%. Importantly, with our results here to-date combined with our focus on competitive strengths and the ability to execute our initiatives, we believe leave us well positioned to achieve our financial objectives for the year.","I\u2019ll now hand this back to Mike for some closing comments.","Michael Barnes","Thanks, Ron. We\u2019ll now be pleased to take any questions that you might have for us at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll now take our first question from Bill Armstrong from C.L. King & Associates. Please go ahead.","Bill Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates","Good morning, Mike and Ron.","Michael Barnes","Good morning.","Bill Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates","Good morning. It looks like the \u2013 excuse me, the decline in the U.K, $0.06, I think it seems little surprisingly large; maybe could you flush out a little bit more, the pressures on the gross margin and what\u2019s driving that?","Ronald Ristau","Yeah. As you know, the U.K. environment has been very challenging as we\u2019ve indicated on our calls in the past, but what we\u2019ve seen in the first quarter was that we did produce a positive comp in the U.K. because we\u2019ve made the decision to protect market share and try to increase our market share there, but we\u2019re finding that it is a increasingly promotional environment and that customers are self-selecting the more promotionally-orientated merchandise in the market.","So, we expect this trend to continue, whereby, we believe we\u2019ll continue to outpace the broader economic industries in the U.K. as measured by the brand. However, we do think that the markets will be under some pressure and we believe that this is the right strategy as we prepare ourselves for holiday as Mike indicated in his comments. So there will be some slight losses that we\u2019ll incur in the second quarter, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re calling it out.","Michael Barnes","When we do \u2013 I\u2019ll just add to that, just to add on to what Ron said, the U.K. tends to be a fourth quarter story for the most part holiday. It\u2019s so important. We feel like we\u2019re positioning ourselves exactly as we need to be as competitive as possible in that marketplace and that we do have the opportunity to gain further market share in the future.","We continue to invest strongly into new merchandize programs. We\u2019ve invested, as you well know into stores and remodeling stores etcetera. So we\u2019re encouraged with the direction that we\u2019re going in that market. And we feel good about the long-term future there.","Bill Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates","Is there a change in the competitive environment there, any new competitors coming in or is this just really kind of a function of the difficult overall economic conditions in the U.K?","Michael Barnes","You hit it on the second part there. It\u2019s really a function of the overall macro environment there. We continue to make the same moves as we need to in the U.K. in terms of pricing just like we do in the U.S, but because of the competitive and the promotional environment, and Ron said it best, the customer really is self-selecting the more promotional merchandize and that\u2019s driving the mix. And it\u2019s an impact on our gross merchandize margins to some degree. But again, I feel like that we\u2019re well positioned for the future and that we\u2019re moving in the right direction.","Bill Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates","Okay. One other question, on a different topic and that\u2019s, I was wondering if you could maybe just explain a little bit more about this change in the number of credit billing cycles and maybe help us understand how that works and how that would have affected obviously the Q1 and then, how that\u2019s kind of reverse in Q4? [What are] the mechanic of that?","Ronald Ristau","Yeah. This is really a change in our internal operations relative to credit, and what we wanted to do was to really unify our quarterly credit loss and just some -- the way we process internally, I mean it drives some of the way that we recognize our bad debt expense and other operating income.","So what happened is we\u2019ve essentially cut the number of cycles in the \u2013 the number of cycles in the first quarter, couple of more cycles in the fourth quarter, I mean just will change the flow between the quarters this year. No net impact to the year, we took a hit of about $4.7 million in the first quarter of this year in the bad debt expense, and we\u2019ll recognize in offsetting favorable situation in our other operating income in the fourth quarter.","So, in the year it means nothing, but it just helps us internally to have some efficiencies that we\u2019re always driving to gain in our own internal operations.","Bill Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates","So then the future, should we then see similar seasonality, seasonal pattern that we\u2019re now seeing this year?","Ronald Ristau","Yeah, this pattern will permanently adjust and you should never have to realize any kind of a difference again.","Bill Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates","Got it. Okay. Thanks. Right, okay. Thanks.","Operator","Now, we\u2019ll take the question from David Wu from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","Thanks. Hi, good morning everyone. First, your second quarter guidance \u2026","Michael Barnes","Hi, Dave.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","\u2026 hi, your second quarter guidance does assume a bit of a comp deceleration through the remainder of the quarter just from the high double-digit growth that you saw during Mother\u2019s Day, I was wondering you\u2019re just being conservative here or are you seeing something out there that is sort of making you more cautious?","Michael Barnes","Well, I mean if you look at the month-to-date in the first three weeks as we pointed out, it was very strong double-digit comps obviously. We tried to put it in as we can, when we give our guidance and we felt like mid to high single-digits was an appropriated guidance to give. It\u2019s very interesting, David, because this first two quarters just have so many moving parts between it. And God knows, I wish that Mother\u2019s Day and other events would start shifting around and I think that\u2019s planned very well to the retail business when they thought about all these holidays thousands of years ago. But the point is there is just a lot of moving parts in the first couple of quarters.","We\u2019re through the shift now and we feel pretty good about where we are at. We\u2019re pretty much guided and said that on the first half of the year also that we expected to see somewhere in the mid single-digit comp range and that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re still at, and with the second, the first quarter being lower single-digits as we guided to and the second quarter being mid to high single-digits. And we think it\u2019s a very strong performance especially in light of the performance that we\u2019re lapping over the last year and even maybe more important than the \u2013 even the comp number is the quality of those comps.","You look at setting record earnings in the first quarter and we still have a very strong year in front of us. We think that we\u2019re well positioned to hit our financial objectives and other objectives for the full-year as we move forward through the back-half. So we\u2019re excited about where we\u2019re at right now.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","Great. And on credit sales, you mentioned credit participation was up versus last year and I was wondering if approval rates are still relatively consistent from the prior quarters?","Michael Barnes","Still relatively consistent, David, but ...","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","Okay.","Michael Barnes","\u2026 they are actually down about a 100 basis points. So I\u2019d consider it relatively significant, but they\u2019re not up or down.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","Got it. And then also, I understand bad debt expense increased about 20 bps even when you exclude the credit cycle impact and I know it\u2019s a relatively small impact, I was wondering if you\u2019re seeing sort of any signs of softness at all and so as the credit health of your customers?","Ronald Ristau","No, I think that\u2019s a very excellent question. We\u2019re very pleased with the performance of the credit portfolio. We\u2019re seeing no indication whatsoever of any problems or roll rates or anything else of that nature, everything continues to be attracting very, very strongly. What we\u2019ve here is a slight impact of 20 bps. Again, with a 13% increase in the receivables starting up for \u2013 the level of bad debt will go up and sales only increasing by 1%. So it produces a slight distortion in the quarter in the rate, but no \u2013 the underlying performance of the portfolio remains very strong and very well managed.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","Great. And just lastly on price increases, I was wondering if you could just kind of share with us your strategy for the year if you raise prices at all in the quarter and if you think price increases could be an effective way to sort of deal with the tough comparisons that you\u2019ve ahead?","Ronald Ristau","Well, we\u2019ve increased prices in accordance with our normal strategies during the first quarter in both the U.S. and in the U.K. And it\u2019s kind of a mixed bag. In the U.K. we\u2019ve taken our normal price increases, but we\u2019re seeing a more promotional environment. So therefore it seems counter productive to take further price increases to offset the margin issues that we\u2019re having here. But that\u2019s really not what it will work in that market, we don\u2019t believe, what we need to be doing there is positioning ourselves for comp growth and greater market share participation in the U.K. right now.","In the U.S, we did realize of course a 40 bps improvement in our gross merchandize margin in the first quarter. So it was helpful pricing, most helpful. And we feel that we\u2019re well positioned while continuing to maintain great values for our customers in the U.S. So we\u2019d not look to take further substantial price increases and that\u2019s something unforeseen happened, but I\u2019d say right now we\u2019re on our normal pattern.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jennifer Davis from Lazard Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jennifer Davis - Lazard Capital Markets","Hi, guys. Good morning. I\u2019m trying to get my arms around guidance, it\u2019s based on 84 million shares, comps, mid to high single-digit, so I\u2019d assume you would get some decent leverage on that and you took price increases in the first quarter. So, I\u2019d expect some higher gross margins in the U.S. I understand the U.K. is weaker, but it looks like the low-end of your guidance assumes some margin contraction and given the U.S. is 80% and the U.K. is 20%, I\u2019m just kind of trying to understand that a little?","Ronald Ristau","There is a little bit of an impact in the second quarter with the tremendous shift of the all of the Mother\u2019s Day, all of our Mother\u2019s Day promotional events into the second quarter. That does have from a mix perspective, a slightly unfavorable impact on your margin as Mother\u2019s Day tends to be always little bit lower dollar value sales.","So, Mother\u2019s Day, the Mother\u2019s Day program in its totality covers a slightly lower margin than other times of the year. When we concentrate that all in the second quarter, as supposed to having a split between the first and second quarter as we normally do, it doesn\u2019t have that much effect, but it\u2019s having a slight effect in the second quarter due to the concentration of those sales. So, that\u2019s something from a modeling perspective that\u2019s kind of complex for people to pick up.","The second thing I\u2019d point out is that while they\u2019re of course covered by the incremental sales that happen, we\u2019re going to see \u2013 because moving along with Mother\u2019s Day, some of our advertising support shifted from \u2013 shifted into the second quarter if you\u2019ll. So there will be a slight impact on the SG&A ratios as I called out when I was monitoring some of the things that are causing some of the differences because we understand it\u2019s a little difficult for people to understand. So I\u2019ll go back and point out the $0.02 impacts last year, and again, we made a profit in the U.K. last year in the second quarter, which we do expect to reverse into a loss this year, which is going to cost us about $0.06. So, I doubt that most models anticipated that, that\u2019s why we\u2019re calling it out.","Jennifer Davis - Lazard Capital Markets","Okay.","Ronald Ristau","So, hopefully we will see how things work out, we\u2019re not usually in the guidance business and we try to be prudent with our guidance also as we\u2019ve to release these numbers.","Jennifer Davis - Lazard Capital Markets","Okay. A quick clarification, that $0.06 decline in the U.K, that\u2019s only the $0.06 based in the U.K. right? So it\u2019s 20% of $0.06, right? Or is $0.06 [the cut off]?","Ronald Ristau","No. $0.06 is the difference \u2026","Jennifer Davis - Lazard Capital Markets","In the U.K. or in the total?","Ronald Ristau","\u2026 the difference versus last second quarter. It\u2019s the effect -- it\u2019s the effect on the total.","Jennifer Davis - Lazard Capital Markets","Okay, great. And then \u2026","Ronald Ristau","It is the effect on the total.","Jennifer Davis - Lazard Capital Markets","Got you, got you. Thank you. And then my next question is on other operating income, we saw a pretty big increase there, is that because of the added number of cycles, did that impact other operating income this quarter?","Ronald Ristau","No, it did not impact other operating income. Other operating income is realizing a benefit from the more on the size of the receivable portfolio as being the primary driver of that. And then we\u2019re also seeing some slight mix differences in the types of programs people are selecting, which is causing us to gain some additional income.","So that\u2019s a trend that we expect to continue in the year, but we\u2019d realize some higher other operating income as we move through the entire year, which is a good benefit to the business and driven by what we believe will be a higher receivable balance.","Jennifer Davis - Lazard Capital Markets","Okay. In the fourth quarter, your receivable balance was higher than it was in the first quarter, and your other operating income was not up?","Ronald Ristau","I\u2019d more think about it relative to \u2013 the fourth quarter and the first quarter are little bit disconnected if you\u2019ll in the short. The first quarter is go-forward, which is \u2026","Jennifer Davis - Lazard Capital Markets","Okay.","Ronald Ristau","\u2026 you should think about the go-forward.","Jennifer Davis - Lazard Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thanks. And I\u2019m sorry, last one, can you talk a little bit about maybe how many new customers you acquire this quarter, do you\u2019ve that information, maybe you\u2019ve like how many customers or new customers you got through your credit card or something and how that compares to prior levels because obviously the question that I\u2019ve gotten a lot this morning already is if you\u2019re losing share to sales, so is there any \u2026","Ronald Ristau","First of all, look at the relative size of the businesses, we\u2019re not losing anything to sales and take a look at the result of the Mother\u2019s Day results versus what was released yesterday and I think we can decide whether or not we\u2019re losing any share to sales in the macro environment. We don\u2019t specifically give those numbers, but I\u2019ll tell you that most of our customers all the time are new customers because again jewelry is relatively infrequent purchase and we\u2019re constantly drawing new customers into our base in order to make our numbers. So that\u2019s about far as we can go as far as giving information.","Michael Barnes","The other thing I\u2019d draw in there, Jen, for just kind of reemphasize what Ron is talking about, again, I\u2019d say there were so many moving parts between these quarters, and the promotions that we run may not be comparable to the promotions that other competitors run that we\u2019re up against in the marketplace. It\u2019s hard to do that when you\u2019ve all these different things moving around.","And the level of promotion, the level of customer interaction etcetera is making difference making various competitors out there of ours. But again, Ron pointed out, take a look, we feel very strong about the great results that we saw month-to-date through Mother\u2019s Day, which were very impressive comp sale numbers for us I believe \u2026","Jennifer Davis - Lazard Capital Markets","It was up 21%, right?","Michael Barnes","Yeah, 21% and even if you adjust for the shift, it was still up 9% ...","Jennifer Davis - Lazard Capital Markets","Right.","Michael Barnes","\u2026 on double-digits last year. So, you might want to compare those numbers out to what the other competitors out there are doing. The other thing I\u2019d like to really say to that is we\u2019re very excited about all of the merchandising activities and the new merchandise that we\u2019re driving out there.","Now, as we mentioned on the last call, we\u2019ve a lot of multiple merchandise programs in test right now. And quite frankly, I\u2019m very pleased to say that several of these tests have had very good results and we\u2019re going to begin rolling those out a lot more during the second quarter more than doubling the number of doors they\u2019re in, and by the end of the second quarter there will be hundreds of doors, several hundred doors.","I really don\u2019t want to go into more detail about what those programs are until we begin that role because I\u2019d like to keep the details quiet for competitive reasons, but I\u2019d love to take that further a little bit later on. That\u2019s a couple of programs. We\u2019ve several other ones that are in earlier stages of testing that are also so far doing very well. Now, its early days on those, and we\u2019ll stay tune, we\u2019ll see what happens and we\u2019ll update you on that as well.","And finally, I\u2019d just say there are some existing things going out there that we think are going to really help us out especially in the back-half of the year with existing programs. Our Tolkowsky Ideal Cut Solitaire program, that\u2019s a really good example, rolled into the final \u2013 well, it\u2019s going to be rolled this quarter into the final 194 Kay doors, that\u2019s going to make an all-door program. It\u2019s done very well for us and we\u2019re very excited about it.","And then finally, Jane Seymour, one of our premier exclusive brands, we\u2019re working on some very exciting innovations for that brand, it\u2019s been around for a few years now that\u2019s going further expand the success that we\u2019ve seen there. We\u2019ve got great new designs going into that. We\u2019ve -- we\u2019re extending the Open Hearts to a new collection called the Family Collection and it\u2019s really I think going to be a fabulous program. We\u2019re actually going to expand that by another 250 doors as soon as possible.","So, there is a lot of exciting things going on out there. We think our comp store sales are \u2013 we know that they\u2019re inline with the guidance that we\u2019ve given and we think that they\u2019re very encouraging for the rest of the year. And with all the stuff going on, we really think like we\u2019re well positioned to hit all of our objectives for the full-year.","Jennifer Davis - Lazard Capital Markets","All right, great. Thanks and best of luck.","Ronald Ristau","One last point I\u2019d make on that, Jennifer, just to follow-up one last time is that, if you recall when we had our original year-end conference call, we estimated that the calendar shift will be worth about $25 million based on what happened in the previous year and the actual numbers I just pointed out you again turn out to be more like $32 million than $25 million when we actually, when the dust settled and did the calculation. So that calendar shift is a little bigger than what we first thought.","Jennifer Davis - Lazard Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Rick Patel from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Rick Patel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Comps at Jared seem to decelerate more than comps at Kay during the quarter, and can you kind of just put that into context for us, is that business just a little bit more sensitive to Mother\u2019s Day than Kay or do you see the higher income customers showing somewhat greater caution with the repurchases?","Michael Barnes","Yeah, sure. There are \u2013 as I said, there is lot of moving parts, some of them have to do with the various brand opportunities that we\u2019ve right now. As you know, some of the brands are in Kay, some of the brands are in Jared, and some of them are in both. And right now, some of the successes that we\u2019re seeing happen to be more of Kay type brands, we\u2019ve seen Tolkowsky has been very strong as I just mentioned. Charmed Memories also did very well, and both of those are only available in Kay at this point.","And then there is also another impact in Jared where \u2013 with the exit of Rolex, there is an impact on sales there as well.","Rick Patel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then can you talk about performance of the bridal jewelry category versus last year? Is Neil Lane still continuing to hold up pretty well? And any new initiatives that are planned on that side of business given there is no major shopping catalyst into the holiday now?","Michael Barnes","Yeah, the bridal category continues to be very strong for us. It continues to be about the same amount of the mix out there. The Neil Lane Bridal has been a great program for us as you know; Tolkowsky, I mentioned, has done well and our bridal, in general, has done extremely well. So we feel very good about where we\u2019re going with bridal, as you probably know that was a huge emphasis for us last year. We did a lot of development and training, which we consider to be a very core competitive strength for us with our associates and our managers on bridal, and we\u2019re going to continue to do that because we see the effects that it had.","Rick Patel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Great. And then just lastly, can you provide some color on how you expect product costs to trend versus the first quarter? Do you expect the percentage increase versus last year to increase, decrease or stay the same as we think about the second quarter and the back half?","Ronald Ristau","Well, I will talk to you about our annual statements that we made about gross margin. We said for the year we expect to maintain our gross margin rate while offsetting commodity costs that are roughly comparable to what it was in the previous year, we will still stick with that statement.","There are some fluctuations by quarter because it's a little complex as I mentioned in the second quarter. There is a little bit of an impact because of the consolidation of the total Mother's Day program in the second quarter that wouldn\u2019t be in some of your historical models. But there is nothing that\u2019s really materially different other than the fact that we have the slight margin pressures in the U.K., which will continue in the second quarter. And as Mike pointed out in his comments, we would expect for the year right now that there will be some gross margin pressure in the U.K., which will continue through the year and may lead to lower than last year results.","Rick Patel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Given the diamond costs have sort of trended down since last summer, do you expect it to be a gross margin tailwind by the time we exit the year?","Ronald Ristau","I think we have to see how it develops over time. I would think that again which our model is a slow turn model that changes in prices unless long-term is sustained over long periods of time, tend have de minimis impact on any one fiscal current year. So changes in diamond cost that would occur more than likely would impact future periods as to \u2013 oppose to having a major impact this year. That said, it could have a small impact, but I wouldn't call it out as something that would be material in this year.","Rick Patel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Great. Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Michael Barnes","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take a question from Ike Boruchow from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ike Boruchow - JPMorgan","Hey, guys. Congrats on a good quarter.","Michael Barnes","Thank you.","Ike Boruchow - JPMorgan","Just couple of quick questions. I guess, first on the credit side of the business, Ron in this quarter can you just help us understand a little bit better, so this one-time kind of issue with the credit billing, it looks that it kind of hurt your consolidated gross margins by roughly 50 or 60 basis points? Is that correct? Are you kind of saying to take that 50 to 60 basis points and put it into Q4, so we should basically have roughly 50 bps of margin opportunity in Q4 just from the shift?","Ronald Ristau","Let me make sure, you\u2019re clear on this. Number one, it did have an impact of $4.7 million in the first quarter on the gross margin number. When we get the benefit back, it will come not in gross margin, but it will come in other operating income in the fourth quarter, so the way this will work, it\u2019s just there is a first time \u2013 there is a expense in the first quarter and a benefit in the fourth quarter that are on mismatched lines, right.","Ike Boruchow - JPMorgan","Okay.","Ronald Ristau","Okay. And then this adjustment is like it\u2019s forever embedded in our model. It will never adjust again. So when you look into 2014 versus 2013, this effect will no longer \u2013 it will be nothing, it will just be like resetting the way close by quarter in both of those lines. But I would stick with the broad statement that the gross merchandise margin we expect to be broadly similar across the full-year, okay, implicit in that if we\u2019re having some discussion in the U.K. with some margin pressures would mean that we\u2019re implicitly assuming that margins in the U.S. would be a touch better, but the two will attempt to offset.","Ike Boruchow - JPMorgan","Okay, great. Also I guess there is a lot of noise, the Mother's Day shift and just to try to avoid more noise for the next quarter in Q3 you guys do lap that one-time the Rolex sale that went on, can you kind of just remind us again last year how much that helped your comps and when we start building our models for Q3, how should we be thinking about comps? I mean it would seem likely that the comp should decelerate from Q2, but the margins could also accelerate [axing] that shift out, could you just give us some color there?","Ronald Ristau","Yes. That\u2019s a very good question and thank you for asking it because the timing shifts can be somewhat confusing. In the third quarter last year, just to remind everyone, we had about a \u2013 in the Jared business about an 8% gain in the comp in Jared in that quarter because of the fact that we\u2019re liquidating some Rolex products as a result of this discontinuation of the line in the stores. That generated a benefit in the third quarter last year approximately $15 million, which we will be up against when we come through this year and that will be of course trying to offset that, but it is a headwind for us moving into the third quarter and the third quarter from a gift-giving perspective is always our most difficult quarter. There is not much activity going on in the market.","Traditionally the third quarter margins are always lower than they\u2019re in the second quarter and first quarter, and you can study that by looking at the historical trend. We would expect that historical trend on a relative sequential quarter basis in the third quarter to be probably somewhat similar to what it's been historically, okay.","I think we will stay with the comment on the full-year that the margins will include. And there is a comment I noted from an analyst someone yesterday, I just want to make sure everyone is clear on. There is this 53rd week and when we gave our year-end or our annual statement about guidance in our year-end release, we\u2019ve indicated that during the 53rd week, we believe that we would recognize incremental sales of between $48 million and $52 million and that the 53rd week would represent an operating loss of $2 million to $4 million because of the way that Valentine\u2019s Day moves within 53rd week.","So, we will incur some advertising costs in the 53rd week and sales shift into the first quarter of next year 2014. I\u2019d point out that sales in that week will represent negative comps, so that the 53rd week it causes a suppression versus the 52-week comp when you think about how to build your model. It\u2019s not a positive from a comp perspective that we have those additional sales flowing in.","So, again the 53rd week would be $48 million to $52 million, a slightly negative comp during that week and a loss of $2 million to $4 million just to reiterate what we said in our previous annual guidance. So, I hope that\u2019s helpful to you in thinking about the way the quarters flow.","Ike Boruchow \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. It\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, Ron. And then, I guess, one last one, I guess for Mike on higher level of view of the business. You came in to this year at around an all-time high margin, around 13.5%, excluding the credit shift in Q1, your operating margins were up almost 150 basis points, which is pretty phenomenal. How do you view operating margins down over the next year or three or five years as this business has clearly changed and structural changes that are kind of going on within the specialty jewelry market?","Michael Barnes","Sure and thanks for asking me that question instead of Ron because you knew I would probably give a different answer, right? But seriously, we\u2019re very pleased with our operating margins and as you know growing profitable market share has been our long-term goal. We don\u2019t have an exact target on that, but we don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve hit a ceiling.","We think that there is still is operating margin expansion available to us quite frankly over the long-term and we\u2019re focused on continuing to grow our sales in our operating margins both over the long-term. So, it\u2019s something that we believe is sustainable for us. We believe that with the productivity that we can gain from our stores and with the excellence and executions that our teams do out there, that we still have an opportunity to continue to gain operating margin.","So, the short answer I guess would be, we don\u2019t feel like we have hit a ceiling yet and that there are still opportunity in front of us.","Ronald Ristau","The only thing that I will add to Mike\u2019s comment is that, we would expect as we\u2019re indicating here that in the U.K. most likely as we look to this year, there will be a slight decline in operating margins. When we look forward into the future, we believe we\u2019re positioning the business to start to reverse that trend as we look out into 2014 and \u201915. So, we would not \u2013 we do not find that situation acceptable. And we will be working hard to with our U.K. team as we try to readjust the business to the realities of the economics in those markets.","Ike Boruchow \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. Great. Good luck guys.","Michael Barnes","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Stein from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research","Good morning, Mike and Ron. Question for you just on the U.K., getting back to the U.K. business for a minute, I mean, philosophically, Signet has always kind of taken the position that they\u2019re going to protect gross margin, merchandized margin first, on the basis that demand for jewelry is relatively pricing elastic. And I am wondering, is this a change in philosophy or does the U.K. customer perhaps, behave differently than the U.S. customer?","Ronald Ristau","It's not a change in philosophy. What it is a recognition of the reality of what is going on in the U.K. market and the challenges from a disposable income perspective that people are having in the U.K. to find the disposable income necessary. So what we have to do there is understand \u2013 we could do two things, we could just continue to increase prices in the U.K., which we don\u2019t believe would work and we believe we would sacrifice market share because literally people are very challenged over trying to stay in concert with what's going on with our consumers. So the U.K. consumer is behaving little differently.","This pressure has been going on for a while, it just seems to be accelerating a little bit this year due to the conditions that we find ourselves in. So, our decision is to go for market share in U.K. and not to just continually price because we do believe the consumer is challenged and we need to have product for that consumer that is appropriately priced for what the consumer needs and that\u2019s what we believe is the right strategy in the U.K. and we\u2019re going to follow it because the other \u2013 we believe it would be worse if we did the alternative.","Michael Barnes","Well, and just one other comment just to make sure we\u2019re fully level set there, it is not a change in philosophy as Ron just said absolutely and by the way we do continue to price in the U.K. and increase prices in the U.K. as appropriate. So that hasn\u2019t changed either, but as Ron mentioned earlier in the call, the consumer themselves, they\u2019re self-selecting more of the promotional goods, and yes we do have the appropriate level of promotional goods out there for them to select from.","So, we have our normalized price increases as we normally would execute them and we have our promotional goods and maybe a few more of them based upon the market as it sits today, but at the end of the day it\u2019s the consumer that\u2019s choosing the mix of what they buy, and they\u2019re bargain hunting still in the U.K., and so that puts pressure out there.","What we won\u2019t do is we won\u2019t raise our prices more than we should. We will raise them appropriately, but we won\u2019t raise them more than we should to offset that promotional mindset of the consumer and therefore it is the pressure on gross merchandise margins a little bit, but we feel like it puts us in the right position in the right competitive place to best execute our business model and set ourselves up for the back half of the year and in the long-term.","Ronald Ristau","And as Mike indicated, we\u2019re significantly outperforming from a comp perspective, the British Retail Consortium numbers, so we are very pleased with how we\u2019re positioning ourselves in that market because we would not want to be having an alternative of significant comp drops.","Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research","Mike, in the U.S. how is the U.S. customer behaving with regard to making similar choices? In other words, what are they selecting right now in the stores? Are they going for the regular price merchandise or the promotional merchandise and is the mix changing very much year-on-year?","Michael Barnes","Well, I would say the U.S. consumer has a little bit of a different mindset and that they\u2019re not overly choosing the promotional merchandise and not overly bargain hunting. In the U.S. really the consumer seems to be focused on newness, design, and innovation. If you give them a reason to buy something, they will buy it. They want something different and they're being very picky about what they chose, but if you have great brands and great designs such as we have, then they\u2019re willing to step up and pay for it.","In fact, some of the better selling merchandise that we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. has not been anywhere near opening price point, much less promotional. Some of it has been very strong price point type merchandise and it\u2019s because of the innovation in the fashion and the design.","Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research","Okay and final question, the regional brands. What happened there? I mean we\u2019ve done some research in terms of calling independent jewelers and the vast majority of them indicated that they had a fairly good Mother\u2019s Day, and I\u2019m looking at your regional brands and you guys were down year-on-year. What accounted for the sharp decline? I know advertising is a big delta, but we\u2019re still hearing that independents are doing pretty well. It sounds like your regionals are underperforming independents?","Ronald Ristau","No. I wouldn\u2019t say that. During Mother\u2019s Day, our regionals were \u2013 they had very good results up. Remember, Mother\u2019s Day for us was included in our second quarter result and included in the numbers that what Mike was quoting for the U.S. division of 21% year-to-date in May, that includes the regional. So the regionals are in there and Mother\u2019s Day was strong in the regionals, not as strong as it is in Kay and Jared because it never is, but they did have a good Mother\u2019s Day.","Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.","Ronald Ristau","(Indiscernible) did not have a good Mother\u2019s Day.","Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Anthony Lebiedzinski from Sidoti. Please go ahead.","Anthony Lebiedzinski - Sidoti & Co.","Yes, good morning. First question is on the U.K., could you tell us what the same-store sales are quarter-to-date? So far you gave us the U.S. number and also Mike you had mentioned in your opening remarks that you\u2019re going to be testing some new products in U.K., so I was wondering, if you could give us some color on that?","Michael Barnes","Well, on the new products, I will talk to that. We are testing some new things. We are not really in a position yet to talk about what they\u2019re, but we\u2019ve just like in the U.S., we have a number of merchandise initiatives underway in the U.K. and a lot of those positive comp store sales are being driven by new merchandise, but again until we roll that out we don\u2019t want to speak more specifically about which ones they\u2019re.","Some of them I could talk too, because they\u2019re the same as the U.S. and they\u2019ve been underway for a while. I had mentioned Tolkowsky a couple of times. It\u2019s been a successful program not only in the U.S., we also have leveraged the fashion business of Le Vian for instance, into the U.K. and that\u2019s an opportunity for further growth for us there. So, there is a lot of exciting things happening on the merchandising side in the U.K. In terms of comps, Ron?","Ronald Ristau","It\u2019s U.K. business, so we didn\u2019t disclose because there is no Mother's Day impact on the U.K., but the comps in the first quarter were in that one \u2013 a little better than 1% range and we\u2019re seeing like more or less a continuation of that trend in the May timeframes.","Anthony Lebiedzinski - Sidoti & Co.","Okay. Thanks for that. And also on your last conference call in March, you talked about investing in your supply chain, you gave a number of $5 million to $7 million for the year. Was there any impact from that in the first quarter and also \u2013 and if so could you quantify that and also can you talk about like what you expect to gain from that initiative?","Ronald Ristau","Number one, there was no significant impact in the first quarter. That activity will be more towards the third and fourth quarters of the year and it\u2019s included in our statements about gross margin and how we think it will be covered. So, it\u2019s in our numbers and will be largely offset as we go through the year. What we expect to gain, it\u2019s a variety of things, and I will let Mike speak to that, but strengthening the supply chain is important to us.","Michael Barnes","Yeah, as we talked about, our supply chain is so important to us and we\u2019re working very diligently to improve the relationships, build partnerships, both improve existing ones and build new partnerships in ways that are going to benefit us for many years to come, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re working internationally on this. We\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019ve always had a strong supply chain and we keep a lot of boots on the ground in a lot of the places where the business is being done. Be it places such as Antwerp or in India in Mumbai, but we think by having a stronger presence in some of these areas that it will benefit us and as we do \u2013 as Ron said, there was no significant impact in the first quarter, but as we do continue to invest in our supply chain and we do see where that investment is going then we will further quantify that for you in the future.","Anthony Lebiedzinski - Sidoti & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jessica Schoen from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jessica Schoen - Barclays Capital","Good morning, everyone.","Michael Barnes","Good morning.","Ronald Ristau","Good morning.","Jessica Schoen - Barclays Capital","I had a question about the traffic trends in the U.S., I was wondering if you could give a little color maybe about how they differed between your on-mall locations and your off-mall. I understand that the shift in Mother\u2019s Day may cause a little bit of noise, but just generally how they compared during the more comparable parts of the quarter?","Ronald Ristau","I guess you could definitely answer that question by looking at what happened to results. Our online sales were up 27% in the first quarter, which we thought was very strong. We continued with that initiative. We continue to see increases in traffic and all traffic measurements and site visitors, time on site, conversion and so on are all very favorable.","In the stores the traffic trends tended to follow what happened with comps, so the traffic trends in the first quarter were very strong during Valentine\u2019s Day, a little bit softer in March and April and very, very strong on Mother\u2019s Day.","Jessica Schoen - Barclays Capital","Okay. And then as far as the progress on the capital investment that you\u2019re planning to make for the year, could you remind us of anything you said about the cadence of that capital investment as well as when you expect to see that potential benefit?","Ronald Ristau","Well, the cadence of it, our capital spending always tend to get a little more skewed towards the second half of the year than the first half of the year just because of the way we bring projects online, and \u2013 but not significant change, we\u2019re still expecting to spend between $145 million to $165 million in that regard. And just as a side note, we probably still expect to be well over $200 million in free cash flow for the year.","So you\u2019re asking how much we\u2019re going to spend by quarter, I don\u2019t think we ever disclosed that. But I would say look to our pattern of past years and how capital spending for the year has broken out by quarter and it probably will follow a similar trend to prior years.","Jessica Schoen - Barclays Capital","Okay. Thanks very much for taking my questions.","Ronald Ristau","That\u2019s (indiscernible). You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","We have now a question from Susan Sansbury from Miller Tabak. Please go ahead.","Susan Sansbury - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Going back to the U.K., would you be willing to share, what your plan is with respect to the level of losses for the year, you have been very specific. We know what the first quarter was. Will you be even very specific about the second quarter?","Ronald Ristau","I\u2019m sorry, let me be clear. We do not expect \u2013 I am sorry for being \u2013 for not being clear about this. We expect to be lower than last year in the U.K. most likely based on what\u2019s happened, but we do not expect losses in the U.K. The U.K. is always orientated towards being a fourth quarter business with holiday being a key driver of profitability. So, we made very good money, our operating profit rate was about 7.8% last year in the U.K. and we will make money in the U.K.","We might not make at the same rate that we did last year because of some of these headwinds we\u2019re facing, but we will be profitable and the U.K. will be a good strong profit contributor and cash contributor to our overall corporation. So don\u2019t want to mislead you in any regard there.","And as for the future, there are some actions that we wouldn\u2019t choose to get into in a lot of detail because of the complexity of execution in the U.K. market.","Michael Barnes","I will just add to Ron\u2019s comment on that. We were very pleased with last year\u2019s overall result, making 7.8% operating income, which was a number in the U.K. that a lot of companies would have signed up for immediately. We are just \u2013 we are toughest on ourselves and we expect to do better than we\u2019re doing currently, but it\u2019s still going to be very profitable and a cash flowing business for us and we\u2019re very pleased with the direction that we\u2019re moving in and the investments that we\u2019re making, because we think that that what we're doing is we\u2019re really securing the business for long-term market share gains and we\u2019re still very excited about it. And a lot of the new stores that we\u2019ve opened up there in some of these big, powerful regional centers have performed, they continue to perform extremely well.","So, there is still a lot of huge opportunity in the U.K. and it will be a very profitable business for us this year. We are just up against a bit of a headwind right now.","Ronald Ristau","The U.K. is all about Christmas. Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, okay, and as Mike said in his comments, we\u2019re focusing on testing new merchandise, staff training and planning for Christmas, which is why we\u2019re encouraged to see the positive comps developing in the U.K. because we want to make sure that we have the merchandise mix that people want when we move into the Christmas season because that\u2019s where we earn virtually a 100% of our profit in the fourth quarter.","So, the better job we can do of getting said, getting the merchandise tested, ironing out all those issues as we move through the second and third \u2013 first, second and third quarter, the stronger Christmas potentially that we can have and that\u2019s what the ballgame is in the U.K.","Susan Sansbury - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC","I apologize for my I guess inappropriate choice of words, but \u2026","Ronald Ristau","No, I just want to make sure I was unclear because we don\u2019t want to \u2013 we are running a little bit lower losses in first and second quarter or more greater losses, but we do not expect and I want to make sure on the calls clear, we do not expect losses in the U.K. division for the full-year, this year.","Susan Sansbury - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC","Okay. But you \u2013 there is a Plan B in the event that all hell breaks loose, we cannot control \u2013 what you can control, everybody is \u2013 I think everybody is comfortable with, but is there a Plan B?","Michael Barnes","Absolutely. You know we realize that anything can happen at any time and things can suddenly break loose and that\u2019s why we focus intently on the details of the business and how we manage our expenses and how we manage our investments. We are always prepared to react to whatever the macro environment throws at us and we think that we can do it quickly, we think that we can do it as effectively as possible depending on exactly what that might be. If a black swan were to hit and things were to change dramatically, we would absolutely react.","And even in today's very tough economic environment in the U.K., we are looking very closely at how we manage our business and we will always continue to appropriately invest in the future and invest in new merchandise and invest in our stores and our people and training, but we\u2019re watching the expenses very carefully, we're looking at ways that we can address what the environment is that we\u2019re operating in today and we have a long-term plan for a lot of success in the U.K. and to see some of the short-term maybe lower operating profits that we discuss coming back up again.","Susan Sansbury - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC","Okay.","Ronald Ristau","And we also \u2013 I guess we\u2019re voting like the debate in Europe. We vote for growth with expense control in the U.K. because we can\u2019t save ourselves to prosperity in the U.K. business.","Susan Sansbury - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC","Okay. Two other quickie questions. Ron, you know I am new to the story and I don\u2019t know if the next questions you can answer or will share \u2026","Ronald Ristau","Sure, I will try.","Susan Sansbury - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC","\u2026 on the call, but inventory plan for the end of the second quarter and the year?","Ronald Ristau","Well, we expect our inventories \u2013 we\u2019re in the inventory is very interesting because we do face the issue of commodity inflation. So, with the same or even lower unit inventory, our inventories will go up just because gold and diamond prices on average will be going up. So we're up at about 9% in the end of the first quarter about $20 million of the increase is just because the build from Mother\u2019s Day is in the inventory. If you will, and that didn\u2019t take \u2013 didn\u2019t come down until the Mother\u2019s Day sales occurred in the second quarter. But I would expect our inventories will be up in that 7% to 9% range as we go across the year, driven by this commodity inflation.","I would point out that embedded in that number where you cannot see is that we continue to improve our underlying turn to try to offset some of the commodity inflation that we have to deal with. So operationally we continue to get better and better in inventory. Our inventories have never been cleaner and more current. We actually from an operating perspective, one of the issues we have is that we don\u2019t have any clearance inventory in order to drive some sales in the stores, but that\u2019s a high class problem and we will take it every time.","Susan Sansbury - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC","Okay. There was some mention in the 10-Q about some specific initiatives with respect to inventory. There was a reference I guess you\u2019re protecting \u2013 anyway never mind, I will ask you later. In terms of share repurchase your stock off \u2013 opened up down 10, now it\u2019s down seven you bought in at $46. Any comment about your attitude or position with respect to this authorization currently?","Michael Barnes","Well, we \u2013 as we said, we executed a lot of the stock buyback approximately a third of it during the first quarter. They had a two year authorization on it. So, we think that we appropriately and effectively went to the marketplace and executed the buyback. The program is still ongoing as you know and we will continue to appropriately execute it as we see it fit going forward, but we don\u2019t really get into any details of what that plan of buying is or how or exactly when because we think it would be inappropriate.","Susan Sansbury - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC","Okay. No problem. I appreciate it. Thanks ever so much. Good luck. You\u2019re doing a great job.","Michael Barnes","Thank you.","Ronald Ristau","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Rod Whitehead from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rodney Whitehead - Deutsche Bank","Hi, there. It\u2019s quite clear that you\u2019ve somewhat underperformed sales in Q1, but you\u2019ve significantly outperformed them in Q2 at least over the key Mother\u2019s Day period. Do you feel that because you shift the advertising and annual business has had a bigger focus on the main event Mother\u2019s Day and perhaps less in the lower period and overall, are you kind of happy with that the way that\u2019s come out?","And the second question, just on exclusive products of those. What kind of growth rate have they seen in Q1? And you said there is a number of initiatives that you weren\u2019t going to mention, and then you mentioned a few things that are being further rolled out. Where those the ones you aren\u2019t going to mention or are there other ones that you haven\u2019t mentioned?","Michael Barnes","Let me \u2013 I will clarify that for you, Rod. To start up with your opening comment, I\u2019m going to assume that you\u2019re talking about sales when you say that we underperformed anybody out there on the competitive marketplace. But the reality is \u2013 yeah, the reality is that, we knew that we were going to have low single-digit comps in the first quarter, that's why we were so clear about that. We wanted to make sure everybody understood that.","Every company has different cadence to the programs that they run, the promotions that they run, how they do it, when they time it, which weeks they do certain things, et cetera. We know what ours is, and so we knew where we were going to come in during the quarter and that\u2019s where we came in, and we managed everything appropriately because we wanted to make sure that the comps that we did have were extremely profitable and well-managed. And when you said record earnings for Q1, we think that we did a very good job of doing that and then as you saw very strong going into Mother\u2019s Day with the month-to-date sales extremely strong 21% or 9% minus the shift and it \u2013 I have to say it worked out pretty much as we expected it to and as we laid it out.","So, we feel very good about where our business is at right now, and our ability to execute the remainder of the year the way that we have planned it. So in this environment, we feel extremely good that we can meet all of our objectives for this year. So, I'm very happy about that, number one.","Number two, on the merchandising items, yes I mean, this is what\u2019s exciting, is that I mentioned that we\u2019re going to finish the rollout of Tolkowsky Ideal Cut solitaires into Kay, which is great, and I mentioned that we have some exciting new innovative things going on with Jane Seymour with the family collection and then we\u2019re going to be rolling into another 250 doors with that.","So those are fairly new things out there, the family collection being extremely new and there are very exciting opportunities for us for the back of the year and beyond. But to your point, I did talk about a lot of things here, and I'm sorry if I confused anyone with it. We have a lot more tests going on and there is a couple of those that I will not mention by name, aside from the ones that I did, that we are rolling into several hundred doors by the end of the second quarter. We will be in several hundred doors with each of those, but until I get that rollout out there, I would like to keep what\u2019s working for us a little bit competitively to ourselves and then even beyond those that we\u2019re already extending the rollout on there is some even newer tests going on that we haven\u2019t made any decisions on yet, but they\u2019re testing well. It\u2019s a short period of time and its early days.","And as I said stay tuned and we will talk more about that, but the merchandising initiatives are very exciting. We think we are well prepared for the back half of the year. The first quarter came out about as we expected based on our own individual promotions and how we run them and how we time them. We came into Mother\u2019s Day very strongly and have done well month-to-date and we think we are well prepared.","Rodney Whitehead - Deutsche Bank","Right.","Ronald Ristau","In the way our testing calendar run, just to follow-up on Rod is that, our testing usually continues Valentine\u2019s Day first, second quarters and we tend to roll much more product into the third and fourth quarters of the year. So that\u2019s just is the way our normal cadence run. So, we look forward to a good second half.","Rodney Whitehead - Deutsche Bank","Thank you very much.","Michael Barnes","Thank you, Rod.","Operator","Our last question is coming from James Pan from CP&E Partners. Please go ahead.","James Pan - CP&E Partners","Hi, gentlemen. A question about the U.K., you said that basically the \u2013 correct me if I\u2019m wrong, that the issues are cynical there because of the, I guess the recessionary environment in the U.K. Can you give more background on what\u2019s happening to the square footage of the industry? In other words, what we benefit from this pain in the U.K., on the other end, if and when the U.K. economy improves just like we did in the U.S. four years ago?","Ronald Ristau","Let me try to address and make sure I understood your question. So, first I\u2019m going to ask is what\u2019s going on \u2013 I thought you\u2019re asking is a little bit about what\u2019s going on with stores in the U.K.?","James Pan - CP&E Partners","Yes. basically I\u2019m asking \u2026","Ronald Ristau","What's happening in the U.K. from an overall perspective is that sales continue to shift into the powerful regional, mall, centers and away from high street locations with the exception of London. So when we look out into the U.K., what we see is that, number one, we\u2019re closing and we expect to close this year around 26 stores in H. Samuel and Ernest Jones combined, okay in the U.K. So, we will be experiencing some slight space decline in the market of about 3% in the U.K. market, okay, as opposed to about 3% growth in the U.S. market. And we would \u2013 that\u2019s a trend that we continue to be working with our U.K. business because there are stores and as the customer patterns of shopping are shifting around, some of the real estate is becoming less desirable and some of the real estate is becoming more desirable. So, we\u2019re following those trends from a consumer perspective in the U.K. and that\u2019s a little bit different than the U.S. because obviously the boom into regional shopping malls in the U.S. happened many, many years ago. So, that trend is continuing.","We also continue in the U.K. to negotiate very productively with our landlords in some of these spaces to make sure that the rents that we\u2019re paying reflect the economic values of the property as that continues to shift or we\u2019re exiting properties. So, that program will continue over a number of years in the U.K. Does that answer your first part of that question?","James Pan - CP&E Partners","What I\u2019m really getting into is market share. Do you expect that after \u2013 when and if the U.K. economy normalize, do you expect it to have materially more market share or about the same or less market share than we do in the U.K. at this point?","Ronald Ristau","More market share because what we see is that we\u2019re not the only people closing stores in the U.K., the whole market is, the retail space is constricted, okay. But what\u2019s happening is as the space constricts is that the powerful stores are picking up the volume if you understand what I\u2019m saying, okay. So that market share \u2013 from the measurements of market share that we see, we would expect our market share to increase over time.","James Pan - CP&E Partners","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call over back to Mr. Mike Barnes for any closing or additional remarks.","Michael Barnes","Okay. Thank you, operator. I\u2019d like to thank all of you for taking part in the call. Our next scheduled call is on August 23rd, when we will review our second quarter results. So, thank you again and have a great day.","Ronald Ristau","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That will now conclude today\u2019s conference call.

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded today, March 14, 2018 at 8:00 AM Eastern Time.","I would now like to turn the meeting over to your host for today\u2019s call, James Grant, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, James.","James Grant","Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. On our call today are Signet\u2019s CEO, Gina Drosos; and CFO, Michele Santana. The presentation slide that we will be referencing is available under the Investors section of our website, signetjewelers.com.","During today\u2019s presentation, we will in places make certain forward-looking statements. Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. We urge you to read the risk factors, cautionary language and other disclosures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form10-Q. And we also draw your attention to Slide number 2 in today\u2019s presentation for additional information about forward-looking statements. And initially we ask that your limit your questions to two so that we are able to take as many questions as possible.","With that I will turn it over to Gina.","Gina Drosos","Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. Today, Michele and I will discuss Signet\u2019s fourth quarter and full year results, including the issues that developed following our credit outsourcing transaction and related operational challenges. We will also discuss Signet\u2019s comprehensive three year company-wide plan to reinvigorate Signet and transform the company to be share gaining, OmniChannel, jewelry category leader. We will then open the line for your questions.","As a member of the Signet Board since 2012, I developed an appreciation for the fundamental strength of Signet\u2019s business, outstanding team members and attractive market opportunities. Since becoming CEO seven months ago, I have taken a look at the business through a new lens diving deeply in to our operating plan details, demand creation capabilities and cost structure.","As a result I obtained a much greater insight in to Signet\u2019s operations and enhanced my understanding of the opportunities for Signet moving forward, and what needs to be done to position the company for improved performance.","It is clear that Signet is working from a strong foundation. The company continues to be the market share leader in North America in a large growing and highly fragmented category, with the opportunity for additional share gains as we leverage our scale in innovation, marketing and procurement.","We have a good balance between a steady bridal business, a fashion-gifting and self-purchasing business and a design, repair and maintenance business which continues to drive traffic to our stores after a purchase has been made.","Additionally, our bridal and anniversary businesses involve big ticket items that are purchased infrequently and often after careful deliberation with the assistance of knowledgeable trusted sales professional. And overall our store footprint is highly strategically placed as we improve our e-commerce and especially our mobile capabilities; the jewelry category gives us an opportunity to use our stores as a key advantage to provide customers with a superior OmniChannel experience.","We plan to build on this foundation, as we aspire to be the preferred authority and destination for jewelry products for bridal occasions, fashion and gift occasions, custom design and jewelry repair and maintenance services.","But before we can fully achieve this objective, we have some immediate challenges to address. These include the operational issues associated with the outsourcing of our prime credit business as we need to transform our business to invest in growth initiatives while lowering our cost structure and repositioning our real estate portfolio.","As you know we completed the first phase of our credit outsourcing plan in October, when we sold Kay and Jared\u2019s prime receivables to ADS for $950 million and outsourced servicing of our non-prime receivables to Genesis. Today we are pleased to announce the final phase with a signing of a multi-year agreement with investment funds managed by CarVal Investors to purchase our book of non-prime receivables. Michelle will cover these transactions in more detail shortly.","When it closes, this credit transaction will complete Signet\u2019s transition to a full outsourced credit structure, while maintaining a full spectrum of category leading, financing and leasing options for customers. Together these transactions are expected to significantly reduce consumer credit risk on our balance sheet, reduce our working capital needs and enable us to focus squarely on our core retail business.","Importantly, these transactions also enable us to continue to return significant capital to shareholders. At the completion of Signet\u2019s transition to a fully outsourced credit model, we expect that the credit transactions will have generated more than $1.3 billion in proceeds, which are being used for debt repayment in significant share repurchases.","From a combination of available cash and proceeds from the credit transactions subject to market conditions, we expect to repurchase approximately one quarter of Signet\u2019s shares outstanding. For all of these reasons, I am confident that these transactions will prove to be very beneficial to the company over the long term. However, the transition of the credit function to an outsourced model has led to operational issues that significantly impacted our same store sales.","We are making steady progress fixing these issues and have seen some signs of improvement in credit participation and application volumes in February versus fourth quarter trends, although still below prior levels. We do continue to expect a transition to be a headwind during fiscal year 2019, as we work through change management in the stores.","The credit transition was not the only challenge we faced last year. As I conducted my deep dive review of our operations and strategy, it became clear that there are some additional operational issues that require attention. We did not invest fast enough in OmniChannel initiatives, particularly mobile and have been too slow to capture our fair share of the online channel both in terms of traffic and conversion.","We have had less effective product innovation success and did not invest enough in differentiated products. As product life cycles have shortened, our innovation pipeline has not been robust enough to offset a natural decline of some of our larger collections. Our banner brand equities have become less relevant and our in-store experience and communication platforms need updating.","Across banners we have relied too heavily on the promotional lever, which has incentivized customers to buy on deal and created a value perception problem in non-heavy promotional periods. And employee morale has suffered as we have experienced organizational change, headcount reductions, negative press, and complications from the outsourcing of credit.","These company operational issues have been exacerbated by several changes in the retail environment which we have been slow to respond to including declining mall traffic and shifts in customer buying behavior. The good news is many of our problems are fixable. We can and we will correct them. There are significant operational improvement opportunities at our disposal; capturing these opportunities allows us to stabilize and then start improving our results, while planning for and investing in the future.","We are disappointed in our fiscal 2019 outlook, but feel it is important to have this year as a transition year to kick-off our transformation plan. Signet path to brilliance is a three-year comprehensive transformation plan to reposition the company to be a share-gaining, OmniChannel, jewelry category leader. The plan is designed to increase our cost competitiveness by driving out cost customers do not see or care about, while enabling growth investment in our three key strategic priorities of customer first, OmniChannel and building a culture of agility and efficiency.","The growth priorities of the transformation plan are number one; as part of our customer first strategic priority, we are aggressively addressing customer relevance and value. Although Signet remains the category leader, we have not been leading category growth and have lost market share. We must become more customer-focused. There is a need to clearly differentiate our banners and drive higher brand equity, shift our advertising and media mix to be become more relevant, use analytics for actionable insight and provide and clear and compelling value proposition.","We are in the process of completing new brand positioning work, which is intended to clearly differentiate our banners with Kay, Zales and Jared effectively targeted to different customer segment with unique benefit propositions, reducing overlap, improving banner differentiation and increasing customer relevance will enable more effective merchandising, in-store experience and marketing.","The new banner positioning are built on deep data analytics and will be tested this year. We are also continuing to shift our media mix to digital to reach customers where they are with greater targeting, personalization and efficiency. Linear TV will remain a competitive advantage for our brands, but will no longer represent the majority of our spend.","We are augmenting our wealth of consumer data with access to new data to allow us to move beyond demographic and behavior marketing, which is focused on a limited number of customer characteristics to predictive modelling and trigger moment marketing, where hundreds or even thousands of characteristics are used in combination to find the shoppers most likely to respond.","We are also investing in data science expertise and new analytics tools to measure marketing impact at the individual level, setting the stage for in-flight optimization of campaigns to drive engagement by providing the information customers want next, whether that\u2019s diamond education or fashion inspiration. We can personalize content to meet their needs.","Disney Enchanted is a great early example of this, where we targeted Disney fans through activities reaching almost 600,000 customers at a very low cost, helping drive the strength of Zale\u2019s sales.","Finally, we are beginning to utilize the latest digital identification technology, enabling us to take the customer along their journey even if they switch devices, search for information on different websites or go in store.","To optimize our customer value equation, we are closely evaluating our pricing structure. Our historical model has been high-low at Kay and Zale\u2019s, with a reliance on promotions, which has made purchasing confusing for customers. We are evaluating our promotional spend, as well as conducting pricing studies with the goal of applying learnings to address price perception issues and identify areas where we have gaps.","At Jared, we have a less promotional model that are benchmarking our value equation and merchandise assortment. Any changes will be made thoughtfully with the goal of providing superior customer value and experience, while carefully managing the trade-off between sales growth and margins.","Innovation is also a top customer first priority to drive traffic and conversion in store and online. We think of innovation in two broad buckets, core and disruption and across several vectors including in product, experience, digital and delivery innovation. We are driving a renewed focus on core innovation with our newly formed banner teams and functions, which I\u2019ll discuss in a few minutes. These efforts are important in driving growth and are lower risk and faster to execute.","Our goal is to increase relevance and move quickly in this area, given that customer habits have changed and the life cycle of product is shorter requiring more continuous newness. For example, we have implemented new and faster idea screening approaches and vendor summit to increase effectiveness in new product design and launch.","To drive disruption innovation, Signet is launching a new innovation engine, our innovation engine team is responsible for idea generation, qualification, piloting and ultimately rolling out the best ideas across new product breakthroughs, experiences and business models. Our goal overtime is to drive a higher mix of disruptive innovations, which have the potential of being more incremental to sales.","For example, this team is currently piloting and optimizing a new digital innovation program in Jared stores, where we are making over 100,000 diamonds available to customers through a virtual diamond vault leveraging R2Net visualization and diamond market technology. Number two, OmniChannel and e-commerce initiatives, our aim is to develop best-in-class mobile shopping and a fully connected in-store and online experience. We launched our website to be an easy, informative and delightful experience for our customer, so we have already begun using R2Net technology across our websites to deliver product leading visualization, try-on and custom design capabilities.","In addition, to give a better sense of scale, we are starting to show every products we can on a model. The early results of which is a double-digit increase in conversion. We are being disciplined about improving our on-site research capabilities and modernizing and speeding up checkout pages, all of which we know enhance customer delight.","We know that our customers have multiple digital touchpoints before they arrive on our websites and that they usually research online before they then go in to a store. So we are strengthening our capability to track this digital journey. New analytical tools will enable us to maximize our marketing spend by targeting the message not only to the right customers but also at the right time through the right digital platform.","Number three, as part of our focus on building a more agile and efficient culture, I\u2019d also like to highlight some important organizational changes we\u2019ve made to drive stronger employee engagement. We have reorganized to increase accountability and focus on results for each of our major North America banners, with a general manager and a dedicated multi-functional team working on Kay, Jared, Zales and Piercing Pagoda.","This moves us away from a Zales versus Sterling division structure to a North America structure. Functional leaders and their teams within marketing, store operations and merchandizing will support all banners delivering innovation informed by customer insight, effectively allocating Signet\u2019s resources and ensuring share best practice.","This structure is designed to emphasize accountability, enable innovation, strengthen collaboration and accelerate decision making. Along with these organizational changes, we are also placing greater emphasis in our annual incentive plans on topline sales growth within each banner and at the corporate level.","Of course in an organization like Signet, where customer interaction happens on the frontline, it is critical that we attract, grow and engage our employees to deliver an extraordinary experience for our customers. We are highly focused on reigniting employee engagement through training and development opportunities, and we are providing a one-time special cash award to non-exempt employees below manager level in fiscal 2019, as we kick off our transformation efforts, as well as a three year transformation incentive program for all employees.","The growth drivers I have just discussed will be funded by a more than 200 million net cost reduction program related to strategic sourcing, logistics, information technology spend, third party contracts and corporate expenses. We have spent considerable time evaluating cost reduction plans over the past four months, with the help of several expert consulting teams, and are confident our implementation will deliver these substantial savings.","In addition, as part of becoming more agile and efficient, we must optimize our real estate foot print. Our stores are a competitive advantage and billboards for our brands. As such we must reinvent and reinvigorate them to continue to provide a compelling customer experience.","Over the next three years, our store footprint must evolve and we are approaching this evolution in a thoughtful manner. Decisions regarding store rationalization will be economically driven, based on the cash financial outlook for each store, the remaining life on leases as well as competitive assessment.","In fiscal 2019, we expect to close over 200 stores. Most of the fiscal 2019 store closings will occur after the holiday season. New store openings are expected to be limited and will be focused on already proven off-mall formats and desirable markets.","As we move out in to fiscal 2020 and beyond, we will be testing more new store concepts, monitoring sales retention success and being opportunistic with what the real estate market provides in terms of rent reductions or store relocations. We expect overall store count at the end of the transformation plan to be lower than fiscal 2019 year-end levels.","Our plan is focused on closing our lowest performing stores. These stores are not losing meaningful operating income, but do not meet our return expectations. We expect a small positive impact on operating profit from closing these stores as well as lower capital expenditures, lower working capital and stronger underlined sales growth. Overtime, we expect our remaining store footprint to be more productive and to drive an overall improvement in return on capital invested for Signet.","Strategically, the goal of our real estate transformation is to provide compelling customer experiences, with seamless integration between our stores and our e-commerce platforms, resulting in higher sales productivity per store. Additionally, we are highly focused on sales retention, making sure we maintain customer relationships as we close stores. Approximately three quarters of stores expected to close are within the same mall with another Signet banner and we are currently modelling an approximately 30% sales retention rate.","Sales retention is a key objective of our real estate transformation and we have already been testing and learning with new programs to help us increase our sales retention rate. This is a comprehensive transformation plan, and we are confident that the activities we have outlined will move the company in the right direction to deliver sustainable profitable growth. They will take time to fully implement and show up in our financial results.","For fiscal 2019, we expect negative same store sales as we continue to work through the credit transition and as our innovation and marketing efforts ramp up. Declining same store sales along with a change to a credit outsourcing model will negatively impact operating profit, somewhat offset by lower interest expenses and a lower share count. We expect to see improved operational and financial performance beginning in fiscal 2020, as our efforts come on fully online.","We intend to responsibly manage the business for topline growth, drive efficiency and to reinvest appropriately to position Signet for sustainable long term growth, and we plan to remain highly disciplined to our capital allocation with a majority of free cash flow being returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Finally, before I turn it over to Michelle, I am very pleased to announce that we have appointed two new members to our Board of Directors, Sharon McCollam and Nancy Reardon. Sharon most recently served as Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative and Chief Financial Officer of Best Buy. She is widely recognized as the co-pilot of Best Buy\u2019s successful renewed turnaround strategy and of having overseen Williams-Sonoma\u2019s operational transformation. Sharon will be a great asset to Signet, as we embark on our own transformation.","Nancy brings a wealth of human resources experience and deep knowledge of the retail, consumer and industrial industries. Having led the major organizational and cultural changes at three Fortune 500 companies including the Campbell Soup Company, Nancy is well suited to provide expert oversight to Signet as we execute on our path to brilliance transformation.","I am confident that the addition of these outstanding leaders will further strengthen the Board of Directors and enable and support the successful execution of our transformation. I am thrilled to welcome them to the Signet team.","And with that I\u2019ll pass the call to Michelle for more details on our financial results and guidance.","Michele Santana","Thank you Gina and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll start with a review of our fourth quarter results, after that I\u2019ll first move to details round the announcement of Signet\u2019s proposed sale of our non-prime accounts receivable. Then secondly, discuss some of the financial impact of our transformation strategy, and lastly conclude the review of our guidance in capital allocation for fiscal 2019.","Our fourth quarter results came in as expected and reflected the trends we discussed on our holiday call in January, therefore my comments on the fourth quarter will be relatively brief. For the fourth quarter, total sales were $2.3 billion, up 1% year-over-year on a total basis and flat on a constant currency basis. This includes the benefit of a 14th week which added $84 million of sales.","In addition, R2Net which we acquired in September of 2017 added $64 million to revenues in the quarter. On a comparable 13 week basis total sales in the fourth quarter were down 5.1%. Same store sales which excluded the impact of the 14th week decreased 5.2% including a 90 basis point benefit from R2Net.","Signet e-commerce sales were up 56.8% on a 14 week basis or 52.8% on a 13 week basis and in total represented 11% of quarterly sales compared to 7% of sales in the prior quarter. Excluding R2Net, e-commerce sales were up 13% on a comparable 13 week basis. Sales trend by division remained broadly consistent with results that we shared on our holiday call with continued momentum in the Zales division being more than offset by weakness in our Kay, Jared and UK banners.","The growth margin rate was 40.1% in the quarter, down a 160 basis points on a 14 week basis and 39.9% on a 13 week basis. The decline in rate was due to one, deleverage on fixed cost as a result of lower sales primarily in the sterling division. Two, a lower growth margin rate associated with R2Net. And three, merchandize mix.","Net bad debt expense had no material impact on the gross margin rate in the quarter. SG&A expense was 27.7% of sales in the quarter and 27.3% of sales on a 13 week basis. The 14th week added $31 million of expense. Excluding this week, total SG&A expense was lower than prior year by approximately $11 million. Lower expense which realized primarily in advertising and store labor costs, in addition SGA was positively impacted by credit outsourcing as we had $21 million in outsourcing cost in the fourth quarter offset by $25 million related to in-house credit operations savings.","Other operating income declined a 130 basis points or $30 million versus prior year due to the sale of our prime accounts receivable portfolio that occurred in the third quarter of this year. Signet\u2019s operating margin decline 350 basis points, driven by one, deleverage on fixed cost; two, the impact of the phase 1 credit outsourcing transaction; and three, the addition of R2Net which carries a lower margin rate.","As we expected, the overall impact of the phase 1 credit transaction with an unfavorable impact of $21 million in the quarter. This was primarily driven by the loss of finance income that I referenced earlier.","GAAP EPS for the quarter was $5.24 including the favorable one-time non-cash benefit related to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities related to US tax reforms. Non-GAAP EPS was $4.28 for the quarter when excluding the $0.96 benefit related to the revaluation of net deferred taxes. This is in line with the guidance range provided on our January holiday call.","So let me briefly touch on comments about our credit portfolio performance for Q4. As discussed previously and in connection with the sale of our prime receivables in the outsourcing of our in-house servicing to Genesis Financial Solutions for non-prime receivables, we adjusted our accounting servicing, our billing terms and delinquency parameters to a contractual basis.","In addition at conversion and in conjunction with a change to contractual aging, we changed our minimum payment structure lowering the required minimum levels closer to those of other retail credit card programs. The impact of these changes coupled with the disposal of the prime portfolio results in substantial changes to a number of our core portfolio metrics when compared to the historical ratios.","Our reserve as a percentage of total AR is now approximately 15% for the retained non-prime portfolio compared to pre-conversion levels of 7% to 8% for the consolidated prime and non-prime receivables. Likewise our collection rate after lowering the minimum required payment for the retained non-prime receivables was approximately 7% compared to the prior year fourth quarter rate of 10%.","In addition to the impact of the lower minimum payment, the collection rate was adversely impacted in November and part of December by a previously discussed disruption by conversion. However, our bad debt expense remained consistent with pre-conversion trends.","In closing on my quarter end fiscal 2018 comment, cash flow was an area of strength in fiscal 2018 with751 million of free cash flow when excluding proceeds of 952 million from the sale of prime receivable to ADS. This compares to 400 million of fiscal 2017. The higher cash generation was due to lower inventory and a favorable impact on working capital related to accounts receivable.","So let me move now to discuss the sale of our non-prime receivable portfolio and the overall impact on our business model of not only the sale but also the phase 1 transaction. Today we announced an agreement to sell Signet\u2019s non-prime receivables to investment funds managed by CarVal Investors and entered a five year committed forward flow purchase program for future origination.","Upon closing, this will complete Signet\u2019s transition to a fully outsourced credit structure. Under the terms of the agreement the non-prime accounts receivable will be sold at a price expressed as a percentage of the par value of the accounts receivable of 72%, which is net of estimated servicing expenses for the receivables.","Historically, Signet has carried these receivables at approximately 85% of par value. The current sales price represents approximately 85% of Signet\u2019s historical caring value. The estimated par value of receivables at closing is $585 million to $635 million. The final amount of receivable sold will be dependent upon sales levels and other portfolio activity between now and closing which we expect to occur in the second quarter.","Additionally, there will be a 5% holdback of the receivables purchase price at closing which maybe paid out at the end of two years depending on the performance of these receivables in that period. As I said, closing is expected in Signet\u2019s fiscal second quarter and this timing is embedded in our fiscal 2019 guidance.","Signet expects to receive $401 million to $435 million in proceeds at closing and incur $7 million of transaction cost. Net proceeds for the transaction will be used for share repurchases in fiscal 2019 subject to market conditions. We expect to book a pre-tax loss or charge associated with the sale of non-prime receivable of approximately of $165 million to $170 million which is inclusive of a lump-sum payment of $45 million to $55 million of servicing expenses related to these receivables as well as transaction cost of $7 million in fiscal 2019.","Approximately a $140 million of the total loss will be recognized in the first quarter upon reclassifying the receivables to assets held for sale, and the remainder of the amount will be recognized in the second quarter. This loss is included in our GAAP EPS guidance and excluded in our non-GAAP EPS guidance.","With respect to future non-prime receivable originations post-closing, Signet will remain the account issuer. Two business days thereafter, CarVal is obligated to purchase these receivables from Signet at a discount to par pursuant to a five year agreement. The discount is a [key] calculated on the credit sale (inaudible) inclusive of servicing and will be recorded as incremental SG&A expense in our fiscal 2019 and beyond P&L.","From a customer experience perspective; servicing for the non-prime receivables will continue to be handled by Genesis. There are no customers or store facing systems integration activities required by Signet to close this transaction, and we do not expect any changes to the current credit application process as a result of closing phase 2. For further details on this transaction, I reference you to the Form 8-K we filed this morning.","Now that I\u2019ve provided an overview of the phase 2 transactions, I would like to take a step back and review the expected financial impact of our credit outsourcing in totality. From a financial perspective, as Gina mentioned, the company will ultimately have received over $1.3 billion due to the combined sale of the prime and non-prime portfolio.","While the outsourcing of our credit portfolio lowers our operating profit, it also reduces share count and interest expense, as proceeds from the sale transactions have been and are expected to be used to pay down debt and repurchase shares. Additionally, the transactions will free up meaningful working capital.","From a P&L perspective, after the completion of the second transaction, Signet will no longer earn finance or late charge income on those accounts and no longer incur bad debt expense. Signet will continue to pay some minimal fees directly to Genesis for new account origination, while all older servicing costs are included in the discount on forward receivables sold. The discount on forward receivables will be partially offset by the elimination of the costs related to our former in-house credit operations.","Slide 11 depicts the net impact of all these items and is posted on the website for your reference. I also encourage you to see page 14 in the release this morning that provides additional details with the slide.","In fiscal 2019, there was a reduction in operating income of $21 million in the fourth quarter solely reflecting the impact of the initial credit outsourcing of prime receivables to ADS, and servicing of non-prime receivables to Genesis. Our fiscal 2019 guidance embeds approximately $118 million to $133 million incremental year-over-year reduction in operating income, reflecting a combination of the following: an additional eight months of impact of the prime portfolio outsourcing, five months of servicing costs on the non-prime portfolio receivable, and seven months of the impact from the future discount rate associated with new credit sales that CarVal will purchase, which embeds servicing costs.","For fiscal 2020, we expect a small year-over-year impact on operating income ranging from zero to a benefit of $5 million. The fiscal 2020 estimate is based on an assumed discount rate for the CarVal arrangement and could change if the discount rate were to reset higher or lower under certain review provisions in the agreement.","So, with that let me now move to review financial considerations, associated with our transformational plan. Our transformational plan, which we are calling the Signet path to brilliance, is expected to result in net cost savings of $200 million to $225 million over three years. In fiscal 2019, the transformation plan is expected to deliver net cost savings of $85 million to $100 million, with further incremental cost reductions of $115 million to $125 million by the end of the three year program.","Total preliminary pre-tax charges are anticipated to be $170 million to $190 million over three years, with $125 million to $135 million of charges in fiscal 2019. Preliminary cash charges are anticipated to be $105 million to $120 million over the three years of which $60 million to $65 million are expected to be paid in fiscal 2019.","Lastly, moving on to guidance and capital allocation; this year we are providing revenue dollar guidance to help you model total sales, given the number of store closures we had in fiscal 2018. Total revenues are expected to be $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion and same store sales are being guided down low to mid-single digits for fiscal 2019.","Keep in mind we had an extra week in fiscal 2018, which provided $84 million in revenue. We also closed stores in fiscal 2018 that had revenue of $150 million. Both of these amounts should be removed from the 2018 base when working through your models. In addition we will be adopting the new revenue recognition accounting standard this year, which will reclassify certain items as revenue that was previously recorded as reductions to expenses. This is expected to result in approximately $100 million of revenue included in total sales dollar guidance, with no impact on profit, as this is simply a geography change on the P&L.","The offsetting expense is 70% cost of goods sold and 30% SG&A. Our same store sales guidance of negative low to mid-single digits assumes the positive momentum we saw in our Zales banner in the fourth quarter to continue and to be offset by negative sales growth in our Kay and Jared banners. Please note that our same store sale excludes revenue recognition changes.","We continue to work on changed management initiatives from our credit outsourcing transition, as well as address the challenges Gina mentioned earlier around product innovation, improving our e-commerce capabilities, and working on the consumer value equation. As our initiative and plans begin to take hold, we do anticipate to see gradual signs of improvement in same store sales trends as we head to the fourth quarter.","Now, moving on to operating profit, fiscal 2019 operating profit will be negatively impacted by deleverage of fixed cost due to lower sales, the impact of the credit transactions discussed earlier in my comments, and a $50 million year-over-year increase related to compensation, primarily driven by the restoration of our short-term incentive compensation that did not pay out in fiscal 2018. These headwinds are somewhat offset by expected net cost savings of $85 million to $100 million related to our transformation plan.","As many of you know, our business model has a large fixed cost component, which impacts our margins in a declining sales environment. As the transformation plan begins to take hold, this leverage should become a benefit to margins, when same store sales trends improve from current levels.","Now, going back to credit for just a moment and as a reminder, we will recognize a total pre-tax charge related to our phase 2 transaction of $165 million to $170 million, and we anticipate a pre-tax charge of $125 million to $135 million related to the transformational plan. Our GAAP EPS guidance of $0.00 to $0.60 includes these charges and they are excluded from our non-GAAP EPS guidance of $3.75 to $4.25.","In addition, the GAAP EPS guidance includes an estimated tax benefit of $62 million to $67 million, driven by the anticipated charges that I just discussed. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance embeds a tax rate of 8% to 10%. In addition, we have provided both common basic shares and diluted shares as part of our guidance.","For purposes of calculating both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS, we expect to use the basic share count for the first, second, and third quarters as well as the full year due to the projected level of net income. For the fourth quarter only, diluted share count should be used in modeling EPS. While we are not providing quarterly guidance, please note the following items for modeling purposes.","The cost savings related to the transformation plan are second half weighted, while reinvestments are more evenly spread across the year. The revenue impact related to credit transition execution is expected to be more pronounced in the first half of the year. Lastly, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we will be modifying our segment reporting to align with the organizational structures that Gina outlined earlier.","We will be moving to a segment reporting structure with a new North America division encompassing the legacy Sterling and Zales divisions and continuing with the UK division. We will continue to provide revenues and same store sales by banner, consistent with our current practice. For simplicity, we will also not be using slides in our future conference calls, and for fiscal 2019, we will be issuing a holiday release only and will not be hosting a call.","Finally turning to capital allocation and cash return; we announced this morning that we will increase our fiscal 2009 quarterly dividend by 20%. We expect to repurchase approximately $475 million in shares in fiscal 2019, funded primarily by the sale of non-prime receivables as well as cash on hand.","With respect to leverage, we anticipate to receive the high end of our 3 to 3.5 times target leverage ratio in fiscal 2019, as we begin our transformation. But expect to be back within that range before the end of the three year transformational plan.","Signet plans to remain highly disciplined towards capital allocation, with the majority of free cash flow being reinvested in strategic growth and\/or returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.","And with that, I\u2019ll pass the call back to Gina for closing comments.","Gina Drosos","Thanks, Michele. Fiscal year 2019 will be a transition year, as we invest in the business and continue to take actions to position Signet for sustainable, profitable growth. We must reinvigorate and rejuvenate this great company for our customers, suppliers, employees, and importantly, our shareholders.","Before we turn to Q&A, I would like to thank James Grant for his six years of excellent service to Signet Jewelers. Randi Abada has recently joined our team as the Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Strategy, and Investor Relations. Randi has over a decade of buy side equity research experience and has also held senior corporate finance roles at consumer companies, and we are thrilled to have her on board.","We are appreciative that James will stay on until the end of April to ensure a seamless transaction of the investor relations function. I\u2019d now like to ask the Operator to please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Simeon Siegel","Gina, can you speak to the transaction growth at Zales versus the drop at Sterling? How do you view the industry landscape right now or why do you think Zales (inaudible) them all and Sterling missed I think even beyond credit and where you think those shoppers might going? So any color there would be helpful. And then Michele obviously increasing the dividend shows confidence in your cash flow. Can you just speak to what you expect cash generation to look like going forward with credit behind you?","Gina Drosos","As I\u2019ve said previously we were able to get a number of our strategic initiatives in place faster at Zales than our other businesses. So for example, Zales has been operating in our new banner accountability organization model since August with a dedicated multi-functional team and has had faster, more banner focused decision making.","What this really allowed them to do is to improve our product assortment at Zales more quickly. So, Disney, Vera Wang, and solitaires performed very well. This shift toward fashion, more fashion jewelry purchasing is something that we really captured at Zales in a way that drove our topline improvement.","The third thing is that our e-commerce started to improve post our Hybris implementation, which had caused a temporary dip in search and conversion, especially on mobile. And then finally, as you also noted, Zales is not impacted by the credit transition having had their credit transitioned for a while now.","Michele Santana","Simeon, and in terms of your question on the cash flow, and as I called out in my comments, that for sure was a point of strength for us in our fiscal 2018. And as we think about moving forward in the transaction between phase 1 and phase 2, the sale of the $1.8 billion of total receivables for sure reduces the total invested capital and will also help improve our return on invested capital profile as we move forward. And as I said on the call, will also provide meaningful working capital reductions, which will also help to drive free cash flow enhancements.","Simeon Siegel","Any color on what that would look like embedded within the guidance for this year?","Michele Santana","No, we\u2019re not guiding the actual free cash flow number. I think we gave the pieces and parts on what we anticipate the sales proceeds to be. And then in addition, the other caller I\u2019d point you to is we did provide the capital expenditures and you can see that range of $165 million to $185 million is lower from the prior period, as we continue to focus on IT and also will have reduction in new store investments, so that will also help to drive and enhance free cash flow.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Ike Boruchow","Michele, just two questions for you; can you confirm that the phase 2 transaction is EPS accretive? It seems to be a little dilutive on my rough math, but I\u2019ll admit the numbers are a little confusing on my end, so just any help there would be great.","Michele Santana","Ike, in terms of the EPS accretion, as you would imagine there\u2019s going to be a number of assumptions and there\u2019s time to go when we close and get the actual proceeds. It\u2019s going to be dependent in terms of level of receivables, and then when we think about those proceeds, obviously what the share price would be at the time we do our share repurchases. So, I think it\u2019s premature for me to comment accretion or dilution.","Ike Boruchow","Then just a follow-up, can you give us any more detail on, maybe explicitly, what discount rate is being used on the credit sales to your partner to get to the numbers you kind of laid out, the 118 to 133, there has to be something kind of embedded in there? I\u2019m not sure if you can share that or give us color.","Michele Santana","Well, you\u2019re definitely right. There is a discount rate embedded in the numbers we provided. We\u2019re not going to share what\u2019s that MDR, we refer to it as the merchant discount rate, what that rate is just for competitive reasons and sensitivity of the information. But what we have provided in the release and which is why we also provided the view for FY \u201920, so you can understand in a more normalized annualized basis what we anticipate the impact to SG&A expenses to be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Oliver Chen","Regarding the consumer value equation, a lot of our research at Cowen does focus on deep value and value for price and pricing, what do you think needs to be done and how will that manifest in the brilliance plan in terms of how we model the comp on (inaudible) versus transaction and timing, because its reorienting toward value can be quite complex and some things may be easier versus longer.","And our second question is just about banner differentiation. You\u2019ve been on a journey regarding this in the past, so what\u2019s different about what you\u2019re seeing, and how should we interpret the new studies versus the former studies and where you want to go with banner differentiation?","Gina Drosos","So, let me start with the customer value equation first; obviously our value equation is comprised of a number of different things, the price of our product, the assortment, the service that we provide in store, the education, the seamless OmniChannel experience that we provide, because we know that fine jewelry shoppers are online, in-store and back again.","So there are a lot of components of that, but a couple of things I mentioned in remarks that we\u2019re doing uniquely now are first, we\u2019re doing some pricing studies to carefully evaluate and benchmark versus key competition as well as evaluating our promotional spend. So, I also mentioned that we\u2019ve become a bit too promotional, we believe at certain times of the year, and this is creating confusion for consumers and also creating an environment which damages brand equity instead of building it up.","So we\u2019re taking a look at both of those elements to see what the right kind of value equation is for us to have, and that may vary across our different banners. Given to the answer to your second question, which is banner segmentation. So you\u2019re absolutely right, several years ago, we had (inaudible) come in and do a study about the market and who are the shoppers within the market. And then we kind of lined each of our brand banners up against one of those consumer groups.","But having done a lot of branding work throughout my career and repositioning brands for growth, it\u2019s more complicated than that. So we\u2019ve brought some deep data analytics to bear in addition to that to show us which consumers are already buying in which banners, which are the consumer groups that are growing the most, and what are the significant benefit promises that those consumers really want to see.","And then we\u2019ve been doing work on what each of our brand banners can stand for and how we might target these consumer groups in a different and more personalized, more individualized way. So, that\u2019s the work that\u2019s been going on over the last six months since I came, and I\u2019ve seen some work on it very recently. I think it\u2019s coming along very well and we\u2019re getting ready to get some of that into execution and testing, which we\u2019ll be doing over the coming months, so that we can really better differentiate our customer groups and reduce the overlap.","The great thing is that that carries over to other things as well. It carries over to new store concepts, new service concepts, our merchandise mix. As we\u2019ve talked before we\u2019ve gotten into a situation of sameness across our banners over the last couple of years where the merchandise looks very similar across our banners. And with the benefit of a fresh look at the segmentation, we can now pull that apart a little bit and differentiate the merchandise that particular customer groups want to see in banners better than we have before.","Oliver Chen","Okay, and Gina I know you\u2019ve done some interesting work with millennials and [Genesis]. How does that manifest in terms of the store experience, and how you see that evolving and what the on-demand capital like customer service and mixed service model may mean for how you\u2019re thinking your store experience should evolve, just to make sure you capture the share of new generations and acquire new customers and maintain existing?","Gina Drosos","Well, it\u2019s a great question. So, thanks for asking that one. Obviously our customers are beyond millennials because people are buying birthday gifts, anniversary gifts, females are purchasing, all of that. But a large portion of our sales, especially on bridal, are focused with millennials. So, we\u2019ve done particular research in that group.","And I\u2019ll give you three examples of things that we\u2019re focusing on that we believe will delight millennial shoppers. One is OmniChannel, so the seamless integration of online and in-store experience. There are a couple of things that we\u2019ve brought to life that I\u2019m excited about, and these are small test and learn activities, but everything we\u2019re testing we\u2019re learning about, and I think we\u2019re seeing strong growth results. And so we\u2019ll see that impact our business more broadly as we roll it out.","A few examples of that are bringing our R2Net technology and product visualization to our websites. Another one is allowing customers to check our inventory in any store from online, before they go to the store. Just in the fourth quarter we had 1.7 million customers check our website for online inventory. And that\u2019s a new service that we just started offering.","I\u2019ve talked about adding appointment booking to our websites, and we had over 3,800 appointments booked online during the fourth quarter. So, immediately customers are responding to that. I talked a bit about personalized content. When someone has visited our website before, we should be able to make their second, third, and fourth experience much more customized and personalized. Last year for holiday, we were doing that about 3% of the time. In the fourth quarter this year, it was about 34% of the time, so a significant increase there.","Another example on visualization is showing our product on models, which is I think, a pretty exciting opportunity. When we showed jewelry on a hand, a wrist, a neck of a model, we were delivering double-digit conversion increases above what we were doing and the way we were visualizing product previously. So, we\u2019re bringing a lot of excellent small test and learn projects into our OmniChannel experience, and they\u2019re working and they\u2019re learning. So, we\u2019ll begin to start rolling those out.","So, OmniChannel is a big one, service is the second one. How we approach millennial consumers from a selling method in our stores makes a difference. Even things like wish lists that can exist online and in-store, the level of information education we provide, the way we provide that we\u2019re modifying. And then a third one is location, we\u2019re looking at some urban store concepts, we have a very interesting mind-opening fact, 43% of consumers who get engaged have kids already.","And so this is indicative of a different relationship journey that a lot of millennial consumers have. And so how do we make it easier for them than having to bring the kids to the mall and sit for two hours at a counter? How do we provide bridal (inaudible) services and things like that that can delight them? So, these are three things, OmniChannel, service, and the location in which we provide our jewelry to our customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Patel with Needham & Company. Your line is open.","Rick Patel","Just a quick clarification, I wanted to be crystal clear that your non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes the $475 million in buybacks, and assuming that it does exclude it, how should we think about the timing of when those repurchases will happen? And then secondly, Michele, I was hoping to get more color on the comment you made about how this transaction would impact SG&A as Signet originates future receivables and sells them to CarVal, what exactly that SG&A impact would represent, and any thoughts on quantifying that.","Michele Santana","So, first, let me help you with your non-GAAP question. For sure GAAP and non-GAAP embed the consideration of approximately $475 million worth of share repurchases. So apologies if that was somehow confusing, but that is in there and we would anticipate that probably aligns since we\u2019ll be using the proceeds from the sale, we\u2019ll align with the closing which we had said we expect to occur in the second quarter.","In terms of giving color on the transaction and understanding the SG&A, I\u2019ll give you two reference points, but then I\u2019ll give you some color. If you go on to page 14 of the release we put out this morning, we give you the impact for FY \u201919, and then we also give you the estimated impact for FY \u201820. And there are a couple paragraphs that speak to the SG&A, the moving parts.","As you think about how we guided the impact for \u201819, $100 million to $115 million, and then if you look at the impact for FY \u201820 as it relates to phase 2, primarily what\u2019s running through SG&A is what we refer to as the discount rate associated with the forward flow of these receivables. So really that discount rate as we said has two components, it\u2019s the discount rate for CarVal, who\u2019s going to be funding the receivables for us. But that also embeds the servicing cost for Genesis to service the receivables.","So, I think if you go back and look at that as well as slide 11 that we had on the presentation, that will give you the estimated impact that you\u2019re looking for.","Rick Patel","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And my second question, as you close 200 doors this year, you noted that existing stores could potentially recapture 30% of those lost sales. Just trying to understand the assumption there and whether that\u2019s something you\u2019ve seen in the past with store closures or whether that\u2019s an estimate and your level of confidence in being able to recapture those lost sales.","Gina Drosos","The 30% is our historical average from stores that we have closed previously, and that\u2019s really without having a very robust sales retention program in place. So, what we\u2019ve done is over the last several months, we\u2019ve been testing and learning on several ideas, which can help us to improve sales retention further. So one of those, for example is announcing to our store staff and to our customers earlier that we\u2019ll be closing a store and helping to redirect them to another Signet banner that\u2019s nearby, and remember, about 75% of the time, it can even be across the hall.","We\u2019re also being much more robust in using our clientele to reach out to customers of a closing store and offer them a one-time incentive to shop at our new store, so really guiding them there. And then the third thing is that we\u2019re actually transferring some of our sales associates from one store to the other, so they bring their customers with them or we\u2019re creating a buddy system where they literally can walk their customers across the hall or down the mall to introduce them to a new sales associate in a nearby store who can help them.","So, we\u2019re moving from an era of just letting it happen, which was the 30% and what we\u2019ve modeled to an era where we\u2019re being very intentional about trying to retain those sales.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with RBC. Your line is open.","Brian Tunick","Two quick ones for Michele, and then maybe one for Gina. Michele, on sort of other operating income line for 2019 now, can you maybe give us what you\u2019re assuming in your guidance and same thing with interest expense. And then Michele, on the quarterly viewpoint clearly, the first half of the year last year had some nuances with shifts of Mother\u2019s Day, and I think you reported a negative 12% comp for Q1.","So just want to understand from a quarterly buildout, how we should be thinking about maybe the first half this year with those timing shifts and then maybe other income and interest expense views. And then Gina, curious on your market share competitive landscape study. Maybe talk about bridal versus non-bridal competition and what you see has changed maybe since you\u2019ve been at the company.","Michele Santana","So, let me start with your first few questions. I think the first one related to the finance charge income for fiscal year 2019, if we can provide any color on what that would look like. And as we say once we close the phase 2 transaction, we no longer will have finance charge income reported. But clearly, there will be some level within the first half year prior to closing. We\u2019re not separately guiding on that line item. I would reference you back to the number that we provided in terms of the operating impact is inclusive of that change.","Your second question on interest expense; we will anticipate some reduction from our interest expense that we saw in FY \u201918, since we paid off the ABS facility of $600 million in the third quarter as part of the phase 1 transaction. So, you would anticipate some reduction, probably in the $35 million or $40 million or so of interest expense. And did you have one other question for me, Brian, or did I hit them all?","Brian Tunick","Yeah, I did. I did. It was really about the timing shift from last year, the Mother\u2019s Day shift. Q1, I think, was down 12% last year. Obviously you\u2019re still having, it sounds like credit issues, but should we be viewing the first quarter as an opportunity, the timing shift between Q1 and Q2, just anything like that on those issues.","Gina Drosos","Yeah. So, the first comment I\u2019m going to say is we\u2019re not going to guide quarterly comps. But when we think about calendar shifts, the way the comp calculation works because of the 53rd week, etcetera, it actually becomes normalized for the promotional or for the shift that we saw last year. So, I wouldn\u2019t say that there\u2019s probably any major callout for Q1 to be thinking of.","Michele Santana","Just build on that to say, we are still fixing our credit transition issues in Kay and Jared and we\u2019re just beginning to get some of these strategic initiatives in place. So, I would expect us to see gradual and incremental progress throughout the fiscal year. And then let me answer your question on market share and what\u2019s changed since I\u2019ve been here. In terms of market share, we have done a deep analysis on when we don\u2019t get a sale, where does it go. We\u2019re seeing that be different across bridal and fashion as you correctly pointed out.","So, in bridal when we don\u2019t get a sale, it\u2019s typically moving online, which as you\u2019ll remember, is something the company didn\u2019t expect several years ago, but we think we have a competitive advantage to capture more of that over time with our R2Net visualization technology. Also, sometimes the independent jewelers who are offering a very personalized relationship with customers.","Again, we think we have an opportunity to provide significantly more assortment to customers. I talked a bit about our Jared test, where we\u2019re able now in a number of our stores to provide a choice of over 100,000 diamonds to customers, which is something that is truly a competitive advantage.","And I think as we\u2019re using clientele better and using the data analytics I talked about to track customer\u2019s journey, this is another place where we have a competitive advantage in our ability to create individualized relationships with customers both online and in-store in a very integrated way that we believe independent competition can\u2019t match.","On the fashion side of the equation, if we lose the sale, it\u2019s typically to department stores, which is part of why we\u2019re doing the pricing analysis and also an assortment analysis that I mentioned to see what are those products, where we may be missing. One of the things we\u2019re excited about are the proprietary brands that we are able to bring. So, Vera Wang is a great example, as we\u2019ve moved into fashion on that brand, we\u2019ve had great success, same with Disney as we introduced more fashion over the holidays. And we saw both of those work very well at Zales.","So, again, small steps, we\u2019re testing and learning on these things, but each one we are seeing some progress and we think we\u2019ll see more substantial growth drivers as we grow and scale those. What\u2019s changed since I\u2019ve been here? I would say the big answer to that is focus. When I think about what are the key growth drivers for us going forward, I think we\u2019ve got all of our organization now rowing in the same direction, that it\u2019s all about positioning and providing clarity of the market position for Kay, Zales, Jared, and running that all the way through our marketing mix, our service mix, and our product mix.","It is product, its being more aware of fashion and gifting as a big opportunity, not ever forsaking bridal, where we\u2019ll always have competitive advantage, but even being more attuned to trends on bridal like we were on solitaires for Zales over holiday and like we are now on Kay and Jared for solitaires as we\u2019re upping the inventory on those.","The third one I can\u2019t say enough is digital, how we\u2019re driving traffic in e-commerce and in stores with all the analytics that we\u2019re putting in place. And the fourth is innovation. And we\u2019ve got our company now set up to be able to deliver that with our new banner accountability structure and some of the new capabilities that we\u2019re building.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Scott Krasik with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Scott Krasik","One quick one and then two tougher ones; first, your original guidance, I think, for selling the phase 1 was that there would be a $50 million impact to operating profit and $21 million has been recognized. So, has that changed at all?","Michele Santana","So, if we go back in terms of we had guided in a range $50 million, $55 million in terms of the phase 1 transaction on an annualized basis, which included the ADS taking on the prime receivables and also included a servicing element related to the non-prime receivables.","So, how we\u2019re guiding now is the totality of the transactions combined, which obviously still includes the ADS component and the servicing is still there, although it\u2019s embedded in the discount rate that we\u2019ll be paying to CarVal. So, that $50 million, how I\u2019d characterize it is you should look at in totality of how we guided the $100 million to $150 million impact for FY 19.","Scott Krasik","And then Gina, could you give us an update on how your employees are dealing with the credit sale process? You don\u2019t have to give us a comp for Valentine\u2019s Day, but did they handle it better, did you get that transition from one to the progressive any better? And then Michele, how do you handle if let\u2019s say the whole sub-prime market starts to get a little tighter. Do you have any flexibility to pay a little bit more to keep the sales going or is that totally in CarVal\u2019s hands?.","Gina Drosos","So, in terms of the credit transition issues that we experienced pretty much as soon as we outsourced on phase 1, I will say we\u2019re making good progress, but we\u2019re not there yet. This is much more complex than I think we originally realized. But what we\u2019ve done a great job of over the last number of months is really diagnosing what all the issues are and getting strong resources against fixing those.","So, we\u2019re moving as fast as we can. We\u2019re beginning to see some good results on that, but this is something that I think is going to still impact us, not only in Q1, but for the rest of this fiscal year. So, the project team has put in place a multi-month implementation horizon of new system enhancements that will get us first back to where we were in terms of the level of information and ease of being able to use credit at the store level. And then secondly will take us beyond that to actually improve versus what we had before, and make credit a much easier process than it ever was in the past.","So, one example of that is that our store personnel have been dealing with really three discreet systems, if you will, the ADS prime system, the Genesis non-prime system, and then progressive leasing, and it has not been as seamless a process of one financing offering as we want it to be or as we originally expected. We have some IT improvements coming online over the next couple of months, which link all of those together to make it a significantly more seamless process.","Michele Santana","Yeah. In terms of your question on the sub-primes, as we announced this morning with the deal with CarVal, they\u2019re obligated to purchase that forward flow. Signet will continue to originate those accounts and will pay the MDR to CarVal over that period of time. And that MDR rate is subject to change periodically. So, we\u2019ll have latitude and flexibility to address whatever the market condition might be.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect."],"19243":["Signet Jewelers Limited (NYSE:SIG) Q3 2020 Earnings Conference Call December  5, 2019  7:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Randi Abada - SVP of IR","Gina Drosos - CEO","Joan Hilson - CFO","Conference Call Participants","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Signet Jewelers\u2019 Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call.

Investors should review the news release, we posted on our website at www.signetjewelers.com\/investors.","I'll now turn the call over to Gina.","Gina Drosos","Thank you, Randi. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining today's call.","I want to begin by thanking all of our team members for delivering a solid third quarter and for providing an inspiring holiday experience for our customers. I'll open my remarks with an overview of our third quarter results and then provide thoughts on the holiday season and progress on our Path to Brilliance priorities.","I'll wrap up with some brief comments on our guidance before turning the call over to Joan for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. We believe that our third quarter performance demonstrates that the cumulative - progress on our Path to Brilliance transformation is positively impacting our results.","The operational improvements we are seeing each quarter are contributing to higher net promoter scores improving traffic trends and better than expected financial results. While we remain mindful that we still have more work to do. We are pleased with the progress of our Path to Brilliance transformation efforts. Here are some highlights of our third quarter results.","We delivered total same-store sales growth of 2.1% with brick and mortar same-store sales up in all US mall-based banners and double-digit growth in eCommerce sales. North America same-store sales grew 2.9% reflecting growth at sales Kay and Piercing Pagoda with Kay's performance driven by a strategic decision to accelerate inventory reduction and make room for holiday newness. James Allen returned to double-digit growth through new merchandise assortment and site enhancements along with beginning to lap the implementation of sales tax.","Once again Signet's U.S. traffic performance was ahead of shopper track total retail traffic. I want to give a special mention to Piercing Pagoda which had its sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit same-store sales growth. Pagoda has made strong progress in enhancing its product offering and recently launched a successful first ever advertising campaign. We are opening 11 new kiosks in the second half and top performing malls to introduce more customers to this fast-growing and highly productive concept.","In the third quarter, merchandising efforts to expand our iconic flagship brands, increased newness and strengthen our core products continue to take hold. North America bridal and fashion each grew on a same-store sales basis in the quarter. Strong performance and flagship brands Vera Wang, Neil Lane and Leo drove bridal sales with fashion growth led by gold. Our exclusive Love and Be Loved collection and diamond fashion, Enchanted Disney showed continued strength in both bridal and fashion. In the UK concerns over Brexit continue to negatively impact customers' spending contributing to a 5.2% decline in same-store sales.","Turning to profits, our efforts to bring greater efficiency to our operations delivered operating profit growth year-over-year and ahead of our guidance, this cost discipline funded important investments in advertising, eCommerce capabilities and growth initiatives during the quarter and also allowed us to take actions to position inventory lower and make room for newness heading into holiday. Adjusted free cash flow was up $243 million year-to-date driven by operating profit growth and inventory efficiency.","Now I'll turn to an update on our holiday plans within our core strategic priorities of Customer First omni-channel and Culture of Agility and Efficiency. Our holiday plans have been built around cumulative progress we have made toward our Path to Brilliance priorities and operational roadmap that incorporates specific learning's we gained last year and our view of the competitive environment. Beginning with Customer First.","We have significantly improved our merchandise offerings, improved the in-store shopping experience and transformed marketing and media effectiveness with improved customer insights and data analytics capabilities. We are continuing our efforts to scale up services. In product, we are positioned with bigger branded product launches a more inspiring broader selection of gifts and competitive price points for value-oriented shoppers.","At Kay, new brands include the exclusive to Signet Adrianna Papell contemporary bridal jewelry collection inspired by the special occasion dress designs of this popular brand. This Center of Me diamond fashion collection, and hallmark branded fashion collection. We've expanded Neil Lane premier bridal and Colored Gemstones. We are also amplifying our gold offerings and adding new designs, including color to our successful in-house designed Love+Be Loved collection.","Kay also launched a sparkling saving selection of gifts at key price points. In Zales, new brands include Marilyn Monroe collection and the Art-Deco inspired Zales private collection in bridal. In flagship brands we launched Enchanted Disney new Frozen 2 and Maleficent collections and new gemstone bridal designs. Vera Wang added new designs and launched new custom in men's fashion.","Zales is also refreshing the exclusive Past, Present and Future collection and building on its successful dazzling deals value oriented gift offerings. At Jared, we have strengthened our competitive advantage in bridal assortment with higher quality loose stones more competitive prices and increased availability using our R2Net virtual inventory. Our efforts position Jared as a destination for custom created rings, while also refreshing branded bridal assortments, including the exclusive chosen collection.","In fashion, Jared has expanded gold and the Shy fashion collection and also recently began rolling out the premium John Hardy collection. Overall, we believe our product assortment is stronger this holiday season across our new and existing iconic flagship brands on-trend merchandise and value-oriented offerings.","Moving on to marketing, we are continuing to implement strategic changes to our marketing model with modernized creative shifts in timing of spend and mix of media. These strategy changes are driving greater efficiency and effectiveness of advertising spent and contributing to improvement and brand health scores and in-store and online traffic trends across banners. The timing of advertising spend has been rebalanced to a more always-on model to support bridal throughout the year.","We also launched our holiday marketing in the third quarter of this year to showcase new products and drive customer awareness earlier in the holiday season. This holiday, each of our banners has innovative, integrated campaigns with improved scores versus last year and nearly all new ads in the top quartile in external database testing. These plans reflect our strategy to shift more spend to digital and mobile with significant increases in digital video.","We are in New York City this week launching breakthrough of that marketing with NBC's Tree Lighting special at Rockefeller Center, leveraging our Center of Me diamond jewelry, and filming Kay's sponsorship of the Empire State Building signature holiday light show, which airs later this month. Both our iconic pop culture moments that resonate with our customers\u2019 heartfelt sentiment at this time of year creating attention-grabbing multi-channel activations that drive cultural brand relevance for Kay.","These events are just examples of the many activations we've added to help drive impressions across earned, social and digital, increasing consumer engagement and providing additional opportunities to share our new creative. Investments we made in our customer data platform and data analytics, combined with the capabilities of our new media agency are enabling us to deliver significantly more targeted digital content and higher total impressions at a lower cost.","Now I would like to discuss our plans to leverage our full service jeweler capabilities. Growing the services business is an important part of our long-term strategy, as it creates more opportunities for us to interact with customers and create loyalty while also driving incremental revenue and margin mix. As I mentioned on our last call, we believe Piercing is an opportunity to increase traffic and build customer relationships, early in their lifecycle of jewelry repurchases.","Leveraging the expertise of our Piercing Pagoda team, we performed successful tests at a group of Kay stores earlier this year and launch piercing services in more than 400 Kay stores in the fourth quarter. We've implemented email, social and in-store marketing to drive awareness of our new Piercing offering. Early customer feedback has been positive and we expect Piercing to become more meaningful over time, as we further scale our efforts.","In repair, we have seen steady improvements in our net promoter score this fiscal year, we've added special events marketing support and website updates to drive customer awareness of our enhanced repair services offering. For example, this weekend Kay, Zales and Jared are hosting get your sparkle on in-store events with free cleaning to prepare customers jewelry for the holidays, along with a 10% off any care and repair purchase during this event, driving an additional touch point with our customers.","Overall, we've built new services capabilities which we expect to drive customer acquisition, increased frequency and grow customer loyalty. While the contribution from services will be small in fiscal 2020, we expect it to be more meaningful revenue and margin contributor in the long-term. Turning to omni-channel, we've made significant investments in omni-channel for holiday across our stores and websites.","In stores, we now have over 19,000 iPads in place and have upgraded bandwidth across our store base. This enables every jewelry consultant to service our customers with virtual inventory and inspiring custom designed selling tools.","In eCommerce we successfully transitioned the Kay and Jared websites to the hybris platform during the third quarter. This common best-in-class technology foundation enables greater speed and efficiency with all banners delivering faster website load speeds. We've also made important investments in mobile this year, including a recent launch of mobile first capability allowing customers to design your own jewelry as well as investments in higher quality images and curated search. We believe these investments set us up to drive higher traffic to our sites and create a more compelling user friendly experience.","Moving on to Culture of Agility and Efficiency, our cost optimization efforts continue to positively impact our results. We expect $70 million to $80 million in net cost savings in fiscal 2020. Our full year gross savings are primarily driven by indirect procurement, workforce optimization and lower corporate costs. Other efficiencies and direct procurement and distribution began to impact our results in the second half and are expected to have additional benefits in fiscal 2021.","A portion of the fiscal 2020 gross savings are reinvested in technology and innovation initiatives to drive growth. Our three-year Path to Brilliance net cost savings goal remains $200 million to $225 million, inclusive of the $85 million and net savings achieved in fiscal 2019. These cost savings have and we believe will continue to enable us to fund investments, mitigate headwinds and improve our profitability over time. Before I turn the call over to Joan, I will briefly discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 financial guidance.","Our fourth quarter guidance for - same-store sales decline of 2% to 4% is consistent with the fourth quarter - outlook embedded in our previous annual sales guidance. Black Friday weekend sales performance was in line with our expectations with particular strength on Cyber Monday, both in-store and online. Overall, our fourth quarter sales outlook balances our optimism about the strength of our holiday merchandising, marketing and omni-channel initiatives with a competitive U.S. retail environment, potential negative impacts from a shorter U.S. holiday selling season and a continued to difficult UK operating environment.","As a reminder, we have many key selling days still to come as December is the largest sales month in our fiscal year. We are raising fiscal 2020 same-store sales guidance and the lower end of our non-GAAP operating profit guidance range to reflect year-to-date over delivery. We continue to expect fiscal 2020 adjusted free cash flow to be higher versus fiscal 2019, primarily driven by disciplined inventory management. In closing, we are encouraged by the progress to date on our Path to Brilliance transformation journey as we continue to execute with diligence while operating in a dynamic and competitive retail environment.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Joan.","Joan Hilson","Thanks Gina, and good morning everyone.","In my remarks, I'll first cover the highlights of our third quarter financial results. Briefly discuss the results of our recent refinancing and then conclude with guidance. In the third quarter, total same store sales grew 2.1% with brick and mortar same-store sales up 0.9% and eCommerce sales up 11.4%.","In North America, same-store sales grew 2.9% with brick and mortar same-store sales up 1.6% and eCommerce sales up 13%. Kay and Jared same-store sales performance benefited from additional clearance to accelerate inventory reduction ahead of new merchandise for holiday. North America eCommerce reflected improvements at James Allen, as well as strong performance from our core banners. North America eCommerce sales excluding James Allen were up 10.6% in the - quarter inclusive of a planned technology platform change at Kay and Jared.","International same-store sales declined 5.2% and continued to reflect the challenging operating environment in the UK. Revenue declined 0.3% reflecting same-store sales growth the impact of net store closures and the impact of foreign exchange. Non-GAAP gross margin is flat to prior year with procurement related transformation cost savings and higher credit revenue share payments offsetting a lower merchandise margin.","The lower merchandise margin in the third quarter included the impact of Kay and Jared inventory reduction efforts. Additionally, the positive brick and mortar same-store sales performance resulted in leverage of our store occupancy costs.","SG&A was down $12 million or 0.9% of sales on a year-over-year basis. This performance was driven by lower corporate and indirect spend as well as lower store staff costs, primarily due to store closures, partially offset by $12 million increase in advertising. Non-GAAP operating loss improved year-over-year, reflecting the benefit of cost savings and a lower net impact of credit somewhat offset by higher levels of clearance to accelerate inventory reduction and an increase in advertising.","Interest expense was $2 million lower year-over-year due to lower average borrowings, lower average interest rates post the debt refinancing during the quarter and higher interest income on cash balances. The non-GAAP EPS loss of $0.76 was an improvement versus prior year inclusive of a smaller operating loss and lower interest expense. Overall, third quarter non-GAAP EPS was ahead of our guidance due to better sales performance, strong cost discipline and lower interest expense.","Turning to balance sheet and cash flow, inventory is down 5% versus the prior year in the third quarter as we continue to thoughtfully reduce legacy inventory and employ a more disciplined purchasing strategy for new merchandise. We generated $80 million on adjusted free cash year-to-date up $243 million year-over-year as a result of solid progress on working capital. Before moving out to guidance, I would like to briefly discuss our previously announced refinancing transaction which just completed during the quarter.","We entered into new five-year asset based credit facility with the availability of $1.6 billion which replaced the previous revolving credit facility and term loan facility due in 2021, and funded a tender offer for our majority of outstanding senior notes due in 2024. The refinancing improved our financial flexibility by extending Signet\u2019s debt maturity profile, increasing available liquidity and slightly lowering interest expense while having a neutral impact on average.","We continue to expect our leverage ratio to be approximately four times by the completion of a transformation plans at year-end fiscal 2021. Turning to guidance, for the fourth quarter we expect same-store sales of down 2% to down 4%. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be $222 million to $232 million with a non-GAAP EPS range of $3.01 to $3.16. Our fourth quarter sales outlook incorporates optimism in our plans for holiday balance with a competitive U.S. retail environment as well as a challenging consumer environment in the UK.","Our operating profit guidance range includes some flexibility for a promotional holiday somewhat offset by cost savings. Our fiscal 2020 same-store store sales guidance is now 1% to down - 1.7%, non-GAAP operating profit of $270 million to $280 million. Our sales update reflects the outperformance in the third quarter and holds our prior fourth quarter sales guidance.","We are raising the low end of the non-GAAP operating profit guidance based on year-to-date performance while holding the upper end of the range to provide flexibility in the always competitive holiday season. This guidance reflects a modestly positive year-over-year, net impact of our outsourced credit model. Our guidance also includes list for tariff which - we do not expect to be material to fiscal 2020 results. At the end of fiscal 2020, we now expect our exposure to Chinese goods to be at low-teens percentage of our merchandise spent versus our previous guidance of mid-teen. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance reflects our updated operating profit range as well as lower interest expense, expectation, post refinancing and a slightly lower tax rate.","We continue to expect inventory levels to be lower at year-end versus 2019 and adjusted free cash flow is expected to be above fiscal 2019 level. To close out my comments, we are intensely focused on delivering our operational and financial commitments for holiday. I'm confident that we are on the right path to continue reducing costs to fund our transformation growth priorities, while optimizing working capital to enable higher free cash flow.","And now I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A section.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Paul, your line is open.","Paul Lejuez","Just wanted to circle back on your Black Friday comments, you said it was in line with expectations, so that means specifically that it was within that down 2% to 4% that you were looking for the fourth quarter. And then second, you mentioned that the Kay and Jared were driven by clearance. Can you quantify how much that did impact your third quarter comps and I wasn't quite sure I understood the comments about how the clearance activity did not impact merchandise margin or wasn't included in your comments that merchandise margins were flat, maybe if you could just expand on that a little bit? Thanks.","Gina Drosos","So thanks, Paul the comps for the quarter - the mentioned was about clearance for Kay and Jared and Kay and Jared did have higher clearance sales, clearance level of selling and it really drove their comp however underneath that. We are pleased with the performance of new product. I would say also that the Zales and Pagoda businesses were largely driven by irregular price promotional type comps and had normal penetration of clearance activity.","Growth merchandise margins on a non-GAAP basis were relatively flat and - as we look at the merchandise margin. It was lower because of the clearance selling itself. With respect to Black Friday, that is incorporated into our view of guidance, but we're not giving guidance specifically are giving actual results relative to the Black Friday performance.","Paul Lejuez","Maybe just one follow-up, can you talk about sales recapture from stores that are closing, maybe how much that - it could help comps this quarter even this year and what are your typical recapture rates as you look historically?","Gina Drosos","The transference rate is 30% is what we target for our store closures.","Paul Lejuez","And - is that we are seeing currently?","Gina Drosos","We see that broadly in some of the older stores, the regional stores and it differs by banner calls. But we're finding our closing strategy to be effective, but that is our target for our closure. As we've also engaged in additional activity if that help us drive our clienteling and our customers two other locations which are we've incorporated that into this year, selling our sales transference and store closings.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time I will turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.

We also draw your attention to Slide 2 in today\u2019s presentation.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Barnes","Thanks James, and good morning everybody. In the second quarter, we successfully closed the Zale acquisition, and we\u2019re really excited as we continue to move forward with the integration process. I\u2019ll go through some of the major accomplishments that we\u2019ve achieved with our new division in a few minutes, but now that we\u2019ve completed the acquisition, we\u2019ve also made a few changes with regards to how we discuss the operating segments, which you\u2019ll see as we move through this presentation.","In looking at the second quarter, we\u2019re very pleased with our results and the achievements that we\u2019ve made. For the quarter, comps at Signet increased by 4.8% all-in, and organic comps that is Signet comps without the Zale acquisition were up by 6.3%. From a division perspective, Sterling in the UK certainly by the way there. Based on channels, both our eCommerce and our outlets were particularly strong for us. And from a merchandise view, branded bridal, fashion diamonds, and watches, all performed well.","Signet delivered second quarter profit driven by the strong execution of our strategies. Organic operating income was $124.1 million, and that was up by $18.6 million or 17.6%. And organic earnings per share was a $1 and that was up by $0.16 or 19%. For the first four weeks of the third quarter, we have had a very positive start, most notably in Sterling and in the UK We remain very well prepared for the second half and especially for the all-important fourth quarter. Mark is going to discuss some of our initiatives for this important holiday selling season here in a few minutes.","Let\u2019s take a look now at Signet\u2019s second quarter sales performance by our new divisions and SEC operating segments as a result of the sale acquisition. Sterling\u2019s second quarter total sales were $810.4 million, and that was up by $69.3 million or 9.4%. Same-store sales increased by 6.7%, a very strong number. Kay comps led the way with an extremely strong 8.1% increase, while Jared increased by 4.9%, and that\u2019s also a great comp number. The success in Sterling was driven in part by 16.6% increase in eCommerce sales and a variety of branded and non-branded merchandise initiatives. In a few minutes, Mark is going to walk you through our product performance for each of our three major divisions being Sterling, Zale, and the UK. He will also discuss some future opportunities for new merchandise going forward.","The Zale division, which we owned only for the last two months of the quarter, delivered total sales of $247.5 million and had a comp decline of 0.9%. Our UK division\u2019s second quarter total sales were $162.9 million, and that was up by $23.8 million or 17.1%. Same-store sales increased by 4.4% and eCommerce sales increased 61% in total. But to be fair, it was 43% in constant currency. So to put it into a more of a comp basis 43%, hey that\u2019s still a great performance by the UK eCommerce division.","The UK increases were driven principally by the benefits of strategic moves we\u2019ve taken around diamonds and gold base upon better understanding of our customers and the type of products, pricing, and promotions that they require. For the quarter, jewelry and watches increased and were led by branded programs including the Forever Diamond program and Michael Kors.","Signet sales growth was driven in part by eCommerce sales in total of $50.5 million, now that was an increase of 61.9% and that does include all three divisions\u2019 eCommerce sales. So, it\u2019s a non-comp number as it includes Zale as well, still a very, very strong performance. One of the important drivers of Q2 sales was the outlet channel. All remaining ultra outlet stores from the November 2012 acquisition had a store front change to Jared Vault in the second quarter or early in the third quarter. Dollowing the changes, sales improved dramatically.","Most Jared Vaults are not yet fully differentiated from the ultra outlets other than the store front, but additional merchandise distinctions are coming soon and as the benefits are even more apparent in the few stores where we have already reassorted the merchandise, we\u2019re looking forward to the future of the other stores.","Part of the strong year-over-year performance by our outlets could be attributed to the improved positioning of these stores versus last year when the outlook portfolio was really early on in its conversion. That is to say that systems and some field operation initiatives were in place, but merchandising and marketing changes were not, and training of our new associates was still in progress. Now however, we see the many strong benefits of the changes that have been implemented as we drive to a very strong outlet business moving forward. This continues to be one of our powerful strategic initiatives.","Now, looking at our strategic diamond sourcing initiative, this initiative represents approximately 10% of the value of the entire diamond procurement year-to-date. It ensures that we have access to the diamond cuts our guests require so that we can execute our merchandise initiatives. In fact, of the allocations we\u2019re getting, more diamonds are usable in our stores than we actually modeled originally, which is great, and it means we\u2019re having to resell very little on the global market.","We have expanded our relationships with mining industry leaders such as Rio Tinto and we\u2019ve added new companies as sources of supply as well. You\u2019ll hear more about that in the future. Most importantly, the team behind this initiative is becoming a centralized center of excellence, supporting the needs of each of our divisions. ","That concludes my remarks on the second quarter. In my last couple of slides here, I\u2019d like to speak at somewhat higher level about the overall organization we\u2019ve put in place and about the progress we\u2019ve made so far around the Zale acquisition. I\u2019m so excited that the management lineups that we now have, because of the team\u2019s experience and the working relationships with each other and the commitment from the long term, it\u2019s really a great team that we put together.","As you can see on this Slide, we realigned the management of our core business to fit the current and future needs of our company. This strategic realignment will help us to build a stronger organization of the future through people, purpose, and patch thereby allowing us to successfully execute our mission which is very simple, and that is to help our guests celebrate life and express love.","I\u2019d like to think of our new transform organization in terms of one, three, eight. There\u2019s been a lot of exciting changes which I believe will help to lead us to bigger and a brighter future. So, I\u2019m sure you guys are wondering what those one, three, eight means. While, Signet is one great company, and within our company we have three very strong divisions called Sterling Jewelers, which includes both the Kay and Jared brands; the UK comprised primarily of H.Samuel and Ernest Jones; and Zale primarily comprised of Zale\u2019s Piercing Pagoda in the U.S. and then Peoples in Canada. Those are seven incredible national brands with leading market shares and constitute leading market share in all three geographies not just one or two. We consider our eighth brand, which is also very powerful to be the combination of all the regional brands that we have within each division and country.","Now ultimately I\u2019m responsible for all of this but on a more day-to-day basis. I will continue to spend time on corporate functions, support and strategy while our COO, Mark Light a 36 year veteran who knows the heart and the soul of the jewelry business better than anyone I know who are in the operations.","Mark leads the passionate management team which is work so well together. They\u2019re all about team work and collaboration sharing best practices and delivering excellence. Mark and our three division leaders Ed Hrabak, who is newly promoted President of Sterling, Sebastian Hobbs our Managing Director in the UK and George Murray recently promoted to President of Sale have been leaders of teams that has consistently produced outstanding Signet results. They possessed deep understanding of their guests and each of the functional areas within their divisions. In a few moments, you\u2019ll also hear from our new CFO, Michele Santana who I\u2019m also very excited to have here and who I\u2019m certainly enjoying working within the many years to come.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the page and talk about the Zale acquisition and some of the accomplishments that we have made since the May 29th close. We put teams in place to identify the best approaches and opportunities for this integration. The cultural assimilation of the newly combined company is going extremely well. The teams are identifying value creating opportunities and they\u2019ll continue to work together for at least another year. We are making so much progress that I now expect we will deliver a 150 million to 175 million in synergies from this acquisition for the first three years from January 2015 to January 2018.","As I\u2019ve mentioned I could not be happier about the lineup that putting out on the field. First and foremost is about the people. There have been many changes among the Zale leadership team and there have been some modest changes at other levels in the Zale division but nothing unexpectedly disruptive. It\u2019s been good change and again I\u2019m extremely pleased with our reenergized and motivated team that\u2019s ready to move forward in collaboration with all the remaining team members in our combined organization which by the way now numbers approximately 30,000 people strong.","In store operations, for the first time in over 10 years, we\u2019re instituting a managers\u2019 meeting which we call a leadership conference to gear up for the holiday selling season. Modeled after the incredibly successful event that Sterling does every year the Zale leadership conference will bring store managers and other store ups leadership together next month for a multiday conference to learn, practice and get energized about the holiday season strategy products and priorities.","Around procurement, we\u2019ve started to centralize the diamond buying process. We are already seeing incremental savings as we put Signet best practices in place. Regarding merchandising, we are already testing the cross selling of certain collections some of the more high profile brands of Zale or testing in Kay and vice versa. We are leveraging Signet\u2019s media relationships to enhance the media mix and exposure the Zale brands will receive for the 2014, 2015 year. And by combing our investments we\u2019re seeing a net improvement in pricing for the entire company.","We are also leveraging capacity in our backend business model to drive greater effectiveness in cost savings in repair and custom design. In conclusion, as you can see we are making a tremendous amount of progress on this integration. I couldn\u2019t be more excited about the position we\u2019re in today and where we are headed. So with that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Signet President and Chief Operating Officer, Mark Light for some words about our Q2 and second half performance drivers.","Mark Light","","Thank you Mike. We have variety of drivers behind our great Mother\u2019s Day and second quarter. Most notably was due to our sustainable competitive strength that includes our superior customer experience, our exciting merchandise offerings, effective marketing and multichannel approach. The customer experience essential to our success and we remain focused on the training and development of our store teams in each of our three divisions. A good example of our training and development is our managements\u2019 leadership conference that Mike just talked about. Now let me take a little time to talk about global business within each of our three divisions during the second quarter in both our branded and non-branded merchandise programs. ","In our Sterling division our Le Vian and Neil Lane brands continued to do very well along with our colored diamond collection, Artistry and Vivid. In our UK division, the luxury and fashion watch brands continued to perform well along with our bridal diamond brands Forever and Perfect Fit in H. Samuel and Le Vian, Tolkowsky and Neil Lane in our Earnest Jones stores. In the Zale division, the Vera Wang Love Collection, Celebration Diamond Gemstones and the Arctic Brilliance Collection all did well. And an exciting new diamond setting technique is doing very well in all three of our divisions and our Sterling and UK divisions we call them Diamonds in Rhythm and in our sale division it\u2019s called Unstoppable Love. Our marketing efforts generate strong financial returns led by Bridal and successful Mother\u2019s Day programs specifically in our Sterling and UK divisions.","We also saw success across selling channels; eCommerce and outlet sales were up significantly. The eCommerce performance was driven impart by 37 million visitors to our sites and over 50% of them came through mobile devices. ","As we look forward to the second half, we remain confident in our ability to deliver outstanding products rages that meet our guest desires. We have tested a variety of line extensions and new programs with strong results. These examples on slide 10 are among the exciting new collections for the second half. And by the way while still in early days of integration we have already worked with our team at Zale\u2019s of some terrific new brand extension ideas for the future. More on that will be forthcoming as we get momentum behind these ideas and begin testing.","We are pleased to have started the association with the Smithsonian Institute. The Earthly Treasures Smithsonian collection is in select Jared stores and available online. It includes the sale on Blue Sapphire, London Blue Topaz, Sleeping Beauty Turquoise, Morganite, Sugilite, Great Garnet and Jade collection in approximately 60 styles and it\u2019s only offered in our Jared stores. We also launched a new fashion for diamond gemstone and gold design collections inspired by Sofia Vergara\u2019s sense of style. These pieces have both geometric looks to showcase movement and they fill features silver combined with rose and yellow gold along with all gold and all silver designs. These are being tested in our Kay stores.","This spring we expanded our Lois Hi collection and now her handmade collection has diamonds incorporated into some of her designs that are in all of our Jared doors. Additional opportunity is in the line extension of LOIS by Lois Hill, which is in our Kay stores. This collection presents the same DNA as the Jared collection but at price points and styles for the Kay guest. We plan to expand the collections to all Kay stores for this fall. Also within our Kay stores Lowe\u2019s full bridal will be introduced and tested this fall. We also have other promising line extensions such as in our Neil Lane category we\u2019re testing solitaires and men\u2019s rings. And one opportunity with regards to the Zale acquisition around merchandise assortments involves non-productive inventory. ","We will limit the slowest moving inventory for the holiday season making way for more desirable faster moving merchandise in those stores. We are confident we can improve inventory turns in our Zale division not only through inventory management size and merchandise initiatives but also through improving the productivity of our field operations, marketing and other areas that contribute to improve the store to productivity. We intend to use our outlet channel, vendor relationships and other techniques and chances to turn Zale\u2019s inventory at a rate much closer to Sterling\u2019s in the future.","We also have exciting new store concepts in various stages of testing or rollout. Importantly, all real estate be it Kay or Zale outlet or in close is all managed by a centralized best in class Signet team with consistent IRR expectations. A new generation of Kay stores is rolling out featuring more side by side selling, boutiques a consultation room and enhanced technology. Jared Vault stores are fully rolled out completing conversion of our acquired outlet stores. ","Now a gradual merchandise transition is underway to distinguish these stores even more through Kay, Zale and other outlet competition. We\u2019ve also launched five Pandora shopping shop locations within our Jared stores with a selling concert that mirrors Pandora stores.","In the era of eCommerce this probably have updated our mobile apps to complement our mobile and tablet optimized sites for both Kay and Jared brands within our Sterling division. We\u2019ll also launch a digital influence campaign working with bloggers and other social media influences to reach new and expanded audiences. From a marketing perspective, in all three of our divisions, Kay and Jared in the Sterling division, Zale\u2019s and People\u2019s in the Zale division and H. Samuel in the UK division will be increasing TV advertising this fall and each of our divisions will have new TV creative which will help promote some of our new campaigns and promotions.","And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Michele for a run through on the financials.","Michele Santana","Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. So let\u2019s start by reviewing second quarter sales. Mike had offered a similar overview of the numbers on slide four so I will just point out a few brief highlights. Starting with Sterling division, total sales increased 9.4% to $810.4 million which included a same store sales increase of 6.7%. Sales increases were driven by a balance between both the number of transactions and the average transaction price with the number of transactions increasing 5.8% and the average transaction price increasing 4.6%.","The average transaction price increase was driven principally by the mix effect of strong sales in high-tech brand such as Le Vian and Neil Lane. Zale division sales were $247.5 million for the quarter and that includes a $9.3 million unfavorable revenue impact due to purchase accounting adjustments. Under purchase accounting, Zale differed revenue was reduced on the opening balance sheet from a $183.8 million to $93 million resulting in a permanent reset of the associated revenue to be recognized.","This adjustment will continue, they have an unfavorable non-cash impact to Zale revenue over the next several years and will diminish thereafter and hopefully recognized over the estimated claim period. UK total sales increased 17.1% to $162.9 million driven primarily by Ernest Jones. Merchandised transactions in UK increased 4.8% and it was primarily due to higher sales of fashion watches and jewelry and more effective store of that. The average merchandised transaction values decline slightly by 0.9% and that\u2019s primarily driven by sales mix.","Now moving on, over the next couple of slides we\u2019ll look at Signet\u2019s consolidated Q2 performance before we than discuss Signet\u2019s organic results. Our second quarter results include the 65 days of performance of the Zale division. And looking at the year-over-year gross margin rate, SG&A ratio and operating margin, there is an unfavorable movement in these rates due to the acquisition of Zale.","Zale operates for the lower sort of productivity and a less efficient operating cost structure and so therefore present is diluted to Signet\u2019s ratio. Nevertheless, the Zale operations were in line with internal forecast and more accretive to the quarter. Accounting adjustments primarily included a reduction of deferred revenue recognized in relation to expanded service plans, inventory fair value step up amortization as well as the amortization of unfavorable contracts which were all diluted to EPS by $0.10.","Other factors such as SGA rate, which by the way is substantially behind us as we move forward. Capital structure in financing and transaction cost also impacted EPS as outlined on slide 13. Income tax expense was 11.8 million with an effective tax rate of 16.9% for the quarter. The forecasted effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 is 29.3%, which is lower than the 35.1% applied as the first quarter. This reduction of 5.8% in Signet\u2019s effective tax rate primarily reflect the benefit of Signet\u2019s amended capital structure and financing arrangements utilized upon the acquisition of Zale.","This all led to reported earnings per share of $0.72 compared to prior year\u2019s second quarter of $0.84. Next, I\u2019ll walk you through the breakout of operating income by division. Operating income was $83.5 million or 6.8% of sales and that was made up of the following components: Sterling Jewelers operating income of $129.9 million or 16% of division sales, Zale division operating loss of $9.8 million or 4% of division sales.","Now that\u2019s does include a loss of $11.5 million related to acquisition accounting adjustments which we just discussed on the previous slide. Excluding the impact on these accounting adjustments, Zale division\u2019s operating income was $1.7 million or 0.7% of sales and when looking at the Zale division operating income of $1.7 million that consist of $1.4 million from the Zale jewelry operating segment and $0.3 million from the Piercing Pagoda operating segment. UK operating income was $1.1 million or 0.7% of division sales and other, which other consist primarily of our corporate administrative expenses and Signet\u2019s diamond sourcing subsidiary was a lot of $37.7 million and that was principally driven by transaction and severance cost.","To give you better comparability to last year, I\u2019ll share with you our results on our organic basis which exclude the Zale operation accounting adjustments and cost related capital structure and financing as well as severance and transaction cost. Organic gross margin was $340 million, an increase of $30.3 million with a gross margin rate of 34.8% down 40 basis points. This decrease was driven primarily by two factors in the UK division. The first being Signet\u2019s strategic initiatives around diamond and gold program, which reduce the gross margin rate but importantly and successfully drove incremental gross margin dollar. ","The second factor was a shift in merchandised mix as a result of strong watch sales. Organic SG&A was $269.6 million compare to $250.5 million in the prior year second quarter an increase of $19.1 million and as a percentage of sale decreased 90 basis points to 27.6%. And this was driven principally by greater sales leverage on store staff and centralized cost.","Other operating income was $53.7 million or 5.5% organic sales compared to $46.3 million or 5.3% of sales last year. This increase of $7.4 million was primarily driven by higher interest income earned from the higher outstanding receivable balances. Organic operating income in the second quarter was $124.1 million or 12.7% of sale an improvement of 70 basis points. Organic EPS was a $1 and that compares to $0.84 in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 and increase of 19%.","Now let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet and I\u2019ll start with inventory. Net inventories ended the quarter at $2.3 billion and that compares to $1.4 billion in the second quarter last year, an increase of $928 million or 65%. The majority of the increase was driven by the acquisition of Zale, a variety of merchandise initiatives in the sterling division, including branded program both new and expanded as well as new store growth.","U.K. inventory which increased in U.S. dollar due to the impact of foreign currency translation and being more vertically integrated by growing our rough diamond initiative. Then just to add a little bit more color on the biggest driver the addition of Zale inventory. The initial net fair value step up on the Zale inventory was approximately $31 million.","At the end of the second quarter, $27 million remain and that will continue to see recognize in the P&L based on inventory churn and will have the affect of reduction gross margins in Zale. The other item I would point out is that Zale inventory has now reported on a FIFO basis, which is consistent with Signet\u2019s other division.","So let\u2019s move on and discuss in house credit metrics and statistics. In-house credit remains an important component of sterling divisions business. Net accounts receivable increased to $1,316 million compared to $1,152.1 million last year and that\u2019s up 14% driven by higher sales and an increase in the credit penetration rate.","In the year-to-date, credit participation was 60% compare to 57.1% last year. The increase in credit participation is attributed primarily to the credit decision engine improvements, higher outlet participation and strong guest acceptance of our credit offerings. We have recently invested in a new decision engine which preserve credit requirements but more accurately scores applicant which yields more qualified customers.","The average monthly collection rate year-to-date were 12.4% and that compares to 12.6% last year as guest continue to opt more for our regular credit turns which requires lower monthly payments as opposed to the 12 month interest rate program. ","Next I\u2019ll move on to credit statistics focusing on year-to-date metrics which minimizes the affect of seasonality. So on a year-to-date our net debt expense was $64.1 million compare to $57.8 million last year and increase to $6.3 million and this is driven primarily by the growth in the receivable balance from increased credit penetration and change in the credit program mix. Year-to-date other operating income was a $107.7 million compare to $93.3 million last year, an increase of $14.4 million and that\u2019s due primarily to more interest income on a higher outstanding receivable as well as the shift away from interest fee program.","As a percentage of sterling division sales, other operating income in the year-to-date increased 6.3% of sale from 5.8% of sales last year. So the net impact of these two items was income of $43.6 million year-to-date compared to $35.5 million in the prior year, an increase of $8.1 million. Operating improvements made to our decision engine has help to increase credit penetration without adversely affecting the net impact of bad debt. The portfolio continues to perform strongly and that is evidenced by the allowance as a percentage of ending accounts receivable decreasing 20 basis points from 7.2% to 7%. ","Let\u2019s move on to some other highlights on the balance sheet. We now carry $1.4 billion of debt and this debt is very cost efficient at an average interest cost of 2.6%. The Zale acquisition was financed in such a way so as to really balance cost efficiency and end up with an appropriate mix of short, medium and long term debt.","As we continue forward, Signet is committed to maintaining an investment grade rating and the capital allocation strategy that provides for financial flexibility to allow execution of strategic priorities for growth including M&A, protection if a black swan event should arise optimization of Signet\u2019s capital structure and cost to capital and return of excess free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We will remain disciplined but will also flex our capital structure as necessary based on the circumstances such as growth opportunities or economic condition. The Signet management team continue to have a shareholder friendly history that include share buyback, dividend increases, M&A and keeping reasonable cash reserves. We ended the quarter with cash of $215 million as we move into our third quarter, our heavy holiday buying period. ","Now let me share with you our guidance. For the first time our guidance includes the acquisition and integration of Zale. Third quarter Signet comparable store sales are expected to increase 2% to 4%. Now underlying this guidance, we expect ongoing momentum in our Sterling and UK division and slightly positive comps, which should improve sequentially as we continue the work free integration and build to the holiday season. Third quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.12 to $0.18. Adjusted EPS includes the organic EPS and EPS attributable to the Zale operations as well as the impact from capital structure and financing cost. So set differently, adjusted EPS include Signet in this entirety excluding purchase accounting adjustments and transaction cost. ","Now as per these adjustments, purchase accounting adjustment including a deferred revenue impact of $0.10 are expected to be dilutive by $0.14 to $0.12. Transaction cost which primarily consist of integration expenses are expected to be dilutive by $0.09 to $0.07. And if I can just add two final thoughts in this quarter we adjusted EPS guidance. First Zale operations are expected to dilute third quarter EPS by $0.21 to $0.19, which Zale has historically reported losses in over quarter given the small volume in not giving period. And secondly while our adjusted EPS guidance may appear to be lower than last year\u2019s third quarter results, this is really due to Zale and interest expense both embedded in our adjusted EPS guidance.","So apples-to-apples, we anticipate a better Q3 year-over-year and I\u2019d be more than happy to walk you this further Q&A if need be. While we\u2019re also introducing annual EPS guidance and therefore Q4 EPS guidance for the first time and on a one-time basis because of the complexity of modeling in this early stage of integration. Following guidance on this call, we expect to return to giving EPS guidance on a quarter-to-quarter basis.","The annual adjusted EPS projection is $5.38 to $5.54 but remain subject to revision later this year. Zale operations included within the adjusted EPS are expected to be accretive to fiscal 2015 by $0.18 to $0.24. And the annual effective tax rate is anticipated to be 29.3% for fiscal 2015. Capital expenditures guidance for the full year is now $240 million to $260 million up from our last earnings call and that is due to the eminent plan investments in Zale of approximately $55 million.","Looking at net selling square footage that\u2019s projected to grow 45% to 47.5% including Zale or approximately 4% when excluding Zale. And I would also reference you to see our news release for further details by same store concept. Longer term as Mike mentioned, our three year synergy ending January 2018 has been increased to the range of $150 million to $175 million. Finally, I encourage you to see our non-GAAP reconciliation table on slide 21. We are prepared to non-GAAP reconciliation to provide you with a clear view of the components of our business pre and post acquisition and we hope that you find this information helpful and useful. And with that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mike.","Mike Barnes","","Thanks Michele that was great. In conclusion, I\u2019d like to once thank to Signet team members worldwide for their incredible contributions to the successful quarter. And now we\u2019ll be happy to take some time to answer your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Simeon Siegel with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Simeon Siegel - Nomura Securities ","","Mike, so as you continue the successful cross-selling, can you talk about the guardrails you have to ensure the specific concepts maintain their own branded entities, I guess. And then, Michele, if we can take you up on your offer. Can you talk about the organic results and the guidance, maybe how was the U.S. organic gross margin rate this past quarter, any thoughts there going forward, and you had really impressive leverage in the organic SG&A rate this quarter, can you talk about that at all, maybe the right way to think about it and then just lastly you mentioned interest, so if you can share the interest expectations for 3Q, that will be great? Thanks.","Mike Barnes","","Sure. Thanks Simeon. I\u2019ll start off with the first one, and then maybe flip it over to Mark to give a little bit more color to it. We\u2019re working very diligently to preserve the identities of both Kay and Zale, knowing that they\u2019re both in the malls. Now, one thing that a lot of people don\u2019t realize is the cross over is less than I would have expected certainly if I had taken a guess years ago. I think it\u2019s about 55%, Mark, somewhere in that neighborhood. So we have the opportunity to leverage that aspect of the business, but having said that, we do want to have very strong brand identities for both brands, and we are going to work with, we have not announced yet who and how, but we\u2019re going to work with a major third party consultant firm to help us with some brand studies, marketing studies, and identity of studies going forward. Mark, do you want to add anything to that.","Mark Light","The survey of the research we\u2019ll be engaging, as Mike said, not only he\u2019s talked to consumers and understand what\u2019s going on with the brands, but we\u2019re also going to look at some other companies that have the separate brands with separate divisions, so we\u2019re going to be very thoughtful and methodical on what we do with this, it is a big question not only to our customers but to our people, but this fall we will be testing, it is one data point for us, we\u2019ll be testing 50 Kay stores that will be carrying Vera Wang, and we\u2019ll have 50 Zale stores that will be carrying Neil Lane and be carrying Le Vian, and we\u2019ll also have Open Hearts by Jane Seymour up in Canada in our People stores, and then also be testing Le Vian and Neil Lane up in Canada. So it will be a good data point for us to understand the effects within each store and within the effects store by store.","Mike Barnes","So just to add on to that before we move on to your second question, bottom line is we\u2019re going to do the same thing we always do. We\u2019re going to test before we invest in markets put together these incredible tests that I think are going to give us a lot of information. We\u2019re also going to work with the third party organization to help us with this process, and I\u2019ll tell you that I have never been more excited about this acquisition than I am today. The integration progress is going along very well. I am not wearing rose-colored glasses here just to you guys know. I know we\u2019re going to run into some headwinds along the way and there is going to be issues to deal with. But you know what, we have got the most collaborative experienced management team that I could ever hope for working on this. So I am very excited about the future, and Michele you want to go into the other points?","Michele Santana","Sure, so let me take you through the guidance in a little bit more detail that we provided for the third quarter relating to organic EPS. So, we talked about the adjusted EPS being in the range of $0.12 to $0.18, and when you back out what we provided in terms of the Zale guidance, the $0.21 to $0.19 that kind of leads you to an organic EPS plus financing cost in the range of about $0.33 to $0.37. ","Now, what I would say is, you should think about interest costs very similar to the impact that it had this quarter, and that's kind of roughly about $0.10 impact. So, assume $0.10 on the financing which would really get you to an organic EPS in the range of about $0.42 to $0.43, up to $0.46. So hopefully that\u2019s helpful from in terms of thinking of the organic EPS guidance.","I think one of your other questions related to gross margins in the U.S., so giving you a little bit more color on that. The gross margin in Sterling Jewelers division did increased as a percentage of sales by 10 basis points, and that benefit was favorably impacted by both sales mix as well as lower commodity cost. You get a little bit of an offset in there as we\u2019re still kind of winding down the gold hedge losses that we have incurred in fiscal 2014, but I would say substantially that\u2019s behind us just a little bit more to go. And I believe your other question related to SG&A leverage and how to think about that as we move forward. Again, when we think kind of full year, we expect to continue to see leverage on our SG&A rate driven by sales growth.","Operator","The next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to hear your early thoughts as you begin the integration of Zale, are there a lot of SG&A investments that need to be made this year to get their stores and sales force up to Signet standards, and is that all factored into your guidance?","Mike Barnes","The answer is yes and yes. We are making a lot of SG&A investment. We are holding a leadership conference for Zale for the first time in well over 10 years and we think it\u2019s going to be powerful quite frankly. I mean we have done this annually for the Sterling division for many, many, many years. It\u2019s always been kind of the culmination of starting off our holiday selling season. It really gets the associates and store managers very excited about what we\u2019re going to drive for the holiday selling seasons. They haven\u2019t had that at Zale. And they\u2019re looking forward to it by the way. We\u2019ve had regional management meetings Mark Light, myself and George Murray the President of Zale. We have sat down with the regional managers, we sat with the district managers and we talked about the opportunities going forward and quite frankly I\u2019ve never seen more excitement. When we got the Q&A we\u2019ve a lot of questions from people and that were great questions and people are engaged and that\u2019s really the key here.","They are engaged in the business, they are engaged and then willing to move forward, we\u2019ve made the management transitions that needed to be made, the people that wanted to opt out did and that\u2019s great them, wish them the best, all the best because that were very helpful in this transition quite frankly and I have a lot of respect for both Theo and his management team but you know what, we\u2019ve a new management team going forward. The people are excited and we\u2019re going to make investments in things like leadership conferences that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.","One of the things that we\u2019ve always sold out there, is that one of our strategic strengths was people and the way that we develop people for the future, the way that we lead them to drive the store sales and it really take us to the future and that\u2019s we\u2019ve always said, the people are most important thing in our company and we believe that and this sales team is incredible, let me tell you there is some unbelievable people down there.","Unfortunately, we\u2019ve been spent a lot of time down there in August was damn hot and I wish it wasn\u2019t but what we\u2019ve found is that the people have just got this great energy and this great excitement about moving forward and taking this thing into the future and so it\u2019s really is a great thing but we\u2019ll invest in that and it have all been built into our forecast numbers and believe me it is a great investment in the future of this company and we believe that we\u2019re going to start seeing some wonderful results starting with the holiday selling season fourth quarter.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","","Great and as you, what was biggest surprised that caused you to change the synergy target so quickly?","Mike Barnes","","Well, I think it\u2019s really a matter of the fact that, when we looked at synergies initially it\u2019s before the close and we\u2019ve to put those numbers out there and as always we took a fairly conservative prudent approach to what we put out there. And we had always hoped that we would find more synergy numbers but I tell you, as we dig into this and Mark, I\u2019ll let him jump in here next because he is an experienced operator in the jewelry industry the most experienced quite frankly and he sees things every day, they are going to be productive to our future in terms of how we can leverage things between all of our divisions not just Zale and Sterling but also the UK division, which he\u2019s been working very closely for the past year.","So, Mark, you want to jump in there with some thoughts.","Mark Light","","Yes, to Mike\u2019s point before the announcement we didn\u2019t have visibility really into the business. So the more and more we get involved in, the reality is Zale and Sterling do the same thing, they sell jewelry to middle market sector and that company has been start for investments in their business and they are operating the company more I would say as a turnaround company as opposed to how we operate, for instance, on how to grow and capture additional market share. So, there is a lot of areas of the business that I\u2019ll be specific on that, we just see best practices that we can enable and work with the Zale management team and the Zale people and to Mike\u2019s point they\u2019re very excited, they understand they looked across the hallway and allows the Kay doors and saw investments in technology, saw investments in additional brands, saw investments in advertising, saw investments in merchandising assortments and they are now they\u2019re excited about the opportunities going forward, they have Signet\u2019s invest in those parts of the business that they haven\u2019t had for years. So yes, with the more and more we get involved the more bullish we\u2019re about the opportunities for the Zale division.","Mike Barnes ","","Yes, and it\u2019s still early days. We hope to find a whole lot more ability to leverage our success across all of our divisions going forward but we think it\u2019s a prudent number taken up by 50% to 75% to 150 million to 175 million at this time and we\u2019re confident and being able to deliver those synergy. Hopefully there is more as we go forward but we\u2019ll wait and see.","Operator","","The next question is from Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee","","Hey everyone, good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congrats everyone on a great integration so far. I guess first question to Michele, for the fiscal year the 538 to 554 just want to make sure I think about it right, does that include a $1 adjusted number for Q2? And then also for Q3 and Q4 just for modeling to help us out, can you help us with what the interest rate and tax rate should like for those two quarters? And last Mike, just the Zale progression throughout the quarter and I know it sounds like the business was negative in the first couple of weeks, can you just talk about what you saw as the quarter kind of progress and you get your arms around the business?","Michele Santana","","Yes, so let me start just in terms of the annual guidance we provided with the 538 to 554 that would include our Q2 adjusted results as well and also as I pointed out it includes our finance expense in there. So, for the second quarter I kind of indicated roughly finance equated to about a $0.10 impact EPS. We would expect a similar impact in Q3 and Q4 each of those quarters, now that is fairly normalize interest expense that we can expect to incur. And in terms of tax rate our annual effective tax rate of 29.3% is really what you should end up seeing within each of those quarters. Q2 is a little bit of a strange with our lower rate because again given that we have that lower annual effective tax rate in a higher rate in Q1, it squeezes that quarterly rate down lower but you should expect the 29.3% effective tax rate for Q3 and Q4.","Mike Barnes","The only other thing I would to that Ike is, the team has done a great job in structuring our capital bases and how we did the financing of this deal and how it affects the results for our business going forward. There\u2019s probably going to be some future benefits, not huge may be but additional future benefits because we have not had the benefit of this structure for year. So you might think about that as well.","Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee","And Mike the progression of Zale is throughout the quarter is kind of what you saw?","Mike Barnes","I\u2019m sorry?","Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee","Just the progression of Zale, because I mean Zale started up negative diverse coupled with Q4?","Mike Barnes","Yes. Well, let\u2019s talk about that a little bit. That\u2019s a great question. Zale announced that they didn\u2019t have the best Mother\u2019s Day results, which is the strongest part of the quarter. We only own them for the past two months of the quarter and the few months of the quarter and not during that period. Obviously there\u2019s been a lot of transition, integration work going on, lot of operational work, we\u2019re working on inventories. And so I would say there\u2019s been some distraction in the Zale business. They still were accretive to us in the quarter slightly accretive. Obviously, what I\u2019m really excite about is the opportunity in fact, from where they are today to where they can be. And they\u2019ve got the team to do it. They\u2019ve got some great people out there. And with the leadership that I think that we can help to provide them although they already have some great leadership out there in the field. I tell you this district manager and resell manager team, it was a joy to meet with them and work with them. And I think that when we put our collective knowledge together that it just going to be explosive and that overtime, it\u2019s going to take some time, but we\u2019re going to drive that business. We have really been focused on the fourth quarter and we have totaled everyone in both Sterling the U.K. and Zale, don\u2019t let anything to distract you from delivering that important holiday selling season in the fourth quarter. The second quarter, we\u2019re finalizing this deal, we\u2019re getting it done. The third quarter we\u2019re going to be doing a lot of integration work, we\u2019re going to be changing things around. We\u2019re going to be imparting a lot of knowledge from one division to another et cetera. But the fourth quarter, don\u2019t let anything stop you from going out there and executing it at the point of sale. Don\u2019t let operational things get into way, it\u2019s all about helping our customers do two things and that\u2019s to celebrate life and express love that\u2019s our mission statement, everything else you know is only meant to provide those two end results quite frankly. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. And what that does it has a flowing effect and if cash stays down, it increases earnings for our company. It increases our ability to deliver results for our shareholders and to return to capital to our shareholders, et cetera. So all of this things working together, I think are going to be a powerful combination and this is going to be an absolutely incredible transformational acquisition for this industry.","Operator","The next question is from Oliver Chen with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup","Regarding Zale Corp and your comments on this inventory opportunity there, what\u2019s the nature of the more productive inventory that you can add? And as we look to Zale Corp going forward, we\u2019re comp drivers amongst opportunistic in terms of pricing versus units. Also just the second question on a holiday, if you could highlight what you\u2019re most excited about on a year-over-year basis with respect to marketing? And your thoughts on the pricing and merchandise margin opportunity as we go through holiday; it\u2019s not an easy environment out there with the promotional kind of noise that\u2019s possible.","Mike Barnes","Thanks, Oliver. I appreciate your questions. I\u2019ll kind of start off and then kick it over to Mark and then Michele will kind of have you on a team basis here, a tag-team approach. But to begin with, we have found a lot of unproductive inventory. And our thoughts were -- what, let\u2019s get it out of there, let\u2019s get rid of the unproductive inventory and let\u2019s invested inventory to take this company forward. And we have the ability to do this, so let just make it happen. There is no secret in the fact that our terms have been substantially higher than Zale terms in the past. And we intend to close that gap it\u2019s going to take some time. I think Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks that we\u2019re really working on up in their inventory returns over time and give us a little bit of time to do that but this is a great start for us to pull out a lot of unproductive inventory and to really build back into some very productive inventory. Mark you can talk about some of the drivers that you expect for the fourth quarter.","Mark Light","","Yes. First, we look at the unproductive inventory, but these determine was unproductive and more importantly as we\u2019re going to invest in money and we look at the fast turning classifications of best selling brands, the faster turning programs and quite frankly and even there is a little bit spark we won\u2019t getting the appropriate refurbishments of maximize sales. So the first place is the most productive programs and products that they have and that\u2019s all going to reinvest, where we\u2019re excited on the futures if you look at the Zale\u2019s store and their brand portfolio in comparison with Kay store brand portfolio, you notice that Kay has a lot more brand. So we believe there is a opportunities to continue to expand Zale\u2019s brand portfolio to a thoughtful methodical strategic testing before we invest methodology we believe there is a great potential to get involve with more brands have opportunity to start future with Zale. We\u2019re also excited just about some of the basis where we started investing in Zale systems and sharing our inventory size best practice with Zale we just think there is going to be a lot of opportunities just in refurnishing the assortment of the generic inventory. ","Mark Light","Also notwithstanding the comp results of Zale during the second quarter or we saw a incredible result as Mark was just mentioning in some of their branded opportunities. Vera Wang continues to be a strong brand for them. The celebration diamond collection continues to have a lot of strength. I think to Mark\u2019s point unstoppable love which is the moving diamond that we talked about that is so powerful right now, they just had invested enough into it and didn\u2019t have the proper inventory to drive the business during the important parts of the selling seasons and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on with them. We believe that overtime we\u2019re going to create synergy that with collaboration of all the divisions that we can have expertise in inventory management and how to drive sales through the execution of how we buy and sale our inventory over the future and that\u2019s going to make the big difference in how you see turns in this industry going forward at least within our company. And Michele, do you want to take the financial question?","Michele Santana","","What was the financial element Oliver I\u2019m sorry, do you have financial question there as well?","Oliver Chen \u2013 Citigroup","","Yes, I was curious about as you do engage in the journey as well, what comp drivers you think will be the biggest factors in terms of units or transactions or maybe a combination of both?","Mike Barnes","","I will jump on that, Oliver, because I think that is a great question. One of the things that we have seen at Zale, I think it is important to call this out and we really haven't talked about it today much, is the fact that while comps in the second quarter were not particularly great, what was great was margin. We continue to see increased -- strong increase in margin and I think one of the things that Mark and his team are really going to have to tackle is a strong look at the balance between driving sales and driving margin. This has been one of the big things that we have worked on in the UK over the past year and quite frankly with some ideas behind especially our diamond business, which is not as strong in the UK and which is becoming much more stronger now with the collaboration with the US team, Mark and his team working with the UK, I think the same thing at Zale. We really need to figure out the appropriate balance between driving sales and driving margins with the overall goal of driving profitable store growth long term. That is what it is all about. It is all about profitable growth, long-term consistent results. That is really all that matters to us, not about the short term. They have done great in driving margin up, especially as cost inputs have come down over the last couple of years, but we need to drive the sales as well. And I think with the team working together that we will start to see a balance similar to what we are seeing at Sterling and that is a balance of comps being driven by a combination almost equal of transaction and cost depending on where cost inputs go in the future. But right now, what I see is a healthy balance. There have been many years where it has been driven by cost alone at the expense of transactions and there were years a long time ago where it was driven by transaction and not cost. But right now, I think there is a pretty healthy balance and I think we are in a good position to help get that team onto the right page in terms of balancing driving their sales and maintaining their margins. The bottom line is that they have done well from an operating income standpoint, but we believe that there is a lot more opportunity out there.","Oliver Chen \u2013 Citigroup","","Thank you. And Michele that\u2019s really helpful, what are your thoughts in the holiday season with pricing and merchandise margin Mike I know how last year given from volatility in the traffic you guys strategically levered some allowances set to offer better deals. So how are you thinking about that with respect to the upcoming season?","Mike Barnes ","Are you talking about in terms of promotions?","Oliver Chen","Yes.","Mike Barnes ","Right now I think that and Mark can speak to this as well as Michele I feel like from a promotional standpoint we\u2019re probably going to be somewhat in line with prior years. We don\u2019t really see the need at this point to drive additional promotional activity out there. Our expectation is not that this season is going to be highly promotional or highly discounted. We\u2019ll see what the competition does. But we think that we can maintain our status in terms of driving sales and margins on a fairly balanced basis without having to go overboard anyway promotionally.","Michele Santana","Yes, and I would just echo that, Oliver, that the goal would be broadly maintain margins. Again, I would just point out that when we are all in, including the Zale operation, Signet's overall margins will be dilutive just given that they currently are operating at a different cost structure, but hence the opportunity on a going-forward basis.","Operator","Dorothy, your line is open. Dorothy Lakner, Topeka Capital Markets.","Dorothy Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","In terms of the 150 million to 175 million in synergies I wondered if you could break that down a little bit in terms of where that\u2019s coming from piece by piece. Secondly, I know Mark spoke to eliminating the non-productive inventory at Zale prior to the holiday. I just wanted to make if you could clarify that. I just want to understand how that process is going to work. And then on the Jared Vault just how the new merchandise initiatives are going to rolled or the timing in terms of the rollout of merchandising initiatives there? Thanks.","Michele Santana","So Dorothy let me take the first part of your question dealing with the breakdown of the synergy target of 150 million to 175 million. Previously, we had disclosed our initial target of 100 million we had provided about 50 million of that would come from margin sourcing opportunities about 20 million from SG&A savings and then about another the residual 30 million coming from cross selling and repair service opportunities. So what I would say is I think looking at the 150 million to 175 million range I would tell you to broadly think about that in the same terms as what we had previously provided for the breakdown of that.","And again I think some elements of it might come a little bit bigger than others we\u2019re still kind of looking at that three year full fiscal period. And then I think your second question was dealing with non-productivity inventory so maybe Mark you want to jump in on that.","Mark Light","Reference to non-productive inventory, we started pulling out inventory in July a large bulk of the inventories with the three months process we start in July we\u2019ll go through August and September a large proponent to the inventories being pulled out this month which kind of is another issue that relates to the Zale\u2019s numbers so their stores will work on pulling inventory out and they\u2019ll be pretty much finished in September pulling out the inventory and we will start replenishing the faster more productive inventory that will start coming into the stores September, October and into beginning of November. So we\u2019ll see the lot of benefits of that inventory obviously in the fourth quarter.","As far as Jared Vault goes the new merchandise products which was going to differentiate the Jared Vault stores from all the other outlet competitors will have a little bit more of the Jared players so we\u2019ll have Pandora in some of our Jared Vault stores we\u2019ll have a different type of offering there is so much like is in some of our Jared stores but it with the product that is different from that the Kay or Zale\u2019s and competitor sets so all of the new inventory for the Jared Vault stores will be in the stores by the beginning of the fourth quarter by November 1st.","Mike Barnes ","One of the things that we probably haven\u2019t driven home as well as maybe we should have is number one I tell you that this outlet opportunity has been a terrific opportunity for us as we converted the Ultra Stores into Kay\u2019s and now the remaining ones into Jared Vault\u2019s we\u2019re seeing incredible opportunities to really grow the productivity of that business and it\u2019s exciting. And now one thing that we shouldn\u2019t overlook in the Zale acquisition is that they were right up there with us in terms of outlet business and number of stores. So we have a much more powerful portfolio to move forward with and we\u2019re going to be able to drive a much more powerful business. We have learned a tremendous amounts as we have put a big focus on outlets following the Ultra acquisition and its worked. So we\u2019re excited about where we go from that entire business is going and by the way we\u2019re testing it in the UK. Mark has worked with Seb. They have put together a test of 5 to 6 stores?","Mark Light","","5 to 6 stores just well led Ernest Jones\/collections that will be testing in half of dozen stores in this fall in the UK also.","Dorothy Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets ","","Great.","Mike Barnes ","","So we\u2019re keeping the foot on the pedal in this thing and it\u2019s totally working for us at this point and we\u2019re just excited about the growth in the business. ","Dorothy Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets ","","That\u2019s perfect and just one more housekeeping question; I just wanted to understand mixture on the interest expense we should be modeling for the third and the fourth quarter?","Michele Santana","","Yes, so Dorothy, on interest expense component, we\u2019ll follow broadly similar to what we saw in the Q2 and if you pick up the interest expense of the P&L and kind of ran it down that was about a $0.10 impact. So what I would say, looking at Q3, Q4 it\u2019s a $0.09, $0.10 impact of how you should be thinking about.","Mike Barnes ","","Alright, thanks Dorothy and at this point we have time for probably one more question before we run so, please go ahead operator.","Operator","","Last question is from Jeff Stein with Northcoast Research, please go ahead.","Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research","","Okay, I would like to have question A and question B real quickly. First of all, Mark, I just want to make sure I understand what do you do with the inventory that you\u2019re pulling out of Zale store and how does that run through the P&L and is that one of the comp drivers that you see? And then second part is, high level given fact that you\u2019ve taken the synergy guidance up from 150 to 175 and looking at all the puts and takes, do you see the accretion for next year still being high single-digit in the first 12 months? Thank you.","Mark Light","","Okay, I will deal with the first part of the inventory and then turn it over to Michele on how we deal with the accounting of it. There are several options, Jeff, in what we do with the inventory. One is that we work with our vendor community and we talk about working with them on some deals on how we can send back product and repurchase other product. There are other options. We have over almost 300 outlet doors that we have a lot of outlet doors, which is the perfect place to liquidate and get rid of this type of inventory. So those are the two main areas, the two main vehicles that we are looking at.","Michele Santana","","Yes, and Jeff from a P&L standpoint, so with the opening balance sheet how we go through and determine the fair value step up of inventory is also considering any component of non-productive inventory. So that kind of get swept up in part of that process. So, when we look at what happens from the P&L standpoint, effectively what we\u2019ve done is, we\u2019ve written that inventory down to the value that we would expect to receive and a recovery on. So as that clears out and we liquidate that inventory or return it back to the vendors that we\u2019ll get and added in the P&L at the same time or receiving the recovery. So dollar wise it should not really have an impact to the gross margin dollars now it will end up impacting the rate because it is really a zero amount that\u2019s going to be running through there so I would expect some slight impact.","And then I think your second question relating to with the increase in synergies and how do we think of next year with Zale operations and as accretion I think at this point we\u2019re still committed to what we\u2019ve said before was it being high single-digit accretive and I would say at this time that view has not changed and potentially maybe there is opportunity for us to revisit half of that where we sit today.","Operator","","That was the final question; I\u2019d now turn the call back to Mr. Barnes.","Mike Barnes","","Thank you and thank you all for taking part in this call we really appreciate your interest and your support. Our next earnings call will occur in November when we\u2019re going to review our third quarter results. I hope you all have a great day, great holiday weekend and thanks again and good bye.","Operator","","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. "],"18772":["Signet Jewelers Limited (NYSE:SIG) Q1 2014 Earnings Call May 23, 2013  8:30 AM ET","Executives","James Grant","Michael W.

My name is Larissa, and I'll be operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Mr.  James Grant, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","James Grant","Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2014 earnings call. On our call today are Mike Barnes, CEO; and Ron Ristau, CFO. The presentation deck we will be referencing is available from the financial section of our website, www.signetjewelers.com.","During today's presentation, we will, in places, discuss Signet's business outlook and make certain forward-looking statements. Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. We urge you to read the risk factors, cautionary language and other disclosures in the annual report on Form 10-K that was filed with the SEC on March 28, 2013. We also draw your attention to Slide #2 in today's presentation.","I will now turn the call over to Mike.","Michael W. Barnes","Thanks, James, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our outstanding first quarter results. We delivered a strong financial performance in the first quarter, driven by the excellent execution of our strategies, which led the sales growth and expense leverage. Our comps at Signet increased by 6.4%. The U.S. division comps grew 8.1% on top of the 1.2% increase last year. And then the U.K. comps declined by 2.3%. We also had tremendous continued momentum within our consolidated eCommerce space, as we grew by 40.7%. Of significance, as of 2012, Signet is now the #3 largest eCommerce retailer in the jewelry category. That is up from 2009  when we stood at #11. It's a great performance for our eCom team. Altogether, this led to operating income of $142.8 million, 10.4%. And diluted earnings per share were a record $1.13, up $0.17 or 17.7%.","So let's begin by taking a look at the U.S. division performance. In the U.S., total sales were $858.6 million, up $107.1 million or 14.3%. Our sales growth was driven by broad-based strength across all merchandise categories in both Kay and Jared, as well as the Ultra acquisition. Kay and Jared experienced increases in transaction counts, and Kay in particular, increased in average transaction value. U.S. same-store sales increased by 8.1% in the first quarter. Kay comps increased 10.2%, while Jared increased by 6%. The success in both concepts was driven, in part, by a successful Valentine's Day period, but also by broad-based strength across all merchandise categories through most of the quarter, particularly in bridal and a strong lead into Mother's Day.","And then in the U.S., as I mentioned earlier, eCommerce performed strongly with sales up $8.3 million to $25.6 million, an increase of 48% for the U.S. division. The U.S. division also delivered operating profit growth of 11% with a 17.8% operating margin. Excluding the dilutive effect of the Ultra acquisition, operating income increased 13.7% and operating margin was 19%, up 70 basis points, a record level for the first quarter. It was another great quarter for the U.S. team members.","The drivers of our performance were our sustainable competitive strengths. In particular, our great customer experience, our investment marketing and broad customer acceptance of our powerful merchandise offerings. The customer experience is central to our success and we remain focused on training and development of our store teams, including the best use of in-store sales enhancing technology. Branded, differentiated and exclusive merchandise continue to perform very well, virtually, across the board. Our marketing investment for Valentines and Mother's Day again proved very effective, with increased impressions helping us drive strong sales performances and building the value of the brand equity of both our store concepts and our merchandise collections. We also saw success selling across channels. As I mentioned, U.S. eCommerce sales were up 48%. This was driven, in part, by 18 million visitors to our sites and over 1\/3 of those were through mobile devices.","Now I'll turn the U.K. Total sales in the quarter were $135 million, down $13.5 million or 9.1%. Comp sales decreased 2.3% compared to an increase of 1.2% in the first quarter last year. The total sales decline was due to a same-store sales decrease, primarily in H.Samuel, the impact of closed stores and currency fluctuations. In Ernest Jones, the number of transactions increased and we experienced strength in the bridal business and watches, excluding Rolex, which is being offered in pure stores in the U.K. In H.Samuel, the number of transactions declined, resulting in lower sales across most merchandise categories.","eCommerce sales were $5.5 million, which was up $0.7 million or 14.6%, a nice double-digit gain. Our U.K. websites attracted 7.7 million visitors in the quarter and 42% of those were through mobile devices. Operating loss was $4.1 million, an increase of $1.1 million from the last year, primarily due to lower sales that's partially offset by cost reductions. I would like to thank our U.K. team members for their strong efforts in what continues to be a very challenging market.","We are well positioned to achieve our fiscal 2014 financial objectives. This is due to our excellent first quarter results in both top and bottom line, strong Mother's Day results, as we have moved into the second quarter, and our consistent ability to execute initiatives by focusing on our competitive strengths, which are our people. It always starts with them. Our brands and the overall strength of our merchandise offerings, our sector leading advertising, the strength of our real estate portfolio, our supply chain leadership, particularly in the U.S. our in-house customer finance programs, and finally, our strong financial position.","And now I'll turn the call over to Ron for a little more color.","Ronald W. Ristau","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by explaining sales in more detail. For the quarter total sales for Signet increased 10.4% to $993.6 million compared to $900 million last year. Same-store sales increased 6.4% compared to 1.2% growth last year. In the U.S., total sales increased 14.3% or $107.1 million to $858.6 million, which included the same-store sales increase of 8.1% that Mike discussed. Our non-same-store sales were up 6.2%, with non-comp stores generating an increase of 1.6% and Ultra adding 4.6%.","The U.S. sales increases, again, were driven by broad-based strength across all merchandise categories in both Kay and Jared, as well as the Ultra acquisition. Kay and Jared experienced increases in transaction counts of 6.6% and 10.3%, respectively. In addition, Kay increased average transaction value by 4.9%.","In the U.K., total sales decreased 9.1% or $13.5 million to $135 million, while comp store sales decreased 2.3%. The total sales decline was due to a same-store sales decrease of $3.1 million, primarily in H.Samuel, the impact of closed stores of $4.8 million and currency fluctuations of $5.6 million, which were unfavorable. Signet eCommerce sales were $31 million, up $9 million or 40.7%, continuing their strong trend, as Mike referenced.","Now let's take a look at the components of operating income. Our gross margin was $382.8 million, an increase of $29.1 million. The gross margin rate was 38.5%, down 80 basis points. The inclusion of the results for Ultra increased gross margin dollars by $8.8 million, however, reduced the consolidated gross margin rate by 50 basis points and the U.S. gross margin rate by 60 basis points. The Ultra gross margin is lower than the core U.S. business due to lower store productivity and the impact of the integration. Ultra gross margins are expected to improve as the Ultra integration and conversion to Kay outlets is completed.","The remaining 30 basis point reduction in the consolidated gross margin was attributed to the following changes in the U.S. and the U.K. businesses. Our gross margin dollars in the U.S., excluding Ultra, increased $24.1 million, reflecting higher sales, partially offset by a gross margin rate decrease of 70 basis points. The gross merchandise margin was impacted by merchandise mix, new bridal and Jared test programs, which were designed to further increase our competitive positioning in the bridal category and the impact of the Mother's Day sales shifts.","Gross margin in the U.K. decreased $3.8 million, primarily reflecting the impact of decreased sales and currency fluctuations. Currency translation costs were $1.5 million of the $3.8 million decline. The gross margin rate declined 20 basis points, as increased gross merchandise margins were offset by deleveraging of expenses on lower sales.","Our selling, general and administrative expenses were $287 million, and as a percentage of sales decreased 50 basis points to 28.9%. This was primarily due to leverage on advertising and store staff costs. I will discuss this in more detail in a moment. Other operating income was $47 million or 4.8% of sales, compared to $40.2 million or 4.5% of sales last year. This increase was primarily due to higher interest earned from higher outstanding receivable balances.","So our consolidated operating income in the first quarter increased $13.4 million to $142.8 million, representing 14.4% of sales, which was flat to prior year. However, excluding Ultra, our consolidated operating margin would have been 15.3%, up 90 basis points over the prior year. The U.S. division's operating income, including Ultra, was $152.8 million or 17.8% of sales compared to $137.7 million or 18.3% of sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. When we exclude Ultra, the U.S. division's operating income was $156.6 million, or 19% of sales, up 70 basis points. The operating loss for the U.K. division was $4.1 million, an increase of $1.1 million. Our consolidated operating income increase led to fully diluted earnings per share of $1.13, up 17.7%. If we were to exclude Ultra, fully diluted earnings per share were $1.16 up 20.8%. Under this scenario, it was a very strong performance.","Now some additional detail on SG&A expenses. Again, the SG&A expenses are $287 million compared to $264 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, up $22.5 million. And as a percentage of sales, they decreased by 50 points to 28.9%. SG&A spending was well controlled, and leverage was realized on both advertising and store expenses, particularly in the U.S. SG&A expenses in the U.K. were reduced by $2.7 million, reflecting the impact of cost reductions and currency fluctuations, while they did deleverage slightly on lower sales. The inclusion of the results for Ultra increased SG&A in this quarter by $12.6 million and increased the consolidated SG&A rate by 30 basis points. We expect a reduction in Ultra SG&A going forward as the integration is completed. If we exclude Ultra, the rate was 28.6%, an improvement of 80 basis points. So SG&A spending was well controlled in the quarter.","Turning to our share authorization, of course, we continuously look at a variety of ways to deliver shareholder returns. Beyond reinvesting in our operations, we have taken a shareholder-friendly view towards our use of cash. In the first quarter, we completed the $350 million share repurchase program by purchasing approximately 749,000 shares of Signet stock at an average price of $66.92. Over the life of the program, which launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we have repurchased 7.4 million shares at an average cost of $47.10. We ended the quarter with cash of $263.7 million, and we remain committed to ending the fiscal year with cash on hand equal to 7% to 9% of our annual sales. We will continue to review with our board future options for the creation of shareholder value.","Net inventories ended the quarter at $1,426 million, an increase of $91.4 million or 6.8% from a year ago. Again, this increase is primarily due to a $49.8 million increase in inventory for Ultra, $31.5 million of diamond inventory associated with our strategic sourcing initiative, expansion of our bridal programs and new store growth. Partially offsetting these increases were management actions to improve churn. Excluding Ultra, our inventory increased only 3.1% and was very well controlled. We continue to believe our inventory remains the best controlled in the specialty jewelry industry.","Our credit portfolio also continued to perform strongly. Accounts receivable were $1,157.5 million, up 12.9% due to higher credit sales driven principally by an increase in our bridal business. Credit participation as a percentage of U.S. sales, excluding sales from Ultra, which doesn't provide credit currently, was 57.7%. This compares to 55.8% in the first quarter of last year and 56.9% for the full fiscal 2013. The increase, again, was primarily driven by higher bridal sales. Our average monthly collection rate was 13.4% compared to 13.8% last year and net bad debt expense, which was $21.3 million, represented 2.5% as a percentage of U.S. sales, flat to prior year. Finally, our other operating income increased primarily due to higher interest income from higher outstanding receivables balances.","Now turning to our second quarter guidance. As we referenced in the 8-K we filed back in January 15 of 2013, the company continues to expect the shift of the Mother's Day sales this year, partially into the first quarter, to impact our second quarter sales and earnings performance. In addition, integration costs and the seasonality of the company's newly acquired Ultra Stores are expected to be dilutive to the second quarter EPS. The company continues to expect the integration of Ultra Store systems and the conversion to Kay outlets to occur as planned in the second quarter, and Ultra to contribute positively to performance by the fourth quarter of the year. As such, for the second quarter of fiscal 2014, the company currently expects same store sales to increase in the low- to mid-single digit range. Earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.79 to $0.84, which includes a $0.06 per share negative impact from the Ultra acquisition referenced above. The Ultra loss expectation is approximately $0.03 greater than originally anticipated due to a potential decrease in sales short term, as we complete key steps in the transition this quarter.","EPS, excluding Ultra, are in the range of $0.85 to $0.90. I'd like to please note that the majority of the $0.09 loss that we are expecting for both the first and second quarter combined of Ultra, is attributed to nonrecurring cost for duplicative overhead, severances and unnecessary office space, and will not repeat next year or into the second half of this year.","For the full fiscal 2014 year, the company continues to expect capital expenditures in the range of $180 million to $195 million, which includes costs related to the opening of now 70 to 80 new Kay and Jared stores, up from our previous expectations of 65 to 75 store remodels, digital and information technology infrastructure and Ultra capital spending, which we now expect will range at approximately $14 million, representing a reduction from our previous expectation of $18 million.","Thank you. And I will now turn the call back to Mike.","Michael W. Barnes","Thanks, Ron. In conclusion, I'd like to once again thank the Signet team worldwide for their contributions to a very successful quarter. We would now be pleased to take any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jennifer Davis from Lazard Capital Markets.","Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","A couple of clarifications. First of all, Ron, how should we think about the other operating income going forward, should we kind of think of it as 4.5% to 5% of sales in general or...","Ronald W. Ristau","Yes. It's not going to move that much, Jennifer, I think you should think about it in the range of last year. This quarter was a couple of basis points up, but I don't think the range is going to move substantially.","Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. But we should think about it as in terms of percent of sales rather than a fixed dollar amount?","Ronald W. Ristau","It does fluctuate by quarter somewhat, but I would follow the actual results from last year as a guide.","Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then sorry if I missed this. What was the -- how come the Ultra acquisition is going to be about $0.03 -- how come the impact will be about $0.03 greater than originally anticipated? Did you say that was because...","Ronald W. Ristau","Sure. I'm sorry, that's a great question, thanks. It really relates to when we originally -- we were originally expecting it to be about $0.03 in each quarter. We're now come to realize or anticipating in our second quarter guidance is that we're going to be completing the majority of the transition of the systems and inventory cutovers in the second quarter, as we've always indicated. And we think there could be a little more of a disruptive effect on sales as that happens. And also, I believe that we could have -- we should have done a little bit better job in anticipating the Mother's Day shift in Ultra, which was as strong for them as it was for us, and our original budgets that we worked on with them didn't really include that.","Michael W. Barnes","Yes. But one thing I would add, Jennifer, this is Mike, is that it's an exciting opportunity for us because we've been waiting a long time now to get this transition completed, and we're expecting to have it done in the second quarter. And once we get the majority of these stores switched to Kay nameplate and are able to leverage the great equity that we have in Kay, it's going to be a big opportunity for us going forward. So we're very excited. We've been waiting for this moment and we're glad it's almost upon us.","Ronald W. Ristau","Yes. And the one last thing I would add to that, Jennifer, is that of the $0.09 that were -- the $0.03 from the first quarter and $0.06 in the second quarter we're anticipating, the majority of that, close to $0.08 of it is related to nonrecurring cost, again, on duplicate overheads, severances and accruals for unnecessary office space that we will be incurring in the -- particularly, in the second quarter. And these costs, for sure, will not be repeating in the second half of the year or in the next year. So that's a good strong help to us.","Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Yes. Right. And absolutely, Mike, I'm -- we're really excited about the opportunity with Ultra as well, so -- or I should say Kay outlets now. One last question on, well, actually 2. On Mother's Day, what was the impact with the shift, I think that I kind of mismodeled a little bit maybe.","Ronald W. Ristau","Well, there was no effect -- once again, there is no effect on comps. The comps were directly shifted, but the dollar sales move was -- it ranges between $32 million and $35 million is our best estimate.","Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then bridal, it sounds like it's increased as a percent of sales, could you talk a little bit about that? And how do margins on bridal compared to the rest of the assortment, are they a little bit lower or are they about the same?","Michael W. Barnes","Well, I'll start off and let Ron finish up with margins. On the sales, we had a very strong quarter for bridal and that's a very important. Because what we saw in this quarter, it was not just driven by the big holiday events, the Valentine's and the lead into Mother's Day. We had a great continuity business throughout the quarter, and bridal was really big part of that. We continued with our usual strong promotions. We also, because we're so focused on bridal, we tested some new promotions that were related specifically to bridal in both the mall and in the Jared stores. And we had really great results from that. So we think there's a lot of opportunity for us to continue driving the bridal. Ron, do you want to talk about the margins, any other points on that?","Ronald W. Ristau","Yes. Our bridal margins are a touch lower than the overall company, just a touch because of the fact that there's a lot of -- there's new stones involved in that, and new stones tend to be one of our lower margin businesses. It's not really that -- it's not all that different.","Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Great. Okay. And then, theoretically, you will get greater, I guess, rents and fixed cost leverage on the sales?","Ronald W. Ristau","Absolutely. I mean, driving bridal sales is a very important part of our business, representing more than 50% of our sales and is something we continue to stay focused on, because we believe it's a natural intersection of all of our competitive strengths. Our great store experiences, the credit offerings that we have and the quality of our merchandise, all combine for a great bridal experience and is something that we are best at. So it's a very good thing for us.","Operator","The next question comes from Oliver Chen from Citigroup.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","What are you thoughts on how we should think about modeling the gross margin going forward in terms of the puts and takes and what can happen there over time? Also, if you could update us on the commodity cost environment and if you're seeing the flexibility there with respect to what you're seeing in how you may be able to adjust your attitude in retail?","Ronald W. Ristau","Well, I'll take the first question. I think that from an overall perspective, we still try to work on maintaining our margins. We can't be specific going into the third and fourth quarter of the year, but we think those margins will be good. When you think about commodities and what's happening at commodities, first thing I'd like to point out is we are on an average cost FICO basis, which takes commodity fluctuations into our P&L at different rates than some of our competitors. Currently, when we look about -- 55% of our cost of goods is diamonds and about 17% is gold. So right now, we really continue to see some upward pressure on diamond prices for our quality goods, although prices are really generally more stable on a relative basis in the near term. Long term, we really believe that this direction is up because global demand is flat and demand is pretty strong still. The recent gold price declines, if they hold, should be somewhat helpful to us in the second half. However, we did do some gold settings, I would point out, and we did have some unfavorable gold hedge positions that we found necessary to close with the reduction in gold prices. However, there's always -- there's a lot of multiple factors including pricing decisions, content, how we run our promotional programs, which will reflect in our overall margins. So our outlook is good, but we really have to figure out how long this will all last and who ultimately wins the battle on gold commodity pricing. But it will be helpful, eventually, to us if it holds.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And regarding your comp guidance, should we anticipate that the same kind of run rates may continue between U.S. versus U.K.? And if -- and on your low- to mid-single digit, is that traffic and conversion led? If you could just give us parameters from which we should think about your forecast, that would be helpful.","Ronald W. Ristau","Well, if you think about our -- if you ask me -- let me try to understand the question though, how we comp forecast going forward will be reflected in transactions and pricing?","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In terms of the comp leverage...","Ronald W. Ristau","I think, if you take a look at the U.S. division you'll see that there was a healthy mix of transaction growth and there was also some price increase, particularly at Kay on average, which went through, why we think that we would expect both transactions and price to drive in the United States as we go forward. In the U.K., we are seeing some traffic declines. We are seeing that particularly at our H.Samuel brand. We hope that we can arrest some of those as we move into the second half of the year, but we are fighting traffic declines in the U.K. So I would, if I had to bet right now, I would say that there'll be some degree of transactional decline in the U.K. going forward. That's  probably the best way I can answer that question. I mean, the U.S. is a great healthy mix, the U.K. is really driven by transactional decline more than anything else.","Operator","The next question comes from Rick Patel from Stephens.","Rick B. Patel - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Just a question on the conversion of Ultra Stores to Kay outlets. When this occurs, are you going to reprice all the merchandise in the stores virtually overnight or are you going to replace and reprice the Ultra product as it's sold through? And as a follow up, when do you expect the pressure on gross margins to wane from selling Ultra products, will it be in the third quarter once the conversions are done?","Michael W. Barnes","On the products, I would tell you that we have been working on starting to move products into Ultra as we could even before the full transition, and we'll continue to do that. Clearly, as we change the nameplates on the majority of the stores to Kay, they're going to look like Kay stores going forward. But having said that, because the outlet channel is a separate channel for us to sell into, we believe that there's ways for us to optimize that channel. In the past, our Kay outlet stores have been pretty much the same as our Kay mall stores in terms all the merchandise offerings. We think that there's going to be an opportunity for us to do some more made for product that is more targeted towards the outlet store customer, including the great tourist opportunity that exists out there in the outlet store channel of distribution. So it will be a little bit of a different mix to optimize it on a go-forward basis, but that's a work in progress. Initially, it's going to be switched over and become a Kay store just as quickly as possible. And the pricing will be exactly the same as it is in Kay.","Rick B. Patel - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And can you talk about the merchandise mix in the U.K.? Have you began to edit the assortment there as part of your strategic plan in the region? And if so, perhaps highlight what you've learned from doing that?","Michael W. Barnes","Yes. On the U.K., as Ron mentioned earlier, it continues to be a very challenging market for us. And as we have laid out the initiatives that we believe are going to help us turn that market around, merchandise is one of the first ones. I mean, we're still very, very focused on that. We are even beginning some new initiatives on how to focus even harder on the merchandise mix and possibly gain some more leverage with more of the products that we have here. If we look at the U.K. market, some of the things that have been successful have been some of the branded merchandise that we've had in there, but it's a lower part of the mix than it is in the U.K -- or I'm sorry, in the U.S. And we see more focus in that direction, more focus on new products. We have to be careful with pricing. We talked about the weakness that we saw in H.Samuel, in particular. Part of that was price increases for H.Samuel didn't stick as well as we had hoped that they would. And so we've got to stay very focused. I've seen -- I saw a recent article from the British Retail Consortium talking about the consumer continues to look for value in the marketplace. So we're very focused on the merchandise offerings, we're focused on branding, we're focused on new product and we're looking at how we can be more innovative going forward and think a little bit more outside the box to really drive some more change into that marketplace in our stores.","Operator","Next question comes from Anthony Lebiedzinski from Sidoti & Company.","Anthony C. Lebiedzinski - Sidoti & Company, LLC","In the past, you guys have been more upbeat about the regional malls in the U.K. versus the high street locations, is that still the case?","Michael W. Barnes","Well, those are still the best performing that we have. I have seen some traffic statistics. Ron was talking about traffic being down across the -- it's kind of down across-the-board in the U.K. The last stats that I saw, the High Street and the malls were down as well. But we continue to perform certainly better in the malls than we are on the everyday high streets. And we think that, that is going to continue to be the direction for the U.K. market, that these big regional malls will continue to be the biggest part of our business on a go-forward basis, notwithstanding London, which of course, is always going to be strong with all the tourist activity going on there. But I think that the traffic itself was down in the malls, as well as on the High streets, but it still is the better performing part of our portfolio there.","Ronald W. Ristau","Yes. Definitely the stronger part.","Anthony C. Lebiedzinski - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. So can you give us a sense as to what percentage of your stores in the U.K. are in the High Street locations versus regional malls? And also, as you look to optimize your store base, maybe you could give us a sense of how do you think that's going to be in 2 to 3 years from now?","Ronald W. Ristau","Yes. I mean, I believe that the mix now is around 60%-40%, 40% regional malls, 60% High Street. But I'm going to double check that number for you, okay. As we go forward, we'll have a much higher -- it should help with the shift that we would end up with 60s -- 65%, 70% of sales in regional malls.","Michael W. Barnes","Yes. The difference, it depends on how you ask the question. In terms of number of stores, there are fewer regional malls, but they drive a disproportionate part of the business for us. So in terms of sales, while it's fairly, even last time I looked, and we'll check those numbers, I think it will become a bigger part of the business going forward in the malls.","Ronald W. Ristau","I will get those exact numbers and dollars for you and give you a call back.","Anthony C. Lebiedzinski - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. Sure. Not a problem. And also, in terms of your store growth expectations now, you did accelerate the -- or you're looking to open more stores than previously, is it more Kay and then Jared? Could you give us a sense to where the increase is coming from and can you also talk about the trends that you're seeing in real estate costs?","Ronald W. Ristau","Well, it is more Kay than Jared, obviously, because it takes a long time to open up a Jared store. There's a couple more Jared stores in there. I believe, we're up to about 13 Jared stores for the year and the residual is Kay. And that Kay is primarily in the off-mall area. We're seeing lots of opportunities, so we're being a little more aggressive as we've said we always would be if the opportunities present themselves. In real estate cost, real estate costs remain as a constant challenge for us. We work very hand-in-hand with our landlord partners and we've been reasonably successful at working continually beneficial deals. But the real estate costs for good real estate have never really changed. They've always been very competitive and we're always after the best space, so there's really no new news. I wouldn't say that the pressure is more or less, it's always been fairly consistent for us.","Michael W. Barnes","We don't compromise on the real estate that we go forward just to open new stores. So that's what's exciting about this, this increase in new store openings, is the fact that the team is doing a great job out there finding the best possible real estate because, again, it's just something we will not compromise on and the cost is what it is.","Anthony C. Lebiedzinski - Sidoti & Company, LLC","So  you haven't changed your objective of your 20% IRR rate?","Ronald W. Ristau","No. No, not at all.","Michael W. Barnes","Absolutely not.","Ronald W. Ristau","No, no, no.","Anthony C. Lebiedzinski - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Got it. Okay. And lastly, when you look at your cash -- free cash flow generation capabilities, you've exhausted your share buyback program going forward. Can you give us any sense as to how the board is thinking between dividends and share purchases?","Michael W. Barnes","Well, that's an ongoing conversation that we have with the board, and we will continue that conversation. What we have done is we've made a commitment as to what we think our capital structure and our balance sheet should look like. And we continue to feel like having approximately 7% to 9% of annual sales in cash. It's a good flexible number for us. And beyond that, we want to invest back in the business, number one, that's the best return we can get for our shareholders. But we'll have ongoing conversations with the board regarding other opportunities to return value to shareholders, such as the continuing dividend and potential share buybacks in the future. And we'll update you as appropriate how those conversations continue.","Operator","The next question comes from Bill Armstrong from CL King & Associates.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Ultra gross margins are expected to improve from current levels. Do you think they can get all the way up to the overall company average in the high-30s or is the outlet sector just structurally a little bit lower?","Ronald W. Ristau","Well, I think they can get substantially closer. I think the outlet does tend to be a touch lower than the overall mall, but this will be still a smaller percentage of our business. So I think it will go up substantially from what it is today and we'll approach closer to the levels. But obviously, because the product mix is a little different, it won't get all the way to the same level. It's just a different -- it's a different gross margin model. Of course and we have other costs that are lower. And in particular, one of the things I think we're very pleased with and -- we really are going to have a very -- the SG&A structure of the outlet operations is something I would urge you to think more about, too, is that -- because once we integrate, we will need very little additional incremental SG&A other than our store operations people to run the business. And that's a big part of the savings as we move into the third and fourth quarter of the year.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","In terms of SG&A leverage, you mean?","Ronald W. Ristau","Yes.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got it. How about in the eCommerce, that's obviously a growing piece of your business. Are the gross margins in eCommerce similar to margins at retail?","Ronald W. Ristau","Yes.","Michael W. Barnes","Yes. The merchandise margins would be the same because our pricing is the same online as it is in store.","Ronald W. Ristau","And the pricing is -- I'm sorry, the overall operating margins are as good as our best stores or sometimes even better.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then just lastly, just to clarify a comment, I think, Ron made earlier on price increases at Kay. Were those increases taken during the first quarter or were they taken last year?","Ronald W. Ristau","Well, what I said was that, if you take a look at the charts we're providing on average price and transaction cost, Kay average price went up, which is partially pricing and partially mix adjustments. So I want to be clear about that. The pricing -- we did take price increases on our normal cadence in the March and before Mother's Day timeframe, so we did do that. We don't disclose how much in total, but they were a little less than we have in previous years.","Operator","The next question comes Ike Boruchow from Sterne Agee.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Mike, sometimes -- if you can help us out, this would be the overall consumer environment right now, it was a great U.S. comp for you in Q1. Could you maybe give us some color on what you're seeing in the environment thus far quarter to date?","Michael W. Barnes","Yes. I mean, the environment, we've -- I've talked about this a lot in the last couple of weeks even. The best way I can characterize it, and this is just one man's opinion, is that it feels like a more stable environment than I would have spoke to 12 months ago at this same time. A lot of the noise that was going on out there kind of subdued itself a little bit with fiscal cliffs and the rising payroll taxes and late tax returns. We heard a lot of that noise, especially at the beginning of the first quarter in early February. And it's somewhat subsided. Who knows what the macro environment is going to bring to spook or support the purchasers at retail tomorrow, I have no idea, I don't have that crystal ball. But I would characterize it, just in general, as being a more stable environment than I have seen in the past, and we'll see where it goes from here. That's in U.S. market. In the U.K., it's still an extremely volatile environment with a lot of continued bargain-hunting going on. And I was just reading U.K. unemployment, it went up more than it's gone up in a long time. I mean, it's a tale of 2 different markets, really. But the U.S. driving the majority of our business has been much more stable, we had a great first quarter, we had a good beginning of the second quarter through Mother's Day. And as we've said, we believe we're really well positioned to make all of our objectives for the year. So we continue to be excited about the opportunities we have in front of us and we're going to just keep driving the successful business model we have.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And I guess, Ron, the company's historically broken out their merchandise margin changes in both the U.S. and the U.K. when you guys report your quarters, is there any way you can help us out there just so we can have it updated in our models? And maybe, I know you've even asked a few times, but maybe any color on how you expect the U.S. merchandise margin to progress throughout the year given some of the puts and takes that you called out?","Ronald W. Ristau","Well, I would say is that the gross merchandise margin followed in the U.S. the gross margin, so if the overall excluding Ultra margins in the U.S. were down about 70 bps, the gross merchandise margins were down similar type numbers. So explaining one explains the other, if you will. In the U.K., our merchandise, gross merchandise margins are actually up about 100 bps, but that was offset by deleverage on the lower sales on some of the real estate and other costs. So they only netted up about 20 basis points, I believe. When you think about go-forward, I believe that it depends upon the mix of what happens with gold and commodities and our stance promotionally. We did see, of course, in the first quarter that some of these very successful bridal promotions did have an impact on our gross merchandise margin, but were very, very profitable for the overall business. So I would say, in general, you should expect them to be a little better than they were this quarter. And you should start to see the dilutive effect of Ultra start to diminish. At what rate, I can't really predict for you. But as we convert the model in the second half of the year, you would expect or I would expect that the margins would get closer to those experienced by our core business. If that's helpful.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. No, very helpful. And then just one quick last one. Ron, you talked about a $0.09 impact from Ultra integration in the first half of the year. Did I hear you correctly saying that there shouldn't be any real drag as a we get into Q3 and Q4. I know we'd lapped the acquisition, but is that..","Ronald W. Ristau","What I don't think is -- what will happen is a lot of the SG&A overhead cost will diminish after the second quarter as the impact of integrating the business more fully to our Akron operation occurs. I continue to believe that the third quarter is a -- still a little bit of risk for us, some degree of dilution. And then we expect it to turn positive in the fourth quarter. And the only reason I hedged in the third quarter is the fact that, we believe, a good couple of months of learning with all the new systems and the training that has to go on in the field sales force, so it's a bit of a -- a bit difficult to predict how long that training will need to take root, you understand?","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Ronald W. Ristau","So the systems and everything converts during the kind of the end of the second quarter. We give ourselves a couple months to work out all the operational issues, if there are any, right. And then we believe that in the fourth quarter, we start to become accretive. But the overhead costs will start to diminish as we move into the third and fourth quarter for sure.","Operator","And the next question comes from Jeff Stein from Northcoast Research.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Ron, question on -- I was looking at this footnote number 11 on hedging, and wondering if you could just try to explain the impact that your hedging losses have had. It looks like, if I'm reading this correctly, you had a negative $17.5 million impact in Q1 versus $12.9 million in Q2, and how your open contracts could potentially affect Q2 through Q4?","Ronald W. Ristau","Well, first, let me explain that what you're looking at there is balance sheet-related items, not P&L items. But what ended up happening with the -- it was the largest move in gold in 38 years that we can trace, so we had open hedging positions. And we took the decision, as allowed by accounting rules, to close those hedges in essentially on a stock loss basis. And then, of course, we'll move forward with the reset pricing levels. So we've made a lot of money in hedging over the years. As this pricing reset occurred, it was, of course, unfavorable to us. That will flow into the P&L, Jeff, over the life of our inventory turns. So it takes about 12 to 16 months for those to flow-through. But on the plus side, remember we're buying the underlying commodities. So we're getting tremendous benefit by buying gold at spot as we go along. In fact, we're doing much better than our hedging positions, of course, would have allowed us to do. So that was a business decision. Nobody likes to take losses, but we've figured it was the lesser of 2 evils, if you will. And as we go forward, we're approaching the gold market with caution. And we will gradually seek to reestablish our hedging positions as the market becomes a little more predictable.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","So Ron, based upon the losses that you took and the lower spot prices that you're paying right now, presuming that prices were to remain flat, and we don't know where they're going to be, but if they remained flat, net-net, are you in a plus position or a minus position for the rest of the year?","Ronald W. Ristau","Net-net, we would be in a plus position. Because the value of the buying at spot far outweighs the loss that you incur in the close of the hedge positions.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Got it. Okay. That's great. And with regard to your credit business, can you talk a little bit about the mix of interest-free versus your traditional monthly payment, revolving payment?","Ronald W. Ristau","It's been relative stable, Jeff. It has -- we got a shift on that which started to occur in the first quarter of last year. And of course, we talked about it last year because it was resetting those other income ratios throughout the year. But right now, we're seeing stable. It really hasn't changed much from the third to fourth quarter of last year, it's been relatively stable. So the incremental income this year is really more driven by higher outstanding balances as opposed to a shift in the mix of programs.","Operator","The next question comes from David Wu from Telsey Advisory Group.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","First, the gross margin contraction, obviously, a bit surprising, even if you exclude the impact from Ultra. And I want to know if you could break out the impact between the unfavorable merch mix shift and the Mother's Day sales shift? I understand that bridal is a lower gross margin category, but I want to know if you adjusted pricing at all to be more competitive there? And if you could provide more color on the Jared test programs? And also is it fair to assume that mix should remain a headwind in the second quarter?","Ronald W. Ristau","Let me answer that a couple of different ways. Mike do you want to take...","Michael W. Barnes","Yes. Well, I'll take the last part of that first, Dave, this is Mike. On the Jared test programs, basically, what we talked about is that we did do some test, promotional programs, especially as it was related to bridal, but we're really not going to go into detail for competitive reasons on that. We felt like we saw a lot of good success and a lot of opportunity for us to continue to tweak our business, our promotions, our merchandise and everything going forward, quite frankly. And that's what we do, we continue to evolve and grow as this industry changes and find better and better ways to compete effectively and gain market share. But all I could tell you is that we were very pleased with both the merchandise that we've tested and some of the new promotions that we're not comped that we tested. And we think we got a big opportunity going forward. And I'll let Ron take the gross margin.","Ronald W. Ristau","What I basically say in the gross margin, excluding the impact of Ultra, the 70 bps adjustment that we realized, that is primarily caused by the impact of these programs. And not so much unfavorable mix, but we've decided, we made the decision to get to somewhat improve some of our programs and offerings and see how they would work in the market. And they worked fantastic, as evidenced by the strong, strong comp that we experienced during the quarter. We did have to give up some margin on that and we believe that was a good trade-off. We continue to believe that all those programs have fantastically high return on investment. And the part of Mother's Day was really in the neighborhood of 10 bps to 15 bps of the 70 bps, so the majority of what was really these programs that we were running in Jared and the bridal programs that we were initiating.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","So theoretically then, as you continue to test these programs, that should remain a headwind then in terms of the second quarter on the gross margin in the U.S.?","Ronald W. Ristau","No. These are programs that we flex in and out of, okay. Some of them, depending upon what we do, I don't think you should assume that we will just be running all these programs there. Like anything, they are programs that we put in, at times of the year, we think are effective. Some of the Jared programs that we ran could have some more longevity in the system, but they have lesser impact. And we get tremendous -- you saw the Jared comp really start to get very strong. So all of these things, we believe, as business people, were very favorable trade-offs for us to make for the long-term health of the business.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great. And the U.K., gross merchandise margin, up 100 basis points, obviously, a vast improvement from the prior quarter. Can you talk about the main drivers there and comment on promotional levels, and should we expect a more sort of moderate decline in the U.K. gross merchandise margin going forward assuming that the comp maintains a similar pace?","Ronald W. Ristau","Well, some of it is mix. And the basis of the fact that as Rolex becomes a lower percentage of the risk, the merchandise margins, of course, will improve. So some of it is mix, some of it was the impact of pricing. As Mike indicated, we're not totally enthralled with the benefits of pricing that we received in the first quarter. So what I would say is, Mike correct me if you disagree, but the jury's out a little bit on whether or not we'll continue to realize incremental gross merchandise margin in the U.K. We may choose to do it a little differently as we go forward.","Ronald W. Ristau","Yes. I think that we're going to have to really focus on pricing in the U.K. market, and it's something that we've got to really watch very closely. The prices didn't stick in H.Samuel as well as we had hoped that they would. There's just a lot of pressure in that market in that regard, and so we've got to make sure that we remain competitive and that we're kind leading the charge over there. So we're going to be looking at a lot of different opportunities and different ways to move forward. So that's something that we'll just have to watch and see. But I wouldn't expect to see anything in particular change for us regarding the margins there.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","And is credit as instrumental in driving the sales performance in the U.K. as it is in the U.S., and could there be an opportunity to potentially introduce a similar type of in-house credit program into the U.K.?","Michael W. Barnes","We use a third-party provider in the U.K., and it's a very, very low percentage of our business, in the single digits, I believe.","Ronald W. Ristau","It's very low, yes.","Michael W. Barnes","And it's just a different type of customer profile over there. I think that they're much more inclined to use their bank cards for those type of purchases, whether it's to gain miles. But certainly, some of the big, big retailers have private label, I guess. But there's not -- it's not near the successful impact that it is in the United States, it's just a different customer profile. And it wouldn't be large enough for us to even consider going in-house with  just by the fact that it's such a low part of the mix, even in the third-party credit that we do offer.","Ronald W. Ristau","We don't have a term for [indiscernible].","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great. And on the second quarter guidance, will the $0.06 negative impact from the Ultra acquisition, will that come more from the gross margin versus SG&A? So similar to what we saw in the first quarter?","Ronald W. Ristau","More from SG&A.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","More from SG&A, okay.","Ronald W. Ristau","That's why I make the point that when you look across the 2 quarters and I look into the components of it, I say there's a couple of things. Number one, I've got lower productivity stores in general than I have in my main Kay operation. But I also have costs that will -- we were not able to take out of the system until we make the transition. We were making the transition more in the -- by the end of the second quarter. So therefore, some of our costs and then some of our onetime costs that involve severance and excess real estate and things like that, once we're through all that, then I believe that the cost structure will get better. And we know because I can control that virtually 100%, we just know that's going to happen.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great. And then just lastly, the higher ticket that you saw in the U.S., was that tied mainly to particular strength out of bridal or did you also benefit from a higher ticket in fashion jewelry?","Ronald W. Ristau","I would say in Kay, a little bit more as of -- because of bridal. A little bit because of the stronger bridal business, which carries a little bit higher ticket.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great. But on the fashion jewelry side, how did ticket trends perform?","Ronald W. Ristau","That's a little -- I don't want to give -- I would say nothing -- they didn't move much at all. They didn't really move much on average for us.","Michael W. Barnes","We had strong fashion trends throughout the quarter as well, I think that's important to point out. And again, some of the branded merchandise, Le Vian did very well for us in bridal, as Ron mentioned. Certainly that helped the ticket price because we had, again, strong brand bridal with Leo and Tolkowsky and Neil Lane. Neil Lane fashion did well on the fashion side. So that's really what's driving it. And we're seeing a lot of strength out of all of those great brands that we have. And we're very pleased with the partnerships and the opportunity going forward to continue driving that.","Operator","The last question comes from Warwick Okines from Deutsche Bank.","Warwick Okines - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Actually, just following on from the last one. Could you say what the mix was at branded and exclusive in the U.S. in the quarter, please?","Ronald W. Ristau","We don't generally disclose it in the quarters. We tend to do it on an annual basis because it tends to fluctuate on the quarters. But it was positive, significantly positive as a penetration in the first quarter. So those products, as well as our non-branded and our more fashion products. So across-the-board, branded, non-branded, bridal, everything worked well for us in the U.S. in the merchandise offerings in the first quarter.","Michael W. Barnes","Very broad based.","Warwick Okines - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right, right. I guess, I was trying to -- I mean, you talked to the full year last year, I think, 27.4%. I was just trying to work out whether that was that kind of underrepresents the progress you've made in the last few quarters?","Ronald W. Ristau","Well, I would say that our -- if you look -- what I'm basically telling is that our penetration, relative to the penetration a year ago, in the first quarter was up in branded and exclusive. Does that makes sense, yes?","Warwick Okines - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. Okay.","Ronald W. Ristau","So we're on trend to keep improving, but we have to see how the rest of the year develops.","Warwick Okines - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And finally, could you ask -- could you tell us whether at the AGM you'll be seeking further authorization to repurchase shares?","Michael W. Barnes","Yes. We mentioned earlier that's -- our capital structure and our balance sheet are going to be ongoing conversations with the board. We've made a commitment, again, to keep approximately 7% to 9% of cash, we think is appropriate to keep on the balance sheet. Beyond that, we want to invest in our business first. And then we'll have ongoing discussions with the board about how best to return other value to the shareholders beyond anything that we are investing in the business. So I would just say, again, stay tuned. As we have further discussions with the board, we'll see what decisions are made. We were very pleased with the buyback that we concluded, and it was very successful in our opinion. We're very pleased with the dividend that we have and will continue having those discussions with the board, and we will update you as appropriate --","Operator","And we have no further questions at this.

I'll begin the call by discussing our first quarter results as well as our performance over the Mother's Day shopping period. Then I'll provide an update on the progress we are making in our omni-channel strategy and growth initiatives. I will then turn over to Michele to detail some of the quarter's financial highlights. After we conclude the discussion of the first quarter we will discuss the structure of the credit transaction we announced just a short while ago. Afterwards we'll be happy to take your questions. So let's get started.","Turning to the first quarter results that's on Slide number 4, as anticipated we had a very slow start to the year as continued headwinds in the overall retail environment were exacerbated by a slowdown in jewelry spending and company specific challenges. We generated net sales of $1.4 billion a 10.1% decline on a constant currency basis and our same-store sales decreased by 11.5%. Although 330 basis points of the decline was due to the later Mother's Day holiday, typically Mother's Day is split between the first and second quarters, but in fiscal 2018 it fell entirely in the second quarter which caused an unfavorable impact to the first quarter but will benefit in Q2.","In Q1, against difficult comparison to prior year we saw declines across merchandise categories and collections with the exception of e-commerce and Piercing Pagoda both of which had higher sales. The number of transactions also remained under pressure across divisions, largely due to the ongoing declines in brick-and-mortar store traffic, deep jewelry promotional activity across the sector and increased competition for share of wallet.","While we are certainly not pleased with our first quarter results we recognized that our portion of our performance softness is being driven by overall weakness in the retail environment, as well as some one-off impacts like the delay in tax refunds which impacted our Valentine\u2019s Day sales. However, we also know there is much within our control to address and improve our performance, and we are doing just that.","Importantly, though it\u2019s still early and we have begun to realize some of the benefits of the actions that we have been taking since the end of last year, in areas like e-commerce, digital marketing, and organization structure, all of which are driving the reaffirmation of our full year 2018 guidance today.","Along these lines we have experienced sequential sales improvement across all divisions in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 would normalize for the later timing of Mother\u2019s Day. In terms of product categories, diamond fashion jewelry such as bracelets, earrings, and necklaces, our Ever Us collection as well as higher price bridal categories outperformed the overall merchandise portfolio. We have remained focused on merchandise innovation and throughout the quarter continued to test and invest in new line extensions, new collections and new fashion trends to successfully position Signet for the upcoming Holiday Season.","From a sale and channel perspective Piercing Pagoda total sales increased year-over-year driven primarily by higher sales of 14 kt. gold chains, children's and religious jewelry.","You can see on Slide 5, we have also continued to make meaningful progress on our Customer First Omni-Channel initiatives and in the first quarter realized some of the benefits of the investment that we have made and work that we have done to-date. During the first quarter, our e-commerce platforms improved sequentially across all key e-commerce metrics. For example we have been focused on addressing our online platform page load times, streamlining the online checkout process and improving the overall customer online experience our sales in the first quarter were $80 million, up 1.1% compared to a year ago.","Before I continue, I want to take a moment to talk about Mother\u2019s Day, where we saw solid performance over the holiday selling period as a result of our efforts to drive improved performance. We successfully leveraged our marketing modeling tools to respond to issues and opportunities using real-time data. Specifically, we implemented more targeted, simpler holiday promotions that resonated well with our customers.","Additionally, our marketing was more focused with fewer and stronger messages that also made use of integrated digital elements. Although, our promotional activity was higher than last year, significant improvement across store brands and merchandise categories is what is driving our confidence in our full year guidance.","Before I turn things over to Michele, on Slide 7 I want to highlight our opportunities for fiscal 2018. As a the [sector shift] [ph] continues to go online we are making ongoing enhancements to our e-commerce platform adding relevant talent and resources, upgrading our mobile functionality, making advancements in search engine optimization, rolling out various content enhancements, launching a new Zale's e-commerce platform and enhancing our digital marketing efforts.","We also expect our OmniChannel focus to drive increased in-stores orders through online appointment booking and the introduction of new functionality like local store inventory search. Additionally, we believe greater adoption of a new client system, clienteling system by stores will increase team member productivity. As you may recall, clienteling enables our team members to improve their interaction with customers before, during and after their visits to our stores or our sites.","Further to the actions we have taken to streamline our organization, I want to let you know that a 165 to 170 store closures slated for fiscal 2018, which are primarily mall, regional base remain on track, regional-based brands which remain on track, as do the openings of new Kay off-mall locations.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Michele to walk you through the details of the quarter.","Michele Santana","Thank you, Mark. So, we are going to start on Slide 8. For the first quarter, Signet\u2019s comps decreased 11.5%, against an increase of 2.4% in the prior year first quarter and that compares to a two-year comp hurdle rate of 6%. Of our comps sales decline about 330 basis points was attributed to the later timing of Mother\u2019s Day. In general, average transaction value was higher while the number of transactions was lower for the reasons that Mark had just reviewed.","So, I\u2019ll move on to the income statement. On Slide 9, you can see our gross margin was $491.2 million or 35% of sales, down 300 basis points. The lower rate was due principally to lower sales leading to de-leverage on fixed cost partially offset by higher gross merchandise margins in Sterling and Zale divisions.","First quarter merchandise margin was favorably impacted by mix benefits, targeted re-pricing, some commodity favorability and better discount control. As we have said before, we aim to balance our competitiveness in the market with our promotional levels to protect margins in light of the heavy ongoing promotional activity seen across the sector.","SG&A expense was $452.8 million and the rate was 32.3% of sales. We continued our prudent SG&A expense management in the first quarter. As we have discussed before, we are taking steps to streamline our organizational structure to deliver operational efficiencies with a greater OmniChannel focus. As a result SG&A dollars decreased 2.1% in the first quarter versus the prior year.","Though I will point out we did experience about 300 basis points of de-leverage due to lower sales and fixed expenses. This includes store payroll, long-term IT investments and legal fees. Now, this was partially offset by the favorable impact of lower variable compensation, lower corporate payroll and advertising timing.","Other operating income was $76.9 million. This increase of $2.6 million was due to the Sterling division's higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. But note that the rate increase was tempered by the higher mix of reduced rate plans.","Diluted earnings per share was a $1.03, a decline of $0.84 compared to the same quarter last year. This also includes approximately $0.17 unfavorable impact to EPS due to the later timing of Mother\u2019s Day holiday. At the end of the first quarter there was about $511 million remaining under Signet share repurchase authorization with no share repurchases occurring during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.","So, moving on to inventory. Net inventory ended the period at $2.4 billion, down 3.2% year-over-year which is roughly in line with our full year sales guidance. We are managing sales stores with less inventory per store to improve prominence and presentation of key collections. This also includes refinement of some of our bridal collections in favor of others with greater focus such as Vera Wang Love and Endless Brilliance. We've also made changes to a few lines to provide less breadth and more depth in key categories driving overall inventory productivity.","So, turning our attention to our in-house product metrics and statistics on slide 11. Our first quarter in-house credit sales in the Sterling Division were $529 million, a decline of 12.6% over the prior year and in-house credit participation was 60.7%, down 100 basis points. The average monthly payment collection rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was 11.4% compared to 12.3% last year.","Our monthly collection rate is calculated as cash payment received divided by the beginning of accounts receivables. The decline in the collection rate is due principally to credit plan mix and an increase in the average transaction value while it is getting financed. As a result, monthly payments are higher in dollars, but lower as a percentage of balances, thereby resulting in higher receivables outstanding to be collected.","With that said, our credit plan mix is driving a higher FICO score customer with the rollout of our 36-month bridal plan to select customers. The collection rate decline contributed to an increase in our gross accounts receivable which increased by $40 million or 2.2% over the prior year driven primarily by the collection rate decline. Interest income for finance charges, which makes up virtually all other operating income on our income statement, were $74 million which is $1 million lower than the prior year. The change was due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables base but tempered by plan mix.","Other net bad debt expense was $43 million $9 million higher than last year and when taken together with the finance income generated, operating profit of $31 million. This net combination was down $8 million from prior year. In general, our bad debt expense was impacted by lower receivable growth which was a symptom of the overall sales decline and late tax refunds in the first quarter.","So with that, let's turn our attention to our financial guidance on Slide 12. Recall that fiscal 2018 is a 53-week year. As Mark had indicated we are reaffirming our fiscal 2018 full year guidance. Our comparable-store sales are expected to decrease in the low to mid single digits. The additional week will be accretive to fourth quarter total sales by approximately $75 million, but will have no impact to our same-store sales calculation as it is excluded.","EPS is expected to be $7 to $7.40. The additional week will have an immaterial EPS impact fourth quarter due to the cadence of our planned Valentine's Day marketing and promotions. Also note that our guidance excludes any impacts of the credit transaction which Mark and I will discuss with you next.","That concludes my prepared remarks and with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark Light","Thank you, Michele. We will now discuss the strategic outsourcing of our credit portfolio. Please turn to Slide 14. Today, we are very excited to announce the first phase of the strategic outsourcing of our credit business with the transactions structured to substantially meet all of the strategic priorities we set at the beginning of this process.","As we reminded, those priorities include eliminating material credit risk from our balance sheet, substantially maintaining our net sales, enhancing our credit and customer experience in the most efficient way, minimizing any disruption to our business that will impact our customers, our team members and our store operations, while optimizing our business model, and deliver transaction that creates value for our shareholders including EPS accretion.","On Slide 15, we have provided an overview of the first phase of our outsourcing structure, which is designed to allow us to maintain our full spectrum of credit offering and competitive advantage, while substantially de-risking our balance sheet. The structures of the first phase which Michele will cover in detail a bit later includes the sale of roughly 55% of our existing accounts receivables as well as long-term partnerships that ensure our customers will have access to our credit offerings.","Let me take a moment to explain what we are accomplishing in this first phase. We are pleased to announce that we have [sold] our prime quality receivables with a $1 billion growth book value to Alliance Data at par value. Following the close of the transaction, Alliance Data will service these receivables also.","In addition to the sale I just described to fully outsource the servicing of our entire receivables book we have also put in place a seven-year agreement to which Alliance Data and Progressive Leasing will become funding providers and servicers for our new originations at our U.S. store brands.","Alliance Data will provide credit to our prime customers and Progressive will provide a lease purchase payment option to our customers that are at the low-end of our current in-house credit structure as well as those who are probably not covered and at no risk to Signet. For of the portion of accounts that would have remained on our balance sheet until the completion of the second phase we have entered into a preliminary agreement or a binding letter of intent with Genesis Financial Solutions to which they will service our existing accounts receivable as well as new credit sales that are funded through our in-house program.","However, it is important to note, that our in-house program will be meaningfully reduced in size as Alliance Data will own the prime customers and Progressive leased payment option will take the bottom portion of the current secondary program.","Before, I move on, let me also take a moment to provide you with some general guidelines as to how we intent to structure the second phase. As part of the second phase Signet intends to fully outsource its future secondary credit programs, including the sale of the remainder receivables on its balance sheet as well as funding from new non-prime account generations. And to this end we anticipate engaging in discussions with one or multiple capital providers.","Once the second phase is completed, we expect Signet's credit programs to be fully outsourced from a funding and servicing perspective, and for all material credit risk to be fully moved from our balance sheet.","Turning to Slide 16 I want to highlight the benefits of this new outsource structure to our customers, our Signet team members and our valued shareholders. For our customers our robust range of credit offerings will be preserved. They will continue to see the full spectrum of credit offering and quality services they expect and we will ensure that the transition will be seamless.","Additionally we have added a lease purchase payment option that will enable customers that may not be eligible for credit options to access Signet's merchandise which will have no financial risk to Signet.","For our team members, the majority of those that support our current credit operations will be transitioned to our experienced partners at Alliance Data and Genesis and they will continue to service our customers with excellence as always. They will ensure smooth transition of our credit portfolio while internally we enhance our operational focus on driving the growth of our core retail business.","Our store operations teams will remain aligned to key performance indicators with both credit and non-credit based sales.","And finally for our investors, outsourcing our credit business will enable us to unlock the value from our credit portfolio allowing us to over time optimize our capital structure and allocation strategy as a leading jewelry retailer with a simplified investment thesis.","On Slide 17 it is important to talk about the criteria for us with the outsourcing structure was to ensure the transition process has minimal disruption to our business. We expect to close the sale of our prime quality credit portfolio and stand up the service increment with Alliance Data in October of this calendar year. And we have already begun detailed planning activities, including systems integration planning, team member training, and employee transition.","We also expect to transition the servicing of our retained accounts receivable to Genesis on the same time line. Alliance Data and Genesis will assume the facilities related to the portion of the credit operations they will be servicing which will enable us to move quickly and allow for a smooth transition. And we are very pleased to be able to retain access the deep experience embedded in our credit team as they will continue to serve our customers as a part of our partners.","Additionally, we look forward to benefiting from the sophistication and the deep experience and knowledge of Alliance Data and Genesis. Of course we want to ensure any potential disruption to operations is avoided during the upcoming holiday season. So if needed, we may adjust the timing of closing to ensure the integration activity is completed prior to the launch.","I will now turn the call over to Michele to provide more details and review the financial impacts of today's announcement. Michele?","Michele Santana","Thank you, Mark. I'd like to start by reiterating Mark's comments that we believe the outsourcing structure we announced today provide compelling economic benefit to Signet and Signet shareholders.","On Slide 18, we provide a breakdown of how our current credit sales will be supported in the first phase of our outsourced structure. As you can see on the slide, the outsourced structure is designed to maintain the full spectrum of our credit offering for our customers and as a result, we will protect our net sales while we de-risk our balance sheet and drive EPS accretion.","On the left side of the slide, we've outlined the various credit years that we currently served through our in-house programs. The portion Alliance Data will be acquiring and servicing which consists of prime credit quality customers represented 65% of our credit sales in fiscal 2017. The middle near and non-prime tier which we will retain on our balance sheet during the first phase made up 28% of our credit sales in fiscal 2017. We will outsource the servicing of this tier to Genesis which is a leading player in this arena.","We will also move to the contractual aging methodology in conjunction with the transition to Genesis which is expected to occur in October of 2017. The Lower Tier which represented 7% of sales in fiscal 2017 includes customers who will no longer be covered through any of Signet\u2019s current credit programs as well as those customers that previously did not have a payment option to access Signet\u2019s merchandise.","So, turning to Alliance Data primary program on Slide 19, Alliance Data is a leading provider of branded private label credit programs and marketing services based in Columbus, Ohio. They have been providing credit services to Zale brand's prime customers since 2013. Under this agreement Alliance Data will purchase our existing accounts receivables with prime credit quality.","They will also provide prime credit and services to all of our Signet\u2019s brands in the United States adding Kay, Jared and regional brands to its portfolio. The portion of the portfolio that they will be acquiring is anticipated to total $1billion in receivable at time of closing. This anticipated amount takes into consideration, the seasonality of our business and which we expect to close occurs at the time of our lowest receivable balances. As the primary program provider Alliance Data will get first look to qualifying new credit applications after the closing of the transaction and provide all key functions to service the primary program and that includes account issuing, servicing, funding and marketing and data services.","Signet will receive future payments based on the performance of the program including both existing and new accounts generated by Alliance Data under an economic sharing agreement. Now as part of the transaction Alliance Data will retain a portion of our current credit operations including certain facilities and approximately 250 employees located in Akron, Ohio.","The transition of these employees to Alliance Data will help to facilitate a seamless transition for both companies and customers. We expect the transaction to close in October 2017 with full conversion to have occurred ahead of the holiday season.","So turning to the secondary program outlined on Slide 20, as part of our phased approach we intend to retain the non-prime accounts receivable our balance sheet until the completion of the second phase. We will also continue to provide credit to customers that do not qualify for Alliance Data\u2019s primary program.","It is important to note that our in-house credit offering which will continue to be funded by Signet until the completion of the second phase includes prime customers not approved by Alliance Data and non-prime customers that sit above the progressive Tier. We have brought Genesis a leading provider and consumer financing that specializes in near and non-prime credit on board with a five-year agreement with the option to extend an additional two years to service our remaining secondary program accounts receivable and new originations. And in conjunction with the transition to Genesis which is expected to occur in October, 2017 we will move from the Recency method to the contractual aging methodology.","We do not expect any material impact to the financial statements as a result of the move to contractual aging. The move to contractual aging will be incorporated into our reserve methodology and the definition of charge up will change to be solely on a contractual aging basis. We plan to provide an update at the time of this transition.","As part of our agreement Genesis will run the operational interface and servicing functions and will retain a portion of our current credit operations in Akron, Ohio, including approximately 650 team members and certain facilities so, we expect the transition to be smooth. In line with the primary program, we expect to launch the servicing program with Genesis in October of 2017.","Looking ahead to the second phase of the outsourcing program we are planning to fully outsource our secondary credit program including the sale of the remaining receivables on our balance sheet as well as funding the new non-prime account origination. In conjunction with the outsourced credit programs we are introducing a new payment option in partnership with Progressive Leasing for those customers that do not qualify for outsourced credit programs or who do not wish to pursue a credit option. This includes customers who no longer will be covered through any of Signet\u2019s current credit programs as well as those that previously did not have a payment option to access Signet\u2019s merchandize.","Starting in August in-store Signet customers will have the option to lease jewelry whereby Progressive will pay the full value of the merchandize to Signet once the customer agrees to leasing terms. The program will launch online thereafter. As a result, Progressive will assume any financial risk from the leasing of the merchandize. Now while it\u2019s difficult to cite the opportunity, we are very pleased to have the accessibility of our competitive credit offerings to our customers. The initial term of the agreement is seven years similar to our agreement with Alliance Data.","With that, I will discuss the anticipated financial impact of the outsourced partnership structure on Slide 22. So Mark had mentioned that a priority for us was substantially maintaining our net sales and this transaction is designed to be able to do so. The structure we are putting in place provides coverage for our current credit offering; therefore, we expect no material impact from the outsourcing of our credit portfolio to net sales.","One aspect of our credit offering that is excluded from the new structure is that we will not provide credit insurance going forward from close of transaction which is incorporated in the anticipated financial impact from the transaction. This will further simplify the in-store selling process.","So walking down the P&L, we've already noted that the first phase is not expected to have any material impact on net sales and we also expect SG&A to be net favorable. We expect the outsourcing structure to reduce our SG&A expense by 2% to 3% on an annualized basis. That takes into account the elimination of SG&A associated with our current in-house credit operations, economic sharing with Alliance Data and the cost of outsourcing the credit servicing with Genesis.","Additionally in the first phase the transaction will create savings from the elimination of 23% to 27% of our bad debt expense net of late fee income associated with the prime portion of the in-house credit program.","Due to the elimination of approximately 50% of our credit income which we conventionally report under other operating income net line and expenses associated with outsourcing of the credit which are partially offset by elimination of credit operations and the economic sharing with Alliance Data, we expect to realize a minimal decline on our EBIT.","Further, there are significant benefits to our capital efficiency ratios from the removal of credit assets. We estimate our return on capital employed ratio could reach about 40% in fiscal 2019. Importantly, we expect the bottom line impact of the transaction will be accretive to earnings per share in the first full year of operations based on share repurchases at current share prices.","We expect to recognize one time transaction cost of $35 million to $45 million which is comprised of advisor and legal fees, IT conversion costs and employee transition expenses which are expected to be largely realized in fiscal 2018. In addition, we expect to incur a one-time non-cash gain in the second quarter due to the accounting treatment that requires us to reclassify our existing receivables that Alliance Data will purchase from assets held for investments to assets held for sale.","On Slide 23 we have provided an updated view of our capital allocation which is essentially unchanged. However, we have revised adjusted leverage ratio calculation. We remain committed to maintaining an investment grade profile with a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility to fund our business and growth strategy. The proceeds from the transaction will provide us additional liquidity of which $600 million will go towards repaying our existing securitization facilities.","We plan on using the remainder of the proceeds to repurchase shares over time. I will note though we have the flexibility to repurchase shares in advance of the close of the transaction depending on market conditions. These will be incremental to capital returns under our commitment to distribute 70% to 80% of free cash flow in the form of dividends and or share buybacks. So this capital allocation tenet will now exclude the one-time proceeds from the transaction.","Finally, we are targeting to maintain our adjusted leverage ratio between 3 times to 3.5 times which is in the range of our previous target of the low 3.5 times. On our website, we will post an illustrative reconciliation of our pro forma leverage calculation for fiscal year 2017. You will see this revised calculation excludes adjustments we previously included for our captive finance operation, move to a five times rent compared to previously eight times rent and doesn't include an add back for stock compensation. We believe this updated calculation is more simplified and reflective of our foregoing business model.","With that, I'll turn things back over to Mark to wrap up before we take your questions.","Mark Light","Thanks Michele. Before we take your questions, let me close by saying that we are extremely pleased with the first phase of our outsourcing of our credit programs that we announced today. While we initially sought to achieve the full outsourcing as part of a single structure, with this phased approach we have been able to substantially de-risk our balance sheet with the sale of 55% of our accounts receivable, not only maintain net sales, but also outsource servicing for our full credit receivables to our partners.","And we've achieved all this in a way that delivers value to our shoulders in the form of EPS accretion. Because we are executing from a position of strength, we were able to take the time to find the right partners for the second phase, partners that understand the importance of protecting our business, partners that understand the importance of understanding our customer\u2019s economics and delivering on our commitment to create value for our shareholders.","In summary, with the new credit structure in place Signet will have an enhanced focus on our strategic 2020 vision, which is focusing on delivering a customer first omnichannel experience.","With that, we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Tom Nikic","Hey, good morning, everyone. This is actually Tom Nikic on for Ike. I kind of had a couple of questions around the credit transaction on the primary portion. Can you give any - I think you mentioned that there's a profit sharing agreement with ADS, is there any sort of details or quantification you can give us around that? And I think you also said that ADS is taking about 250 of your employees and Genesis is taking some of them as well. Are there some other employees that are still going to be part of your business and would you anticipate seeing those employees be part of a Phase 2 transaction?","Michele Santana","Sure. So let me start with the employees, I will reverse it in back order of your questions. In terms of the employees, yes 250 of our employees will be transitioned to Alliance Data Systems and then 650 of our employees will be transitioned to Genesis.","There is a remaining population of employees that will stay with Signet for our customer care operation. So we think it is a great outcome and really what helped to facilitate a smooth transition upon the close of the transaction.","In terms of the profit sharing agreement, my remarks for that this would be net additive in terms of EBIT, it will reduce our SG&A expense but outside of that, I cannot quantify that for you.","Tom Nikic","Okay, got it. I was also just hoping to understand the deal with Progressive a little bit more as well. You know, I think you said that they would capture 7% of your current credit business. Is this also an opportunity to maybe facilitate sell to customers who would have otherwise been turned away until maybe there is an incremental sales benefit? And given that they're kind of a rent to own business, is that sort of a similar function like the customer is basically going to be renting the jewelry from you and returning it, if they can't make their payments any more, and any help there would be great?","Michele Santana","Sure. So and I\u2019m glad you really picked up on that, but this truly does represent potentially an incremental revenue opportunity for Signet, because not only for those customers that now under our current structure at that Lower Tier of 7% will have that option for Progressive, but customers who previously did not qualify for our current credit offerings have that ability. So, we do expect the program to generate incremental revenue for Signet. It is difficult to size the opportunity, but we're extremely pleased to add this additional option.","And just to go back and give you a little bit more flavor in terms of how the lease purchase works, I mentioned it's a seven-year agreement, Progressive Leasing will offer the lease purchase payment options to our customers that then don't qualify for our future credit program or potentially they just don't wish to pursue a credit option to begin with. So that as I mentioned includes the customers that no longer would be covered through Signet\u2019s current credit programs. What happens is, Signet will receive the payment from Progressive, so Progressive actually makes the purchase from Signet. We get the payment for the full value of that merchandise and then Progressive will enter into the lease contract with the customer.","Tom Nikic","All right so, basically once Progressive buys the merchandise from you guys it is sort of out of your hands?","Michele Santana","Yes, I mean subject to there's always the return policies we stand behind, but it\u2019s a relationship with Progressive and the customer.","Tom Nikic","Got it. All right. Thanks very much. I\u2019ll get back to the end of the queue. Thanks.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with Nomura\/Instinet. Your line is now open.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. Hey guys, good morning. So I guess just first off with the reiterated full year guide can you just share anything maybe quantify quarter to date trends, speak to the confidence for the full year? And then maybe any color on the February comp versus the ending comp run rate?","And then just Michele on the so, the loans you plan to still fund in phase one can you give any color there whether by FICO scores, bad debt to charge offs, any context you want to give for what you guys are still going to be funding and any timeline you want to share broadly for Phase two?","And then that piece that you were just referring to, the 7% that Progressive is taking, I think it was 7% of credits of last year, what has that looked like over the past several years in terms of that 7%? Thanks.","Mark Light","Hi, I\u2019ll take the first question and I\u2019ll turn it over to Michele. Good morning Simeon. As it relates to the business, as we said in the prepared comments Simeon, we had a very, very tough start of the year and it was not a great Valentine's Day. But the good news for us and why we're so - feel strongly about reaffirming our guidance is that if you normalize Mother's Day calendar sequentially after Valentine\u2019s Day into March into April and leading into Mother's Day we continue to get sequentially better and better. And we saw an enhanced performances not only across our categories of products and across our brands of stores, but just as importantly we saw enhanced sequential enhancements to our online exposure and customer experience.","We continue to get better at increasing our traffic. We continue to get better at increasing our conversions and we continue to get better increasing our online sales. And the one thing that we know more now than ever is that online experience for our customer is a critical and it will affect the in-store experience. So, the better we get online, the better the in-store experience and in-store sales will be. So, that's why we continue to have confidence in our reaffirmation of our guidance because we have seen the sequential improvement of our business straight from the end of Valentine\u2019s Day, all the way through and into Mother's Day.","Michele Santana","Yes, and Simeon I'll just add one comment before I move on to the next set of the questions that you had. If you go back and you think about at the time when we issued our annual guidance on March 9th we were well beyond Valentine\u2019s Day which is the largest contributor to the first quarter. In fact we do what the first month the largest month again of the quarter to be. So, we really had insight as to how our first quarter was shaping out and that was all factored into our guidance and then as Mark mentioned the continued sequential improvement that we've seen. So, we feel confident in reaffirming our guidance based on that.","In terms of your next question which I believe went into the non-prime component of it, let me see if I can give you a little bit more color. The expected gross value of the remaining portion of that portfolio is estimated approximately about $708 million to $100 million at the time of closing October 2017. So, this includes the non-prime accounts receivable that are related to our Sterling U.S. brand and it also does include a smaller portion related to the Zale brand.","And then I\u2019d also just direct you back into the slide presentation from a sales perspective representing about 28% of our credit sales in fiscal year 2017. I believe your last question related to the Progressive Leasing of the 7% in that Lower Tier and maybe how these metrics looked historically, I don't have any information with me, but I probably have no reason to believe that it would have looked significantly that different.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. And then maybe lastly, so you guys mentioned the challenging promotional environment a few times and we saw the sales, but you did point out the stronger March margins. So which is obviously a nice thing to see, so can you guys speak and Mark I wish speak to the way you're viewing sales versus margins and it looks like the resolve, maybe willingness to hold the short term sales for long term health, so just any thoughts on how you're viewing those two pieces?","Mark Light","Yes, Simeon it's always a balance obviously and we in the first quarter were able to preserve our gross margin and we just didn't feel during that time frame with the data we had there were able to make. We didn't have enough data to make the definitive decisions to go out and think that we can capture market share because there was some really deep discounting going on in some of our competitive set. And so we felt to the first quarter that we needed, we didn't have the data that we needed to stay firm and increase our gross margin dollars on that front.","That being said, as I said in my prepared comments with more data that we've got and from our data group and the information that we learnt about some of our marketing modeling that we were able for Mother's Day to be more promotional, but more targeted, have less stories on our promotions. So, we felt there was time during Mother\u2019s Day to do as we have opportunity to capture some market share while increasing our gross margin dollars to be a little bit more aggressive and more targeted.","Michele Santana","Yes and I would just add Simeon to that. I mean, it goes back at the time we issued our guidance where we talked about an amplified promotional environment and we knew that and built into our guidance was a level of incremental promotional activity this year based on what we've seen, so I'd say that's all been factored into the guidance as well.","Simeon Siegel","Great, thanks a lot of guys. Best of luck to both of you.","Michele Santana","Thank you, Simeon","Mark Light","Thank you, Simeon","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with C.L King & Associates. Your line is now open.","William Armstrong","Good morning everyone. A couple of questions. Michele, on the SG&A savings of 2% to 3% is that 2% to 3% based on the approximately $1.8 billion of adjusted SG&A kind of full year run rate that you had last year, is that how we should think about that?","Michele Santana","That\u2019s correct Bill.","William Armstrong","Okay, great and then I\u2019m not sure how much you can comment on this, but Phase two what sort of timing are we looking at on getting Phase two done? I assume that's going to be some time next year or how should we think about that?","Michele Santana","Yes, so in terms of the timing we plan on engaging in discussions very soon with capital providers to look to transfer our existing receivables as well to originate and fund the future receivables so those discussions will start very soon. We are committed to finalizing the full outsourcing of the credit portfolio in a timely manner, but at this time Bill we can't predict the timing or the ultimate composition of that.","Mark Light","You, look this, if you go out of this per year and you need to question what would happen for the full year you were involved in it. But our portfolio is a unique and complex portfolio as compared to other major retailers who sold their portfolios. In this Phase two function as I stated in my words, in my comments, we need to be focused and find the right partner who's going to service our customers the way we would be expected to be serviced and is going to partner with us.","And we believe those partners are out there, but we weren\u2019t able to focus on it singularly on that partnership we're trying to get one kind of package out right now and now we're going to take the time. We hope to get it done as soon as possible, but having Genesis as a servicer as a big leg up and having them work with our team members. And really we will - we are excited about the Genesis partnership because we believe they can even help us be better at lending dollars to those near prime and non-prime customers.","Michele Santana","Yes, so ultimately I\u2019d say we are executing the phased approach really from more of a strategic approach to outsourcing from a position and then working on from the position of strength and because of that we will and are able to take the necessary time to find the right partners and take care of our customers which is alternately our number one priority.","Mark Light","And it is important to remember Bill that we will be switching over to contractual aging when that deals close with Genesis that we're projecting to be in October.","William Armstrong","Got it. Is it possible that Phase two would be implemented this year or actually before October and sort of maybe leapfrog that or not really?","Mark Light","No, we don't see that as a possibility to close out Phase two this year.","William Armstrong","Okay, great. All right, thank you very much.","Michele Santana","Thank you, Bill.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Oliver Chen","Hi good morning. On the outsourcing program I have some concerns about how the selling experience will evolve like in-store in terms of the training and development and the heritage you have with the sales force really understanding your prior programs versus this one, so could you speak to that and if that\u2019s a risk factor that is reasonable to think about?","Also just broadly speaking, what do you think it will take for the comps to get less negative and then positive? Are you, there is factors outside your control which you mentioned in terms of competition as well, I'm just trying to understand the prioritization of factors as we ideally journey back to positive comps? Thanks.","Mark Light","Thank you, Oliver. As far as the outsourcing, we actually are not concerned. If you remember what the critical component of this whole transaction was that we're able to maintain sales and continue to prove and underwrite \u2013 continue to improve and underwrite our programs and the credit offerings that they have in the past. So we have all the confidence. We've worked with Alliance Data with our Zale stores, the secondary program which will be underwritten by Signet and with Genesis basically there is not a lot is going to change on that front.","But we will take time and train our team members, our team is actually excited about it because what is going to happen because of Alliance Data and because of Genesis is that they will ask our customers for less information, there will be more seamless experience and they won\u2019t be selling credit quite frankly which makes a whole selling transition a lot more seamless and they are very excited about the opportunities.","And some of our competitors already do this offering Progressive Leasing options to our customers which we believe there could be some incremental opportunities. So as far as the primary credit offering we believe that is going to be more seamless and easier for our team members to actually interact with our customers and asking for more less information and not trying to sell credit insurance. And that Progressive is a very simple program that our team members are very excited about getting involved with and again as I stated, some of our jewelry competitors are already offering that program is something that we could have and we believe there could be incremental sales opportunities.","On the comp question Oliver, I said in my comments there is things that we could control, things that we can\u2019t control and what we can control is making sure that we have the products and the right channels for our customers. And it all starts off with do customers still hold our products in favour? And I will tell you that all the research that we have done, anything that we have researched and some of our data perspective is, our consumers, whether it be Millennials or whatever age group or demographic they are involved in, still find jewelry is a wonderful way of expressing emotion and love. And over the last 25 years of the jewelry industry and I think over the last 25 years, the jewelry industry has grown on a compounded annual growth rate of 3.8% almost 4% which is very good and better than a lot of industries.","Now we have had some dips in those timeframes, but as a whole we've come on and specifically Signet and we have seen dips in the last 25 years, Signet has come out as even a stronger company and able to have strong comps going forward. So we need to do as a retailer with passion and intensity is to make sure we have the right products for our customers in the fashion arena, in the bridal arena and we are focused on that is to make sure that we have the omnichannel experience is second to none. When the clients or customer goes online, goes into an outlet store, goes on a Facebook page whatever their experience it's got to be seamless and as smooth as possible and we are very focused on that.","And just as an example, during Mother\u2019s Day, if you went to k.com in the past the download of a page may have taken over 10 seconds and now it\u2019s taking under five seconds and in-store is taking under three seconds and where we are doing a lot of enhancements in our marketing of our digital marketing and a lot of enhancements to our in-store customer service and our online presence. So it\u2019s all about making sure that we give our customers the superior customer first omnichannel experience, that will start increasing and improving our accounts.","Oliver Chen","Okay. And it does feel like you have intensified that perspective on the omnichannel story and you had some good leadership there in the beginning as well. Do you - how would you view your model as on Amazon able and what does that mean to you in terms of being very competitive versus Amazon because we have also seen some pure-plays look for physical retail, so I\u2019m just curious about that and like was there intensification of investment happening here given the trends you\u2019re seeing?","Mark Light","There is definite intensification, not only of investments in the omnichannel experience, but in investments in the talent that we have in our business, investments in the technology, investments in team members and partners that can help us make sure that we are the best, because we believe that in a lot of ways the jewelry experience is different online and still the vast majority of jewelry is bought in person, but the vast majority of customers go online first to educate themselves.","So, we have to have and our plans and our expectations by Christmas time that as good a jewelry online experience as anybody in the industry. And so yes, however it is critical that online which ties into our omnichannel experience is as good as it gets enjoy and we will be focused on using our resources to get us there as fast as possible.","Oliver Chen","Okay, thank you. Best regards.","Mark Light","Thank you, same to you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is now open.","Brian Tunick","Thanks, good morning guys. I guess first question for Michele, I think you commented that you expect no impact to revenues on the sale. I'm just curious, people have been saying where Zale, I guess credit participation rates are trending now under Alliance Data systems, can you maybe talk about that the Zale credit penetration and how you think that won't happen in the Sterling division?","And then second question I guess, on the market share closing of independence seems to be continuing at a very high pace. What do you think is happening to that customer or market share as the independents close and does that give you more flexibility on rent negotiations as you come to these lease terms? Thanks very much.","Michele Santana","All right Brian. I'll start with your first question and then Mark and I can take your second question. So in terms of, I guess credit penetration, and you're trying to compare and contrast Zale and Sterling, do you tender and just put this out for you that, due to the tender shift that we would expect to see from credit to non-credit tender, we do anticipate that there would be a single digit decrease in our credit penetration rate.","So simply if you go back to the slide that we talked about fully covering our current spectrum of credit sales, Progressive at that 7% is not considered to be a credit sale, so that's what I'm referring to in terms of the tender shift.","So although we'll be covering the full spectrum of our sales, part of it would no longer be considered credit. I\u2019d also referenced that the progressive leasing will sit across all of our brands including Zale that currently doesn\u2019t sit there today, so that also becomes incremental opportunity for us. So, Mark do you want to take that?","Mark Light","Yes, as it relates to Brain, your question about independence closing is a good point. There has been a dramatic increase of closings of independent jewellers. The biggest increase since the recession and in the short term that's a challenge for us because a lot of independent jewellers a lot of their net worth is in their inventory. So, the way they're getting their money back out is having massive liquidation sales at or below cost to get their cash out of their business and we're obviously not going to go complete to those levels.","That being said, in the longer term, the independents closing is an opportunity for us because the independents don't have the capabilities, the scale, the expertise that we have whether be in the supply chain or be in marketing, whether it be linear marketing or digital marketing or the investments of the dollars that we're going to put into the omnichannel experience.","So we think there is greater opportunities in the near short term, but not the very short term to gain market share because those independents are closing and the ones that are left really can't do a lot of things that our scale allows us to do, is in relation to your point about rent negotiations that you can never make a statement across the board about rent negotiation. It always depends on the center or the mall or what the participation in the mall is and what kind of year it is.","There are opportunities in some places to get rent relief for certain, but some of the top malls and the top centers in the country you just can't, you're not going to get there, you are also getting the best location, the best mall.","We are looking to optimize our footprint completely. We think we have a very diversified portfolio. Right now less than 6% of our sales is done outside the mall. If you look five years from now, over 50% of our sales will be done outside the mall and we think that as all just tie into the benefits of the omnichannel experience which will make our stores more efficient and more productive.","Brian Tunick","Super. Thanks and good luck.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Mark Light","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Your line is now open.","Paul Lejuez","Thanks guys. Still a big picture question, you know mall traffic I think has been pressure points for you guys for some time, but you were able to buck the trend for many years. I'm curious to know just in your opinion what changed over the past several quarters, call it over the past four quarters that has caused the falloff in end comps? And if you could maybe just give a little bit more color on mall versus off mall performance and the differences that you're seeing in A, B and C locations? Thanks.","Mark Light","Sure, I\u2019m going to start the latter, as it relates to mall versus off mall performance in the fourth quarter and it continued into the first quarter and sequentially continued to Mother's Day and the off mall stores have performed better than our mall stores and continue to do so. As far as what's changed, I mean big changes this whole omnichannel experience. I mean traffic Brian, has dropped even more substantially than it has mall traffic, specifically has dropped more substantially than it has over the last couple of years.","A lot of that we believe again is that because people instead of shopping in the mall they're shopping online and going to online first so that they have to make less trips to the malls. We still believe that our products, I mean as long as we have the products that our customers are looking for, specifically obviously engagement ring is somewhat Amazon proof that people still want to engage with a sales associate, they still want to engage and be educated on diamonds and understand about the product they\u2019re buying, but we have to do a much better job online in making sure that that experience online is more critical.","So the big change Paul, is that two or three years ago the online experience wasn't as critical as it is today because that mall traffic that were getting the benefit from in the past is now being taken up by the online traffic and we are doing everything in our power to make sure they have fabulous experiences online, so that we can have the opportunity when we have lesser customers walking in our malls, in our stores to close them in a higher ratio.","Michele Santana","Maybe if I could just pile on when you think about you know that our footprint and our diversification between mall and off mall, what we do know with that our Kay off mall is our highest ROI and that really has been where our focus has been in terms of our investment opportunity to grow that off mall locations on the Kay side and further diversifying between the mall and off mall locations.","Paul Lejuez","Got it and you made a comment that in five years you expect 50% percent of your business to be off mall, is that correct and I guess I'm just wondering what percentage of that is actually physical locations off mall versus ecom?","Mark Light","I\u2019m referring to, I\u2019m referring to the actual physical locations mall versus off mall.","Paul Lejuez","Got you. Okay, great. Thanks guys. Good luck.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Lindsay Drucker-Mann with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Lindsay Drucker-Mann","Thanks. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask one on synergies as far as what you were able to achieve in the quarter and how you\u2019re thinking about for the full year?","Michele Santana","Sure, Lindsay. So our synergies part of our guidance that we had issued was $70 million was our expectation to achieve for this year which is built into the guidance that we have reaffirmed today. We feel confident in terms of achieving those synergies and we're definitely where we need to be.","Lindsay Drucker-Mann","Okay, great and then as far as the extended service plan revenues and how we think about modeling that for the full year, that's been growing a bit ahead of sales historically. Is that the right trend line to use going forward or should we think about, that growing more inline or even slower than sales?","Michele Santana","I probably, I don't know if I would do it slower than sales, I think inline maybe slightly above would directionally be the right way to model.","Lindsay Drucker-Mann","Okay, great thank you.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Scott Krasik with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Scott Krasik","Hi, thanks. Just a question on guidance and then the question on credit. So I know you don't want to give quarterly guidance, but you did just miss consensus in 1Q by about $0.50 or $0.60 and $100 million on sales. So as we look at 2Q, can you give us some ideas, consensus, reasonable where it is right now and I know you didn\u2019t want to give a quarter or day comp, but relative to the low to mid single digits for the full year, do you expect that to be at the high end, above the high end, at the low end, any color there would be great?","Michele Santana","Yes, sure. So probably I'm not going to provide you much color. As we said when we initiated our annual guidance we were no longer providing quarterly guidance and really can't comment in terms of the consensus that's out there. We're confident for the reasons that we cited on the call in terms of reaffirming our annual guidance and that was based on the fact where we stood at the time we issued that knowing how the Q1 was shaping out. And then the reaffirmation comes with the comments that Mark had said in terms of the sequential improvement that we've seen in our comps combined with the initiatives and the actions we've taken to drive savings as well.","Scott Krasik","And then I guess from a credit standpoint, you're going to see an increase in the delinquencies when you switch to contractual. As we look back in times when they're tough, I mean we're still in a full employment situation, I mean how should we think about sort of modeling the credit business on a go forward basis when the environment is a little bit more challenging?","Michele Santana","Yes, so I guess, two comments to that, keep in mind what we've said is this is the first phase and then there is a second phase where we would look to fully remove those receivables from our balance sheet. I know we did not provide any timing, but we will look at those discussions soon.","In terms of your question on the contractual aging, mentioned comments on the call that we will move to the contractual aging method in conjunction with the transition to Genesis and we would expect that to happen in October of 2017. I also provided comments that we don't expect any material impact to financial statements as a result of the move to contractual aging. And really from a customer perspective, it's likely that there's going to be a lower card monthly payment to really harmonize those terms with Alliance Data.","So the only \u2013 so that would be a change. Billing statements they already receive on a contractual basis, so really from a customer perspective, I would say no call out to that. And then the other part of your question can you go back to?","Scott Krasik","Just trying to understand things are still pretty good from a credit standpoint, just trying to model now the sensitivity going forward?","Michele Santana","Yes, so in terms of a modeling standpoint, let me try and just give you some of the color and a lot of it I will guide you back to originally what my prepared remarks were. So as we went through the slide material, I did go through on how to really model the impact of Phase 1 on EBIT on an annualized basis. If you think about that we said the transaction is expected to close in October of 2017, if you apply the normal seasonality that should really help you think about the impact of these 2018 and then of course as we move forward, we will give you additional updates at the appropriate time.","Scott Krasik","Okay, thanks very much.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Stein with Northcoast. Your line is now open.","Jeff Stein","Hey Michele, I have got a modeling question and I\u2019m not sure I got it right, did you indicate that on an annualized basis Phase 1 is EBIT positive or EBIT negative, again annualized once Phase 1 is completed?","Michele Santana","Right, so let me go back and give you that information. It is a slight decline to EBIT. So if we go back through, I guess the component of that roughly 23% to 27% of our net bad debt expense and late charge income will be eliminated, that's associated with the prime and that also includes will be eliminated associated with the prime.","If you go down to SG&A, our total SG&A reduction is estimated to be 2% to 3% annualized and that's really three components that are in there. First of all we're going to have savings associated with the elimination of our in-house credit operations. The second piece that's in there is we will have the economic sharing with Alliance Data, so that is a positive and then we will have the cost of outsourcing the credit servicing function to Genesis.","But when you put those three things in a blender, it drives in overall reduction to SG&A and then you have the elimination of roughly across 50% or so of our finance charge income. So when you take those three things that leads to a slight decline in the EBIT on an annualized basis.","Jeff Stein","Got it. Okay, that makes sense. On the trends for Mother's Day, obviously you guys did increase your promotional activity, so I know you're not talking about forward-looking, but when you report second quarter should we expect to see a change in the direction of merchandise margins?","Michele Santana","I\u2019m sorry, I totally missed your last question.","Mark Light","With the increased promotion of Mother\u2019s Day change in merchandize amount for Q2?","Michele Santana","Yes, so let me give you a little bit of color on that Jeff. I mentioned before that we had anticipated as part of our annual guidance that we would be in a more promotional environment this year. So that is factored into the guidance. As we've mentioned before we will continue to look to kind of balance that margin depending on how promotional environment gets. So that would be the additional color I'd provide.","Jeff Stein","Okay with the 30% off promotion at Kay and 30% to 50% off at Zale was that a planned or unplanned promotion because your Mother\u2019s Day circulars did not include that 30% off?","Mark Light","As I said Jeff from my comments, we had some real time data that we got later than when the Mother\u2019s Day catalogues were printed and so it was planned, but it was planned after the print of those catalogues.","Jeff Stein","Got it, okay. That makes sense. And one final question, in your release you did reference the fact that you had a mix of lower rate plans which affected your credit income, could you \u2013 Michele, could you elaborate a little bit on that, what plans are you referring to?","Michele Santana","Yes, absolutely Jeff. So we had talked over the past year about we did the testing and then we did the full roll out of our 36 month bridal plans which under that plan, it's based on there's a dollar amount you have to purchase to qualify and then it's at a reduced interest rate. So that is having the effect and that is what I was referencing, it\u2019s a lower rate which ultimately would have an impact on that finance charge line.","Jeff Stein","Okay, thank you very much.","Michele Santana","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Rick Patel with Needham and Company. Your line is now open.","Rick Patel","Thank you, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just a few ones on e-commerce. First, can you help us think about what's driving your e-commerce sales in terms of categories or branded lines and whether there have been changes to that over the past few quarters?","And second, as you make investments in omnichannel, do you expect an acceleration in online sales or will the uptick show up in stores as people still look to buy product in stores perhaps after talking to an associate or seeing the product in person?","Mark Light","Thanks Rick. There's a lot going on in our online business and I'll just talk to you about several of them and just going on. One is that we're trying to enhance the customer experience. I mentioned this earlier, our page download speed has improved dramatically. If you go from Christmas of last year it has improved to Valentine\u2019s Day and it sequentially has improved all the way through Mother's Day where we had just dramatic improvement of cut in half of page download speed.","Our check out efficiency is better. The way our customers have to apply promotions or rewards is more seamless for them. Our personalized jewelry is better. Our website personalization is better. Our search engine optimization has been improved and our search engine marketing has been improved. And that\u2019s just on the customer experience side. We're also thinking, there's ways that we are going to grow the business to your question and we're dedicating more human resources to our online channel. We\u2019re adding additional investments in our e-commerce platforms and capabilities and we are reallocating materially more marketing dollars to digital.","So that being said, we are expecting both to improve Rick. We believe that because of the online experience which is all omnichannel critical that our online sales should improve which they have been sequentially and we believe that will enhance our in-store business also going forward.","So yes, because we believe because of our instruments and our improvements to our online business, we will improve our online business going further into the year and our in-store business and again that is one of the reasons why we\u2019re reaffirming our guidance today.","Rick Patel","And can you touch on the margin profile of your online segment versus your brick-and-mortar stores perhaps some context on where is that right now and what is the go forward assumption as some of your investments ramp up?","Michele Santana","Yes, so our margin on our e-commerce business is actually a little bit higher than our brick-and-mortar. So as we continue to ramp up investments, really don't anticipate say a material change in what that margin looks like. The biggest difference that we see is the rent expense associated with the brick-and-mortar and although you've got the distribution costs flowing through the e-commerce channel, it still drives the higher margin overall from the brick-and-mortar.","Rick Patel","Great, thank you very much.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Mark Light","And thank you all for taking part in this call. Our next scheduled call is to report the second quarter of fiscal 2018 on August 24. Thank you all again and goodbye.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's call.

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded today, November 24, 2015 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.","I would now like to turn the meeting over to your host for today\u2019s call, James Grant, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, James.","James Grant","Good morning and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. On the call today are Mark Light, CEO and Michele Santana, CFO. The presentation deck we will be referencing is available under the Investors section of our website, signetjewelers.com.","During today\u2019s presentation, we will in places discuss Signet\u2019s business outlook and make certain forward-looking statements. Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number for risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. We urge you to read the risk factors, cautionary language and other disclosures in the Annual Report on Form 10-K that was filed on March 26 with the SEC. We also draw your attention to Slide #2 in today\u2019s presentation for additional information about forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures.","I will now turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Light","Thanks, James and good morning everyone. In the third quarter, Signet comps and total sales both increased by 3.3%. Adjusted EPS was at $0.33 a share, a 57.1% increase over the prior year\u2019s adjusted EPS. There are four key messages that I want you to take away from our results and our guidance. First, in what has been a choppy retail environment for most, we were able to deliver same-store sales growth in line with our guidance. Our total sales increase, which came from all selling channels were driven primarily by branded bridal sales across all of our store banners as well as strong growth overall from Kay Jewelers, Ernest Jones and Piercing Pagoda.","We also continued to outperform our industry according to the latest U.S. government and British Retail Consortium data. This was driven by a multitude of strength that separate us from our competition such as advertising, driving jewelry trends, branding and much more. Second, we made significant investments in store operations, systems and training during the third quarter in order to be in the best possible position for the fourth quarter and those investments are starting to payoff. While our sales results in the aggregate were in line with our expectations, we saw some softness at Jared and Zales. This was a result of very specific systems investments, personnel changes and training that we implemented in the quarter. I will elaborate on these changes later in the call, but suffice it to say that this was a lot of change to implement in a short period of time. We thought it was appropriate to push through these changes and investment in our smallest quarter in order to prepare us for our biggest quarter and into the future.","The third point I want you to take away is that these investments are paying off and we are seeing solid sales results across our banners thus far in the quarter, particularly at Jared and Zales. One specific bright spot is sales from our newest must-have collection, Ever Us, which was launched on October 15 and have exceeded our expectations thus far. We are confident heading into the holiday season given the strength of our business and the results to-date as evidenced by our guidance for accelerating same-store sales growth of 3.5% to 5% in the fourth quarter.","The fourth point is that our top line results are translating into strong earnings growth per shares. Our adjusted EPS grew by 57% in the third quarter. The Zales integration continues to go very well. Importantly, we are realizing net synergies from our acquisition integration activities during the third quarter, which in part helped driving operating margin 190 basis points higher or 90 basis points on an adjusted basis. While we delivered excellent earnings growth overall in the quarter, there was a modest margin impact due to a sales mix shift from Jared to Kay, which Michele will elaborate on later.","Now, let\u2019s take a look at the sales drivers of the third quarter. Bridal, which is a strategic focus of ours, grew faster than Signet\u2019s overall rate of sales. The bridal business is a stable grower and insulates us from some of the volatility that traditional retailers face. Bridal brands such as Vera Wang Love, Neil Lane and the Forever Diamond, which is sold exclusively in our 8 Zales stores led the way. Complementing those results has been the momentum of fashion collections, such as Diamonds in Rhythm and diamond solitaire earrings led by the radiant reflection assortment as well as growth in bracelets and a variety of jewelry for the rest.","Also marketing initiatives in the third quarter did well. Most notably at Kay, we increased our TV rates and executed successful multimedia campaign around engagement season. We also applied learnings from our customer segmentation study to our advertising creative, which we believe is starting to resonate with our customer. And speaking of Kay, the team had an excellent quarter across all of its selling channel and have a wide variety of product collections, including fashion jewelry and watches as well as bridal. Piercing Pagoda had a great third quarter, which was driven by gold, piercings, diamonds and religious jewelry. Improvements in training and the newly design kiosk helped results as well. Ernest Jones delivered outstanding results across all of the selling channels driven principally by diamond and the watch business. These gains, however, were partially offset by the multitude of investments that we made at Jared and Zales.","So to elaborate a little, Jared managed a significant amount of change around field operations, including coverage and selling process. Zales initiatives included discount control policies, repair process and more. These distracted our people a bit, but it was the appropriate decision for our business to prepare us for the important fourth quarter. While this was a lot of change to implement in the short period of time, it was important to get it done in our smallest quarter to prepare us for the fourth quarter when we expect to make over half of our adjusted EPS for the year.","Towards the end of the third quarter, we launched Ever Us, our new must-have offering and the biggest product introduction in our company\u2019s history. We are about six weeks into it and Ever Us is off to a strong start. To review, Ever Us is Signet\u2019s effort to jumpstarting innovation in our industry. It was led by our New York design office. We identified the need in the jewelry industry and developed to start a collection, which is been consistently marketed and tagged with all of our store banners in the markets that we serve. The 2-stone diamond ring, which is positioned to be for one\u2019s best friend and true love, serves a variety of gift-giving occasions in the lives of couples.","Ever Us sales are greater than our expectations at this point. And what\u2019s most exciting is the longer term strategic potential of a program like this. For now, Ever Us comes in one ring style and five different carat ways, but we anticipate extending the benefit tail driven by product line extensions into maybe different ring designs, earrings and pendants and omni-channel opportunities. As a matter of fact, Ever Us has already established a strong online presence. Part of the power of Ever Us is that it\u2019s being purchased for a wide variety of occasions. We are hearing stories from our store teams that customers are purchasing Ever Us for anniversaries, for birthdays, special mother and daughter events and even for self purchase. Needless to say, we are very excited to see how Ever Us is received by our customers in the fourth quarter.","Now, that we are done with the third quarter in which we made significant progress around implementing initial phases of select systems, testing products and refining selling techniques, we are locked and loaded for the fourth quarter. So, let\u2019s take a closer look at some of the initiatives going on. In merchandising, as I mentioned, we are very optimistic about Ever Us. Vera Wang Love continues to do well in all of our selling channels globally. The cross-selling effort tested so low in Jared that is now fully rolled out to every Jared store. The Star Wars collection of beads as well as men\u2019s and women\u2019s jewelry is off to an excellent start in Kay stores. Miracle Links has expanded to all Jared stores and about 500 Kay stores and it\u2019s the perfect gift for new moms symbolizing the birth of a child.","In marketing, we have greater advertising ways and more impressions than last year across all of our store brands. We have applied many of our recent customer segmentation learning to our new campaigns. Our new TV ads are available to view at signetjewelers.com on our Media Center page.","Jared ran its first and very successful sales event billed Light Up the Holidays earlier this month. And Zales has one incremental preferred customer event this quarter also. In field operations, the investment that we made in the third quarter at Zales around training, systems and process for a peer, discount controls and custom jewelry are in early stage deployment. And Jared has made some improvements to its selling techniques, coverage and customer relationship management. Our field operations team are highly motivated and ready to execute this holiday season. The testing of our in-house credit group offer credit at Zales as a third month quickly moved from a test in mid-October to full rollout here in the fourth quarter.","And we know that our customers heavily rely on our online platform to learn about jewelry, compare products when they purchase online or they purchase in store. We are aggressively implementing changes that enhance the omni-channel experience and drive online and in-store sales. Led by our newly promoted Signet\u2019s Senior Vice President, Julien Shirley mobile navigation and search has been dramatically improved. It is also greater personalization and targeted digital marketing, which has elevated the efficiency and the effectiveness of our omni-channel approach to selling.","There has been more going on in this company in recent months than I can recall in my long history here at Signet. Third quarter is the time to train and plan for new initiatives. And now with the fourth quarter underway and distraction to our store team members minimize, we are excited about all the new initiatives that they will deliver. So to sum up the third quarter, Signet delivered solid sales, net synergies, operating margin expansion, significant adjusted EPS growth and completed the fourth quarter preparations effectively. We are loaded with initiatives in the fourth quarter in all the critical areas of our business, including merchandising, marketing, store operations and credit. These initiatives are already paying off as evidenced by our results to-date and our expectations for accelerating same-store sales of 3.5% to 5% in the fourth quarter. And we are simultaneously delivering consistent strong sales and earnings growth, achieving synergy goals, executing transformative initiative that will facilitate long-term profitable growth, and we are making the share purchases we committed to as part of our capital allocation plan. We are very confident and excited about our fourth quarter and long-term opportunities.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Michele for a run through on the financials.","Michele Santana","Thank you, Mark and good morning everyone. Alright. So let\u2019s begin with our third quarter sales performance. Signet\u2019s total sales and comps each increased 3.3% and on a constant exchange basis, total sales increased 4.9%. Let me add some additional color on our total sales and comp performance by division. Starting with our Sterling division, total sales increased 5.9% to $733.5 million, which included a comp increase of 3.5%. Sales increased primarily due to branded bridal and select diamond jewelry, most notably at Kay. This was partially offset by a comp decline at Jared. The average transaction price in Sterling increased by 3% and the number of transactions decreased by 0.7% due to merchandise mixed shift in favor of branded bridal.","Our Zale division Q3 total sales decreased by 0.5%, but increased 2.4% on a constant exchange basis. Total sales were $329.9 million including a same-store sales increase of 2.6%. The average transaction price and number of transactions both increased 1%. The Zales jewelry operating segment saw higher transaction growth at 2.9% and a decrease in average transaction value of 1.9% as we improved sales productivity in fashion jewelry. Piercing Pagoda sales were driven by an 11.6% increase in average transaction value, while transaction count remained flat. The higher average transaction value was primarily due to higher gold sales. Now in our UK division, total sales decreased 1.1% but increased 4.9% on a constant exchange basis. Total sales were $149.4 million, with a comp sales increase of 4.1%, driven primarily by diamond jewelry and watches, most notably at Ernest Jones. The average transaction price increased 3.4% and the number of transactions increased by 2.3%.","Now moving on from sales, let\u2019s walk through Signet\u2019s consolidated Q3 performance and then we will turn and analyze Signet\u2019s adjusted results. So on Slide 9, the table provides the reconciliation of Signet\u2019s adjusted results to consolidated results. The difference between adjusted Signet and Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and transaction costs, which includes integration-related expenses. Starting on the right side of the slide on a GAAP basis, EPS was $0.19 per share. The next helm-over reflects our transaction costs, which are primarily costs for consultants that are assisting us with the integration. Transaction costs were responsible for $0.11 of EPS dilution. Purchase accounting adjustments which reflect a reduction to deferred revenue and amortization of unfavorable contracts were diluted to EPS by $0.03. And on an adjusted Signet basis, the foremost left column, EPS was $0.33.","So moving on and reviewing Signet\u2019s adjusted P&L results below the sales line, adjusted gross margin was $373.8 million or 30.6% of adjusted sales. This rate was flat to last year as the favorable impact from commodity cost and synergies was entirely offset by the impact of bad debt due to the sales mix shift from Jared to Kay. The sourcing impacted the key inputs led by gold was favorable and we are starting to benefit from new initiatives, principally in Zales such as discount controls, vendor terms and other growth margin enhancing programs. These factors combined improve the Zales division\u2019s gross margin rate by 120 basis points. The Sterling division gross margin declined 90 basis points, driven primarily by the sales mix shift. This mix shift had a notable impact on gross margins, given that Q3 is the smallest quarter. I will discuss further details in a few minutes related to this.","Our UK gross margin increased 70 basis points due primarily to occupancy leverage. Adjusted SG&A was $387.6 million or 31.7% of adjusted sales. This rate was favorable to last year by 40 basis points and was driven by store payroll leverage and partially offset by incremental investments in Zale around advertising, technology support and employee benefits. Other operating income was $60.9 million. This increase of $7.4 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. Adjusted operating income of $47.1 million or 3.9% of sales reflects a 31.9% increase in dollars and a rate expansion of 90 basis points. This growth was driven by the increase in sales, net synergies and SG&A leverage.","The credit mix shift had a notable and partially offsetting impact on operating income because our operating earnings in Q3 are less than 5% of our overall annual operating earnings. So a small shift in credit has a more noticeable impact. Adjusted EPS was $0.33 compared to $0.21 last year, an increase of 57.1%, driven principally by stronger business performance. We repurchased 30 million of Signet\u2019s stock in the third quarter and 112 million year-to-date. This is ahead of our capital allocation plan and already within our annual buyback guidance. Nevertheless, we anticipate being in the market in our fiscal fourth quarter, we have 154 million left on our share repurchase authorization program.","So let\u2019s move on to balance sheet and we will begin with inventory. This is the first quarter since the Zale acquisition that we had an apples-to-apples result and our continued focus on optimization of Zale inventory is reflected within our Q3 ending inventory position. Net inventory ended the quarter at $2.7 billion, an increase of 2%. At the end of the third quarter, we had 39 more stores than the previous year, which is what drove the inventory growth. Now this was offset in part by outstanding inventory management across all of our Signet businesses.","In our Zales division we ended narrower and deeper in our assortment, which continues to be a strategic objective for us. It\u2019s important to note that our total sales increased 3.3%, which is 130 basis points faster than the growth in our total inventory. Coupled with sound inventory management across the rest of our business, this puts us in a good, clean position to have started the fourth quarter.","So, now let\u2019s move on and turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Net accounts receivable increased to $1.5 billion compared to $1.3 billion last year and that\u2019s up 12.3% driven by higher sales and an increase in the Sterling division credit penetration rate. Year-to-date, credit participation was 63% compared to 61.7% last year driven by Kay. Our credit approval standards remained disciplined and unchanged. The higher participation rate was primarily driven by a greater increase of Kay customers compared to our Jared customers. The average monthly collection rate was 11.7% compared to 12.1% due to two main reasons: first, as our mix of bridal increases due to our Best in Bridal strategy, this creates a higher average receivable. By design, the repayment rate is lower as the price point of the merchandise increases. Bridal has a higher average credit sale and therefore the repayment is longer. So, this leaves a higher outstanding receivable to be collected. And second, like other consumer loans, more principal is paid off later in the life of the loan. So, as our credit portfolio has grown more in the last year, proportionately more of it will be paid later.","Net bad debt expense for the quarter was $53 million compared to $41.7 million last year. The increase of $11.3 million was driven by higher receivable balances as well as the mix of customers accepting our credit, particularly by store banner. That is just Jared typically has a higher tiered credit scoring customer than Kay, but Kay credit sales are growing faster than Jared resulting in a sales mix shift. Importantly, Signet has not changed its credit standards and our credit portfolio continues to perform well and profitably.","Other operating income was $60.9 million compared to $53.5 million last year. The increase of $7.4 million was due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivable base. The net impact of bad debt and other operating income generated operating profit of $7.9 million compared to $11.8 million in the prior year. No changes have been made in our credit standards and the bottom line is that small changes have a more pronounced impact in the third quarter as the third quarter is our smallest quarter, but our credit earnings are earned more evenly throughout the year. This modest shift in mix had a $4.5 million impact in the quarter or about $0.04 to earnings per share. We remain highly disciplined in our approval process and as a result, our credit portfolio continues to be profitable and stable.","So finally, let\u2019s walk through our fourth quarter guidance. Signet\u2019s fourth quarter comparable store sales are expected to increase 3.5% to 5%. And as Mark indicated earlier, we are experiencing a strong start to the quarter across all banners based on the number of initiatives that we have put in place. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $3.40 to $3.60. Based on the investments we have made and the strong sales results we have seen to-date, we are confident in this guidance. From an effective tax rate standpoint, Signet\u2019s fiscal 2016 annual rate is anticipated to be about 28% to 29% and that\u2019s both on an adjusted and GAAP basis.","Capital expenditure guidance for the full year now stands at $260 million to $280 million due primarily to timing. The reduction versus our earlier projection is attributed to a combination of store remodels, information technology and facilities that we likely will address before the end of the fiscal year. Net selling square footage is still projected to grow approximately 2% to 3% and I would reference you to see our news release for details on how the capital is to be directed. We remain highly confident in our achieving our synergy target of $30 million to $35 million for fiscal 2016 as well as our 3-year target of $150 million to $175 million.","And with that, I will turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark Light","Thank you, Michele. So to sum up, we had a good quarter. We had our biggest product launch, which is exceeding our expectations. And we made some smart strategic investments and those investments are starting to pay off in time for our most important quarter. Finally, I sincerely want to congratulate and thank all Signet team members. We believe we are very well positioned for a profitable long-term growth as a direct result of the passion and dedication of the Signet team.","And with that, we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Stephen Albert","Hi, guys. This is Stephen Albert on for Lorraine. I guess first question would just be the increase in the bad debt expense that\u2019s due solely to a mix shift and you are not seeing any deterioration in any of your credit metrics, correct?","Michele Santana","That\u2019s absolutely correct. And let me just add a little bit more color. Again just to start with, every credit decision we made is done on a very thorough analysis using those predictive and statistical analysis to drive those decisions. And again, we said this before, credit really is a competitive advantage to us that enables our sales and drives a higher customer lifetime value than a non-customer \u2013 non-credit customer. And so really what we saw in Q3 and I would just draw an analogy to merchandise mix, where product changes might affect rate, but profit is still flowing through the bottom line. So, when you think about our Q3 which is really our smallest quarter and that our credit earnings are more evenly spread throughout the year, it just has a more profound impact on our Q3. So really, that increase is driven by this mix shift that we saw in Q3 we equated it to about $0.04 per share and our credit portfolio continues to operate profitably. It is stable and continues to perform strong and well within our expectations based on this mix shift.","Stephen Albert","Great. And then I guess a quick follow-up on the average transaction price decline at Zales that also you seem to indicate that was a mix shift towards fashion jewelry. You haven\u2019t made any sort of pricing investments at Zales that have driven that either, correct?","Michele Santana","No, that\u2019s absolutely correct. And that again this is part of our strategic objectives when we look at the Zales. Zales has always done well within the bridal category. And particularly as you moved into the holiday, the Q3 holiday seasons, where they haven\u2019t performed as well as in fashion jewelry. And so that\u2019s been a key area that we have looked to drive. Particularly, we talked about our Unstoppable Love fashion jewelry before the shimmering diamond, which has been a tremendous success for us at Zale. So when you see that ATV change, it really is merchandise mix driving from that bridal to our fashion jewelry.","Stephen Albert","Alright. Thank you, guys.","Michele Santana","You are welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen. Your line is open.","Oliver Chen","Hi, thank you. We just had a question regarding the Jared comp store sales and looking forward, which comp lever do you think has the most opportunity? And also, Mark, can you elaborate on your earlier comments about some of the transitions regarding the training program and how that will manifest mix, it sounds like you are in really good shape for fourth quarter? Thank you.","Mark Light","Hi, Albert. Thank you. Yes, we do believe we are in very good position in the fourth quarter. And I just want to ground everybody listening on the call that traditionally to serve in the jewelry industry, we take the third quarter as an important quarter for us to train our people, prepare them for all the new initiatives and get them ready for the fourth quarter and the third quarter is our smallest quarter. In Jared, they had more going on than usual, because we were focused on a lot of different areas of business that we are trying to enhance and a lot of it came from our customer segmentation study that we did with Bain to get a better understanding of that Jared customer that settlement of this customer to make sure we are interacting with them the appropriate way what they are expecting. So, some of the things that we did in the third quarter one is we had a major leadership conference, where we get all of our managers and get them trained and ready. And then our Jared team had to focus on some more specific areas, because we are changing our selling process and techniques.","And quite frankly, the third quarter is the time when we make sure that we have all the right team members, both from a managerial perspective and on the sales floor, that we have the right team members in place that are ready and prepared to execute our new selling techniques that correlate with our new \u2013 our Bain segmentation study. So we have made some changes. We have made some changes in the stores and made it \u2013 because we have some team members that weren\u2019t there and weren\u2019t ready. So we made some good personnel changes first and foremost, then we focused on training our team members to sell differently. They actually have changed their selling techniques to get it more specific with the customers on what they are looking for as opposed to giving them a tour of our entire store whether they were looking for a tour or not.","We also had some enhancements and some product launches. Vera Wang Love is rolling to all of our stores. The team members are getting to understand the Vera Wang collection better. So a lot of these changes that were made were affecting our sales because our team members were down consciously focused and training and enhancing these process. Now you asked what level we will work the most, I mean there is never any magic bullet, Oliver. It\u2019s a bunch of different levers. So it starts off with the customer experience and that\u2019s a very important lever. It starts off with the advertising, the new creative of our advertising, which is coming off of the segmentation. So if you are watching TV and you are seeing a new Jared ad, it\u2019s a different creative and we are hearing wonderful feedback on the creative \u2013 our new advertising from our Jared customers through our team members. And of course, having exciting new launches, whether it would be Miracle Links in Jared or whether it would be Vera Wang Love, are all exciting for the team members. So we think that Jared stores are just really prepared for the fourth quarter and we constantly took the third quarter to get them even more prepared.","Michele Santana","And I would just add to it Oliver, in terms of the comp sales. Again, all of the initiatives that Mark has just talked to, we really believe will drive both the transaction and the ATV from a comp sales standpoint.","Oliver Chen","Okay, that\u2019s really, really helpful for our models. And regarding the portfolio at large, how are you dealing about the price points in terms of the balance of entry price points versus more elevated, I know it seem like an opportunity this year versus last year, I was curious about that from a product and how you allocate the marketing dollars?","Mark Light","Yes. We feel better this year than last year, Oliver. We do have a lot of new exciting initiatives at lower price points, whether it would be the Star Wars beads and jewelry collection and in case, our Miracle Links collection in Kay\u2019s and at Jared at \u2013 in the Zale division, we have more Persona beads. We actually have an exciting new launch with the Snoopy \u2013 new Snoopy film, Peanuts \u2013 excuse me Peanuts film that\u2019s just coming out now. So we have a good mix of fashion products at lower price points and we have some the new launches and new initiatives and a little bit higher films is doing very well such as Ever Us, which is really doing well for us. So we feel a lot better about the mix of price points that we have available for our customers this year as compared to last year.","Oliver Chen","Okay. And just a final question is in light of the tragic global events in Europe is that a factor where your customer has an added degree of volatility or are you different just because of your bridal and your domestic exposure?","Mark Light","I mean I don\u2019t think we are different. I mean obviously, with these tragic events that happened around the world has everybody concerned. And we have a benefit because our product is a more preconceived purchase than that of other retail products, but we need customers being feeling secure and feeling good about that there is their security when they go shopping. That being said, we have a lot of let\u2019s just say, promotional opportunities in our toolkit. And that we really have a good understanding, we have tested over the year a lot of different elastic type of opportunities to promote if and when needed as continue to see if things get a little bit more challenging. But it\u2019s important to note that we don\u2019t have the big tourism factor that other businesses have and that we see as benefit to us.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. Happy holidays and best regards.","Mark Light","Thank you, Oliver.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Annie Samuel with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Annie Samuel","Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. You spoke to a strong start of the quarter in November, particularly at Zale and Jared, given Jared was a little softer this quarter, can you speak to maybe what incremental is improved in November to-date. And then also across the chain any November standouts?","Mark Light","Sure, Annie no problem. Yes. Jared, it goes back to kind of our prepared statement. Jared has a lot of going forward. And that again, we have made so changes to the team members working in the stores of making sure everybody was in unison and understood the new way of selling to our Jared clients. We have the benefit of Vera Wang Love rolling into all of Jared stores was tested very well, so it\u2019s an incremental bridal option for them. We have Miracle Links in those stores, which is a new program for the birth of a child, which is a little lower price points that we are happy with. And also we have a great partnership with Pandora and you will see some new Pandora ads and we are partnered with Pandora and Starting to sell Pandora jewelry and pushing that opportunity even further and taking that to next level. And you will see the TV ad this fall actually with Pandora with the beautiful Pandora ring that will be on. So Jared is ready for a good fourth quarter, there is a lot of incremental initiatives and product launches. And again, they have increased TV marketing spend year-on-year and they new creative, which we believe is getting better reaction from our customers than last year.","Annie Samuel","Great. Thanks so much. And then you guys spoke to a choppy retail environment, given expectations for a choppy and promotional landscape kind of across retail this holiday period, can you speak to your stance on promotions, how you plan to position yourself competitively?","Mark Light","Yes. Well, first of all we start off with that we have unique exclusive brands, which aren\u2019t offered by our competitors, whether it would be Ever Us or it would be Vera Wang Love or it would Neil Lane or it\u2019s the Open Hearts by Jane Seymour and there is a lot more that we have. So just by having brands that are only available to us and they cannot be discounted by our competitors is a huge benefit to was. That being said, as I shared with Oliver, we always have a toolkit. We are continually testing opportunities for different type of promotions and understand the elasticity of those promotions. So we have a toolkit of promotions that we know or at least we understand the lift that we can get from sales and incremental gross margin dollars if the market gets a little bit more competitive, we will determine if and when it\u2019s appropriate to use one of those promotions that we have in our toolkit.","Annie Samuel","Great. Thanks so much.","Mark Light","Thank you. Have a good holiday.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with Nomura Securities. Your line is open.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. Hey guys, good morning.","Mark Light","Good morning Simeon.","Michele Santana","Good morning.","Simeon Siegel","So I know you don\u2019t normally give it, but just given the planned acceleration in guidance, can you quantify the November improvements you are seeing at Jared sales at all, I mean any color on the current trends by concept. And then just can you talk about the margin puts and takes at Sterling, what they look going forward a little bit, any help Michele you can give on how we should think about that sales mix shift impact on credit, commodity benefits, I guess general merch margin, full price of our commercial selling, etcetera, kind of anything along there would be helpful? Thanks.","Michele Santana","Sure. So let me start with \u2013 Simeon, as you know we are not going to quantify our results to-date other than the commentary that Mark and I have already shared out. We are seeing we are off to a strong start, which is factored into our guidance, particularly at Jared and Zale. So we feel very confident and good with the accelerated guidance that we have given up 3.5% to 5% comp sales. In terms of the margins again and I say this every quarter. We are not going to guide on particular gross margins, but try and give you some additional color to help with your model. On the Sterling side, we would expect that we will continue to see benefits related to lower gold costs. We did see benefits in the quarter related to that and that was as I said in the prepared remarks, entirely offset by this mix shift that we saw in Q3. So as we think about the Q4, what I would expect is still to see benefits flowing through on the gold side on our commodity side. A little bit of headwind I would imagine, coming through on this credit mix shift. It\u2019s something that we will work through, but given the size of the Q4, that will be definitely less pronounced. And so I would expect that we will see the expansion.","Simeon Siegel","Great. Thanks. And then if I can just ask one more, so it looks like you got leverage this quarter, which I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just a simple of your lapping four quarter of Zales, but can you just talk to anything that might be going on there, because just given all the color about the initiatives that are going on, which makes complete sense to use this Q3 for the kind of get ready quarter. I just would assume that we would have deleverage, so is there anything going on there or you found some savings or opportunities that we should think about?","Michele Santana","Yes. I think part of it is really just that we have kind of have fully lapped the Zale acquisition. And particularly SG&A, as we talked about we are making significant investments on the Zale division and we know that there is a lag between when we are making those investments and when we are seeing the lift coming through on our sales and our gross margin side. So I think it was more so due to the fact that we have lapped the quarter, but there have some targeted cost savings reductions that we have been looking across the business to help from a leverage standpoint. As we move forward, the investments will continue to be there. Again, we will have a little bit of this lag effect when you look at your sales and gross margins in the way those are flowing through. Importantly, though, what I would say and what we are really pleased when we think about the Q3 is we did realize net synergies in the third quarter. And Mark and I both talked about our operating margin expansion of 90 basis points in Q3 that was in part driven by the modest net synergies that we realized during Q3. And those synergies primarily are coming from our sales and our gross margin. And again, they are partially being offset by the investments that we are making within our SG&A.","Simeon Siegel","Perfect. Thanks a lot, guys and best of luck for holiday.","Michele Santana","Thanks, Simeon.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Krasik with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Scott Krasik","Yes. Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions.","Michele Santana","Sure.","Scott Krasik","I jumped on the call a little bit late. Did you quantify what the contribution from the change in the accounting for the extended service plan was to comp and EPS this quarter and then just maybe reaffirm what you think it will be for 4Q and maybe 1Q?","Michele Santana","Sure. So in \u2013 for Q3, the change in our extended service plan and again just the operational change we had made related to that had an impact of 40 basis points on our comp sales at Signet and had a $0.03 impact to our earnings per share. As we look into Q4, previously what we said and this continues to be the case is that we would anticipate about a $0.07 impact on earnings per share. And then from a comp standpoint, it\u2019s just factored into our comps. If you kind of go back between Q2, I believe there was a 60 basis point impact, 40 basis point impact in Q3 you can kind of do the math and come up with an estimate on the comps. And at this point, we haven\u2019t quantified the impact going forward after our fourth quarter.","Scott Krasik","Okay. That\u2019s fine. Thank you. And then just \u2013 can you just remind us what percentage again of the synergies you expect to achieve in fiscal \u201817? And I know it\u2019s early, but does it seem like you are on plan, is there a high degree of confidence? Some people are complaining that you are not accelerating the synergy now, but we are just really hitting the first quarter. So, I just want to keep people\u2019s expectations in check.","Michele Santana","No, I appreciate that. We are extremely confident in our ability to achieve our synergies of the $150 million to $175 million by the end of FY \u201818 as well as the original targets on how the synergies should flow. And that was again 20% this year, which equates to about $30 million to $35 million. What we realized in Q3 was really on track with what we are expecting to see. The remainder will flow through in our Q4. When you go to FY \u201817, it\u2019s an incremental 40% or said differently, we should realize a total of 60% of our net synergies by the end of FY \u201817. And again, we remain highly confident with those targets and those goals and everything that we are seeing to-date just reinforces that level of confidence.","Scott Krasik","That\u2019s awesome. And then just last, you were going to be a secondary lender or make Zales credit file, how did that play out in 3Q?","Michele Santana","So, in our Q3 which was primarily our test period in October, we started testing to our select Zale U.S. stores, very successful tests. So that was fully rolled out for the holiday season to all of our Zale U.S. stores. We are seeing great results. And so there will be more to come during our fourth quarter call related to that program.","Scott Krasik","Okay, good luck. Thanks.","Michele Santana","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.","Brian Tunick","Thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess a couple of questions. On the Ever Us rollout, I guess first off, can you give us some idea of what kind of contribution can one product category have for the quarter and when do we see a bigger rollout of SKUs or marketing spend just curious? And should we assume it\u2019s the Kay division primarily that should see that kind of benefit? And then the second question on the capital allocation side, I think you mentioned how much stock is left under the current program. You mentioned CapEx coming down this year, but should we expect some of that CapEx dollars got deferred into next year and just give us a thought on the capital allocation and share buyback viewpoint maybe for next year? Thanks very much.","Mark Light","Sure, Brian. I will take the Ever Us question and Michele will do the capital allocation. As it relates to Ever Us, the contribution we don\u2019t share that information with you or anybody outside of internal of our company. But I will tell you that it is the as of yet and as early, we have a lot of business to do yet, but as of yet, we are projecting to be the biggest rollout we have had of any new program in the history of our company. And I am talking even if you pull out Zales. So, it\u2019s a very, very strong rollout for us, but we do not give specific contributions. The company will tell you though that historically when we have an exciting program like this, it really does excite the store teams and the customers. So, it puts a good emphasis on the business let\u2019s just say that.","As far as the rollout where we are going next is we will start testing different items, whether it be in the earring category or the necklace category or different ring styles, we will be starting testing in the first quarter and the second quarter of this year with the hopes of finding a winner being able to extended out into all of our brands into the fall season of next year, a year from now. And it\u2019s not Kay division primarily this is all of our brands. It\u2019s in Kay, it\u2019s in Zales, it\u2019s in Peoples in Canada, it\u2019s in Ernest Jones and H.Samuel in the United Kingdom, it is in Jared. So, this is not Kay only. This is a brand and an offering that crosses over all of our customer segments and it\u2019s working well in all of our brands and all of the countries of which we operate.","Michele Santana","Yes, in terms of \u2013 I will pickup on the capital allocation side. As you heard in their prepared remarks, we have repurchased 112 million of our shares to-date. The guidance we had provided was 100 million to 150 million of a share buyback as it relates to FY \u201816, and that was really on the heels of our capital allocation policy that we had unveiled last March with one of those tenants being that we would return 70% to 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders either in the form of dividends and\/or share repurchases, again always subject to any strategic initiative that will come along. So, we really have met that guidance. We anticipate in the fourth quarter that we will continue to purchase our shares. We have currently 154 million that remains under that authorized program. So, I think you need to stay tuned and you will be hearing more on our fourth quarter call as it relates to our capital allocation plans moving into FY \u201817 and what that means.","From a CapEx standpoint, you are right, a number of these \u2013 we reduced that guidance from what we originally had. We are at $275 million to $325 million previously and that has now $260 million to $280 million primarily driven by timing. So, we would expect a number of these products, particularly as it relates to IT will be moved over to FY \u201817 and we would expect to see elevated levels of capital expenditure for FY \u201817 given the amount of initiatives we have in place, particularly as it relates to IT. And so we will give you an updated capital expenditure guidance when we close out the year in our fourth quarter.","Brian Tunick","And if I could just throw in one last one. So, the Zale comp looked a little light for the third quarter. Was it a lot of what you said around Jared and the training? I mean, you are calling it out that it\u2019s strong here in the fourth quarter. Can you maybe just talk about what learnings you had in the third quarter on the Zale business and how it came in versus your expectations?","Mark Light","Yes, Brian. As you stated, Zales trend run-rate was a little lower than it was in the first and second quarter. Of course, we weren\u2019t satisfied with that, but we understood why. And some of the reasons why and it\u2019s even more emphasized in Zales than it was in Jared and in our main baseline of stores. There is a lot going on in Zales. We have a lot of training going on. We have some training whether it be on our new discount controls. We have a new repair information system that we have started to train our people on. We have a new custom system we are training our people on. We have labor scheduling that\u2019s new for Zales. We have compensation changes that we made with Zales. We actually even have different price tagging and we have a new test management system in place. And compounded on all of that, we also have new products that we are launching. So Zales, it\u2019s a lot for those stores to take on, but because we have to add the experience in a lot of these systems and trainings that we have done in our U.S. Signet business from the past, we knew we can make it happen, but it was a lot of take on. So that being said, it was constantly done in the third quarter and we feel very good about the position that Zales is in the fourth quarter. And as we stated, they are starting off just very well so far, very good so far going into the fourth. So, we believe we made the right decision on getting our people trained up in the smallest quarter of the year to get the Zales team members right into the fourth quarter and so far so good.","Brian Tunick","Super. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks our much. Good luck for the holiday, guys.","Mark Light","Thank you, Brian.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lindsay Drucker-Mann with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Lindsay Drucker-Mann","Thanks. Good morning everyone.","Mark Light","Good morning.","Michele Santana","Good morning.","Lindsay Drucker-Mann","I wanted to ask about traffic, could you give us any insight into what your portfolio of stores are seeing as far as traffic goes maybe on versus off mall or across the different brands?","Mark Light","We really don\u2019t share that kind of information Lindsay. I will tell you that, obviously we experienced the experience of the traffic dropping in the malls and in retail affects us, but we believe it doesn\u2019t affect us as much as our other retail competitive set because again, we have a product that people are thinking about before they come into the stores and doing a lot of shopping online. So the traffic does affect us, but we believe we are a little insulated as it relates to other parts of the retail world. But again, we feel very good about the amount of advertising we have got this year, our new creative that we have this year, our new initiatives as it relates to selling and our new product launches that should hopefully increase the traffic into our stores for the fourth quarter.","Lindsay Drucker-Mann","Maybe asked a different way, to the degree that Jared and Zales slowed versus expectations sequentially, was that a traffic or conversion issue?","Mark Light","We believe it was a conversion issue more so than a traffic, obviously it\u2019s a combination of both but we believe because of all of the training and all of the tactics we are working with our team members in Zale and Jared, there was more conversion in youth than it was a traffic issue.","Lindsay Drucker-Mann","Okay. Thanks. And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about your outlook for pricing on a like-for-like basis or excluding maybe mixing up to higher priced products, how you are thinking about that in the fourth quarter, I know you have talked about Jared\u2019s first ever sale event. Zales had one more preferred customer event, but maybe offset by more promotional discounts in an industry that\u2019s getting \u2013 seems to be getting a lot more promotional in jewelry into the fourth quarter, how you are thinking about that?","Mark Light","Yes. It\u2019s a good question. First of all, I keep on always going back to one of the things that we have that kind of insulates us from promotion is our brands. And that our brands are not all for our competitive set, it\u2019s things programs like Ever Us, and Vera Wang Love and Neil Lane that if customers are excited about those brands, they are not going to get anywhere else and so they are not going to get a discount. So it insulates us. That being said, you are right. We have increased the amount of promoting specifically in Jared because when we have learned more about the Jared customers through segmentation studies, there are sentimentalist customers they care about the product, they care about being engaged as it relates to when they are purchasing the products. But they still want to make sure that they are getting a value and they still want to make sure they have an opportunity for that value. So having a sale every once in a while and Jared like some other type of non-jewelry competitors to Jared, is very normal for them and we think we are actually out of sync by not having those sales for our sentimental customers. So you will see a little bit more promotions with Jared. As far as Zales goes and the rest of our brands, we are just targeting our promotions better. We are understood we have a promotional kind of treasure chest what we have for dollars there. And what we are doing better with Zales, we believe we are targeting those promotions better and that we are using those promotion dollars more succinctly and more effectively. So as far as the fourth quarter, are we promoting more as a whole, I would say no. But in the Jared business, we are being a little more thoughtful to do to that segmentations understanding of that customer is looking for some event sometimes.","Lindsay Drucker-Mann","Great. And then just last question, could you give us an update on what you are seeing in the diamond supply chain, whether it\u2019s pricing of rough and polished stones and then also just generally, what you are seeing from liquidation of some of the middle men that compete in the diamond supply chain and how that industry is transitioning? Thanks.","Mark Light","Yes, it\u2019s a good question Lindsay. There are some dynamic shifts happening in the diamond supply chain right now, specifically those of you have read De Beers had a very not a good second quarter, there has just been some writings in our industry about the last sites, meaning the last production or sale of goods coming out of their mines was substantially below the previous years. And it\u2019s primarily coming from the lack of demand from the Far East and from the Middle Eastern part of the countries, who have a demand for primarily user demand of higher quality goods than we are using. So right now, there are opportunities to make buys in the rough market and potentially as polished market on the higher quality of diamond called the VS type of goods by GIA terminology. And that\u2019s just not the goods that we use here at Signet, we are a house that uses I1s \u2013 heavy I1 and some SI2s. So the opportunities that are coming from the market right now are more in the higher quality because of the lack of demand from the Far East. It\u2019s not something we are seeing now. Well, will there be opportunities in the future, can there be opportunities and supply chain opportunities for our company who has got a consistency of how we order our products, we will see and we are investigating those opportunities. But as of right now, those opportunities are really for better buys are really in the higher quality rough and polished diamonds that we don\u2019t use at this point.","Lindsay Drucker-Mann","Great. Thanks so much.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Michele Santana","Good morning.","Mark Light","Good morning.","Operator","Paul Lejuez, your line is open.","Mark Light","Okay. I think let\u2019s take the next one please operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong from CL King & Associates.","Unidentified Analyst","It\u2019s actually Jennifer for Paul. Sorry about that, having some headset difficulties. First Michelle, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the kind of the third quarter EPS miss relative to guidance, was that due primarily to the investments at Zale and Jared or the increase in bad debt expense or both and then any commentary on the semi-annual sale that Jared?","Michele Santana","Yes. Hi Jennifer, so let me start with your first question in terms of the guidance. The $0.33 was impacted and quantified in terms of the prepared remarks about the mix shift related to credit that we saw from Jared over to Kay. That equated to about $0.04 per share. So if you take your $0.33 and you add $0.04 that gives you a sense of where we would have been. And then as Mark had talked about just on some of the softness that we saw on Zale and Jared, driven by the intentional investments and our objective to use Q3 to really get prepared for the fourth quarter also have somewhat of an impact, but it was primarily we saw from this mix shift on the credit side of $0.04.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. And then any commentary on the semi-annual sale at Jared and then kind of maybe a longer term picture, what are you seeing in terms of cannibalization any kind of now that you have had Zale for a year any new learnings there? Thanks.","Mark Light","Yes. As far as the Light Up the Holiday event, Jared did well. It did well as well enough we would tell you that we believe we are doing better in the fourth quarter, so it did well for us. We are happy with the results of the first event. And as far as the cannibalization effect, it\u2019s minimal. We studied this over and over again. And just a little bit of data for you all, from our research, 65% or more customers that shop at Kay or shop at Zales have never stepped into a Kay or Zales stores. And we also track this weekly. We look at stores that have Kay and Zales in the mall versus stores that only have a Kay or Zale in the mall and we are seeing minimal cannibalization. And we believe the more we get involved in our segmented differences from Kay and Zales and Jared, the better it\u2019s going to get, but we are seeing minimal cannibalization at this point.","Unidentified Analyst","Alright, great. Thanks and best of luck.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong of CL King & Associates. Your line is open.","Bill Armstrong","Good morning Mark and Michele. So just a couple of quick points of clarifications. You discussed the impact from the shift to Kay from Jared on bad debt expense, to what extent if any, was there an impact on merchandise margins from that mix shift?","Michele Santana","In terms of merchandise mix, I would say there was probably a lesser impact as it relates to that sales shift from Jared over to Kay. It was just more pronounced from the credit shift moving over to the Kay customers.","Bill Armstrong","Got it. And then on the ring sizing extended service plan change, just to clarify that was a favorable $0.03 impact for the quarter, correct?","Michele Santana","That\u2019s absolutely correct, Bill.","Bill Armstrong","Okay. And will we see a favorable impact in Q4 as well?","Michele Santana","That\u2019s correct, it\u2019s a favorable impact.","Bill Armstrong","Thank you.","Michele Santana","You\u2019re welcome.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Light.","Mark Light","Thank you. And thank you all for taking part in this call. Our next scheduled call is on January 7 when we will be reviewing our holiday sales results. From all of us at Signet to all of you, have a very happy and healthy holiday season.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Randi Abada, SVP of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Randi Abada","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. On the call today are Signet\u2019s CEO, Gina Drosos; and CFO, Michele Santana.","During today\u2019s presentation, we will in places make certain forward-looking statements. Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. We urge you to read the risk factors, cautionary language and other disclosures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form10-Q.

For a discussion of the non-GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, investors should review the press release we posted on our website.","I will now turn the call over to Gina.","Gina Drosos","Thank you, Randi. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. I'll begin with a brief overview of the second quarter and then move on to an update on our Path to Brilliance transformation plan and how it is beginning to impact our business. I'll wrap up my comments with a brief overview of the changes to our full year fiscal 2019 guidance.","During the second quarter, we continued to execute on our Path to Brilliance transformation plan and saw early signs of operational improvement in our business. We are in the initial stages of a multi-year journey to invest in growth under our three strategic pillars of customer first, omni-channel and culture of agility and efficiency, which are enabled by driving out costs customers do not see or care about.","I would like to thank all of our team members for their hard work and support of our customers. The entire Signet team is intensely focused on our plans to deliver the important holiday quarter as well as laying the foundation to be a share gaining omni-channel jewelry category leader with sustainable profitable growth.","With the closing of the sale of our non-prime receivables this quarter, Signet has completed the strategic transaction to a fully outsourced credit structure. This allows us to focus squarely on our core retail jewelry business and enables significant cash returns to shareholders. Together, the prime and non-prime credit transactions generated nearly $1.4 billion in proceeds enabling the repurchase of 25% of shares outstanding.","And now I will provide an overview of our second quarter results. Our results in the quarter reflect signs of stabilization in our sales performance with total company same-store sales up 1.7%. Although it is early in our transformation journey, we've started to see our results impacted by transformation changes in key demand drivers, clear strategic priorities, greater accountability, and better processes and discipline.","Same-store sales reflected continued strong growth at Zales, Piercing Pagoda, and James Allen and improved performance at our Jared, Kay, Ernest Jones, and H. Samuel banners. eCommerce was a strong contributor to growth across all of our banners with legacy banners up high teens and James Allen up 25%. North America same-store sales increased 2% as we began to see improvements in the key demand drivers of product, marketing, and value propositions.","On the product side, we continue increase newness with second quarter results positively impacted by a refreshed core assortment in both bridal and fashion and a larger percentage of unique items in each banner. We also had incremental clearance offers across banners in the quarter and wrote down certain inventory items as part of this strategic effort. Both our bridal and fashion categories were up in the quarter driven by increased new product sales and incremental clearance to make room for those new items.","Watch sales increased while beads declined due to the strategic decision to reduce participation in our owned bead brands and soft performance in non-owned brands. Our strategic effort to increase newness started first in Zales where we are seeing solid customer response, and we are in the process of scaling up newness across our other banners.","With respect to marketing, additional investment in bridal at Kay through an always on bridal marketing strategy to both increase spend and distribute the spend more evenly throughout the year began to show green shoots. This effort began in the first quarter with signs of progress in sales in the second quarter due to the links of the bridal customer journey. For example, a Kay bridal online amplification test of investment in key non-branded search terms showed significant increases in click through rates and share of voice.","We also executed a successful watch promotion on Citizen and Bulova at Kay. We saw strong performance in Enchanted Disney at Zales which was supported by personalized campaigns targeting Disney fans in collaboration with Disney Digital Network properties. Across banners, we remain focused on personalized data-driven marketing.","We began our value proposition work at Jared and have recently completed a pilot of targeted pricing actions along with product assortment changes in the test group of stores, and we are pleased with the results. This strategy adjusts prices across the Jared portfolio to optimize customer value and is designed to grow sales and increase gross profit dollars. Our plan is to expand and refine this strategy across the Jared portfolio beginning in the third quarter.","Moving on to credit. We continue to execute our plan to return to operational excellence in offering category leading payments options to our customers. The operational issues related to credit are improving in line with our expectations. We estimate the impact of the credit transition issues lowered total same-store sales by approximately 160 basis points relative to our pre-outsourcing trend performance. This is slightly higher than in the first quarter due to calendar shifts and timing of promotions.","We do expect some remaining impact on our sales in the third quarter. Going forward, our credit volumes and participation rates will continue to be subject to overall consumer health, mall traffic trends, as well as execution in our stores. We remain focused on optimizing performance within the new credit structure to drive a successful holiday season.","Now, I'd like to discuss how we are laying the foundation of the Signet Path to Brilliance transformation plan with more to come as we move through this multiyear plan. Beginning with customer first, in the second quarter we took an important step to improve the customer experience in our stores. Our Voice of the Customer net promoter score initiative is now live in all key North America banners measuring both in-store and online customer experiences. We are pleased with our response rates thus far with feedback from over 126,000 customers in the first few months of launch.","To maximize the impact of this customer feedback, we recently launched a close-looped feedback pilot in a group of stores where store team members are specially trained and are actively following up with customers as they provide us feedback through the program. We see meaningful opportunities to use this data to develop actionable insights that we can roll out across our store banners over time.","Moving on to differentiating our banners, inventions in the jewelry category have become standardized and our research told us Signet Creative was not distinctive. Over recent months we've undertaken extensive and thorough customer research to guide the development of clearly differentiated banner positions. We are on track to deploy the new executions for Kay, Zales, and Jared preholiday, each of which is designed to align with their unique target customer and value proposition.","In essence, Kay customers will feel loved and appreciated as Kay inspires us to cherish our most meaningful relationships to provide the ultimate expression of gratitude and to champion love. Zales customers will feel known and stylish and Zales empowers contemporary shades [ph] of expression with a bold energetic brand personality. And Jared customers will feel cherished and understood as Jared challenges us to celebrate those we are devoted to with premium jewelry as unique as our love.","Research of these banner positions showed strong scores on both purchase intent and differentiation indicating that we have an opportunity to broaden our audience especially among women and millennials. As we enter the fourth quarter these banner positionings will start to come to life for our customers through new cohesive marketing campaigns. Our fourth quarter media strategy that will launch these campaigns will see an increased digital investment versus last year as we continue to invest in targeted higher ROI media part which will be the spoke [ph] partnerships to deliver greater social media customer engagement and activation.","To support our media buying effectiveness this year we have increased our analytical capability enabling us to better manage advertising placements especially in support of key promotions and to better phase our bridal and gifting messages at the appropriate point of the seasons.","Finally, our scale enables Kay, Zales and Jared to own sports networks integrations with the NFL, NBA, and NCAA Football. This holiday season will see the new positioning supported by integrated marketing campaigns and compelling new merchandise with execution across additional customer touch points as we move forward on our transformation journey. We continue to increase our customer first approach to product with more innovative designs and more database qualification of initiatives.","Which brings me to product. This holiday we are launching new collections created by our in-house design team in collaboration with out vendor partners and working closely with our top brands to ensure we are offering the new and exciting product assortment our customer's desire. We will also offer more distinct assorts by banner in line with our new positioning and continue to refresh core assortment.","Turning to omni-channel. Enhancing our eCommerce and mobile first omni-channel capabilities is a key aspect of our Path to Brilliance plan and we continue to see encouraging results. eCommerce as a percentage of total sales was 10.6% in the quarter and we achieved increases in both traffic and average order value.","Here are a few highlights of key omni-channel initiatives. We continue to leverage the digital innovation capabilities of R2Net with Sagoma 360\u00b0 visualization of top selling designs launching across banner websites in the second half of the fiscal year. R2Net's Augmented Reality mobile ring try on capabilities are currently operational at Jared currently in pilot at Kay and will be piloted at Zales in the second half of the year.","In addition, we are continuing to optimize a digital innovation program in Jared stores where we are making over 100,000 diamonds available to customers through a virtual diamond vault leveraging R2Net visualization and diamond market technology. Our recently launched Kay Bridal configurator positively impacted Kay's eCommerce sales in the second quarter and was just launched at Zales in August.","We continue to focus on enhancing the digital customer eCommerce journey becoming more agile in testing and quickly deploying enhancements. We are also increasing our investment in mobile. Mobile traffic was a key area of strength in the first half of the year with strong double-digit growth at Kay, Zales, Jared, Piercing Pagoda and James Allen. For example, in the second quarter we implemented initiatives to provide customers more relevant on-site search results and a faster more efficient checkout process.","We also launched the ability for customers to sign in to the Kay, Zales and Jared website using Facebook or Google credentials. Additionally our research showed that customers had to search for the Add The Shopping Bag button when viewing a product page on mobile devices due to the scrolling nature of the page. Adding an ever present sticky Add The Shopping Bag button at the bottom of the screen increased conversion by 8% during the test and was rolled out during the quarter.","We are continuing to see positive results from initiatives launched over the last 12 months, including increased personalized content, website appointment bookings, the ability to view local store inventory online and improved product visualizations through images shown on a model.","Moving on to culture of agility and efficiency, a key component of our three-year transformation plan is to drive out costs customers do not see or hear about in order to lower our cost base and provide funds for reinvestment in growth drivers and enhanced profitability. We are on track to achieve our fiscal 2019 net cost savings goal with approximately one third achieved year-to-date.","Our plan to close more than 200 stores in fiscal 2019 is also on track and we are focused on our goal of achieving at least 30% sales transference with our new hyper local marketing plans rolling out in the third quarter, well in advance of planned fourth quarter closures. New store openings remain disciplined focusing on off mall locations and desirable markets. In addition, we are developing new store concepts, the first of which is a James Allen concept store and showroom in Washington DC. This store opens preholiday and will feature advances in digital technology and millennial inspired shopping experience.","And now I would like to make a few comments about culture. It is incredibly important at Signet that we create a workplace experience and culture that will allow us to continue to attract, retain and advance great people. We have the distinct privilege of helping our customers celebrate their most memorable moments. And as such, we strive to make sure that our 36,000 team members are well trained and engaged in delivering that mission and that they feel supported, empowered and motivated at work every day.","We recently fielded our first employee survey in eight years and I'm pleased to report that our overall engagement levels outperformed retail benchmarks with particular strength in our field operations teams. Team members like the work they do, enjoy strong relationships with their immediate managers and importantly believe they have a responsibility to promote diversity in the workplace.","We've learned a lot from this survey and are committed to further strengthening the training, development, and advancement opportunities of all team members and promoting fresh, diverse, and innovative perspectives. These changes are very important for the future of Signet and the growth of our business. Our talented and hard-working team members are our greatest strength and Signet will continue to foster a culture where they are all able to unleash their full potential.","Turning to our guidance, based on our second quarter performance, we are modestly raising our full-year revenue and earnings objectives. We are still early in our transformation plan and continue to expect the vast majority of our operating profit to be generated in the fourth quarter. While we have seen some improvement in the first half, we recognize there is still a lot of work ahead to deliver a successful holiday season. We feel good about our holiday preparations, but recognize that we are making multiple changes in our business this holiday including branding, product assortment, and value equations.","For fiscal 2019 we now expect same-store sales of down 1.5% to flat and non-GAAP EPS of $4.05 to $4.40. Michelle will discuss the guidance in more detail in her remarks, but I would like to highlight that we have decided to increase advertising in the second half of the year relative to our original plan and are now forecasting some additional compensation expense due to sales outperformance.","In conclusion, we are confident that Signet is on the right path to create long-term profitable growth. Our transformation efforts will take time and we have still a lot of work ahead although we are encouraged by and building on Greenshoes [ph]. We remain optimistic that the benefits we are currently seeing and the incremental benefits we expect to see from second half Path to Brilliance initiatives will leave us well-positioned to be successful in the highly competitive fourth quarter marketplace.","With that, I'll pass the call to Michelle for more details on our financial results.","Michele Santana","Thank you, Gina and good morning everyone. I'll begin with a review of our second quarter results and then move on to our updated fiscal 2019 guidance and our outlook for the third quarter. For the second quarter total sales were $1.4 billion, up 1.5% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 1.1% on a constant currency basis. Same-store sales growth was 1.7% inclusive of one, a 40 basis point benefit from a planned shift in timing of promotions at Jared out of the first quarter into the second quarter.","Two, an unfavorable impact of approximately 160 basis points due the transition issues related to the October 2017 credit outsourcing and three, as Gina mentioned in her remarks, as part of our initiatives to increase newness and refocus our product assortment, there were incremental clearance sales in the quarter which positively impacted same-store sales by 240 basis points.","In addition, James Allen generated $54.4 million of revenues in the second quarter with a favorable impact of 80 basis points on same-store sales. Other items which did not impact same-store sales but impacted total revenue dollars included the following four items: First, the adoption of new revenue recognition accounting standards which contributed $24 million in sales; second, a calendar shift of weeks in the quarter which resulted in a Mother's Day event in Q1 that was held in Q2 of the prior year.","Note that this shift has no impact on same-store sales and same-store sales calculations were adjusted to comparable weeks. The net effect of realigning the weeks following our 53rd week fiscal year including the Mother's Day shift was an unfavorable impact of approximately $50 million. Third, an unfavorable impact of store closures of $34 million partially offset by new store openings and fourth foreign exchange benefit of $5 million.","Touching briefly on the sales drivers of our banners, Zales had strong results with mid single digit same store sales growth driven by strength in both core bridal and fashion as the merchandising changes implemented last year continue to gain traction in addition to slightly higher levels of clearance sales. Solitaires, Enchanted Disney, Vera Wang Love, gold jewelry and diamond fashion were key sales performers.","Piercing Pagoda achieved low double digit same store sales growth and improved sequentially driven by strong double digit growth in our chain, gold earrings and charms business as well as solid performance in Piercings. Same-store sales down 2.1% at Kay benefited from a higher percentage of new merchandise, incremental marketing investments, and incremental clearance sales. While fashion engagement performed well with refresh core assortment, beads declined as we continued our strategy to exit owned beads. Watches also grew in the quarter including the benefit of the watch promotion Gina mentioned in her remarks.","Jared same-store sales growth was 1.2% including a positive 195 basis point impact from a planned promotion shift out of the first quarter. The performance at Jared reflects positive results from the pilot of a customer value proposition that Gina discussed and incremental clearance sales as well as headwind from beads. James Allen performed particularly well with 25% same-store growth in all banners, software and eCommerce sales.","The results in our international division, which includes our UK operations improved sequentially or continue to be impacted by overall macro conditions. We saw lower sales at diamond jewelry and fashion watches somewhat offset by higher sales of prestige watches. Our UK banners also saw strong eCommerce growth.","Moving on to margins, the GAAP gross margin rate was 30.1% in the quarter down 260 basis points year-over-year. GAAP gross margin rate reflects the impact of a $63 million or 440 basis point inventory charge related to brand and collections that we are discontinuing as part of our transformation plan to increase newness across our categories. Excluding this charge non-GAAP gross margin was 34.5% up 180 basis points year-over-year. Transformation cost savings related to direct sourcing, distribution, and store occupancy in the quarter offset sales to leverage in a higher mix of clearance sales.","Additional factors that impacted the gross margin rate included the following four items. First, gross margin benefited by 350 basis points as we know longer recognized bad debt expense or late charge income due to the completion of our credit outsourcing.","Second the impact of the addition of James Allen which carries a lower gross margin rate unfavorably impacted the rate by 80 basis points. Third, the decision to cease offering credit insurance midyear in fiscal 2018 unfavorably impacted the second quarter margin rate by 60 basis points. And lastly, an unfavorable impact of 20 basis points related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.","SG&A expense was 31.3% of sales in the quarter compared to 29.2% in the prior year quarter. Total SG&A was up by $36 million over the prior year quarter. The primary drivers of increased SG&A were the following four factors. First $6 million in higher advertising, second $6 million in higher store staff cost, third $9 million in higher incentive compensation, and fourth $32.6 million in credit outsourcing costs partially offset by $10.4 million in savings related to in-house credit operations. These increases were partially offset by transformation cost savings related to IT, professional fees, and other corporate cost savings.","Other operating income declined by $59 million as expected compared to prior year primarily due to a loss of interest income as a result of the outsourcing of credit. The $3.2 million of other income this quarter relates to a gain on the sale of assets.","Our GAAP operating loss of $58 million included the impacts of the non-prime credit sales and restructuring charges. As expected, we recognized a loss of $24 million on non-prime receivables during the quarter as we completed the non-prime credit outsourcing transaction. We also incurred restructuring charges of $83 million related to inventory charges, severance, professional fees, and impairment of IT assets associated with our transformation plan.","On a non-GAAP basis, excluding these items operating income was $48.6 million or 3.4% of sales, which was ahead of our plan as a result of better than expected same-store sales performance. The total impact in the second quarter related credit outsourcing was a $39 million reduction operating income slightly higher than our guidance due to higher than anticipated sales performance.","In looking year-over-year, the decline in non-GAAP operating margin rate of 630 basis points was primarily driven by 370 basis points decline attributable to the net combination of credit outsourcing and discontinuation of credit insurance. Additional drivers included higher advertising, store labor costs due to higher sales and incentive compensation expense somewhat offset by cost savings.","GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.56 including a $0.25 impact related to the loss on the sale of non-prime receivables and $0.83 of restructuring charges associated with the transformation plan. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP EPS was $0.52 for the quarter.","So let me briefly touch on a payment plan participation in the second quarter. As a reminder, starting with our first quarter we are now reporting our payment participation on a North America segment basis which includes credit and leasing. The North America payment plan participation in the second quarter was 53.3% versus the prior year quarter of 54.9%. The rate decline of a 160 basis points in the quarter was driven primarily by lower credit applications, which is near the decline saw pre conversion. The second quarter rate reflected improvement over the first quarter rate decline of 370 basis points.","Turning to an update on the sale of our non-prime receivable portfolio. The sale of the non-prime receivables was completed in the second quarter resulting in $445 million in proceeds which were used for share repurchases. We repurchased $425 million in Signet shares during the second quarter and year-to-date Signet has repurchased $485 million in shares at an average price of $55.6.","In terms of the expected financial impact of our credit outsourcing in totality, we expect an unfavorable fiscal 2019 year-over-year impact on operating profit of a $152 million to a $159 million which is slightly higher than our previous estimate due to better than expected sales performance in the second quarter. For fiscal 2020 we continue to expect year-over-year impact on operating income ranging from zero to a benefit of $5 million.","So with that let me now move to review financial considerations associated with our transformational plan. We continue to accept the Path to Brilliance plan to result in net cost savings of $200 million to $225 million over three years. In fiscal 2019 the transformation plan is expected to deliver a net cost savings of $85 million to $100 million with further incremental cost reductions of a $115 million to a $125 million by the end of the three-year program. Year-to-date we have realized approximately one third of our fiscal 2019 cost savings goal. We expect the remaining fiscal 2019 cost savings to be somewhat evenly split between the third and fourth quarter.","Moving on to cash flow, year-to-date adjusted free cash flow excluding the proceeds from the credit transaction was a negative $49 million reflecting lower operating income and investment in inventory to refocus our product assortment particularly in bridal including larger and more premium diamonds and adding more solitaries in fancy shades. Inventory was somewhat offset by higher payables. Capital expenditures declined by $50 million year-to-date as we lowered our store count.","Turning to guidance, we are modestly raising our fiscal 2019 guidance to reflect the improved performance in the second quarter. Our fiscal 2019 total revenue guidance is now $6.2 billion to $6.3 billion and we now expect same-store sales to be down 1.5% to flat for the year.","Our updated non-GAAP EPS guidance of $4.05 to $4.40 reflect our second quarter results, the completed share repurchase and incremental investments in advertising versus our original plan. This guidance range also includes higher sales commission due to sales performance above our original plan and at the high end some additional short term incentive compensation.","In addition, our non-GAAP EPS guidance embeds a normalized tax free of 8% to 10%. Importantly, as Gina noted earlier, we continue to expect a significant portion of our revenue and the vast majority of our operating profit to be delivered in the fourth quarter. We are remaining appropriately cautious in our outlook as many of our Path to Brilliance initiatives will be launched later in the year.","Our GAAP EPS guidance of a loss of $7.47 to $7.09 embeds the performance for the first half of the year and includes impairment and restructuring charges, as well as the loss on the sale of non-prime receivables. For further details I refer you to our press release issued this morning.","For the third quarter we expect total sales of $1.15 billion to $1.17 billion. Same-store sales are down 1.5% to flat and a non-GAAP EPS loss of a $1.23 to $1.08. As a reminder, the third quarter is our smallest revenue dollar quarter of the year and as a result revenue and expense drivers can have a larger impact on growth rates and margin rates.","Our third quarter same-store sales outlook incorporate our projections for banner mix continuing incrementally year-over-year clearance sales, continuing headwind in beads and some continuing impact from the October 2017 credit outsourcing transition. Additionally, a Zales promotion event that ran in the third quarter of last year will be moved to the fourth quarter this year, unfavorably impacting third quarter same-store sales by approximately 60 basis points. As the fourth quarter is a larger revenue quarter, the movement on this promotion will have a smaller impact on fourth quarter same-store sales. All in, we expect our gross margin rate to improve on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter.","Gross margin rate in the third quarter will continue to be on favorably impacted by the addition of James Allen, the discontinuation of credit insurance and the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard and will be positively impacted as we no longer recognize bad debt expense.","SG&A in the third quarter is expected to reflect a significant year-over-year increase due to the following three items. First, higher average hiking [ph] expense due to timing of holiday campaign; second, higher year-over-year incentive compensation expense at levels similar to the second quarter; and third, the impact of costs related to our credit outsourcing including the first full quarter of non-prime outsourcing fees. Also note that the year-over-year increases in incentive compensation are expected to be more heavily impact the fourth quarter given the level of revenue and profit generation in the fourth quarter.","As previously mentioned, we estimate that credit outsourcing to reduce operating income by $40 million to $45 million. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance of a loss of $1.23 to a $1.08 excludes expected restructuring charges of $5 million related to our Path to Brilliance plan and a best in [ph] normalized tax rate. GAAP EPS guidance including these charges is a loss of $0.81 to $0.70, which reflects an embedded estimate of the tax benefit generated by restructuring charges as well as the third quarter tax impact of charges taken in preceding quarters.","Moving on to leverage, we continue to expect to exceed the high end of our 3 to 3.5 times target leverage ratio in fiscal 2019 as we begin our transformation, but expect to be back within that range before the end of the three-year transformation of plan.","To close my comments, we are encouraged by the size stabilization we have seen year-to-date and our confidence at Signet is on the right path to return to sustainable, profitable growth over the long term.","With that I'll pass the call back to Gina.","Gina Drosos","Thanks, Michele. Before we proceed with our Q&A session, I would like to finish my prepared remarks by discussing the announcement we made today regarding my colleague, Signet CFO, Michele Santana. Michelle will be leaving Signet after eight years with the company and I want to publicly thank her for the positive and lasting impact she's had on Signet and the partnership we have shared since my appointment as CEO.","Michele played an instrumental role in many significant Signet milestones including the completion of our credit outsourcing transaction, the acquisitions of Zales, Ultra and R2Net and the launch of our Path to Brilliance transformation plan. With the completion of these major milestones reflected in our year-to-date result this morning, Michele felt that now is the right time to announce her intention to leave Signet and pursue new opportunities.","We are committed to an orderly transition. Michele will remain CFO until her successor is appointed and then serve in an advisory capacity to ensure a smooth transition. We\u2019ve commenced the search for a new CFO with the assistance of an executive recruitment firm and expect to name Michele's successor by the end of fiscal 2019. This is a critical hire to lead our financial operations as we progress through our Path to Brilliance transformation plan.","Once again, I'd like to thank Michele for her many contributions and her ongoing commitment to Signet. This is a remarkable time for our company. We are well positioned as we continue to implement our Path to Brilliance transformation and we have a very strong team in place and are fully committed to delivering great results for our customers and our shareholders.","And now with that, we are ready to start our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rick Patel with Needham & Company. Your line is open.","Rick Patel","Thank you. Good morning everyone and congrats on the progress. I'm hoping you can talk about the opportunity to improve operating profit over the next couple of years. After the efficiency savings this year you're still going to have another $120 million left to go, and so given the year-over-year impact of credit won't be a major headwind in fiscal 2020 what would prevent operating profit from growing by $120 million over the next two years? I recognize that comps are the biggest driver here, but hope you can do some color on the offsetting investments you may need to make given so much of the heavy lifting is being done this year.","Gina Drosos","So why don\u2019t I take that question, so as you imagine we're not providing a margin target in terms of longer term out, but do expect both our top and bottom line financial performance to have a gradual and incremental improvement over time as we continue to implement our Path to Brilliance initiative.","And as we talked about our Path to Brilliance initiative, it does embed reinvestments that we'll be making back into the business to support and drive our future performance, so we'll continue to test and learn and see how our initiatives take hold, how the market responds to the initiatives to really drive that top line growth and also to enhance the operating margins as we move forward.","Michele Santana","I'd just mention two other things related to our key strategies for Path to Brilliance. On the customer first strategy as we strengthen our brand equities and get our value placements right across our business, we think that gives us some room to continue to improve on operating margin front, and the second is cost savings. We're really working on that not only from a very well defined plan for this year, but also on building a cost conscious and entrepreneurial culture within the company so that we're consistently driving out all costs that customers don't see or care about to be able to reinvest in that top line growth.","Gina Drosos","Yes, maybe just one other follow up point Rick, just when we think about the fixed cost nature of our business, it does mean that there's significant operating leverage both up and down depending on what our revenue growth is, and I think that's something we're going to be able to better access longer term our same-store sales outlook after the key holiday season in that operating margin rate outlook as well.","Rick Patel","Thank you. I also have a question on lab produced jewelry, so we've seen a growing number of products in your assortment with lab produced gemstones like sapphires and rubies, curious to know how customers have responded, your plans to scale that further, and also plans to potentially expand that into diamonds?","Gina Drosos","So I\u2019ll take that one. Rick, as you probably know we don't carry lab grown diamonds in any of our banners today, but we have a very customer first mindset on this and we want to focus on delivering the products and experiences that customers want. So we are very closely monitoring and assessing the demand for this emerging category.","What our research shows is that customers prefer natural diamonds for those really important purchases, bridal purchase, special birthday, graduations those kinds of things, but there could be some growing interest in the fashion jewelry space for synthetic diamonds. So we'll make sure that Signet is well positioned to participate in that space if the growth and the economics of it are attractive and if customers point us in that direction.","Rick Patel","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Oliver Chen","Hi, thank you. You made a lot of progress at the Kay Banner so far. What are your thoughts on what it will take to get sustainable positive comps like Kay? And it was also interesting advertising -- your decision around advertising, what was driving that and are there any banner specific details on how you'll spend that money and what medium as well, that would be great? Thank you.","Gina Drosos","Sure. Thanks Oliver. So I think across all of our banners the key things that we expect to positively impact our business especially as we move into that all important fourth quarter are these new banner positionings. We have I think done a very disciplined job on understanding our customers really making sure to differentiate our target audiences, broadening the appeal collectively of our banners by creating more differentiation between them.","And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks we tested those positionings and have seen both higher purchase intent for all of our banners including Kay as well as more differentiation and opportunity to broaden our appeal to women and millennial consumers, so I think that\u2019s an important piece.","The other piece that I'd point to is our efforts in data science, in analytics that we've put behind creating more personalized marketing. I mentioned the always-on bridal campaign for Kay. The facts of the matter are only 2% of people in the country will get engaged in the next year and while broad scale marketing can be effective in helping people to understand our brand equity and the new and exciting merchandise that we carry targeting them on their journey at those right touch points is what really matters.","And so as we have moved more of our effort to the right search terms, the right targeted social programs that kind of thing we're seeing an improvement in Kay and we back that up with putting more premium diamonds, larger carat sizes, more fancy stones, more solitaires because those are trending in the Kay and we saw a very positive response.","So I\u2019d say the big picture is back to what are those key things customers care about and the brand equity, the value equation, the right products we are single mindedly focused on making sure we get that right for our Kay customers and then differently for our Zales and our Jared got to customers.","Michele Santana","And Oliver, the other thing I would just add quickly to that is, keep in mind we'll be laughing the credit outsourcing in the prior year which impacted Kay more heavily than the other banners as well.","Oliver Chen","Okay and Michele best regards and great to work with you. On the operational issues related to credit improving, you did mention that you're monitoring that and you've made some nice improvements there. But what are you looking for in monitoring because the holiday selling season is very significant and that's an issue where you'll watch the impact with interaction between sales and customers?","And another question we're receiving this morning is in relation to clearance sales. In terms of clearance sales how are you incorporating that in your guidance and how is it impacting earnings per share in terms of gross margin dollars? Thank you.","Gina Drosos","So why don\u2019t I start on the credit piece and then Michele you can kind of pickup. I think, overall there are kind of two things I'd say on credit. One is that our goal is to offer a comprehensive program for our customers, so that wherever they are on their life journey they can be able to celebrate life and express love with their loved ones in the right way.","And so you know that we offer a full suite of financial products for them to choose from whether that is using their own credit card, our Kay or Jared, Zales cards or whether that is using our leasing program which we've just added and so that I think is overall what we're really aiming to do. Now our application rates and things like that will continue to be influenced over time by mall traffic trends and where customers are generally in the economy, but I think we've got category leading suite that we can offer them.","The second piece is how are we doing on fixing the operational issues that we saw when we did the transition last fall and those operational issues really sum up the two buckets one were technical issues and the other were training kind of changes we really more dramatically even than we had anticipated changed the process about how we offer credit to our customers.","On the technical side we have made all of those changes and we've seen good results from that. We have tested those inside now and we feel like we are positioned well as we go into a busier time of year. And on the training and process changes we have really going from the bottom up on that getting feedback from our associates and then developing new programs and training plans that help us make that a very seamless process for them in-store and with our customers. So that's the part that we're really focused on here in the third quarter getting ready for holiday is making sure that we have everyone trained and feeling really comfortable with offer credit on our stores.","Michele Santana","And then if I address your question in clearance, I guess a couple points on that front. As we mentioned on the call is part of our merchandise strategy. We continue to work to increase the newness and we're refocusing our product portfolio tied in conjunction with our banner repositionings that we're doing as well.","And there's always a certain level of clearance that we have in our business, but we did make a decision to add incremental clearance in order to accelerate this strategy and ensure that we're freeing up store space for the newness.","So we did clear certain products related styles, colors, brands as part of the second quarter and we also I mentioned in prepared remarks that we expect to have some higher incremental clearance sales in the third quarter.","When you think about that impact in terms of margin, in the prepared remarks I mentioned that our non-GAAP gross margin rate was 34.5% up 180 basis points over last year and what we saw as our transformation cost savings related to a number of initiatives, really help to offset the sales to leverage as well as that higher mix of clearance sales, so it\u2019s embedded in that non-GAAP margin rate.","And then as we think about our guidance, clearly when we talk about a higher level in Q3 that's factored into our guidance as well as our full year. Generally, when we think about fourth quarter, typically clearance is a smaller percentage of the total product mix for us.","Oliver Chen","Thanks for that clarity and best regards.","Gina Drosos","Okay, thanks Oliver.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. This is [indiscernible] on for Brian. I guess two questions for us. The first one is a clarification or a follow up from Oliver\u2019s question now. Help us understand the margin impact of the promotional incremental promotions you called out this quarter.","I know you mentioned that 440 basis points impact from restructuring charges related to an inventory charge. Is that all related to the incremental promotions or how would merchandise margins would look like if you only included impact of promotions in the gross margin not the charges maybe but just promotions that you run that through all. I think you called out 240 basis points of comp this quarter.","Gina Drosos","Yes, so let me try to clarify, because I want to make sure it is understood on the two components. So in the prepared remarks and I talked about our GAAP gross margin rate and when we look on a GAAP basis our gross margin rate was down 260 basis points over last year and that was reflecting 440 basis points or an inventory charge that we took of $63 million that relates to products that we are discontinuing.","So that is separate from when we talk about the higher level of their sales. So non-GAAP the 440 basis points is the inventory write-down. And then when we think about what you refer to as our non-GAAP gross margin which was up 180 basis points was excluding the inventory write-down but includes the higher level of clearance. That was up over 180 basis points.","And as I said on the prepared remarks, we really did see an impact from a higher mix of clearance given the transformation cost savings that we saw. And then you are correct, we did call out that as part of same-store sales we saw a 240 basis points positive impact related to the higher level of clearance. So hopefully that helps to clarify what's rolling through the gross margin.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, yes this is very, very helpful thank you for that. And then the second question is on the category growth, clearly your results are showing a very nice improvement here and the industry data we get also looks more encouraging. So would you say at this point maybe the versus behind us in terms of jewelry store closures out there and the promotional environment, and I know last three-year is part of the reason for lackluster I would say industry sales was sort of a lack of broad based fashion trends to drive sales. But beyond the - beyond your own product introductions planned for the second half are you seeing any exciting trends emerging maybe into the holidays?","Gina Drosos","So, let me see if I can answer those questions kind of in the order you asked them. So number one, overall we see a healthy jewelry category. We continue to see growth in the low single digits and we continue to see customers of all ages desire jewelry as one of their top three to five items they like to receive for a gift, millennial consumers commemorate their engagements with diamond rings, all of that is contributing to this low single digits growth which has been pretty consistent over time.","I think in terms of closures, yes a little bit about that, we see increasing closures of independent jewelers and that has been a trend that has gone off and on for the last several years that most recently we've seen a little bit of a pickup in that trend.","In terms of promotions in the environment, we always expect a heavy promotional period in the fourth quarter and so I wouldn\u2019t expect this year to be any different from that, usually you know department stores participating very actively in that. What we're really focused on is understanding our overall value equation which is the combination of rate irresistible product and so we're really focusing on newness and consumer driven innovation in the product area.","We're focused on exceptional service. No one understands diamonds and jewelry better than our sales associates out in the stores and providing exceptional service and then doing that with the right value equation, the right pricing and promotion combination that delights them in those purchases. So that's kind of what we'd expect on the promotional environment.","And then in terms of trends, definitely we're seeing some very interesting trends and this is an area where we see Signet as a leader is in that consumer understanding and really being able to get out in front of trends in that category. One of those has been gold. Gold chains as Michele mentioned have been a big driver of our business and heavier chains have been trending and took us to a level of double digit growth in our go to business which was great to see along with charms, children's jewelry, some other areas.","We carry unique designs for Disney in our Zales stores and we've seen some nice growth on that for both bridal and for fashion jewelry and those are really just plain beautiful jewelry designs. You understand as Disney if you know that going in, but Pocahontas ring for example that has a very slight feather design on the side is just something very interesting and fun for people to wear that commemorate something meaningful for them.","And then we've seen in the bridal category solitaries continuing to trend. That\u2019s one of the reasons why we've increased for all of our stores, the level of our premium and larger carat stones and we've seen [indiscernible] shapes continue to be something that\u2019s very important, so shapes other than round, whether that\u2019s an emerald cut, a pear, marquee cut, these are things that make rings more personal and distinctive for our customers. And so Kay, Zales, Jared, Pagoda are really all ever making sure we have a great assortment of those items.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you very much. Best of luck.","Gina Drosos","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. Hey guys, good morning and congrats on a positive comp and improve results. Just a few quick clarifications if I can Michele. The products from the $63 million charge is that still on the books was it already sold or are you not planning to sell it and I guess what were the margin assumptions you used to determine that amount?","Recognizing the different promo and clearance shifts, can you just explain or kind of talk to why transactions would be down but the ATV was up? And then the last one within that $32.5 million of credit outsourcing costs, I'm assuming that's not just a one month of the MDR, so can you just help us think through what that includes, that would be helpful? Thanks.","Michele Santana","Yes, so I'll try to remember the question as we go through so remind me if I forget. So starting in terms of the inventory, basically what the inventory charge, the $63 million, we wrote the inventory down so there's a reserve that sits on the balance sheet for that inventory as we move through disposition of it. It basically relates to discontinued collections various products that we'll no longer be offering in our store and again it all in tied terms of our Path to Brilliance as we're bringing in a lot of newness. Ahead of the holiday season and for the holiday season we need to make room in the store.","So I'm not going to get into specifics in terms of the margin assumptions related to that write down charge, but we always know that there is inventory that we are disposing off, there is always value in terms of the gold and the diamond associated with that.","Your second question, remind me on your second question?","Simeon Siegel","So this transaction\u2026","Michele Santana","Transaction, right, ATV and transactions, yes so keep in mind one of the things that has been impacting our transactions for a period of time that I think I believe we continue to call out and it\u2019s a hurt to the transactions but it's also help to the ATV as the bead and so our churn [ph] memories, other bead programs within our banners we\u2019ve continued to see that decline and as we've talked about, we have an exit strategy related to our owned bead brand, so that's the primary driver that you're seeing there.","And then you had a question in terms of the credit outsourcing and the costs that we saw in the quarter, so that the combination of our credit outsourcing closed the transaction in June, so the fees associated with that.","And I guess also considering the whole when you take the total amount is the bad debt expense removal of the bad debt expense removal of the finance charge income and the outsourcing associated with that I think that all came to a net $39 million.","Simeon Siegel","So the 32.5 I just want to confirm that's not just one month of the MDR right that there's more in there?","Michele Santana","Let me go back and revisit, there should be more than just one month because we closed at within June, so yes a little bit more than month.","Simeon Siegel","Okay, great. Alright, thanks lot guys, best of luck for the rest of the year.","Michele Santana","Thanks Simeon.","Gina Drosos","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Tom Nikic","Hey, good morning everyone. This is actually Tom Nikic on for Ike. I had a quick question about the Jared banner, I know you said that there was a, I think it was 195 basis points benefit from a promo shift, but even excluding that there was a pretty substantial acceleration from Q1 to Q2 which you didn't really see at Kay. And so I was wondering if there's any reason why Kay would be more affected by the credit disruption than Jared would and if maybe some of those - more of those clearance promos that increased the comp, flowed through Jared rather than Kay, I'm just trying to get a sense on the difference between those two banners? Thanks.","Gina Drosos","Sure, so to directly answer your question on credit. Yes, as we've said since we did the outsourcing last fall, Kay is disproportionately affected by our credit transition issues. Higher percentage of our Jared shoppers are using their own credit cards, American Express, Visa, Master Card, Discover, and so that makes the impact on take greater.","The bigger thing that was driving Jared\u2019s business was response to changes that we made in our product merchandise and our value equation. So I mentioned that under our customer first strategy we have gone back and done very detailed shopping journey understanding with our customers and we understand that when they're coming into buy a bridal engagement ring particularly loose stone, they're doing a lot of online comparison. So they are on jamesallen.com, they are on bluenile.com looking at pricing as they are standing in the Jared store getting ready to make a purchase.","And so, we have really tried to make sure that we are benchmarking across all different competitive sets to offer a superior product line and better service at what is a great value for customers. So we rebalanced some of our offering. We've brought in higher quality stones into our Jared stores because we found that that premium merchandise was more with our Jared shoppers are looking for and that newness and refocusing is beginning to show some there.","Tom Nikic","All right, thanks very much, best of luck in the back half.","Gina Drosos","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Herrity with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.","Josh Herrity","Great, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on some of the front line store staffing, store level staffing, you highlighted increased sales commissions as you know sales have been trending ahead as planned. I was curious if you're seeing any increased levels of turnover at the store level or other wage pressures as the market tightens to some degree, especially as you look to improve I think stability in the customer experience after implementing a lot of operational changes in the field organization over the past year. Thank you.","Gina Drosos","No, it\u2019s really related more as Michele said in her remarks to the commissions. In fact we've had an ongoing program over the last number of months to reduce unnecessary tasks in our stores to really free up our consultants to spend more time with their customers and less time on pricing changes, merchandising changes, reporting, things like that and we're seeing some really positive benefits on that not only in employee engagement, but also in terms of efficiency we think in our store staffing which is something we can do going forward.","Michele Santana","It\u2019s Michele, I want to go back before we take the next question just try to clarify Simeon's question on the $32.6 million that are rolling through SG&A related to credit outsourcing. I just want to make sure that it is clear that if you go back to Q1 I mean we had about $24 million of credit outsourcing cost, when you exclude the offset in savings. So the increase that we're seeing over the quarter is the combination we talked last quarter promo plan mix and there's a cost associated with that, then combined with the month and a half or so that we saw finalizing the outsourcing of the non-prime receivables, so I just wanted to come back and clarify the increase from Q2 to Q1.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Your line is open.","Paul Lejuez","Hey, thanks guys. Can we just go back to the inventory charge for a second Michele? How much of that was related to product that was already sold in the second quarter versus product that will be sold in future quarters?","A - Gina Drosos","Yes, so in terms of the inventory charge that really is going to be the discontinued inventory items that we're pulling from the stores to make room for store space. So it is separate from how we look at the levels of clearance that we saw within the second quarter.","Paul Lejuez","Right, but was that inventory that was sold and benefited sales in the second quarter or would that benefit sales in future quarters or is it destroyed?","Michele Santana","Yes, so there's no impact in terms of the products that were already sold, so it's not related to Q2 products that we sold. It's inventory that we're discontinuing that we're going from the stores to make space for the new products and then we evaluate the disposition method because there is still as you would expect, there is still value in the inventory items where you can pop the stones to diamonds or the gold, et cetera, but it will be moved out of stores and disposed of in different methods.","Paul Lejuez","Got you. And then just what was the merchandise margin rate this quarter and the second quarter including the clearance sales?","Michele Santana","Yes, so we don't disclose our merchandise margin rate. We've provided the gross margin rates which when you exclude the inventory charge we said was up a 180 basis points and in the prepared remarks we provided the drivers of those, the most significant being 350 basis points since we're no longer recognizing bad debt expense, and then we also did make a comment that our transformational cost savings that falls into gross margin that helped to offset sales de-leverage as well as the higher mix of clearance sales.","Paul Lejuez","That\u2019s it. Thanks, good luck.","Gina Drosos","All right, thank you.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time and this will conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"18947":["Signet Jewelers Limited (NYSE:SIG) F4Q 2014 Results Earnings Conference Call March 27, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","James Grant - VP of Investor Relations","Mike Barnes - Chief Executive Officer","Ron Ristau - Chief Financial Officer","","Analysts","","Eric Beder - Brean Capital","Bill Armstrong - CL King & Associates","Simeon Siegel - Nomura Securities","Rick Patel - Stephens","Nancy Hilliker - Citigroup","Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","Andrew Hughes - UBS","","Operator","Welcome to the Signet Jewelers Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2014 Results Conference Call. My name is Joan, and I will be the operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. James Grant, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","James Grant","Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 earnings call. On our call today are Mike Barnes, CEO; and Ron Ristau, CFO. The presentation deck we will be referencing is available under the Investors section of our website, signetjewelers.com.","Following Mike and Ron\u2019s prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session about Signet operations. During our Q&A, questions should be limited to the operations of Signet. We will not be answering questions on Zale as the transaction has not closed. During today\u2019s presentation, we will in places discuss Signet\u2019s business outlook and make certain forward-looking statements. Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially.","We urge you to read the risk factors cautionary language and other disclosures in the annual report on Form 10-K that was filed today with the SEC. We also draw your attention to slide number 2 in today\u2019s presentation.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Barnes","Thanks James and good morning everyone. We\u2019re pleased with our fourth quarter results and our full year results. For the quarter, comp store sales at Signet increased by 4.3%. Our U.S. division comps grew at 4% compared to a 4.9% increase last year. In the UK, comp store sales increased 5.7% as the team continued its strong momentum coming out of the holiday season and on through the end of the quarter.","E-commerce sales for Signet were up by 23.6% as our string of impressive double-digit growth rates continued in Q4. Signet delivered record Q4 profit driven by the strong execution of our strategies. Our operating income was $270.6 million up $2.9 million or 1.1% and diluted earnings per share were $2.18 up $0.06 or 2.8%.","In the fourth quarter, the U.S. division results were driven by strong performance across a variety of merchandised categories. Bridal, colored diamonds, fashion jewelry, beads and watches, all performed very well. Our branded differentiated and exclusive brands increased by 21.8% reaching 31.1% of sales for the year. Once again, we had an impactful advertising campaign and our store execution was strong.","In the UK division, results were driven by growth in bridal and fashion diamond jewelry as well as fashion and prestige watches, exclusive of Rolex, which was offered in fewer stores. Our in store teams executed with a renewed enthusiasm and drove results throughout the quarter. Lastly, in the fourth quarter, our teams did the bulk of a hard work necessary to set the stage for the February announcement regarding the Zale acquisition.","I\u2019ll take a few moments at this time to review some of the key takeaways on the Zale deal before I resume discussion on the Signet full year performance. The transaction is of course subject to Zale\u2019s stockholder approval, certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, but we expect it will close sometime within Calendar year 2014. We\u2019re all very excited by the great potential this acquisition allows for. We realize there is a lot of work in front of us, but the benefits and the opportunities that this brings to our customers, suppliers and team members is tremendous.","The addition of Zale will help us support our mid market and best in bridal strategies. It also provides digital ecosystem opportunities and gives us a very strong position in Canada. The timing of the acquisition works well. The Zale team has really done an outstanding job of returning the company to profitability. Soon, working together with Signet resources, the knowhow, we believe that we can take our companies to a greater level of success.","We\u2019re in a strong position to cost effectively finance this transaction as well. We expect to utilize approximately $600 million of receivables securitization and $800 million of other debt financing to complete the transaction. This cost effective financing as well as our ability to evolve and better optimize our capital structure will also enable improvements in the level of our tax efficiency.","The evolution of our capital structure includes the potential for further securitization of our accounts receivable as our company grows and cash flow predictability of the combined entity stabilizes. We have identified clear opportunities for approximately $100 million in synergies within the first three years after this deal closes and we will continue to develop additional ideas after the deal closes as we work closer together. To that end, we are beginning our planning for integration and we have decided to partner with McKinsey Consulting to work together with our internal teams to ensure success.","Now, I will turn to the results of our fiscal year 2014. Our comp store sales increased by 4.4%. The U.S. which represents about 84% of our sales for the year delivered 5.2% comps, which was outstanding after an increase of 4% last year.","In the UK, we delivered a positive 1% comp and that is the best we have seen in six years. The comp store sales growth led to record profit for the year. Our operating income was $570.5 million or an increase of 1.8% and diluted earnings per share was $4.56, up 4.8%.","There were other highlights beyond just the income statement as well. We repurchased 1.9% of our outstanding shares in fiscal 2014. We also increased our dividend in the first quarter by 25%. And I am very happy to say, we announced today another dividend increase this time by 20% to $0.18 per share per quarter.","During fiscal 2014, we strengthened our strategic diamond sourcing initiative in a variety of ways including the purchase of a rough to polish manufacturing facility in Botswana. And we increased our square footage globally by 4% by opening 63 new Kay and 13 new Jared stores. I\u2019d like to thank all of our team members worldwide for a year of outstanding results with their tremendous efforts.","Now, let\u2019s take a little bit of a closer look at the U.S. division annual performance. In the U.S., total sales were $3,517.6 million, up $243.7 million or 7.4%. Our same store sales increased by 5.2%. Kay comps led the way with the 6.5% increase, while Jared increased by 4.7%. The success in both concepts was driven by variety of merchandise categories.","The U.S. eCommerce business performed very well with sales up $27.6 million to a $129 million or an increase of 27.2%. The U.S. division operating profit increased by 1% with the 15.7% operating margin; Ron is going to add little bit more color on this in just a couple of minutes.","Now, I am going to move on to some of the key drivers of this performance, starting with the merchandise. Our merchandise sales growth was very broad-based with strong growth across both the bridal and fashion jewelry categories.","In fiscal 2014, branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise gained relative share within our product portfolio. The category grew by 23.2% and ended the year accounting for 31.1% of our merchandise sales mix and that\u2019s up 370 basis points. This growth was led by our colored diamonds and gemstone collections.","Those include Le Vian, Artistry, Vivid and Shades of Wonder. Also our branded bridal collections saw strong growth including brands such as Neil Lane Bridal and Tolkowsky Diamonds. And Neil Lane Designs and Open Hearts by Jane Seymour were important contributors to branded growth within the designer fashion merchandise.","Looking beyond the branded differentiated merchandise, overall bridal sales increased a double-digit percentage, enough to gain a small amount of relative share within our merchandise portfolio. Our leadership in marketing and advertising continues to be an important driver of our U.S. sales as well. Everyone knows that Every kiss begins with Kay and that He went to Jared.","For the holiday season, we created fresh new TV ads continuing to build upon our industry leading share of voice. In fiscal 2014, our advertising investment in the U.S. increased to $233.6 million. Our branded, differentiated and exclusive merchandise continued to provide compelling stories that we communicated very effectively and efficiently with our messaging. The bottom-line is our compelling marketing and advertising continued to drive strong purchase intent.","Another driver in fiscal 2014 results was the strengthening of our digital ecosystem. We evolved kay.com and jared.com from the previous year\u2019s redesign. We optimized the customer experiences for both desktop and mobile devices. And we created mobile apps which have a variety of features such as allowing customers to pay their credit balances from their mobile phones. We also created an online education center called jewelrywise.com, which is an excellent resource for customers who want to know more about jewelry in a more objective in a softer sale kind of environment.","We surround customers with eCommerce and social media touch points and we engage them in digital ecosystem marketing not only through kay.com and jared.com, but also through Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other points of interaction. As a result, we created outstanding customer experiences in all channels. Our success in the digital ecosystem is validated in part by the tremendous three year growth rate of our eCommerce sales which is over 34%.","Now I\u2019ll turn to some of our UK performance. Total sales in fiscal 2014 were $685.6 million that was down $23.9 million or 3.4% due to fewer stores. Comp sales however increased by 1% compared to an increase of 0.3% last year. This comp increase was driven by strong fourth quarter at Ernest Jones, driven through bridal and fashion diamond jewelry, as well as prestige watches exclusive of Rolex, which as I mentioned was offered in fewer stores. It was driven in H.Samuel primarily through bridal and fashion diamond jewelry and fashion watches. eCommerce sales in the UK were $35.1 million and that is up $6.7 million over a very strong 23.6%.","Operating income was $42.4 million for the year, an improvement of $2.4 million from the prior year. Operating margins increased by 60 basis points, which is a great sign that our turnaround program in the UK is well on track.","We remain committed to our UK long-term plan and we have a series of activities underway to deliver sustained growth and a 10% operating margin. Collaborating closely with the U.S. division, our UK division is focused on continuing to develop our people, selling systems and customer service. The UK is focused on merchandise initiatives as well such as best in bridal, which will continue to showcase the brands and store processes to reinforce our growth initiatives.","We are also engaged in ongoing development of our fashion jewelry programs and committed to strengthening our partnership with the watch brands. Another main focus is the ongoing investment in key real estate, rolling out new store designs and continuing to develop our growing digital ecosystem business. And finally, discipline on cost remains a key element of our performance improvement.","In conclusion, fiscal 2014 was a successful year, not only because of record financial results, but also because we successfully supported our mission to help customers do two things, celebrate life and express love. We\u2019ve been building upon our mid market success and staying true to the heritage of our core brands.","We grew our bridal business through initiatives around field operations, merchandise, marketing and procurement. We advanced our digital ecosystem as I discussed a little earlier. And in the near future we\u2019re also expecting to achieve a big win around our strategy of geographic expansion and expanding our footprint upon the close of our Zale acquisition.","So in the meantime, I am very proud of what our team accomplished during fiscal 2014. And now I am going to turn the call over to Ron for some financial color on the fourth quarter and the full year. Ron?","Ron Ristau","Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll focus my comments today primarily on the fourth quarter and I\u2019ll start by reviewing the fourth quarter sales in more detail.","For the quarter, total sales for Signet increased 3.4% to $1,564 million compared to $1,513.3 million last year. Same store sales increased 4.3% compared to 3.5% growth in the prior year.","In the U.S., our total sales increased 3.5% or $43.1 million to $1,288 million which included the same store sales increase of 4%. Our non-same store sales were up 3.2%. Sales increases were driven by a variety of merchandise categories. By category, bridal, colored diamonds, fashion jewelry, beads and watches all performed well.","The number of merchandise transactions increased in both Kay and Jared. Average merchandise transaction values increased in Kay primarily due to higher sales in granted merchandise. Average merchandise value declined in Jared primarily driven by sales mix due to higher bead sales.","In the UK, total sales increased 1.4% or $3.8 million to $272.2 million. Comp store sales increased by 5.7%. UK sales performance in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by growth in bridal and fashion diamond jewelry, as well as fashion and prestige watches exclusive of Rolex which was offered in fewer stores in fiscal 2014.","Average merchandise transaction value was consistent with the prior year in H. Samuel and declined slightly in Ernest Jones primarily due to sales mix. The number of merchandise transactions increased in Ernest Jones due primarily to increased focus on the bridal business and sales of watches.","The decrease in H. Samuel was primarily due to continued store closings. Signet eCommerce sales in the fourth quarter as Mike mentioned were $79 million, up $15.1 million or 23.6%.","Now let\u2019s review the components of operating income. Our Signet gross margin was $648.8 million, an increase of $11.7 million. The gross margin rate was 41.5%, down 60 basis points. In the U.S. gross margin dollars increased $9.1 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 reflecting higher sales partially offset by a gross margin rate decline of 70 basis points.","The lower gross margin rate primarily reflects the net impact of gold hedge losses associated with the declining gold prices earlier this year, fourth quarter promotional programs and year-end inventory adjustments, partially offset by favorable pricing. The U.S. net bad debt expense to U.S. sales ratio was 3.5% compared to 3.3% in the prior year fourth quarter.","In the UK, gross margin dollars increased $3.4 million compared to the prior year fourth quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of higher sales and a gross margin rate improvement of 70 basis points. The increase in the gross margin rate was primarily result of store occupancy savings associated with store closings and lower store impairment charges partially offset by planned promotional activities in the key holiday gift giving period.","Signet's selling, general and administrative expenses were $425.8 million compared to $410.9 million in the prior year fourth quarter. So an increase of $14.9 million and as a percentage of sales increased 10 basis points to 27.2%. I'll discuss this in more detail on the next slide.","Other operating income was $47.6 million or 3% of sales compared to $41.5 million or 2.7% of sales last year. This increase of $6.1 million was primarily due to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances.","So, our consolidated operating income in the fourth quarter was $270.6 million, representing 17.3% of sales. By segment the U.S. division operating income was $227.9 million or 17.7% of sales, as compared to $227.5 million or 18.3% of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. And the operating income for the UK division was $51.7 million or 19% of sales compared to $48.8 million or 18.2% of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Our fully diluted shares, fully diluted earnings per share were $2.18.","Now some additional detail on SG&A expenses. As I stated earlier, SG&A expenses were $425.8 million compared to $410 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. In the U.S., SG&A expenses increased by $15.6 million the primary reason for the increase was advertising expenses made in anticipation of higher sales than we actually achieved. The overall SG&A expense in the UK was relatively consistent with the prior year as savings that we did generate as a result of our savings program were redeployed to advertising and store support.","Our SG&A remains effectively controlled and focused. Our ending inventory was $1,488 million up $91 million or 6.5%. This includes inventory on our new store program as we had approximately 83 new stores, new stores increased inventory by $40 million.","We made an additional increase in bridal investment to support our best in bridal initiatives. This represented a $20 million of the increase. Our diamond sourcing initiative was up by $17.4 million over the prior year and then the UK our inventory was up $14 million primarily due to foreign currency translation increases.","Excluding the increases due to foreign currency in diamond sourcing, our inventory was up by 4.2%. We continue to believe our inventory is very well positioned to support our first quarter sales.","Our credit portfolio continues the strong performance, net accounts receivable increased to $1,374 million up 14% for the quarter. In the quarter the credit penetration was 55.5% compared to 53.5% last year. This is attributed primarily to increases in branded bridal sales and strong customer acceptance of our credit offerings. The average monthly collection rate this quarter was 11.5% compared to 11.9% last year as customers continued to opt for our regular credit terms, which require lower monthly payments as opposed to the 12 month interest-free program.","Our bad debt expense was $45.5 million for the fourth quarter, driven primarily by growth in receivable balance from increased credit penetration and change in the credit program mix. Offsetting the net bad debt expense was an increase in other operating income, which is primarily interest income on the higher outstanding receivables and a shift away from interest-free programs. The income on these programs was $47.6 million or 3% of sales in the fourth quarter. The net impact of these two items was income of $2.1 million in the fourth quarter compared to $0.4 million in the prior year, an increase of $1.7 million.","In the year-to-date, we see a similar trend of slight increase in bad debt caused by an increase in receivable balance, offset by increases in other operating income. The net income impact was $48.4 million versus $39 million last year, a net benefit of $9.4 million on the year.","Now turning to our first quarter fiscal 2015 guidance. For the first quarter, the company currently expects same store sales to increase in the 3% to 4% range. The first quarter diluted earnings per share prior to acquisition costs are expected to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.28 with acquisition costs impacting EPS by a negative $0.10 to $0.8 resulting in first quarter diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.14 to $1.20 based upon an estimated $80.3 million weighted average common shares outstanding.","The recently announced pending acquisition of the Zale Corporation will result in the realization of incremental expenses prior to the close of the transaction, as the final close date is dependent upon Zale stockholder and regulatory approval and the satisfaction of closing conditions. These expenses will primarily be transaction-related costs, such as legal, tax, banking and consulting expenses, which are expensed as incurred, and financing fees, such as bridge financing fees incurred prior to establishment of the new capital structure.","For the full year, the company expects a range of capital expenditures estimated between $180 million to $200 million. This includes the opening of 75 to 85 new Kay and Jared stores and one new store in the UK, the cost for store remodels and continuing our digital and information technology infrastructure build outs.","Thank you very much. And I will now turn the call back to Mike.","Mike Barnes","Thanks Ron. I\u2019d like to again just thank all of our Signet team members worldwide for the great contributions to the successful quarter and to the fiscal year 2014. Now we would be pleased to take any questions that you have. But again as James mention, during our Q&A, questions should be limited to the operations of Signet. We're not answering any questions on Zale as the transaction has not yet closed.","Thanks again and let\u2019s begin the Q&A session please.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Eric Beder from Brean Capital. Please go ahead.","Eric Beder - Brean Capital","Good morning. Congratulations on a solid quarter.","Mike Barnes","Thank you, Eric.","Eric Beder - Brean Capital","When you look into 2014, I know that you have changed the cadence a little bit with the advertising; you are a little more aggressive in down periods. I'm curious how that's going to be reflected in 2014? And when you look in Valentine\u2019s Day, how did you guys continue to do extremely well even with kind of the bad weather and traffic patterns we see with other players?","Mike Barnes","Yes. The weather, I'll take that one first and then I'll talk about the advertising a little bit, and what we did and what we're thinking about going into this year. It's very interesting, Eric, because we got impacted when Mother Nature decided to deal her blow. We got hit just like everybody else and it was pretty tough, there were periods of time where we had to close stores because of the weather, certainly the customers weren't coming out, it was not only the snow, but just the better, better cold that was out there and it was tough.","The great thing is that our customer seems to be very resilient because whenever we had nice open windows of weather warming up and snow melts, the customers were coming into the stores and they were coming in and they were buying. And so it kind of balanced itself out and I\u2019ve heard a lot of the market news in retail about the weather and the impact that it\u2019s had.","But I would have to say that as tough as it was weather wise. I feel like the customer was resilient, they kept coming back. And so we finished out our quarter. January was very tough in the U.S., it was pretty flattish. The UK continued its strong momentum that it had through holiday throughout the rest of the quarter, throughout January. And we've had -- this earnings announcement is a little later than the other three because of the year-end piece of it. So we\u2019ve had ability to see about half the quarter. And Q1 has started off pretty well, we feel good about the guidance that we gave that you have seen. And we feel good about meeting our objectives for the year.","On the advertising question, we did increase advertising a little bit last year. We did a little bit more continuity advertising and we extended it back into October a little bit. This year we are looking at how to go about that. We are working with the networks and in fact we\u2019ve got our senior people in New York with some pre-meetings right now. And we will have to see how they are able to negotiate things. But we are looking to try to add a little bit more flexibility into the way that we handle our advertising and we will have to see how that works out. But it will be another very strong advertising year, we are going to have some great campaigns out there and we are looking forward to a good year in fiscal 2015.","Eric Beder - Brean Capital","Okay. Congratulations. Good luck for this year.","Mike Barnes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Armstrong from CL King & Associates. Please go ahead.","Bill Armstrong - CL King & Associates","Good morning, Mike and Ron. In the UK, you had a strong holiday season and it looks like sales even accelerated in January. Is that acceleration continuing quarter-to-date and what do you think is driving that? Could you maybe discuss some of the macro environmental issues in the UK currently?","Mike Barnes","Yes. We did finish out the quarter very strong in the UK, January was very good, it continued the strong holiday performance. We\u2019ve had a good start to the first quarter; we are not going to quantify that other than saying that on a consolidated basis in the UK and in the U.S. it\u2019s been a good start. There are some timing shifts. The UK has a Mother\u2019s Day shift from week 5 to week 9. In fact Mother\u2019s Day is going to be this Sunday in the UK. But everything seems to be moving along pretty much according to plan and we feel very good about being able to hit our objectives in this first quarter in the UK and the U.S. and on a consolidated basis. And we think that we\u2019ve got a pretty good start to the new fiscal year. So, we\u2019re pretty excited about it. We\u2019ve got a lot of things driving that UK business. They\u2019ve been collaborating a lot with our U.S. teams as well.","And I\u2019d tell you, our teams on both sides have just done a remarkable job. We have a lot of experience. We\u2019ve got a new management team in the UK that has a tremendous enthusiasm; they\u2019ve got a great culture driving the people; the stores teams are newly excited about driving the business there. They had a great holiday and kudos to them, they deserved it, they\u2019ve worked really hard and they\u2019ve done a fantastic job. They\u2019re driving their diamond business; they\u2019re driving their watch business; they\u2019re adding new and different promotions. It\u2019s really an evolution of the jewelry industry in the UK.","I think that our team is trying to drive over there and I think they\u2019re doing a pretty darn good job of it. Now one great quarter is not a long-term trend. So I am not going to get overly excited about it. But you have to start a good long trend somewhere and I hope this is it, but we\u2019re going to be looking towards long-term consistent performance. That\u2019s really what matters, is giving the best customer experience over a very long time period and watching your business grow and develop because of that.","So, they\u2019re doing wonderful job with the merchandise, they are doing great with promotions, they are really driving the business. And we look forward to the balance of the year.","Bill Armstrong - CL King & Associates","","Okay. Anything that call out in UK in terms of either overall consumer spending trends or the competitive environment in jewelry, anything going on there?","Mike Barnes","","Yes, the competitive environment is tough as always. We have some -- a lot of competition there in the jewelry business. And I think though that our team has positioned itself very well in that environment and that we\u2019re doing some new and exciting things to kind of change the dynamic of how competition works over there.","The best compliment I can get, I think somebody told me the other day that one of the competitors said to them you guys are not acting very gentlemanly over here, you are driving your business very strong. That\u2019s what I want to hear. So it\u2019s good. And we\u2019re going to continue looking at new ways to drive the business and not just the same old things. But the macro environment seems to be getting slowly better; hopefully that will continue on. And business for us so far has been pretty good. And again, we look forward to the balance of the year.","Bill Armstrong - CL King & Associates","","Okay, great. And just a real quick question for Ron. It looks like your CapEx this year will be roughly $30 million to $50 million higher than last year, looks like about the same number of stores being open. What would explain the difference or the increase in CapEx this year?","Ron Ristau","","Two primary things, so number one is just a shift from some IP projects that we were unable to complete in fiscal 2014, so the timing of them shifted out into 2015. And the second thing is the number of store remodels that we are doing is up somewhat in next year. And those two things account really for the bulk of the differential.","Bill Armstrong - CL King & Associates","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Mike Barnes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel from Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Simeon Siegel - Nomura Securities","Great, thanks. Good morning guys.","Mike Barnes","","Good morning.","Simeon Siegel - Nomura Securities","","So Mike, I think you noted that Ultra drove 80 basis points of operating margin dilution to the U.S. segment this year. Can you talk about the margin opportunities there this year as those conversions drive the improved productivity? And then Ron, I believe you guys beat your inter quarter gross margin expectation? Can you just talk about where the improvement fell between the commodity cost versus the promotional cadence and maybe the right way to think about that, those elements for the next few quarters? Thanks.","Ron Ristau","Okay. Well, when you get to Ultra, as we said Ultra last year, as we came through the year, we came through with the negative EPS in the first quarter of 3 -- about $0.06 in the second quarter and about another $0.03 in the third quarter. And then we started to turn slightly accretive as we had indicated in the fourth quarter as the business really started to getting traction.","So, I think the best way to think about it is that those numbers from last year will certainly not be repeated. We use money in Ultra in any other quarters. So that would be helpful and it is helpful in the first quarter. That\u2019s probably the best way to think about that, just from an overall basis rather than break it down from what\u2019s in the margin and what\u2019s in the SG&A and everything else. So, I would look at it from a total EPS perspective.","And when we think about the margin and what improved in the fourth quarter; I mean the improvements were, there is a little bit -- there was some in margin and there were some in SG&A versus our original expectation. Some of our SG&A savings had to do with actually some lower bonus calculations. So that\u2019s not a way we like to have that happened but that did happened versus our original expectation. And that movement is really almost too small to talk about in any substance, so I would just say, a little better in the margin as we came through January, some of the promotions we were doing in December came off and therefore the margins went up a little bit, and we realized some benefit from that.","Simeon Siegel - Nomura Securities","Okay, and then on the back of that going into, I guess looking forward, is there the right way to think about or any color helping with commodity costs and the impact that might have over the next few quarters?","Ron Ristau","Sure. I think the commodity cost question, as we said last year, with our average costing system, the price improvements in gold which started to incur in the first quarter of last year, we didn\u2019t realize that much of a benefit for last year because it just takes time to monitor. So, we will get a bigger benefit from gold commodity cost increases declining this year.","I will point out there will be some offsets to that. Number one will be the fact that our scrap recovery rates when we sell gold on materials that we melt down, we will receive less money for that, therefore that\u2019s an offset to the improvement in the average price of gold that we will see. And we also are still dealing with the flow through on the commodity hedge losses that we incurred last year in the first quarter because we were hedged. And when the prices unwound so rapidly, we took a fairly sizable hit, a piece of which went through last year\u2019s P&L, and a piece of which will go through this year\u2019s P&L. That\u2019s about $19 million negative across the quarters in the whole year as disclosed in our 10-K.","But net-net, I would say that gold will be provided it behaves\u2019 this morning it\u2019s down again, I don\u2019t know if anybody noticed, but it\u2019s went up to 1,390, today it broke below 1,300 again. So I think net-net it will be a helpful situation to us. And I do not think that you should anticipate that margins will be down like they were in the fourth quarter. I think we\u2019ll be able to get some more stability in our margin as we look into 2015. And so we\u2019re relatively in good shape with that. I hope that answers your question.","Simeon Siegel - Nomura Securities","Yes. No, that helps. So thank you very much and good luck for the year.","Ron Ristau","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Patel from Stephens. Please go ahead. Rick, are you there?","Rick Patel - Stephens","Can you hear me?","Operator","I can now.","Rick Patel - Stephens","Hi, good morning everyone and congrats on a strong year. Just a follow-up to an earlier question; comp guidance for the first quarter looks pretty healthy in light of relatively difficult traffic trends at the mall. So, how would you characterize it? Is it continued share gains in bridal? Have you raised prices so far in the New Year? Has traffic come back? Just help us think about what you think will drive that comp?","Mike Barnes","Well Rick, you\u2019re right. I mean traffic has been tough, but what we\u2019re seeing are -- we\u2019re seeing strong transactions. And you mentioned bridal that was very significant for us. We did see strong bridal growth; in fact the mix increased slightly there. And fortunately, bridal is a continuity business; people get engaged all throughout the year. Of course at holidays sometimes, it gets a little better even, but it is a strong business for every quarter of the year. So, that\u2019s one of the reasons that we\u2019re so focused on being the best in bridal.","But our fashion business is a bit good too. And I\u2019d tell you I attribute that to the fact that we\u2019ve got some exciting merchandise out there. Some of the new styles that we\u2019ve got out there, some of the colored diamonds that we\u2019re selling out there, I mean they\u2019re just doing tremendously for us. And our customers are looking for this new innovative type merchandise and they are coming into our stores. So we\u2019ve been beaten down a little bit with the lower traffic in the malls, we\u2019ve been beaten down by Mother Nature and the weather.","But the customers, as I mentioned earlier, they are just resilient, they just keep coming back. And they are coming back because our teams are doing a fantastic job in the stores, because our corporate teams are doing an incredible job creating and innovating new and exciting merchandise, and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving our business, that\u2019s really what it\u2019s all about.","Rick Patel - Stephens","","Great. And then can you talk about watches, it seems like that was an area that stores did very well during holiday season. What\u2019s your outlook for this business for this year? And considering how well you are doing, is it an area that you\u2019d look to increase shelf space into or would that hurt your ability to drive the core jewelry business?","Mike Barnes","Watches have been a good category for us; they\u2019ve been pretty strong; we\u2019ve got a lot of brands that are doing very well. It\u2019s still a relatively small category for us. In the U.S., it accounts for about 7% of our business, but it\u2019s an important piece of the business, because it does bring people and traffic into the stores. A lot of people are looking for specific watch brands when they come out shopping and that brings them into the stores, and hopefully we\u2019ll end up selling them some diamonds as well as watches, when they do that. But it\u2019s been a strong part of the business.","We continue to evolve that piece of the business too. We\u2019re continuing to look into certain higher end fashion offerings. We\u2019ve done pretty well by putting MICHELE into a decent number of Jared stores, we\u2019ve also put Gucci out there, Gucci has tested very well, Coach is another fairly new brand for us that has tested well and we\u2019re looking at expanding some of these brands even further. So it\u2019s pretty exciting.","In the UK, watches have always been a bigger part of the business, it\u2019s about a third of our business in the UK. So, it\u2019s very strong. A lot of that\u2019s attributable to the fact that culturally in the UK jewelry stores sell fashion watches, whereas in the U.S. generally they don\u2019t sell a lot of the kind of mid tier fashion watches.","So, we\u2019ve had a very strong business in the UK with watches. Michael Kors which everyone knows is one of the hot brands out there. It\u2019s a brand that we carry for watches and jewelry in the UK, and it was terrific for us.","So, we\u2019re excited about the partnership that we have with the major watch companies out there. And we intend to build upon that even further. We have a team at the largest watch show in the world right now\u2019 in fact it started today the Basel Watch Fair in Basel Switzerland. And unfortunately, this is the first time I\u2019ve missed that show in about 25 years. But I\u2019m glad to be here today, given our great fourth quarter results and talking about the great future that we have in front of us here. ","Rick Patel - Stephens","We\u2019re glad you\u2019re with us. Thanks very much and good luck this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Oliver Chen from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Nancy Hilliker - Citigroup","Hi, everyone. Thanks so much. This is Nancy Hilliker filling in for Oliver Chen. Congratulations on the quarter.","Mike Barnes","Thank you.","Nancy Hilliker - Citigroup","We wanted to ask a little bit more about the strong performance in the brand and merchandise. At 31.1%, do you expect that to go higher; are there particular new launches that you would expect to continue to drive that higher? And then, just a follow-up in terms of Mother\u2019s Day, is there any U.S. based calendar shift that we should know about?","Ron Ristau","I\u2019ll start with the -- from a calendar shift perspective, no there is nothing.","Nancy Hilliker - Citigroup","Okay.","Ron Ristau","The significant Easter flips back into April of course, but Ester is not a big driver of jewelry sales, it is somewhat helpful, but it\u2019s just a switch between March and April, so it\u2019s within the quarter, so nothing that you would or should be concerned about and Mother\u2019s Day is placed almost exactly where it was last year, so the timing of our programs will be the same. Could you just repeat the first part briefly, what was first part of your question?","Nancy Hilliker - Citigroup","Sure. The brand penetration in terms\u2026","Ron Ristau","Why we\u2019re up, our brand penetration. It has to do with the colored diamonds. Mike?","Mike Barnes","Yes. We have got some new brands in our differentiated line up. Vivid Diamonds which are a range of colored diamonds that we carry in Jared and Artistry Diamonds which is a line of colored diamonds that we carry in Kay. And they\u2019ve just done extremely well. I mean, as I mentioned earlier, the customers are looking for very fashionable new merchandise. The colored diamonds are doing well.","We have also got other merchandise categories within the diamond range. We have got a new line called Diamonds in Rhythm that was very strong for us during holiday and again during the important Valentine\u2019s Day holiday period. And the big brand names continue to drive more volume and strong growth. The Neil Lanes are doing fantastic, Tolkowsky Diamonds doing very, very well. Some of the important fashion programs I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Jane Seymour continues to be an important part of our line-up as does Neil Lane Designs which is the fashion piece of that. And it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s very strong. Our team is getting better and better at the branding. We are going to continue driving that. And we are going continue looking for new things to test. And we will see how it goes. But we are pretty excited about the line-up we\u2019ve got.","Ron Ristau","Just a small point of clarification, Diamonds in Rhythm is not part of our branded proprietary group, just that\u2026","Mike Barnes","No, it\u2019s just a\u2026","Ron Ristau","It\u2019s a great ramp, but it just isn\u2019t -- just not and that goes for more [confusion there also].","Nancy Hilliker - Citigroup","Thanks so much.","Mike Barnes","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Tunick from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. This is (inaudible) filling in for Brian. I guess going back to the UK. I was wondering if significant portion of your turnaround initiatives are done and finally bearing fruit at this point. I guess more specifically in terms of the 3 points you laid out last year, with merchandise, real-estate and expense management buckets, where would you say we have those at this point?","Ron Ristau","I think we\u2019re doing great. All those three initiatives are seen and reflected in the UK results. Obviously, we\u2019ve made significant strides in the merchandise and what\u2019s being presented and the things that we\u2019re stressing there with our reemphasis on bridal and diamond and some of the renovation that we\u2019ve done in the watch category, particularly the launch of Michael Kors into that brand has done well.","So, that addresses the first part. The real-estate closing and renegotiating importantly of rents is continuing very strongly to contribute to financial results there. And we continue to reduce costs as evidenced by the results in the SG&A area. We did save some pretty good money. We did do some redeploying of that money into areas that drive sales.","So we instituted some new bonus programs in the UK that are more similar to the U.S. and we also spent some additional money on advertising and you see that reflected in the comp. So, we\u2019ve been moving from -- moving money into more productive areas as we save in some of the areas where we wanted to cut cost. So I\u2019d say that program is a direct result of everything that we\u2019ve done. That combined with our new management team and the partnership that Mike mentioned with the U.S., all of it is working together to drive that business forward.","Unidentified Analyst","","Great that\u2019s very helpful. And then on the gross margin side, I guess going back to Simeon\u2019s earlier question. I was wondering how we should think about it through the year between the tailwind you should get from the lower commodity cost and the impact of gold hedges. I know the P&L impact here is sales dependent, but maybe can you provide a little more color on relative to last year, where your blended input costs are and where your gold hedges are?","Ron Ristau","Well, I would tell you is that the reason I made the comment in three parts is that last year we saw de minimis impact on our average gold cost. We will see greater impacts in fiscal 2015. However, the total impact on a company will be mitigated somewhat by what happens in the gold scrap cost area and of course we are dealing with those hedge losses of $19 million which are one-time in nature. Obviously, we hope that that doesn\u2019t happen again, but we were dealing with it this year, so it will be a slight offset to the benefits that we get.","The net message I guess I would try to give you is that gold will be helpful, but I would stay balanced in your thinking about how much it would improve because of the two offsets that we have.","Unidentified Analyst","","Great. Thank you very much and best of luck.","Ron Ristau","","I hope that\u2019s helpful. Sorry, next\u2026..","Operator","Thank you our next question comes from Dorothy Lakner from Topeka Capital. Please go ahead.","Ron Ristau","Good morning.","Operator","","Dorothy, are you there? Dorothy, if you have muted your line, if you could unmute your line please? I\u2019ll go on to the next person.","Mike Barnes","Please do.","Operator","We have Ike Boruchow from Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee","Hi, everyone. Good morning and congrats on a solid year.","Mike Barnes","Hi Ike.","Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee","I guess Ron, I wanted to ask you about the credit portfolio right now. How do you feel about the book today? And then how should we be thinking about kind of participation in 2014 and also receivable of book growth as we kind of model out 2014?","Ron Ristau","Sure. That\u2019s a very good question. Well, the credit portfolio as I indicated continues perform very strongly, we\u2019re very pleased with the overall performance of the portfolio. We have experienced last year some creeping increase in the participation and penetration rates, because people just seem to like the program and the certainty of payments and they like to pay off their jewelry purchases quickly which is what we always say is the benefit of program.","So, I\u2019d expect that this year when you think about it, that we will probably see some slow further increase in the penetration rate, nothing dramatic but slow increase driven by our focus on bridal again. As you know credit supports the bridal program very, very strongly and as high as 70%, and maybe more higher, and it keeps getting up there.","So, it\u2019s very important part of supporting our bridal program. So, that will drive it forward. And I think that the overall performance of the portfolio will remain stable, which I would describe as good to excellent. I mean it might get some creeping increase in the bad debt as a percentage of sales, again due to growth in the overall portfolio. Last year on an annual basis, the growth in the portfolio should be you know I would guess somewhat similar, maybe a touch little bit similar as the way to model is what I would choose to do. And if the business gets stronger and might go up a little bit which would be a good thing, and with the business it is relatively consistent with last year, it would be about same growth rate. I think that\u2019s how you should think about it, but the performance of portfolio is very, very strong.","Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee","Okay, great. And then Ron, also when you talked about kind of putting together the new capital structure of the company. You mentioned certain things you are trying to optimize and one of things I think you mentioned was the tax rate. I am just kind of curious when you think about your tax rate say 35%, some of the things and leverage that you are pulling right now, where do you think that could ultimately go directionally?","Ron Ristau","I think it would be, we don\u2019t target tax rates, so I don\u2019t know. We try to put in place very effective programs. And as we develop our programs and complete the acquisition of Zale and put in place our new financial structure, which we do expect to be efficient from both a financing and tax perspective, we will be happy to provide more information about that. But I think any speculation would be premature at this point. And I think that\u2019s where we leave it for now, we hope it will get better, but we will not be able to target exactly how much.","Everything we are doing relative to the financing we believe should create substantial value for shareholders and owners of the company. So we have that in mind as we do all this and we will put in place a very excellent package, I can assure you. I am sorry, can\u2019t be more specific. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s so wise to do so.","Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee","Okay. Thanks so much. And I am also happy, we are all here.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Wu from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","Thanks. Hi, good morning everyone and congrats on the very solid quarter. My first question; can you comment on what you\u2019re seeing in the promotional landscape and your expectations for this year and if you have pulled back on some of your promotional strategies since the holiday season?","Mike Barnes","We\u2019re continuing with I would say fairly consistent promotions as we do year-over-year. I haven\u2019t seen anything remarkably different in the landscape out there. Things seem to be pretty much status quo. We continue to, as we always do, test a few new promotions here and there and see how they work out. But I wouldn\u2019t expect anything dramatically different this year promotionally than what we saw last year at least not in the environment that I am seeing out there today.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","Got it. So we shouldn\u2019t see any incremental promotions relative to last year, it should be about the same?","Mike Barnes","I think it\u2019s going to be relatively similar to last year at this point.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","Excellent. And how did the gross merchandise margin perform in both the U.S., as well as the UK in the quarter?","Ron Ristau","The gross merchandise margin, we addressed, I believe we\u2019ve addressed overall the merchandise margin at the margin level not the gross merchandise margin level which will turn it back away from for a lot of different reasons. So the main driver of what happens at the margin level is the gross merchandise margin so that\u2019s how I think you should think about that.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","Got it, but directionally it improved or it was contracted in the quarter?","Ron Ristau","No, no I am sorry, in our comments, in my prepared comments I\u2019ve said in the fourth quarter of the year the gross margin in the United States declined by approximately 70 basis points and the gross margin in the UK improved by 70 basis points. I would tell you that the primary driver of that is gross merchandise margin without being specific.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","Got it, great and can you provide any details on perhaps some of the new exclusive product launches that you are currently testing?","Mike Barnes","Yes. This is that time of the year, David when we\u2019re doing test and we don\u2019t really get into a lot of detail because we want to see how they work out. And at the appropriate time in the year we\u2019ll talk about what it is. But I\u2019d like to get them into the stores before I announce that to my competitors out there what I\u2019m working on.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","Great. And if we continue to see healthy momentum in the UK, this has perhaps speed-up the timing of when you can\u2019t reach a double-digit op margin there?","Mike Barnes","We have not put an exact timing on that and we don\u2019t think it prudent to that, but we do feel like we have turned the corner and that we\u2019re making the steps in the right direction now. So we\u2019ll see how it goes. Again, we had one really great quarter and kudos to the team there, I\u2019m really proud of them, but we need to see a little bit more consistency. So we\u2019ll watch it very closely this year and see how it goes. We\u2019ve had a reasonably good start I believe in both the UK and in the U.S. as we move into the new fiscal year and we\u2019ll see how it turns out, but we\u2019re pretty excited about it.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","Excellent. And then just lastly, how many stores are you planning to close in the U.S. and UK this year?","Ron Ristau","In fiscal 2015?","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","Correct.","Ron Ristau","This year, okay. The numbers will be, it always moves around. I\u2019m always reluctant to give a number because it\u2019s highly dependent upon what kind of alternatives we get to when we get to the final negotiations with the landlords often. And last year, the numbers were inflated by Ultra, by 15 closures in Ultra and we did about 16 in the regional area. As we said, the regionals are right now are still under closure, we\u2019ll see what happens when we get a chance to take a total look at our real estate portfolio with the inclusion of the Zale\u2019s properties and so on. So there could be some change in direction there.","I would tell you that thinking of 50ish stores is a reasonably safe number because there is always a culling that goes on relative to stores that in a normal course of business we just will not renew. For instance last year, we did not renew 22 Kay stores out of a 1,000.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","Right.","Ron Ristau","So, there is always some percentage that you\u2019re going to say, this isn\u2019t going to work any longer. And it\u2019s healthy I believe to be culling out those bottom performing stores; I think that\u2019s a sign of a very healthy retailer. So, I would give you a nice round number of 50ish\u2026","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","Okay.","Ron Ristau","I was going to estimate.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","And this is total, including both the U.S. and the UK?","Ron Ristau","You are asking for specific number now. I think 50ish is a reasonable number to use in planning and any number that\u2019s different than that wouldn\u2019t have a material impact on models one way or another I would guess.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Ron Ristau","Thank you.","Mike Barnes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Andrew Hughes from UBS. Please go ahead.","Andrew Hughes - UBS","Yes, good afternoon. Nice to be coming from the UK and asking you question when the UK site performs better than the U.S. for once, not often that\u2019s the case. I just had a follow-up question on the credit side, your slide 19 on net impact. I think you\u2019re suggesting from the previous answer that you would expect that net impact to increase. I mean, would there be any conditions under which it actually might fall that net benefit in the current year?","Ron Ristau","Nothing that I can pursue would tell me that it would be substantially under stress or that it would fall in anyway. I believe that the receivable portfolio will grow slowly and that the customers seem to continue to be shifting to the regular terms versus the interest-free terms that increases the other operating income. So I would expect to see some slight improvement in that as we go forward. And I think the bad debt is performing well.","So I have nothing in my radar screen that tells me that there will be a -- that I\u2019m concerned about in any way at this point in time. The only things that you ever have to worry about in something like this is a huge, the only time we ever had a problem with it over the last 10 years, 15 years has been the financial crisis of 2008, which was a huge (inaudible) event. I don\u2019t know of anything like that on the horizon. And that\u2019s the only thing that could change that. But that\u2019s a very unusual circumstance; nothing that we foresee tells us that that\u2019s going to happen. These numbers are relatively stable numbers.","Andrew Hughes - UBS","All right. Where are we in terms percentage of regular credit versus the interest free credit? Where are we now\u2026","Ron Ristau","We don\u2019t generally quote that number publicly for competitive reasons.","Andrew Hughes - UBS","Or even relative to history?","Ron Ristau","Well, it\u2019s -- on a relative basis, I mean against the size of portfolio, it\u2019s a relatively stable number. When it moves, it moves in basis points. And we see it and then we know it\u2019s happening, but it\u2019s not like it moves 500 basis points in a year; it moves 30 basis points, 40 basis points, something like that. So it is a small movement and accretion towards the regular terms, nothing dramatic.","Andrew Hughes - UBS","All right. Okay. Thank you for that.","Ron Ristau","Okay.","Operator","Thank you.

Our operating income, our net income and our earnings per share were all up over 20% year-over-year.","This was due in large part to managing our expense structure in disciplined fashion and realizing synergies that position Signet well for the long term. This prudent expense management included good results in credit which Michele will speak about in more detail later.","Second, we delivered solid sales for the quarter. Although our sales were slightly below our guidance they were still strong enough to deliver on our earnings expectations. Year-to-date we are gaining profitable market share.","The third point I want you to take away is that we remain a growth story, a prudent, measured and profitable growth story. We remain on pace and are committed to growing our stores' square footage.","Our disciplined, internal rate of return requirement on new stores of 20% remains firm. The growth this year will be led by Kay jewelers outside the enclosed mall. This is a departure from many other retailers that are having to reduce square footage these days.","Fourth, we are reaffirming our annual earnings guidance. Our first quarter results and sales flow through keep us positioned to achieve our year end goals around EPS, adjusted EPS and synergies despite a lower sales outlook.","And fifth, we are conducting a strategic evaluation of our credit portfolio, as we are always looking for ways to optimize our operating business model. Goldman Sachs, who has vast experience in this area, has been engaged as the company's advisor in this process. We will consider a full range of options as we evaluate our in-house and outsourced credit programs.","These options include but are not limited to optimizing credit offerings, optimizing allocated debt and equity capitalization of the credit portfolio, including potential incremental securitization, bringing all credit function in-house over the long-term, in sourcing some credit functions and outsourcing others and outsourcing all credit functions.","This evaluation is a top priority and as we move through this we will remain focused on executing our operational plans and driving profitable growth in our business.","Moving on to slide 4 and the financial highlights, I will leave the specific numbers and details for Michele. But the main headlines and accomplishments from a financial perspective related to our first quarter are as follows.","We delivered a good sales gain which included 2.5% comp increase. We delivered operating margin expansion and we leveraged both gross margin and SG&A, coupled with meaningful buyback which demonstrates our confidence in our business and the value we see in our shares.","This led to record first quarter EPS with a double-digit percentage increase, and we have sound cash and liquidity levels and we continue to possess a strong balance sheet with clean inventory and a responsible amount of debt.","Next, I'd like to discuss the main sales drivers of the first quarter. Like the fourth quarter results were led by our Ever Us which is our two-stone diamond ring collection. Ever Us is now testing line extensions in stores for the holiday season and some are already showing significant promise.","Bracelets and earrings as well as necklace with on-trend looks and innovative fastening systems were also very successful in the first quarter. Branded bridal also grew in Q1. The bridal business is a stable grower and insulates us from some of the volatility that traditional retailers face, brand such as Vera Wang Love and Neil Lane led the way.","Before I go into what is to come for the back half of our company, I want to take a few moments and make a few comments about our place in the jewelry industry. Our internal research shows definitively that consumers still find jewelry gift giving is one of the best ways to celebrate life and express love, and the numbers support this.","As shown on the left side of slide 6, with three and five year compounded annual sales growth rates in the teens and 8% growth for 10 years when figuring in the recession, Signet has been gaining and continues to gain market share profitably.","We consistently outperform the jewelry market and the total retail market and based on results to date we appear poised to deliver another year of industry out-performance.","Given the fragmented jewelry industry we believe we have many years of profitable market share gains ahead of us. Our brands, our scale and our people give us a sustained competitive advantage.","Signet is relatively Amazon proof as consumers have consistently shown a desire to touch jewelry and get educated by trusted and trained professionals before making a highly emotional purchase.","We are in a consolidating industry. Jewelry in the US is growing in dollars and declining in the number of doors and we have three of the most preeminent brands in this space. We know that there are growth opportunities and we also know how and where to get them which makes us even more attractive for investment.","So why invest in Signet? Firstly, we are the clear jewelry market leader with less than 8% of the total market share in the US and it's a highly fragmented and growing middle-market industry.","We are a square footage grower and will be for years and we are consolidating in a growing industry. During calendar 2018 after synergies are done and the Zales business model is ready and operating consistently we intend to grow Zales outside the mall.","We continue to deliver high quality financial results. Our financial flow-through is powerful with consistent comps and margin expansion accelerated by the Zale acquisition.","We believe this will lead to long-term EPS growth. Coupled with a solid balance sheet including prudent inventory management and our financials compare pretty well with most of retail.","We continue to have confidence that we will deliver on our annual earnings guidance. We have many competitive advantages that we're leveraging around our store teams, our marketing and our exciting merchandise programs.","But allow me to discuss just a few of our exciting, compelling merchandise line extensions and tests that should help us deliver on the year by making the bulk of their contribution in the fourth quarter.","As I mentioned earlier, we are successfully testing Ever Us line extensions, such as new diamond ring styles, necklaces, bracelets and earrings and in our experience beacon or industries trend that\u2019s driving type strategies like this tend to perform even better in year two versus year one.","We are also testing a line of Vera Wang fashion diamond jewelry and pearls and pearl jewelry to capitalize on her strong name and her design expertise. In all of our Jared stores we are resetting our Pandora presentation with beautiful new Pandora store in-stores. As a part of it we are selling a broader collection of Pandora products and fashion jewelry and we will support it with new TV advertising in creative in the fourth quarter.","We're rolling out the Chosen diamond program to all Jared stores, which shows the customer each stage of a diamond's journey from a rough diamond to finished jewelry. This is in total alignment with the Jared customer segment who tend to value this type of product and information more so than some of our other store banners. We are also designing brand-new TV created to support the Chosen also for the fourth quarter.","And lastly, we have new technology for our store teams in Kay and Jared for the fourth quarter that will enable our teams to interact with customers more intelligently based on their previous purchases and special life locations. We call it clienteling and we are very excited about its potential to drive sales and build relation with our customers and our team members.","Okay. Now back to Signet's overall investment merits as we continue down slide 7. Our integration is progressing as planned and delivering the synergies along the way. We are living up to the expectations that we've articulated.","Where Signet has pockets of underperformance, we have strategies. For example, at Jared merchandise, marketing and store operation plans will help us deliver a strong holiday season.","And finally, we have a thoughtful and balanced capital allocation policy that accounts for strategic investments, meaningful stock repurchases, dividend increases and a preservation of capital.","That concludes my prepared remarks. And now I'll turn it over to Michele.","Michele Santana","Thank you, Mark, good morning everyone. So we'll start with our first quarter sales performance. Signet's comps increased 2.4% and that's on top of a 3.6% comp increase in the prior year first quarter with all three of our divisions delivering positive comp sales. Total sales increased 3.2% and on a constant exchange basis total sales increased 3.9% for the quarter.","In looking at total sales and comp performance by operating segment let me share some additional color. In Sterling Jewelers total sales increased 3.8% to $980 million which included a comp increase of 2.3% on top of a prior year increase of 2.3%. Sales increases were driven principally by strong sales of select branded bridal jewelry, as well as fashion jewelry.","The Zale jewelry operating segment's total sales increased by 2.3% to $381 million and 3.2% on a constant currency exchange basis. On a geography basis our Zale US sales increased 3.7% and comps increased 2.4% and that's on top of a 5.4% increase in the prior year.","Our Canadian total sales declined 6.2% but increased 0.2% on a constant currency basis with comp sales decline of 0.6%. Canada sales continue to be impacted primarily by the Western region of Canada due to the struggling energy industry. Across stores sales were driven primarily by diamond fashion jewelry and branded bridal.","Our Piercing Pagoda total sales increased 7.5% to $69 million with comp sales of 5.6% on top of 6.1% last year. Sales increases were driven primarily by gold chains and diamond jewelry.","In the UK our total sales decreased 1.7% to $144 million, but increased 4% at constant currency rates. Comp sales grew 3.4% and that's on top of a 6.2% comp increase in the prior year. Diamond jewelry and prestige watches were the primary drivers of sales increases in the UK. So moving on from sales, we will look at Signet's consolidated Q1 performance and then we'll turn and we'll look at Signet's adjusted results.","So turning to slide 9, the table provides the reconciliation of Signet's adjusted results to consolidated results. And we're continuing to present this reconciliation in fiscal year 2017 to reflect the impacts of purchase accounting, as well as severance and IT implementation expenses associated with our global systems that will drive future synergies.","The difference between Signet and adjusted Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and integration costs. So starting in the lower left portion of the slide, on a GAAP basis EPS was $1.87 per share and that's up 26.4% over last year.","In the next column over, purchase accounting adjustments were worth $0.04 of EPS dilution and this was driven primarily by deferred revenue adjustments related to acquisition accounting.","The next column over reflects our integration cost and as I had just mentioned relate to severance that's associated with our organizational design changes and consulting costs related to information technology implementations. Integration costs were also responsible for $0.04 of EPS dilution.","So on an adjusted Signet basis on the far right column, by adding back the $0.08 with adjustments adjusted EPS was $1.95, an increase of 20.4% over last year.","So now looking below our sales line at Signet's adjusted P&L results. Our adjusted gross margin was $604.4 million or 38.2% of adjusted sales and that's up 40 basis points due primarily to the Zale division and a variety of synergies such as sourcing, discount controls and vendor turns, as well as some favorability in commodity cost and leverage on store occupancy.","Sterling Jewelers gross margin increased by 20 basis points due primarily to commodity cost. The Zale division's adjusted gross margin rate increased 90 basis points, as synergies favorably affected many areas including our merchandise margins, distribution cost and store operating cost.","Our UK gross margin decreased 30 basis points, driven principally by lower sales and merchandise margin deleverage as a result of currency exchange rates.","Adjusted SG&A was $456.1 million or 28.8% of adjusted sales and that compares to $451 million or 29.3% of adjusted sales in the prior year. The 50 basis points of leverage was due primarily to lower store and corporate payroll expenses associated with our organizational realignment, as well as lower advertising expenses.","This was offset in part by information technology expenses related to Signet's IT global implementation. Other operating income was $74.3 million or 4.7% of sales. This increase of $10.8 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances.","Adjusted operating income was $222.6 million and increased 14.7% over prior year first quarter. Our adjusted operating margin rate was 14.1% of sales. Now this 150 basis point expansion over prior year was driven primarily by the increase in sales, as well as gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. Adjusted EPS was $1.95 which compares to $1.62 last year, an increase of 20.4% driven principally by our stronger business performance.","So now let's move on to balance sheet and we'll take a look at our inventory. Our strong first quarter end inventory position reflects the success of our continued focus on inventory optimization.","Net inventory ended the period at about $2.5 billion, an increase of just 1% compared to our sales growth of 3.2%. This relationship to sales was driven by solid inventory management across virtually all of our product categories, divisions and locations but most notably in branded bridal.","We increased Zale inventory turn by reducing unproductive inventory, rightsizing store level inventory closer to Kay averages and improving clearance inventory management. As we move through Q2 our inventory levels and merchandise assortment for fiscal 2017 are very well positioned.","So now we'll turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Our first quarter credit sales were $605.1 million, compared to $573.1 million in the prior-year quarter, reflecting an increase of 5.6% which compares to a increase of 9.2% in the prior year. The higher credit sales was driven primarily by growth in bridal and Ever Us, both with higher average transaction value.","The average monthly payment collection rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was 12.3% compared to 12.6% last year. Our monthly collection rate is calculated as cash payment receipt divided by beginning accounts receivable.","The change in rate over prior year is due primarily to merchandise mix as bridal, especially higher priced branded bridal increases this creates a higher average initial balance.","Now by design the minimum payment rate declines as the price point of the merchandise increases. Bridal has a higher average credit sale. Therefore, the repayment period is slightly longer and cash collected as a percentage of the receivable declined slightly.","The combination of growth and credit sales and collection rate led to an increase of 11% in our net accounts receivable compared to an increase of 14.7% in net receivables in the prior year quarter. Our quarter ended net accounts receivable increased to $1.65 billion compared to $1.49 billion last year.","Interest income from finance charges which makes up virtually all of the other operating line on our income statement was $72.8 million, compared to $64.4 million last year. The increase of $8.4 million was due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables base.","Our net bad debt was $33.6 million compared to $28.1 million last year. The increase of $5.5 million was driven by our higher receivable balances, but more specifically our bad debt provisioning establishes a 3% reserve at origination of the receivables based on historical experience.","The higher our credit sales, meaning the more new volume in accounts receivable, the greater the amount contributes to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Now the net impact of bad debt in finance income generated operating profit of $39.2 million and that's compared to $36.3 million in the prior year.","So looking at some of the key Sterling division allowance for doubtful accounts metrics, our total valuation allowance as a percent of gross receivables was 6.6% in the first quarter. This was up 10 basis points from prior year and down 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter.","But what's most important is that as we expected we made more sequential improvement in Q1 of this year than we did in last year. So why is that? The impact of improved collection execution and credit marketing techniques that we began late last year are making more than just seasonal progress. We improved 40 basis points Q4 to Q1 versus 30 basis points over the same period prior year.","Now the same trend was true for our non-performing portion of our receivables as a percent of the gross receivables. At 3.6% this was also up 10 basis points from prior year and down 40 basis points quarter over quarter.","Again the sequential trend of non-performing loans was better at 40 basis points down versus 30 basis points down in the prior-year period. Building off the Q4 trends that we had discussed on our year end earnings call in March, we continue to see the same improvements in trends in Q1 and we anticipate that these trends broadly speaking will hold true for the remainder of the year.","So moving on to our capital allocation, I want to reiterate our priorities for capital structure and our capital allocation strategy that we had first introduced 14 months ago. We have a strong balance sheet and we have also extended our ADS agreement for an additional year.","The strength in our balance sheet and flexibility allows us to invest in or business, execute our strategic priorities and return excess cash to shareholders all while ensuring adequate liquidity.","Our investment-grade ratings remain important to us because long-term we may return to the debt markets. Our adjusted leverage ratio target is to be at or below 3.5 times and we had ended fiscal 2016 at 3.7 times.","As our EBITDA grows in fiscal 2017 we anticipate that we will have additional leverage capacity and we are actively evaluating use of this capacity under the tenet of our capital allocation policy.","We plan to distribute 70% to 80% of our annual free cash flow in the form of stock repurchases and or dividends assuming no other strategic use of capital. In recent years we have been able to grow both dividends and share repurchases.","Our share repurchase authorization is considerably higher now given the recently announced $750 million buyback authorization to go along with what was already left on the previous program. At the end of the quarter we had $761 million authorized after our $125 million of Q1 share repurchases.","So now we will move on to our financial guidance. Signet's second quarter comparable-store sales are expected to increase 1% to 2% which factors in our quarter-to-date performance and also assumes that the environment remains somewhat muted. Second-quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.49 to $1.54.","For fiscal 2017 we anticipate comps of 2% to 3.5% and adjusted EPS of $8.25 to $8.55. The comp range has been reduced 100 basis points from our March guidance and we all see the trends out there and with a softer consumer environment we believe it is appropriate that we proactively reset our comp guidance.","With that said, we continue to believe that the $8.25 to $8.55 EPS rate is achievable for the following reasons. First, and just as a reminder, March was the first time we had issued full year guidance and we were just out of the gate into our new fiscal year and appropriately so we had guided to an earnings range that gave us room to achieve earnings under various scenarios.","Second, we are planning for the strong earnings flow through to come about through both gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. We anticipate expanding our gross margin rate through higher sales and realization of synergies and the SG&A leverage will flow due to marketing and organizational design deficiencies, as well as additional expense letters within management's control.","We proved this capability in Q1 where we were able to deliver at the high end of the EPS rate despite lower sales from the guidance and as a result we remain confident in our ability to deliver our EPS guidance.","Now as to other aspects of our guidance, our annual effective tax rate is anticipated to be 27% to 28%. Under the recent U.S. Treasury and IRS proposed regulations tax rebate of related party debt and the tax deductibility of interest expense are limited to only certain related party transactions.","Signet's related party financing arrangements, which stems primarily from the Zale acquisition are grandfathered under the proposal and there is no impact on our short to medium-term forecasted effective tax rate.","Capital expenditure guidance for the full year is $315 million to $365 million, driven by a combination of new stores, store remodels, information technology and facilities expenditures.","Net selling square footage is projected to grow 3% to 3.5% with most of Signet's new square footage growth is slated for real estate venues other than enclosed malls. We are also reaffirming the multi-year synergy guidance which we increased February 29.","In fiscal 2017 we intend to deliver $158 million to $175 million cumulatively. That means the $60 million we realized last year, plus another $98 million to $150 million this fiscal year. Then by the end of fiscal 2018, we expect to deliver $225 million to $250 million of cumulative synergies.","So in closing, we're pleased with our earnings performance and our relative financial results to date.","And with that I will turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark Light","Thank you, Michele. To sum up we had a good quarter: record EPS, operating margin expansion, excellent inventory management, solid sales and profitable market share growth. I want to sincerely thank and congratulate all the Signet team members for all their hard work and accomplishments.","And with that we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rick Patel from Stephens. Your line is open.","Rick Patel","Thank you and good morning everyone.","Mark Light","Good morning, Rick.","Rick Patel","Can you help us think about the decline in traffic? I know it's not a new development, but is this something that is going on across the whole jewelry industry, and if so what does it say about customer shopping habits?","Since bridal is doing well, I guess is there some level of fatigue out there to buy fashion jewelry or is competition just getting a little bit tougher for certain categories? Just some help on thinking about that.","Mark Light","Thanks, Rick. Decline in retail traffic, we're seeing a decline as everybody else is seeing a decline that we saw in the first quarter. We do have a third party company that tracks the traffic in the malls and it is showing that retail traffic as a whole was down for the first quarter.","We have some traffic counters in our Jared stores, some in our Kay stores and we're seeing declines not as much as you are seeing with some of the third-party providers out there.","But to your point, bridal is our stable type of business where it is a premeditated purchase and people are coming into our stores thinking about bridal and shopping beforehand. So we don't believe we're as affected by retail traffic in jewelry, as our retail competitors. But there is an effect, obviously, if there is less people in the malls.","And more so like you said for gift giving. Now gift giving is also premeditated purchase but we're seeing less traffic in the malls right now, and overall retail traffic is down. But we still think the consumer is vibrant out there and we are seeing it in our own sales that you are seeing that we had a very respectable comp increase as it relates compared to the rest of the retail industry world.","Rick Patel","Thank you, Mark. And just a question also on the department store space and the competition there. Macy's in particular recently talked about taking a more aggressive approach with fine jewelry and engagement.","Have you seen an impact of this on your business and can you touch upon I guess what you see as the biggest differentiators between your business and what department stores would have competitively?","Mark Light","Sure. We are well aware of Macy's test, we were aware of it last year, we shopped the stores that we believe are being tested, we shopped them both from an inventory assortment and from a sales approach and a customer service perspective. And we believe we have tremendous competitive advantage against all of our competitors including Macy's and other department stores.","When you just look at our assortment whether it be in gift-giving products and fine jewelry or more importantly in engagement and bridal category our assortment is far beyond anybody else out there.","And in this category, as I stated, the customer engagement is critical and the experience that they have in the stores is critical. We believe that our team members out in our stores are better trained and better equipped to educate our customers on this critical emotional purchase and educate our customers on qualities of diamonds and understanding their needs.","So our competitive advantage are we believe we have a better assortment, we believe we understand diamond fashion jewelry and diamond engagement much better and we believe we have much better trained and experienced salespeople to take care of that specific jewelry customer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Oliver Chen","Thanks, congrats on really awesome results in a really tough retail tape. So Michele I want to ask you the reaffirmance of guidance, the details are really helpful. On the gross margin and SG&A side what are the main drivers that are enabling you to - for that to offset some of the reality of the comp?","Also, Mark, the details on the credit portfolio are helpful. Could you brief us on your thoughts on timing in terms of how this decision may unfold?","And also are there drawbacks to outsourcing the credit portfolio just because of your very integrated selling process and if there's any learnings that you've had with Zale and ADS? It sounds like you are still encouraged by that relationship, that would be helpful? Thank you.","Michele Santana","Thanks, Oliver. So let me start with your question in terms of the gross margin and SG&A and some of the primary drivers that we're very much focused on. So first, it does start back with the synergies and really pushing the synergies through gross margin both SG&A.","I mentioned on the call on the gross margin what we're really starting to flow through and we continue to expect to have opportunities as we move into the year on the synergy front really relate to our discounting controls that we put in place. There's repairs, our vendor terms.","We did actually move from in-sourcing our special events to outsourcing that. That has had a favorable impact on our gross margin. So there's a lot related to synergies that we see flowing through there and in addition there's still a little bit of favorability we're getting on the commodity cost front that's flowing through gross margin.","On the SG&A side, on the synergy front we did a lot of work and we talked about this during the fourth quarter where we had accelerated some of the work around our organizational design efficiencies.","And so we're starting to see those benefits. We will continue to see the benefits flowing through related to that in terms of payroll savings. We also have been really looking at optimizing our labor scheduling as it relates to our store payroll. So we continue to expect to see favorability flowing through that in the year leveraging our SG&A.","And then more importantly as I was referencing, there's additional expense levers that management really does have control over. And although we will want to continue to preserve our more customer facing expenses, those expenses such as our advertising, line item, et cetera, for those that are less directly customer facing, whether it's our travels, our supplies, our support center, those are the ones that we are really able to tighten our belt and take a more disciplined approach to give up us the confidence that we will be able to hit our EPS guidance.","Mark Light","And Oliver, in reference to your credit question I'm going to be kind of giving you a holistic answer and answer your three questions about timing and drawbacks and learnings from Zales.","And I want to start off with stating, and I just need to start off because we said in the announcement, that our credit metrics in our credit portfolio are strong. As we said our credit metrics are improving sequentially and within our expectations and all we fought for and involved in our earnings guidance both on a quarterly basis and on an annual basis. So our credit metrics are strong.","To answer your questions, the reason why we're doing this credit project, your point is, yes, we have had some good experience with ADS. We've had a full quarter now under our belt where ADS has been managing our entire credit portfolio for Zales from January through now we're having some good experiences and we're learning more.","And at Signet we're an evolving company. We're always looking for ways to better improve our business part of our business. That being said, we always feel there's ways of us getting smarter and understanding more about our business and we've also seen other major retailers out there.","And I'm sure a lot of you know of them, that have carried internal receivables and have sold their receivables and have done work with receivables of recent and we've just understand there is an evolution going on and we want to make sure that we're on top of it.","We're a business that is constantly looking for ways to improve ourselves. Actually one of our mission statements is that we're always looking to continuously improve. So we look at every facet of our business on a regular basis to make sure that we're continuously improving how we can enhance our business for our operations and for our shareholders. And credit is no different. We've done major credit analysis in the past.","So as we mentioned, as I mentioned in our remarks, Oliver, possible outcomes could be outsourcing of all of our credit functions, possible outcomes could be some in-housing of our credit functions, some would be outsourced. Other things that we will be analyzing is the ways of optimizing our debt structures on our accounts receivables.","Can we optimize our credit offerings? We're looking at variations of options to make sure that we're improving our ability to do sales, maximizing our profitability and enhancing our business model.","And as far as timing goes Oliver, it's a top priority for us. We will be thoughtful though, and we will be diligent about the work but we are going to take time to be very thoughtful. And we are working real-time right now with Goldman Sachs on this who has a lot of experience in this world and has done a lot of this type of work with other retailers.","So that's why we're comfortable sharing with you today. But we're not going to share a timeline with you because we want to do this thoughtfully and methodically, but we will keep you up to date when appropriate.","Oliver Chen","Okay. Just a quick follow-up, that's really helpful. You've given really helpful detail and more detail over time regarding your credit portfolio. Some investors are asking a lot about accounts receivable aging and the FICO score distribution and the reality of using the recency accounting methodology.","Could you brief us on how you're feeling about those topics in terms of what you're seeing in your portfolio? It's an accounting method that you've used throughout many years. So I understand that it's very integrated in your processes?","Michele Santana","Yes, thanks Oliver. So real quick on that. We talked at quite length on the last call that at the end of the day, regardless of recency or contractual, whatever method you are on, the financial results are going to yield the same answer. The provision will be the same, our bad debt expense will be the same.","But to that point, the reason why we use our recency is one, we have done it since the beginning of time, and it really has worked well for us over the years with the type of lending that we do, jewelry lending that emotional connection and it does optimize our collections for us.","And so with the use of the recency it does help us to engage with the borrower, start collecting quicker. It gives the customer some flexibility based on the disciplined criteria that we had outlined of our recency aging, what a customer has to remit to stay current. It leaves that customer in good standing if they are having maybe a challenging month where they can't remit a full payment.","And that psychology and that flexibility of working with that customer puts that customer first, and that at the end of the day really drives maximization and optimization of our collection effort. Then as I said, importantly, the financial results will be the same.","Now we'll continue and when you see the 10-Q that we plan to file within the next week or so in the footnote you'll see the same type of a breakdown of our aging. So we've continued to provide that, the 30 day, 60, et cetera and 90 days.","In terms of FICO scores that will be an annual disclosure for us. But what I can tell you is the FICO scores are broadly in the same range as what we saw in Q4 which everybody would expect that you're not going to have major shift quarter-to-quarter on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong from CL King & Associates. Your line is open.","Bill Armstrong","Good morning, everyone. Question on\u2026","Mark Light","Morning.","Bill Armstrong","Good morning, Piercing Pagoda, so that's the division that arguably would be the most vulnerable to changes in mall traffic, given its locations within the hallway and the impulse nature of the purchase. That was actually the best performing division in terms of comp in the quarter.","So I was wondering if you could maybe review for us what's going on in Pagoda and how is that division performs so strongly in such a weak environment?","Mark Light","Sure, thank you, Bill. Great observation. First of all, it always starts off with people, and we have a great leader who is running our Piercing Pagoda business named Jaime Singleton, and we have very motivated team members at Piercing Pagoda, and they feel great about the business and investments we are making in the business.","Specifically what's helping our cause, if you look at the release, the average price is up dramatically in Piercing Pagoda. And what the team has done in Piercing is they have invested more in 14 karat gold, more in diamonds.","So what they are doing - and we are training our people to be able to be comfortable selling at Piercing Pagoda 14 karat gold and diamonds and they are motivated and excited about the business.","So we're getting benefit in Piercing Pagoda, even there's less traffic in the mall, we are getting the benefits similar to what's happening in our mall stores is that we are increasing our average sale dramatically. And a lot of that again is due to increased assortments in 14 karat gold and diamond jewelry and increased training on how to sell that product.","Bill Armstrong","Okay. Great, thanks. And you gave some industry data in your slide presentation, the industry lost a net 700 jewelers. Is that individual stores and are you seeing kind of regional chains going down or are these more kind of individual mom and pop type of stores do you think are exiting the market?","Mark Light","Bill, year-on-year there is an increase in the decline of jewelry store doors closing from 2014 to 2015. I believe it was about 100 basis points, but it was a big decline. And the vast majority of them are independent stores that are closing doors.","And there is a lot of reasons for that whether it be lack of profitability, lack of a successor to turn the store over to. But the facts are the facts that the jewelry store doors are closing at a faster rate in 2015 than they did in 2014.","Michele Santana","Let me just add to that, I mean that is one of the advantages whenever you are going through a somewhat softer environment given that we are so fragmented with a lot of these independent small mom and pops that does generally put pressure on those doors and you start to see an up-tick in those store closures.","So we are probably one of the few retailers that actually benefit with gaining profitable market share gains in these type of environments.","Mark Light","And just to pile on to Michele's point, Bill, is a good reason as why we stated that we're expanding our stores more so outside the malls because a lot, the vast majority of jewelry sold in this industry in this country for certain is done outside the mall.","And so we see opportunity to continue to grow Kay from those doors that we're closing primarily outside the mall and as we said after the end of 2017 an opportunity to start opening Zales stores outside the malls.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel from Nomura Securities. Your line is open.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. Hey guys, good morning, nice consistency.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Simeon Siegel","So just recognizing the synergy this year are going to be primarily expense savings related, can you talk to the ongoing opportunity to narrow the sales productivity gap, what should that do for the comp trajectory there?","And then in light of what's looks like on ongoing shift to higher ticket items, you specifically called out a shift from Charmed Memories, can you just talk about that Jared Pandora rollout and any thoughts or expectations there? Thanks.","Mark Light","Yes, the Zale productivity, there's a lot of initiatives out there and we still feel very strong and have built good increase for Zales going forward. We continue to see benefits from our cross selling of brands. We continue to see tremendous benefits and we think there's going to be a huge benefit to Zales is having our repair business, our repair business being internal, not being done by third-party contractors which will help the top line not only in the repair business but ultimately you take care of our customer. You have a new customer for life and you take care of that customer.","So we have a lot of areas of business that are going to increase the top line. But we are focusing right now on making sure that we get the model in place and we get the appropriate level of SG&A in line for that business model.","So we do see good opportunities to continue to grow Zales going forward. And if you look at the comps for the Zale business itself in this past first quarter it was up over 3.5% which is better than most of retail. So we still feel really good about the opportunities for Zales on the sales line.","As far as the average sales in Pandora, we did see some beads slowing down but not in our Pandora business. We have a big bead business, Pandora is just in our Jared stores and we're very happy and excited about our Pandora partnership.","As we said we have these new store in stores, it will take us see year to roll them out but we will have all the new stores, our new stores, the Pandora stores in our Jared of stores by November 1.","Right now we just completed about 50 doors and initial - it's early but initial sales results are very good to us. So we see great opportunities with Pandora in increasing our partnership with Pandora. And a big benefit of the Pandora partnership we have is not just selling more beads.","But Pandora has been doing a great job of designing new jewelry products at lower price points that we really haven't done a great job with in the past and have not had a good inventory assortment of the Pandora jewelry product. And we're very excited about that opportunity for new business in our Jared stores this fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Stein from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Jeff Stein","Hey, good morning guys. Michele, a question for you with regard to ADS, I'm curious what the approval rates, what kind of approval rates you've seen on the ADS credit metrics relative to your in-house credit? And then I've got a couple of follow-ups.","Michele Santana","Yes, so we're really excited with partnering with ADS and this is really the first full quarter that we've had them in play. Overall what we've seen with our Zale credit penetration rate for Q1 it's about 48%, now that's inclusive with primary with ADS, as well as our in-house second look that we're doing. But that 48% penetration rate compares to about 41% last year. And that really - that increase in rate is really driven by the primary lending that ADS is doing.","And so what we're seeing and what we expected to see as part of the benefits with ADS, is it's driven by both a higher application and higher credit lines with ADS. And first, when you think about the change over to ADS there was a re-launch of the credit cards to customers, so one, you generally get that drives customers back into the stores.","In addition, we did some field training relating to the ADS rollout. I'd also say that when we think about the credit value proposition related to ADS it really is more appealing than traditionally what we've had as it allows for lower minimum purchases that are required.","And then also the application process, it is much more quicker and easier for that applicant. Previously it was a paper application where now we've utilized technology, hand the drivers license, punch in data and then they are off to the races with ADS.","And then I would also lead to that when we think about the benefit of ADS in that relationship it is the reduced or the lower expenses associated with that which is flowing through our P&L.","Jeff Stein","Perfect. And a question on the bump that you may have received from extended service plans in first quarter both from a comp store standpoint and an earnings per share standpoint since I don't think you had anniversaried that change until Q2.","Michele Santana","Yes, you are correct, Jeff. We will anniversary that in Q2. So we did see the impact in Q1 and on a consolidated basis it was about 70 bps to comps and about $0.07 or so to EPS.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line f Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Ike Boruchow","Hey, everyone, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess for Michele, I'm just curious do you have data on your credit customer about what percent of credit customers would be fine buying something without that option, but maybe just like the 12month interest-free or something like that versus the ones that would actually need the in-house financing arm to buy his or her item?","And then just a follow-up to that I guess Mark, when you guys guided I think Valentine's Day was already over, I assume that's a big part of the quarter. So I'm just kind of curious can you comment on April? It was tough for most of retail, it seems like it was probably tough for you guys. I'm just curious about how the quarter maybe played out? Thanks a lot.","Michele Santana","Good morning, Ike. So in terms of your question with the data that we have with our customers and I think the question was would they use another form if we didn't have a credit, we have a lot of information on our customers and we look at the data in a lot of ways.","That's one that becomes a little bit difficult to track if we didn't have it would the customer still make that purchase. It really is challenging to be able to quantify that. But it is information that we're always looking at very closely to understand the benefit and the competitive advantage of the credit offering.","Mark Light","And Ike, how are you. In reference to your question about our guidance and Valentine's Day to your point you're right, we guided to have a 3% to 4% and we put that guidance out there on March 26. We had Valentine's Day under our belt.","That being said, we had April ahead of us which leads up into obviously some critical shopping for Mother's Day and there was a slowdown in April. If you just look at what we have accomplished compared to what our guidance was at the time we gave the guidance there is no doubt that there is a slowdown in April that we experienced like all of retail. We've all been exposed to all the retail numbers out there for the first quarter. So our numbers slowed down but were better than most.","That being said, going into May we're seeing a similar level to May, not better, not worse, we're seeing similar levels. So the guidance that we're giving you for Q2 is assuming that things don't get better and things don't get worse from an economic environment basis.","But even though you didn't ask I want to say to you that we still feel very strongly about our earnings guidance for the year and we believe that we have a great opportunity in the second half, as I stated, we have a lot of initiatives - we have more initiatives this year than we even had last year, as I mentioned with the extension of Ever Us, as I mentioned with the Chosen diamond for Jared that tested wonderfully.","We're very excited about the Pandora store-in-stores. We're very excited about the Vera Wang extension going into diamond jewelry and pearl jewelry. And we're very excited about this new technology that we're enabling our people in our stores to really be more sophisticated and more knowledgeable about their customers past experience and what they bought and what they can go buy in the future to help them communicate better with our customers.","So, yes, we saw slowdown in April, but we're still outperforming most of retail and we still feel very bullish assuming the economy stays stable that we're going to have a very good second half and fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dorothy Lakner from Topeka Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Dorothy Lakner","Thanks, good morning everyone. Just wanted to follow-up on some of those things, Mark, that you were just talking about. I wondered if you could provide a little bit more color on this new technology, the clienteling kind of technology and when the training is going to occur. So when we should start to see some benefits, obviously for holiday, but just wondered on the timing.","And then also just the timing of the Vera Wang fashion introductions, the diamonds and pearls? And then just on Ever Us, obviously a big success story for you all. I'm wondering if you are seeing any changes in the customer base for that.","I know you had seen a broader customer acceptance for that product than you had expected, sort of different types of clients than you expected. I wondered if that's changed any as we go into the rest of this year? Thanks.","Mark Light","Thank you, Dorothy. First a little bit more color on the technology I was referring to, so we have some great partnerships that we're working with some software technology companies like salesforce and Rosetta that's working with us on this project we're calling clienteling.","And just to give you this spot, a good jewelry sales consultant has a book and they will talk, they will have it and they'll keep it manually now to understand all of their customers what they bought in the past, what are their key special occasions and their lifetime moments, whether it be birthdays or their loved ones or anniversaries or just graduation gifts and that type of things, and all that has been done manually in the past.","We're going to be able now to have and give our associates real time information through their iPad and they can understand what their customers have bought in the past, what birthdays are coming up, how to communicate with them more intelligently.","We will also be able to use this technology for CRM. So we think there is just vast opportunities of what we can get incremental benefits and sales from this new technology. To your point, we are training up our people at our Jared and our Kay stores and we will start in August.","We will have a big training conference at our leadership conference in October and for Jared and Kay they will be fully ready for this aspect of this new technology for the fourth quarter. And we think there's a good opportunity to increase our sales and get incremental sales with just communicating more effectively with our customers.","As far as Vera Wang and the extension of jewelry, we just think it's a great opportunity. Vera as I said is a tremendous designer and she's got such credibility in the bridal area and she has a great eye.","So she's been designing some beautiful jewelry, pearl jewelry, pearls and diamond jewelry for our business. And so far it's testing well, and we don't want to say for certain because we are still in the testing zone, but if the tests continue to be successful we may see some major extensions of Vera Wang jewelry roll out potentially in our sales doors for the fourth quarter, but we'll keep you up to speed on that.","As far as Ever Us goes, as you said, Dorothy, it's a tremendous success story for us and having an item and a trend that we have created. And we just - this has just continued to grow for us and the test that we're starting to see and necklaces, we see opportunities potentially in other parts of jewelry, different ring styles are really going well and we don't see a slowdown.","As I said in my prepared remarks from our experience these type of trend changing or beacon type strategies from our experience actually gain momentum because as well as it did for us last year and into this year it's still a small, small portion of customers out there that have really have an understanding of what Ever Us is all about.","So we believe there's still tremendous upside for the Ever Us collection going into the fourth quarter and into the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Janet Kloppenburg from JJK Research. Your line is open.","Janet Kloppenburg","Hi, everybody. Congrats on a good quarter, nice showing.","Michele Santana","Thanks, Janet.","Janet Kloppenburg","Mark, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your outlook for the fashion jewelry component. It feels like there's a lot of newness that you've created on the bridal site, both Ever Us and Vera, and I'm just wondering if you're finding it more competitive on the fashion side?","And if you could also help me to understand what's going on in the Jared business a little bit more. I know you're transitioning maybe the promotional strategy there and the pricing strategy. But if you could elaborate a little bit that would help a lot? Thank you.","Mark Light","Sure, thank you, Janet. The fashion outlook, the fashion business is a business that we have to stay on top of and it's not you got to continually investigate and innovate with new opportunities and new styles like we did with Ever Us.","And we have a lot of exciting things in the pipeline. I touched on several of them. One is Pandora is all about fashion. Pandora jewelry is all about fashion. When you think about Vera Wang designs and what we're going to do is all about fashion.","So we have a lot in the works and that we're testing in the pipeline. I was just sharing some for competitive reasons that we're always looking to be innovative and look for new ways of continuing to test new things in fashion.","It gives me an opportunity to say something broader. For us to continually gain market share in the jewelry industry over the last 5, 10 and 20 years and for us to continue going forward we as a company have got to constantly be innovative. We've got to consistently have new ideas in our pipeline not only as it relates to fashion which is critical, but all facets of our business.","So we are continually, that's why we open the design center and that's why our design centers are continually looking for new ways and looking at fashion trends to continually test and look for new ways, of innovative ways to sell fashion and gift-giving products to our customers. So we believed we have a good, healthy pipeline in fashion.","As far as the Jared business goes, Janet, we have said that we believe, firmly we believe that even though Jared's comps were down in the first quarter and their total sales were up and we believe we are gaining profitable market share in the jewelry industry, we believe that firmly because Jared is growing in a healthy, profitable way.","That being said, we have made some enhancements and refinements to the Jared model. We've have talked about how we have changed some of the selling tactics that we have used.","We have talked about how we are changing some of the assortment that we are having. We are getting more involved in some fashion areas. We are getting more involved with some lower price point fashion products. We are getting more involved with designers like Vera Wang.","We've also talked about how we are continually looking for ways to enhance our selling coverage and how we sell to the Jared customer and that Jared customer we've learned that our segmentation analysis is they are looking for a little bit more promotions, they are looking for some sales every once in a while.","So we are testing that also, and we're also testing radio advertising in certain markets because continuity of radio is a strong thing and we are selling products in Jared and engagement rings with Jared's 12 months a year, not just in the 12 weeks that we advertise on TV.","So we are actually very bullish on our Jared business. We believe that we've a lot of good things going on in Jared and they are in a transition stage where we are changing their inventory up a little bit, we're continuing to change the selling tactics that we have and we're still working on testing some new bounce-back programs and coupons and promotions.","So, again, we feel very bullish about how Jared is going to perform in the fourth quarter, as long with the economy is consistent and operating consistently.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Thanks, good morning everyone.","Michele Santana","Good morning.","Mark Light","Good morning.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","I wanted to clarify Mark, just quickly a comment you made before about the end to first quarter and beginning of second quarter. The start to the second quarter, are you saying that the momentum you are seeing to start the quarter is consistent with your 2Q guidance or are you embedding some degree of acceleration in the way it feels like you are embedding some degree of acceleration in the back half of the year? That's my first clarification.","And secondly, as you think about the strategic review of the credit book you talked about basically every kind of scenario that could be determined from this outcome. I was curious Mark, as you think about what the priorities are for the outcome is it shareholder returns, is it unlocking value?","And as you think about now, I know that this is your initial strategic review with an outside party, but you've been conducting some review internally and you do have this partnership with ADS now a good quarter under your belt.","Is there a scenario you believe where you could have a third party run the credit portfolio and not have to change your current lending practices or is it two very different? Thanks very much.","Mark Light","Okay. First answer your first question, Lindsay, what I was saying is that April, the decline after we announced and the decline it was declining as the rest of retail was and May was at a similar levels to April. So that was built into our first-quarter \u2013 second quarter guidance of being up 1% to 2%.","And so what we're saying is that our April decline it's not decelerating, it is not accelerating, it's similar to what's happened in April is what is happening in May. That was that is that clear for you Lindsay?","Lindsay Drucker Mann","So you are in order to get to an up 1% to 2% business would have to accelerate from here?","Mark Light","We believe that we feel comfortable in our guidance of 1% to 2% that we can deliver that sales guidance for the second quarter.","Michele Santana","Yes, I think with what we've seen as Mark said with May being very similar to what we had observed in April and we've incorporated that into the guidance that it's a very balanced view in terms of balancing both the upside, downside risk to achieve a 1% to 2% comp. So we feel good with that comp guidance.","Mark Light","And your question about our priority as it relates to the credit review, and Lindsay you are not going to like this answer, but shareholder value and operating profit are both hand-in-hand.","So it's about both, and when we look at this we are going to look at it holistically. What options do we have, what alternatives do we have that can help enhance, potentially enhance the profitability and or the shareholder value, we believe they go hand-in-hand.","So are there opportunities for third parties, can there be, that's what the analysis is all about. We are looking to see what the opportunity is out there. And we have to take a deeper dive and we need time to make those determinations.","But to be confident in understanding what we're going to do is make the right decision for our business model to make the right decision that is right for our shareholders and what is right for the company as a whole and our customers.","And we have to take all those elements into our decision making process. And we'll keep you up to speed, Lindsay. We just wanted to announce to everybody because we did hire Goldman Sachs who has a lot of experience.","And to do this thorough analysis we will be talking to different type of constituents to get this analysis done. And we wanted to make you and everybody else aware that we are doing that now, but we will keep you up to speed once we have more information and talk more intelligently with more data.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we are out of time for our formal Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Light.","Mark Light","Thank you. I'm trying to find my date here. Okay, thank you for taking part in this call. I wanted to let you all know that our next scheduled call is at August 25 when we review our second-quarter earnings. Thanks again to all of you and good-bye.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this call is being recorded today, January 07, 2016 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.","I would now like to turn the meeting over to your host for today\u2019s call, James Grant, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, James.","James Grant","Good morning and welcome to our holiday season sales call. On our call today are Mark Light, CEO and Michele Santana, CFO. The presentation deck we will be referencing is available under the Investors section of our website, signetjewelers.com.","During today\u2019s presentation, we will in places discuss Signet\u2019s business outlook and make certain forward-looking statements. Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number for risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. We urge you to read the risk factors, cautionary language and other disclosures in the Annual Report on Form 10-K that was filed March 26, 2015, with the SEC. We also draw your attention to Slide Number 2 in today\u2019s presentation for additional information about forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures.","I will now turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Light","Thanks James and happy New Year to everyone.","We're extremely pleased with our holiday season operating performance and there are ample key messages that I would like you to take away from today's release and presentation.","First Signet delivered an increased income of 4.9%, which is an increase of -- and an increase of total sales of 5%. This was driven -- these results were driven by results across the portfolio of our national store brands.","Second, these excellent sales were driven by all of our company-specific strategic initiatives that we laid the groundwork for months in advance. For example, our superior customer service that was executed by the best team in the jewelry industry, our exciting new product launches as well as continued success of existing collections and improved advertising trade and the use of increased advertising ways.","The third key takeaway is that our operating expenses flowed in line with our expectations, which coupled with strong sales led us to margin improvement and the narrowing of our earnings guidance towards the higher end; and fourth, our success was broad-based.","We run a powerful global portfolio in jewelry retailing and it showed this holiday season. We succeeded in diverse geographies, different selling channels, various product categories and multiple store banners.","I'll now discuss the sales drivers of the holiday season with a little more specific color on the results. We saw strong performances in a number of fashion diamond and bridal collections throughout the selling channels and geographies.","The new Ever Us Collection did extremely well for us. I'll devote more time to that in just a few moments.","Diamond earrings continue to have tremendous momentum and certain other fashion collections were strong, especially jewelry for the wrist including select bracelets, charms and watches.","Bridal brands such as Vera Wang Love, Neil Lane, Tolkowsky and the Forever Diamond, which is sold exclusively in our 8 Zales stores performed well also.","Marketing initiatives during the holiday season did well; we believe especially our new television advertising creative. We applied learnings from our customer segmentation studies and we increased our advertising ways.","Our holiday sales results were solid across most of our global store portfolio and especially strong in U.S. malls. Signet continues to deliver tremendous success inside the mall driven by Kay, Zales and Piercing Pagoda.","Piercing Pagoda's strong results were driven by gold, diamonds and religious jewelry. Improvements in training and the newly designed kiosk helped as well.","Jared turned in a nice performance too due to a combination of factors including store operation improvements, exclusive merchandize programs and new marketing influenced by new customer segmentation findings.","And finally Ernest Jones delivered outstanding results across all of its selling channels, driven principally by bridal and other diamond collection as well as our Swiss watch collections.","Now let's turn over to Ever Us. This new collection was nothing short of a Grand Slam for Signet. It was the largest introduction of a jewelry collection in Signet's history and delivered much better than our expectations.","We actually ran out of stock in certain carat sizes in certain store brands during the end of the season. For now Ever Us comes in one ring style and five different carat weights, but we anticipate an extended benefit tail driven by product line extensions that are up and coming.","To review Ever Us is an example of Signet creating a jewelry fashion trend. The ability to develop a trend is very unique advantage that Signet possesses as the largest diamond jewelry retailer in the world.","Led by our New York-based design office, we identified a need in the jewel industry through consumer market research and developed the Ever Us collection, which is being consistently marketed and tagged in all of our store banners and the markets that we serve.","The 2-stone diamond ring, positioned to be for one\u2019s best friend and true love, serves a variety of gift-giving occasions in the lives of couples.","In the holiday selling period, Ever Us was purchased for anniversaries, for birthdays, for special mother-daughter events and even engagement in some cases. We look forward to the ongoing success of this wonderful collection.","That concludes my prepared remarks and now I'll turn the call over to Michele.","Michele Santana","Thanks Mark and again happy New Year to all.","Alright, let's start with looking at Signet in total. Signet's total sales for the holiday season were $1,947.8 million and that's an increase of 5% over last holiday season. We saw particular strength in our U.S. malls and outlet.","Signet's growth rate outpaced similar measures and projections from the National Retail Federation, U.S. Commerce Department and MasterCard SpendingPulse. This once again suggests that Signet gained market share and we did so profitably.","In the Sterling division, same-store sales increased 5.3% and total sales grew 7.2% to $1.2 billion. Kay comps led the way at 7.2% and Jared increased 2.7%. The average transaction value in the sterling division increased and that was driven primarily by Ever Us and Bridal, while the number of transactions declined.","The Zale division delivered total holiday sales of $532.9 million and a comp increase of 4.5%. The performance was even stronger in the U.S. led by the flagship Zale brand and Piercing Pagoda.","Now similar to our sterling division, the average transaction value in the Zale division also increased driven primarily by Ever Us and Bridal, while the number of transactions declined.","Sales in Canada were impacted primarily by the Western Region of Canada, where lower oil and gas led to a recession earlier this year. The effect of what started as a regional issue has had an impact nationally and consumers have not entirely recovered.","Our U.K. division total sales for the holiday season increased 0.9% and 4.9% on a constant currency basis. Comps increased 3.9% driven by Ernest Jones. The average transaction value increased in the U.K. division and that was driven primarily by branded bridal and diamond jewelry across store banners as well as Prestige watches in Ernest Jones, while the number of transactions declined.","Signet\u2019s eCommerce sales of $139.7 million increased 10.9% over prior year and that represented 7.2% of total holiday sales compared to $126 million in the prior year, which had represented 6.8% of the holiday sales.","Now let\u2019s turn on to our financial expectations for the fourth quarter. Signet has narrowed its financial guidance to the top end of our previously provided guidance based on our strong holiday performance in the January trends to date.","Our fourth quarter same-store sales are expected to increase 4.6% to 5%. Our expectations for fourth quarter adjusted EPS has been revised to the range of $3.54 to $3.60, representing a growth rate over prior year of 15% to 18% and this would imply a full year projected EPS growth of over 20%.","All of our guidance discussed in our third quarter release back in November such as our store counts, taxes and capital expenditures remains unchanged.","Now before turning the call back over to Mark, I would like to just take a moment to address our in-house credit operations. In-house credit has long been an important element of Signet\u2019s success and we\u2019re very proud of significant sales and earnings the program has delivered in its 30-plus year history.","Our credit program offers a competitive advantage for the company. As you know, we saw a modest shift in our credit receivable mix leading up to Q3. This shift frankly was neither dramatic nor unprecedented and managing these modest changes is part of what we\u2019ve done for decades in managing our credit portfolio.","Based on Q4 results to date, we anticipate credit expense and finance income to be very much in line with our expectations and this is factored into our guidance. This means that for Q4 in our Sterling division, we expect the net of finance income less net bad debt to be similar to Q4 of the prior year.","For the holiday sales period, our credit penetration rate was 58.5% and that compares to our prior year rate of 57.7% reflecting an 80 basis point increase.","We've undertaken credit marketing initiatives, which are designed to favorably influence our credit receivable mix. While it is still early days on these programs, the credit mix has been slightly more favorable.","In summary, our credit portfolio is profitable and the performance in Q4 is very much in line with our expectations. We\u2019re very pleased with our holiday results allowing us to narrow our financial guidance to the top end of our prior range.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark for his closing remarks.","Mark Light","Thank you, Michele. To sum up, we had a great holiday season and we're poised towards a fantastic fourth quarter.","We talked to you in recent past about a variety of initiatives and their financial implications and we delivered exactly what we said we would deliver. Signet\u2019s mission, our Vision 2020 and our strategic pillars are rock solid. The integration of our acquisition is progressing extremely well.","We remain confident in our ability to achieve our synergy targets and look forward to providing you with an updated view on our synergies on our fourth quarter call.","And finally I want to congratulate and thank all of our Signet team members. Our team has done an excellent job and enabled us to deliver on our fourth quarter indicatives.","We believe we're well positioned for profitable long-term growth as a direct result of the passion and dedication of the Signet team members.","And with that, we'll now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Ike Boruchow","Hi everyone and Happy New Year. Congrats on a great holiday performance. I guess my question Mark on the Jared concept and nice bounceback, it looks like a positive 3% for holiday. Can you just talk about your view of the concept right now?","It was a little slow in Q1 and then October you laid out the issues in Q3. But as you look into next year, can you talk about how you're viewing that concept? And I think you have some Pandora initiatives set for next year as well as some shop-in-shops. I was curious your views there. Thanks.","Mark Light","Sure. And thank you, Ike and Happy New Year to you also. First of all we want to reiterate the point that we believe our Jared concept is still gaining profitable market share that our total sales are up above what the overall jewelry marketplace is and we believe Jared is gaining profitable market share.","That being said, we have worked on enhancing and tweaking the Jared concept and we\u2019ve taken a lot of steps that were given to us by the Bain segmentation study that we did. And some of the key moves that we made this fourth quarter is we make some key personnel changes in the stores and we changed some of our selling strategies.","We enhanced our product assortment with having Vera Wang in all of our Jared stores, which did very well by the way. We have extended our partnership with Pandora. We now have Pandora jewelry in our stores and we're looking forward to next year.","We\u2019re putting Pandora store within stores within our Jared stores. We have a lot of exciting new programs going on in Jared that we\u2019re testing. So we feel pretty bullish and good about our Jared concept and we believe that the new creative that we put on television, which was a lot of the creative was directed by the Bain analysis of studies that we did Jared customers that we have a better sense of who the Jared customer is and that TV creative and that the way we\u2019re selling is really enhancing the Jared business and we'll continue to enhance the Jared business going into the future.","Ike Boruchow","Thanks. Congrats.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Michele Santana","Thanks Ike.","Operator","Your next question comes from Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Oliver Chen","Thanks congratulations. Regarding your comments, U.S. mall traffic has been so tough to obtain. So how would you prioritize how you're able to buck the trend with your execution?","And then with Ever Us that's great that's it's been really successful. I'm just curious about the key learnings as you've done at multichannel in terms of how it works in the Jared execution versus Kay? Thanks.","Mark Light","Thanks Oliver. As far as the U.S. mall traffic, obviously we all tracked the numbers that the numbers were down year-on-year and it doesn\u2019t help us the traffic is down but it doesn\u2019t hurt us as much as our retailer peers in the malls because we\u2019ve said this for a while that our purchases are premeditated purchase and people are looking for jewelry and specifically people are looking for engagement rings.","They're doing a lot of work and thinking about it ahead of time and going online and doing a lot of online shopping and studying.","So our purchase is a premeditated purchase for certain engagement rings and definitely in gift giving. So we believe because of that premeditation and because the purchases are driven by emotional connection to the products that we're not as affected by mall traffic as exemplified in our sales over the fourth quarter in November, December.","So we\u2019re bucking the trends because we have a great category. We\u2019re bucking the trends because we're investing a lot of dollars in TV advertising and internet advertising and online advertising to drive the traffic in our stores and we're bucking the trends because we have specific exclusive products that we offer that other people don\u2019t offer, whether it be Ever Us or whether it be our PANDORA that we have in Jareds or it could be our Miracle Links that we offer or it could be some of our Open Hearts by Jane Seymour collection.","So we can buck the traffic because we have a different category that we're offering and that we have a premeditated purchase.","As far as Ever Us in our key learnings, the program did well in all our store brands Oliver. It did very well in Kay, it did well in Jared, did well in Zales. Every one of our store brand that carried Ever Us by the way which was also in Canada where it did well and the United Kingdom it did well across the Board.","So for us this was just a slam-dunk great program for us not only because it did well in all of our store banners, but more importantly that it crosses over gift giving categories that is just not a anniversary gift, it could be a birthday gift.","As I said we even had some customers that were using as engagement rings and some customers were giving to a best friend. So that it crosses over gift giving categories is just something that we're very, very excited about.","And compounding on that what I said is that we by, doing as well as it did for Ever Us or Ever Us we've proven that we at Signet can create a jewelry trend and that not companies in this industry have that capability and that we were able to develop this trend and react to it and be able to have the consumers react to it so well, something that we\u2019re very excited about and just see exciting opportunities for Ever Us going forward and for other opportunities for Signet to develop different jewelry trends going forward into the future.","Michele Santana","The only other thing I would add to that Oliver on the Ever Us, the product did fabulous as Mark had indicated across all store banners and Canada and U.K. where it also performed well that wasn\u2019t supported with television advertising and so to see the product performance well as it did without that creative behind it was very impressive as well.","Oliver Chen","Okay, great. That's helpful. And your in-house credit has been a real competitive advantage in terms of how you strategically and tactically engage in it to generate proprietary sales and motivate and train the employees.","So I was just curious about the initiative that you spoke about Michele. What credit marketing initiatives were you roughly referring to? Thanks.","Michele Santana","Sure, sure. So to give you some of examples of the initiatives that we're working through and again as I mentioned it\u2019s kind of early on, I talked a little bit about this at the end of the Q3 call, but these are initiatives that are really targeted at our top credit quality customers.","And its credit card reactivations we did mailing to these, to our credit customers, come back into our store use your card, reminder you got this open line. There was some other initiatives relating to 10% off, credit when opening a card.","So there are number of initiatives to really help and assist in influencing our credit receivable mix and as I mentioned, it's early days, but we're seeing a slightly favorable mix as we move through the Q4.","And again I would just go back and say everything with our credit portfolio is performing exactly as we expected it to. It's all factored into our guidance and we\u2019re really pleased with the performance today.","Oliver Chen","Thanks a lot. Best regards. See you soon.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Simeon Siegel from Nomura Securities. Your line is open.","Simeon Siegel","Hey guys congrats on a great holiday.","Mark Light","Thank you, Simeon.","Simeon Siegel","So just with the holiday behind us, any color on the synergies or just benefits you saw at Zales from the initiatives you guys have been implementing that you can talk to specifically?","And then Michele thanks for the update on the credit. So just briefly on that comment to clarify, you're saying that the Q4 net bad debt minus the interest received should be flat to the fourth quarter of last year, if that's right. Do you want to just give any color on the expected bad debt expense embedded within that for the quarter?","Michele Santana","Yeah. So why don't I start with the credit there we can talk with the synergy. Yeah so in my prepared remarks, I had mentioned that when you look at our finance charge income, which sits in our other operating income on the P&L and you net that with our bad debt expense in Sterling, you would expect to see a similar trend to prior year Q4.","And I believe last year the net of those two was about $2 million or so. So yes, we would expect to broadly see that similar to that ratio last year.","In terms of diving in and giving metric five, specific P&L line, I just don\u2019t think that's appropriate to do at our interim sales call and I would just steer you back to the comments that we made and looking at this on a net basis between bad debt and finance charge because they really do work together.","In terms of the synergies, our synergies we're well on track with achieving our synergy goals that we had referred to in the past with 20% of our three-year synergy being recognized in FY '16.","So we're very confident. We\u2019re really looking forward to our Q4 result in which we will provide you those net synergies and will quantify the results for you. Give you more flavor behind where the synergies were flowing from and give you an updated view of what we expect those synergies to be on a going forward basis.","Simeon Siegel","Perfect. Thanks a lot guys and see you next week.","Michele Santana","Thanks, Simeon.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joan Payson from Barclays. Your line is open.","Joan Payson","Hi, good morning everyone and happy New Year.","Mark Light","Thanks Joan.","Joan Payson","Could you talk a little bit about the bridal performance and give some color there? And then just remind us what percentage of sales during the holiday comes from bridal?","Mark Light","Sure, as far as the bridal performance, it did well again as it has been going all year. We have some specific standouts. Vera Wang Love continues to perform well. It did extremely well in our Jared stores. We had first season of being fully rolled out in all of our Jared stores.","Neil Lane continues to perform well and our generic bridal continues to perform well. So as a whole, we're just -- we're very happy with our bridal strategy and our bridal performance and we just continue to see that this continues opportunities to be the leader in bridal in the United States and all the markets that we operate it.","So generally speaking our bridal continues to do well and it continues to do well by the way going into January also, which we're very excited about and it continues to see those trends going in through January.","Michele Santana","Yes from a penetration rate, I think bridal in Q4 is kind of the high 30s, 40 percentage.","Joan Payson","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then could you also touch a little bit on the promotional environment during the holidays, what you saw, how you dealt with that? And then maybe just some color around transaction value versus traffic trends?","Mark Light","As far as the promotional environment and overall retail, it would seem to be a little bit more promotional. I would say in our category in jewelry it was not a lot more promotional. So as a whole, I would say retail was a little more promotional than previous year, but in the jewelry category, it was comparable to the previous year.","As far as our company, we stayed pretty much the same on the promotional front. In our Jared concept, we elected to go a little more promotional. We had a first ever light up the holiday sales event in early November and we did that because in getting to know our customers better and understanding the Jared segmented customers, they\u2019re looking for a promotional sale here or there and they want to see some opportunities and it did very well for us.","But as a whole we did not promote more as a whole for our company. We saw little bit more promoting in Jared as I stated and we had a little bit more promoting going on in Canada and in the U.K. due to those markets being a lot more promotional.","So U.S. promotions were about stable. Canada and United Kingdom was a different macroeconomic environment out there. We\u2019re a little more promotional in those markets.","Michele Santana","Yes and just a little bit more color in terms of the transaction value versus transactions, I mentioned in the prepared remarks when you kind of looked across division, overall the theme was we saw growth in the average transaction value and somewhat of a decline in number of transactions.","And the value component was really tied to what we saw across the store banners was just strong diamond sales again particularly Ever Us, other bridal categories, strong diamond earrings, bracelets. So that was really I think driving the ATV.","Joan Payson","Great, thank you and see you all next week.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Michele Santana","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Patel from Stephens. Your line is open.","Rick Patel","Good morning everyone. I'll add my congrats as well. Can you talk about the strategy for Valentine's Day both in terms of new products and marketing? I guess what's going to be different versus last year?","And is it safe to assume that Ever Us is going to be the big focus again or are there other programs that you're looking to market more aggressively as we think about 1Q?","Mark Light","Sure, thanks Rick, first of all we believe we\u2019re very well positioned for Valentine\u2019s Day. There is a not a lot that you can change between Christmas and Valentine\u2019s Day because the time period is so tight.","Some of the, yes, Ever Us will be heavily advertised and in our stores and we will be very well in stock for Valentine\u2019s Day and we see a great opportunity for Ever Us it being a gift giving type of product to do very well.","But in Valentine\u2019s Day usually you have a lot more heart jewelry of course. You\u2019ll see more prevalence of heart being advertised and promoted between Open Hearts by Jane Seymour and just our heart collections.","And you\u2019ll see more fresh exciting marketing and displays in our stores that are more Valentines related, heart related, romance focused, but there is a not a lot of dramatic changes in our offerings other than more emphasis on heart and yes you\u2019ll see Ever Us being very much well, very well represented in all of our store brands during Valentine\u2019s Day.","Rick Patel","And thanks for the color on average transaction value, should we expect the two big drivers here Ever Us and Bridal to continue being a benefit as we think about 2016 and what do you attribute to fewer transactions? Is there something going on with charm jewelry or any other categories that you sell?","Michele Santana","Yes so I would expect Ever Us, Bridal, again diamonds across the store banners are really performing strongly. So I think those will all remain to be key drivers of ATV as we move forward.","And in terms of transactions, I think that there is a number of items that were impacting those -- the decline of what we saw in the number of transactions.","Some of that could have been we talked about the overall traffic being down although we seem to be less impacted by that. I think there was some effect of customers just trading up in terms of higher price points versus some of the lower average selling price whether it's charms or the Open Hearts.","So some of the other categories that might have performed well in the past that tend to be higher transactions, number of transactions just wasn\u2019t there this holiday season but we\u2019re very pleased with the overall transaction value increase.","Mark Light","Yeah and that being said Rick, we\u2019re always looking to increase our units and it's something that we would -- our strategy is to increase units and increase our average transaction and we have a lot of programs that we're working on next year and we\u2019re testing to continue to increase our transactions.","So we believe this is different quarters, different things happen depending on the dynamics of the business and the assortments and what's being promoted out there, but we believe next year will be a good year for us to increase -- continue to increase our average transaction price between Bridal and Ever Us.","And we do have some exciting programs for next year that are in test such as Pandora, which we're working more with Pandora having these stores-in-stores, having more Pandora like jewelry, which we think will help increase our transaction counts.","Michele Santana","Yes. And the only thing I would also add to that, the one thing we did see in Jared really was that across from all stores where we saw the decline in the number of transactions in Jared we actually did see growth in our transaction count.","Rick Patel","Thanks a lot. I'll see you next week.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Scott Krasik from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Scott Krasik","Hi everyone, thanks and congrats as well.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Scott Krasik","So it was clear that if you watch football or any sporting event, you guys were certainly very present on TV. Can you give us a sense maybe of your media impression how much they were up year-over-year and do you have an opportunity to increase those as well and your other key periods whether it's Valentine's Day and Mothers Day and what should we expect?","Mark Light","Sure. We don't give specifically how much our weight, our TRPs are up year-over-year and I'll tell you that all of our brands -- store brands that we advertise, whether it be Zales or Jareds and H.Samuel, Ernest Jones in the United Kingdom and Peoples in Canada, all of our TV impressions were up for November, December timeframe year-over-year for those brands.","Kays impressions were basically flat year-on-year, but what we did with Kays. We were able to advertize more in October and start advertising in bridal category in October, which was significantly helpful to Kay for that we believe for the November, December timeframe.","So as a whole, our impressions were up as a company and do we have opportunity to continue to increase our presence? Yes. We'll do it thoughtfully and methodically going into the future.","Michele Santana","The one thing I would add to that, we put Ernest Jones on TV the first time this year and you saw the results of our Ernest Jones sales. So we'll look at that and see if there is further opportunity as it relates to EJ on TV, but we're very -- I am very pleased with the performance.","Scott Krasik","Okay. And then if I could -- thanks you, and then if I could just add one more on the credit side, obviously it's becoming an issue that it wasn\u2019t over the last year and half or so, when does it become a question of risk reward, do I just want to outsource the whole credit business?","How long of an analysis period would that be for you?","Mark Light","Thank you for the question. I just want to -- just want to reinforce on the Michele sentence. I think it's very important that everybody understands us. We've been running a credit portfolio for well over 30 years, well over 30 years and we've been through good times and bad times of the recessions and we've been able to manage our accounts receivable appropriately and arguable better than most during all times over the last 30-plus years.","So this credit as Michele said, there is modest shifts going on, but there is nothing that's unprecedented for us. So we have every confidence in the way we manage our credit portfolio and the profitability of our credit portfolio.","I just want to reinforce that because there seems to be some concerns about our credit portfolio and we just think it's unwarranted quite frankly and Michele\u2026","Michele Santana","Yes I would add to that. It really is unfortunate on the modest mix shift that we saw in Q3, which was really magnified as we said at that time given the small size of the quarter in Q3, which was only about 5% of our annual operating income.","And that we had mentioned in Q4, the effect of that would be immaterial all of which was factored into our guidance at that point and continues to be factored into our guidance.","The credit portfolio as I mentioned is performing exactly very much so in line with our expectation. We're very pleased with the performance. Early on the initiatives that we put forth to favorably influence that mix seem to be working in the right direction.","And again just go back to our credit portfolio remains extremely profitable, trying to at least give the market some additional flavor to kind of pass that level of comfort over to you, which is what I mentioned in the prepared remarks.","The best way to look at this is when you take that, our finance charge income and net bad debt expense, which they sit in different geographies in the P&L, but when you look at those two and the net effect of that, that is going to be broadly very similar to what you expected in Q4.","And if we go back to Q3, not that I want to spend a lot of time revisiting Q3, when we showed you the net effect of that finance charge in our bad debt expense in Q3, I think what some of the noise came from is when you looked at that net effect, it had actually although very profitable, it was lower than the prior year and that simply is not the case as we move forward into Q4.","So I really hope with the comments that we mentioned today that it does help to put this credit discussion to minimize where it should be.","Scott Krasik","That's helpful. Thank you.","Michele Santana","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Annie Samuel from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Annie Samuel","Hi guys, Happy New Year.","Mark Light","Thanks Annie.","Michele Santana","Happy New Year.","Annie Samuel","Can you speak a little bit to cadence of trends within the quarter? Did you see any acceleration towards the end of the quarter or were trends more consistent throughout? And were there any differences in any of the divisions?","Mark Light","We started off strong as we said at the third quarter announcement, but our performance continued to become stronger and stronger closer to the end of the holiday. So we continue to see business being pushed later and later into the Holiday season across all of our brands. So we did much better going later into the holiday.","Annie Samuel","Great, thanks. And then competitively some of the department stores are starting to bolster their offering in jewelry. Can you speak to how you're positioning yourself competitively and if you think there's any tweaks you need to make in your promotional strategy?","Mark Light","Yes we believe anybody selling jewelry is a competitor and we believe when it comes it to our categories, specifically bridal and the gift giving categories that we are better than anybody out there, not only but the assortments that we have and the value that we offer, but the customer service that we engage with, with our customers because in the jewelry world, you need to have interactive customer service and people need to be explained the features and benefits of the product.","And we believe we just -- it\u2019s a huge competitive advantage for us that none of our major competitors can accomplish and certainly not the department stores.","And that compounded with having exclusive offerings such as Ever Us, such as Open Hearts by Jane Seymour, such as Neil Lane products that these competitors of ours can't carry, we believe just differentiates us from those competitors and doesn\u2019t put us into promotional back and forth with department stores.","So we feel very strong about the way our stores are positioned and we feel very strong about our competitive advantage and exclusive products, the way we can market and differentiate ourselves and most importantly the way our customers are served that is critical when you're selling jewelry and diamonds.","Annie Samuel","Great, thanks so much, guys.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citi. Your line is open.","Michele Santana","Good morning.","Mark Light","Paul are you there? Let\u2019s take the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick from Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.","Brian Tunick","Hi, good morning everyone and congrats as well.","Michele Santana","Thanks Brian.","Brian Tunick","So I guess the acceleration from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, I know we spent a lot of time on the third-quarter call talking about the training, so just curious the Zale in particular had a nice acceleration.","Can you maybe talk about some of the learnings and the payoffs for the third quarter's weakness to the fourth quarter and how that could play out next year?","And then bigger picture I think the last 12, 18 months you guys have talked about the millennials haven't been as inspired by jewelry and other categories regaining share and I think De Beers had taken some marketing spend off the table.","Maybe as you look at 2016 and you think about the category, how bullish are you on what you can control versus what the environment is going to look like? Thanks very much.","Mark Light","Okay. First of all as far as Zale's performance third quarter and fourth quarter, as we said on the third quarter call, we made a conscious decision to focus on specific training of specific initiatives that we\u2019re going to deal with for the fourth quarter.","And in doing that we believe it's somewhat hindered our trend rate in the Zale's brand, but we believe it was the right decision to make because we wanted to make sure we\u2019re able to execute superbly in the fourth quarter, which we did.","Our Zale's store did very well and we just believe this is something that will carry through this. There is a lot of benefit of the synergies as our Zale's team members are selling Bridal better than ever with features and benefits.","They're getting enhanced marketing and advertising that's more focused and targeted to the right customer base. They're getting the benefits of new programs whether it be in repair or custom jewelry.","So a lot that we train the Zale's team members or discount controls in the third quarter, we definitely are getting the benefits in the fourth quarter and we believe that for certain it's going to continue through 2016 and into the future.","That\u2019s what this whole idea is about is getting the Zale business up to levels similar to our Sterling business and it\u2019s starting to work and we believe very confidently we'll continue to work going forward.","There's something I've got to correct Brian, we never said, not Michele nor I, have ever said that millennials did not find our jewelry, our products favorite. Quite the contrary, our research has shown that millennials very much hold jewelry in favor, very much hold jewelry in favor.","And they think it still is one of the best ways of expressing emotion is through jewelry. So the millennials don't believe that. What we said was is that the millennials may not be as loyal because if this is not advertised in front of them they will be easily deterred to spending that discretionary income elsewhere.","So what is important for us is to continue to market our product and advertise our product and get our industry to advertise more. So those millennials who do find our products in favor when they see it and are reminded that jewelry is a wonderful way of expressing emotion and love that incremental marketing will get them to continue by jewelry.","So we believe that is working. We believe by our increased advertising spend we believe there is other, there was increases going on that we saw in the jewelry initiative during the fourth quarter and we believe that work and that\u2019s what you're seeing in our comp results and we believe going forward more advertising to the millennials will do nothing but enhance those customers that hold our product in favor.","Brian Tunick","Right. Super. Thanks very much.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Paul Lejuez from Citi. Your line is open.","Jennifer Davis","Hey guys, its Jennifer. Can you hear me now?","Mark Light","Yes, Jennifer. How are you?","Jennifer Davis","Okay, all right. Happy New Year. Sorry about that. Michele, thanks for the color and credit. So it seems like finance income less bad debt expense will be somewhere around $58 million roughly for the year, similar to last year.","I was wondering if you could give us a rough sense of the operating expenses associated with the credit card so we could get an idea of maybe how profitable the credit card business is.","Michele Santana","Yeah, so let me just start with and we haven't in the past given metrics in terms of the operating expense associated with that what we continue to guide the market to is really looking at the net of the bad debt expense in our finance charge income.","And so what I was saying in my remarks is that when you take the net of those two it will be broadly similar to last year which that was about $2 million. So we\u2019re saying again assuming some of those together and you would expect to see something broadly in that range for Q4.","So that\u2019s not saying that finance charge is flat to last year. It's just saying that the net effect of those two is going to be consistent with last year and again I can\u2019t say there is enough, but our credit portfolio is performing very much in line with our expectations.","Everything has been factored into our guidance. We\u2019re not going to get down into providing guidance in terms of what the credit operating expenses are. We haven\u2019t done that and I just continue to guide to thinking although our finance charge income and the bad debt expense that flows through the model -- your models.","Jennifer Davis","Right. Okay. Well the finance income in the bad debt expense, the net of that is if we assume $2 million in the fourth quarter it looks like it will be about, I'm sorry $58 million again this year similar to last year.","Michele Santana","Yes, you would expect with growth in receivables just from a natural growth in receivable, you\u2019re going to have higher bad debt expense and will also have higher finance charge income.","Jennifer Davis","Right, right. All right, but safe to assume that operating expenses are less than $58 million?","Michele Santana","Again I would -- I would say you\u2019re probably thinking along the right lines, but I can't offer any more insight other than the comments that we made but all is well in the world of credits.","Jennifer Davis","Okay. All right. Good to hear. And then it was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on gross margins. It seems like maybe a little more promotional overall.","I know that was planned, but maybe if you could provide little more color given bad debt commodity cost synergies and leverage. Should we expect an increase relatively similar to the third quarter or any color you could get around that would be helpful?","Michele Santana","Yes so just to try and give you some additional color and I know stated some every quarter when asked about the upcoming gross margin that we don\u2019t provide guidance at that level, but I think it\u2019s helpful to try and give you some enhanced color around that.","Again we talked about synergies and 50% of our synergies coming from gross margin. So as a whole, at a consolidated level that implies that there is gross margin increase to be had related to our synergy effort.","We continue to see favorable commodity cost. So again that will be a benefit to our gross margin as well. As it relates to bad debt expense, we\u2019re not going to provide what that is on a line basis, but again when you look at any growth in receivable, you expect to have some increase on your bad debt that is offset in our finance charge income which flows outside of gross margin.","So all in all, one would anticipate with the comments that I made that gross margins will look good in Q4 and so hopefully that's enough color to help you out.","Jennifer Davis","Yes, thank you. And then if I could squeeze one more in. I was wondering people are still concerned about cannibalization between Kay and Zales. Just wondering if you guys could add any additional color after your results from holiday. Thanks.","Mark Light","Yes. Thank you, Jennifer. I think our performance kind of illustrates that the lack of cannibalization going on with something we've talked about we track it on a weekly basis. It's very minimal and as you can see our Zales U.S. stores were up over 6%. Our Kays stores all in the U.S. were up over 7%.","So we'll take that all day long. There is minimal cannibalization going on and we're very happy with what's going on both with Kay and Zales. So thanks you.","Jennifer Davis","Great. Thanks and best of luck.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Dorothy Lakner from Topeka Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Dorothy Lakner","Thanks and happy New Year everyone. I don't have a question on credit, but\u2026","Michele Santana","I think you don't have\u2026","Dorothy Lakner","You're welcome. But I would wonder if you could give us some more color on Ever Us, just in terms of I know Mark talked about being out of stock in some carat sizes. I'm assuming you'll be back in stock for Valentine's Day and also just the new -- he talked about new product in the assortment, more styles etcetera. So I wondered how soon we might expect to see that assortment broadened.","Mark Light","Sure Dorothy. Thank you and happy New Year to you also. Ever Us was just a Grand Slam for us who did much, much better than our expectations and surprisingly, not surprisingly some of the best, the best sellers were the largest total weights, a 2 carat total weight, a 1.5 carat total weight were some of the best sellers.","And as I said we did run out of stock and we pulled forward our Valentine's Day orders, our Mother's Day orders and we just couldn\u2019t keep up with it, it was just doing so well and we did run out of stock coming into the end of the season and in some brands just ran out.","That's a bad thing because we lost sales, it was a good thing because it just was a tremendous success for us. That being said, we will be very much in stock. We were able to react quick enough to get our Valentine's Day very much in stock and not only to be in stock, but in stock to the level of the success that we believe we had and could add even more so during the Christmas timeframe.","So we are ready, ready and prepared for Ever Us to be a success again on Valentine's Day and all of our brands. As a matter of fact Michele mentioned this, but we will be on TV for Valentine's Day in Canada, which we weren\u2019t for the holiday season. So that's another benefit to our Canadian stores.","As far as extensions goes, we are and will be testing this during the spring season different ring styles, different bracelet styles, different necklace styles and we'll be looking at what's going to work and what tests the best with the hopes if we find some success stories of running extensions really probably in the fourth quarter of next year.","We believe we have a lot of room to grow with the Ever Us, even though it was a tremendous success, there is a lot of Americans, Canadians and people in the United Kingdom who still don't have Ever Us to express that their best friend is their true love and so we still we think we have a long way to go with Ever Us rings.","But we believe the extensions if they're successful in the test will probably be in our stores for the next holiday season of next year.","Dorothy Lakner","Okay. Great. Thanks so much for the color.","Michele Santana","Thank you, Dorothy.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Light.","Mark Light","Thank you. Thank you all very much for taking part in this call. Our next scheduled call is on March 24, when we review our full year and fourth quarter results. Thanks again and happy New Year to everybody. Good bye.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen.

My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. James Grant, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","James Grant","Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. On our call today are Mike Barnes, CEO; and Ron Ristau, CFO. The presentation deck we will be referencing is available under the Investor section of our website signetjewelers.com.","Following Mike and Ron\u2019s prepared remarks, we will have a limited amount of time for your questions. During today\u2019s presentation, we will in places discuss Signet\u2019s business outlook and make certain forward-looking statements. Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially.","We urge you to read the risk factors cautionary language and other disclosures in the annual report on Form 10-K that was filed with the SEC in March 27, 2014. We also draw your attention to Slide #2 in today\u2019s presentation.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael W. Barnes","Thanks James and good morning everyone. We\u2019re very pleased with our first quarter results. For the quarter, comps at Signet increased by 3.3%, our U.S. division comps grew 3.2% and UK comps increased by 4.1% that\u2019s compared to a 2.3% decrease last year. So it was another strong quarter for our UK division.","eCommerce sales for Signet were also up 24.4% as our string of impressive double-digit growth rates continued through Q1. Signet delivered first quarter profit driven by the strong execution of our strategies. Adjusted operating income was $159.1 million, up $16.3 million or 11.4% and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.29, up $0.16 or 14.2%.","We remain pleased with our performance also for the first several weeks of May, including Mother's Day. Customers have responded favorably to our new products and fresh collections, especially in the fashion jewelry category.","In planning, we really expected to end the second quarter with mid-single digit comps. However, our performance in the second quarter to-date has actually been higher than that, both during the Mother's Day week and afterwards. Our team's consistent ability to execute our initiatives by focusing on our competitive strengths leaves us very well-positioned to achieve our objectives this year.","Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at the U.S. division\u2019s first quarter performance. U.S. total sales were $903.5 million, up $46.3 million or 5.4%. Our same-store sales increased 3.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Kay comps led the way with a 4.2% increase, while Jared increased still by 2.3%. The success was driven primarily by fashion diamonds, bridal brands and watches.","The U.S. eCommerce business performed well with sales up $5.3 million to $30.9 million, an increase of 20.7%. The U.S. division operating profit increased 8.8% with an 18.4% margin. Ron is going to add little bit more color on this here in a few minutes. The drivers of our performance were our sustainable competitive strengths, in particular, our great customer experience, broad customer acceptance of our powerful merchandise offerings, investment in marketing and our multichannel approach.","The customer experience is very central for our success and we remained focused on the training and development of our store teams. Our branded, differentiated, and exclusive merchandise continues to perform well in our stores. Our marketing efforts, featured bridal, outlet initiatives, and fashion jewelry.","We also saw success across selling channels. As I mentioned, U.S. eCommerce sales were up 20.7%, this was driven in part by 20.9 million visitors to our sites and over 40% of that was through mobile devices.","Now, our outlet business was another great success story, as our outlets drove very strong sales during the quarter. There is one example I would like to particularly call out and that is to mention Jared Vault. Jared Vault is the new outlet store concept that we have for Jared.","We converted originally 18 of our Ultra stores during the first quarter to Jared Vault stores and, guess what? They have been terrific. So much so that we\u2019re now working on converting another 13 stores or most of the portfolio, within the second quarter or by the end of the second quarter.","Now, I\u2019ll turn over to the UK. Total sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 were $151.7 million that was up $16.7 million or 12.4%, primarily driven by fashion jewelry, bridal brands, and fashion watches. Comps sales increased by 4.1% compared to a decrease of 2.3% last year and that\u2019s a great quarter, and that\u2019s following if you recall, a very strong holiday fourth quarter to finish last year. Our eCommerce sales were $7.8 million that\u2019s up $2.3 million or a strong 41.8%.","Operating income was breakeven for the quarter and that\u2019s an improvement of $4.1 million from the prior year. Operating margin increased by 300 basis points, a great sign that our turnaround program in the UK remains on track. Among the drivers of these improved results were a merchandise focus; very focused on bridal and diamond programs.","Our field operations team was very focused on selling, rather than on tasking. Along with that a renewed teamwork effort, sharing of best practices including with the United States and the great job the leadership team has done there.","Overall, we are well positioned to achieve our fiscal 2015 objectives. This is really due to, first off, our very strong first quarter results in both the top and the bottom line, and our consistent ability to execute our key strategies around, maximizing the mid-market, being best in bridal, our digital ecosystem, the expansion of our footprint and most importantly our people. Executing these strategies allows us to achieve our mission statement, which put simply, is to help our customers do two things, celebrate life and express love.","In closing, we continue to be very excited about our pending acquisition of Zale, on May 29, Zale\u2019s shareholders will vote on our proposed acquisition. We believe our offer provides compelling and immediate value to Zale\u2019s stockholders while eliminating business execution risk. We are very pleased that Institutional Investor Services has recommended for our acquisition of Zale and we encourage all Zale\u2019s stockholders to support the transaction.","And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ron.","Ronald Ristau","Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll start by reviewing first quarter sales in a little more detail. For the quarter, total sales for Signet increased 6.3% to $1,056.1 million compared to $993.6 million last year. Same-store sales increased 3.3% compared to 6.4% growth last year. In the United States, total sales increased 5.4% or $46.3 million to $903.5 million, which included the same-store sales increase of 3.2%.","Our non-same-store sales were up by 2.2%. Sales increases were driven primarily by fashion diamonds, bridal brands and watches. Importantly, the number of merchandise transactions increased in both Kay and Jared and the average merchandise transaction value increased slightly in Kay while declining slightly in Jared. The decline in the average merchandise transaction value in Jared was primarily driven by sales mix, including significantly higher bead sales.","Signet launched 18 new Jared Vault stores in outlet centers in this quarter, which were converted from Ultra, and expects to convert another 13 in the second quarter which will complete the transition of all Ultra nameplates within our business.","In the UK total sales increased 12.4% or $16.7 million to $151.7 million. Comp store sales increased 4.1%, UK sales performance in the first quarter was primarily driven by fashion jewelry, bridal brands and fashion watches. The number of merchandise transactions increased primarily due to beads and gold jewelry in H.Samuel, and fashion watches in Ernest Jones. The average merchandized transaction value declined slightly, primarily driven by sales mix. Importantly Signet eCommerce sales were $38.7 million, up $7.6 million or 24.4% as Mike had indicated earlier.","Now let\u2019s take a quick look at the components of operating income. Signet gross margin was $407.2 million, an increase of $24.4 million and the gross margin rate was 38.6%, up 10 basis points.","In the U.S. gross margin dollars increased $19.3 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2014, reflecting higher sales and primarily the impact of lower gold prices on average commodity costs. This benefit was partially offset by the recognition of gold hedge losses incurred in fiscal 2014 and lower gold spot prices that reduced the recovery on trade-ins and inventory.","The US net bad debt expense to US sales ratio was consistent with the prior year first quarter at 2.5% with the credit portfolio continuing to perform strongly. In the UK, gross margin dollars increased $5.4 million, compared to the prior year first quarter, primarily reflecting higher sales and store occupancy cost savings associated with store closures and rent re-negotiations. This is partially offset by planned promotional activity.","Signet\u2019s selling, general and administrative expenses were $310.5 million compared to $287 million in the prior year first quarter, an increase of $23.5 million and as a percentage of sales, increased 50 basis points to 29.4%. I will discuss this in more detail on the next slide, as the increase is primarily driven by transaction costs.","Other operating income was $54 million or 5.1% of sales compared to $47 million or 4.8% of sales last year. This increase of $7 million was primarily due to higher interest income earned on higher outstanding receivable balances.","So our consolidated operating income in the first quarter was $150.7 million, representing 14.3% of sales. When we exclude the $8.4 million of pre-acquisition transaction costs, operating income was $159.1 million or 15.1% of sales. Fully diluted earnings per share were $1.20, excluding the pre-acquisition transaction of financing costs of $7.3 million net of tax. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.29, compared to $1.13 in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, an increase of 14.2%.","Now some additional detail on SG&A expenses, as I stated earlier, SG&A expenses were $310.5 million compared to $287 million in the first quarter last year, up $23.5 million as a percentage of sales, increasing 50 basis points. In the U.S., SG&A expenses increased $13 million, the primary reason was higher advertising expense of $10.2 million due to timing of production costs and higher store staff costs that flexed with sales. The overall SG&A expense in the UK was higher primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation.","Pre-acquisition transaction costs in the first quarter were $8.4 million; these are costs associated with legal tax accounting and consulting expenses incurred with the announced potential acquisition of Zale Corporation. Excluding these pre-acquisition transaction costs, SG&A was $302.1 million and as a percentage of sales was 28.6% compared to 28.9% in the prior year first quarter.","Our SG&A remains effectively controlled and focused. Net inventories ended the quarter at $1,523.9 million compared to $1,426.4 million in the first quarter last year, an increase of $97.5 million or 6.8%.","UK inventory which actually decreased in local currency but increased $22.3 million due to the impact of foreign currency translation had some significant impact. When we exclude the impact of foreign currency, inventory increased by 5.3%.","Some other key drivers of our inventory position were an increase of $19.4 million due to new stores; our diamond sourcing initiative, where we have continued to build inventory throughout last year, year-over-year is up $16.7 million; and support for sales growth initiatives which increased our inventory by $39.1 million. When we compare the fiscal to year-end fiscal 2014 our inventory is increased 2.4%, or 1.8% excluding the impact","of currency. Our inventory is well positioned as we go forward.","Now let me quickly touch on credit metrics. Credit remains an important component of our business. Net accounts receivable increased to $1,3082 million compared to $1,1575 million last year, up 13% for the quarter, driven primarily by higher sales and an increase in the credit penetration rate.","In the quarter, credit penetration in the U.S. was 58.1% compared to 57.7% last year, which excludes the sales of Ultra where credit was not offered. This increase was primarily attributed to increased outlet credit penetration and strong customer acceptance of our credit offerings. The average monthly collection rate this quarter was 13.2% compared to 13.4% last year, as customers continued to opt for our regular credit terms which require lower monthly payments as opposed to the 12-month interest-free program.","Our net bad debt expense was $22.3 million for the first quarter compared to $21.3 million last year, an increase of $1 million, driven primarily by growth in receivable balance from increased credit penetration that I mentioned earlier. The U.S. net bad debt expense to U.S. sales ratio was consistent with the prior first quarter at 2.5% with the credit portfolio continuing to perform strongly. 96.7% of the portfolio is classified as performing versus 96.3% as of last year's fiscal 2014 year-end.","Other operating income was $54 million compared to $47 million last year, an increase of $7 million, which is primarily interest income on the higher outstanding receivables and, again, the shift away from the interest-free programs. As a percentage of sales, other operating income increased 5.1% from 4.8% last year. So the net impact of these two items was income of $31.7 million in the first quarter compared to $25.7 million in the prior year, an increase of $6 million.","Now turning to our guidance. Signet is providing guidance for its current business, including the expected acquisition and financing costs it will incur. The potential Zale acquisition will result in the realization of incremental expenses. These expenses will primarily be transaction-related costs, i.e., advisor fees for legal, tax, accounting, and consulting, and financing fees which we will incur to support the new capital structure.","Second quarter comparable store sales are expected to increase in the 3% to 5% range. Second quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.95 to $1.01, an increase of 13.1% to 20.2% as compared to last year's second quarter. Acquisition costs are expected to impact EPS negatively by $0.15 to $0.13 and financing costs are expected to negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.10. This should result in a total fully diluted second quarter EPS in the range of $0.70 to $0.78 based on an estimated 80.2 million weighted average common shares outstanding.","For the full year, the Company continues to expect the range of capital expenditures from $180 million to $200 million, which includes the opening of 75 to 85 new Kay and Jared stores and five stores in the UK. This includes our cost for store remodeling and important investments in the digital and information technology infrastructure.","Thank you and I will now turn the call back to Mike.","Michael W. Barnes","Thanks Ron. In conclusion, I would like to once again thank the Signet team worldwide for their contributions to a successful quarter and now we\u2019ll take some time for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question is from Simeon Siegel of Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Simeon A. Siegel \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great, thanks. Good morning, guys and congrats.","Michael W. Barnes","Thank you, Simeon.","Simeon A. Siegel \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","So Mike it\u2019s clearly early but any initial reads on the productivity improvements from the Jared Vaults following those conversions or perhaps what you would expect given the success of Kay.","Michael W. Barnes","Yes. I\u2019m sorry go ahead.","Simeon A. Siegel \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","I was just going to ask Ron, something after, so I\u2019ll follow-up after that.","Michael W. Barnes","Okay, listen, Simeon, we are really excited about what we\u2019ve seen in Jared Vaults. It is early days. And I don\u2019t want to get too far in front of it. But I mean it was pretty dramatic the changes that we saw as we changed the nameplates. We had some stores where we tested changing out different merchandise assortments as well, and saw a big impact there. But I\u2019d tell you that they look great. The logo looks fantastic out there. It gives it a wonderful feel for an outlet store type or an outlet center type store. Vault certainly gives it the feeling that you are getting something valuable and not just discounted merchandise.","So we are pretty excited about the initial response that we\u2019ve had and as both Ron and I mentioned, we are quickly going to turn some more Ultra stores into that pretty much the entire portfolio maybe with the exception of one or two stores for various reasons on timing, but we are excited.","We think that it\u2019s a big opportunity for us. Listen, our outlet business in general, not just the Jared Vault test that we did, but our outlet business was very strong during the quarter, and really helped drive our business and we look forward to continuing to build that business because as you know we\u2019ve really only gotten into the outlet business in a very big way, since our initial Ultra acquisition and we are going to have so much more opportunity going forward. I\u2019m just really excited about it.","Simeon A. Siegel \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","It\u2019s great. It sounds really exciting. If I can just follow-up quickly with Ron. So you locked in a pretty attractive interest rate, especially on the receivable facility. Any thoughts on monetizing that, I guess more of the receivables, whether paying down debt, repurchasing shares et cetera, I guess just the right way to think about that facility.","Ronald Ristau","I think the right way to think about it as we\u2019ve announced, we\u2019ve decided to securitize approximately $600 million of the receivable, and we have no current thoughts of going beyond that. Let\u2019s get that done first and then we\u2019ll see, but it is a very attractive interest rate, no question about that, but we think that the overall leverage ratios and targets that we are working within the Company are where they should be at this point in time.","Simeon A. Siegel \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","","Perfect. Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck for the rest of the year.","Michael W. Barnes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Patel of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.","Rick B. Patel \u2013 Stephens Inc.","","Hey, good morning, everyone and congrats on a strong first quarter and strong start to the second.","Michael W. Barnes","","Thank you.","","Rick Patel \u2013 Stephens Inc.","","Can you talk about the health of your consumer this year and the potential for price increases? I\u2019m curious if this is something you\u2019re looking to do this year as you have in prior years. And then, as you think about your outlook, to what extent comps will be driven by AUR versus transactions?","","Michael W. Barnes","","I\u2019ll take the first part of that question and see if Ron wants to add a little bit more color on there, especially including AUR. The health of our customer is pretty strong right now I think. The terminology that I\u2019ve used for it is resilient.","As we went through that first quarter you guys all know that we had a lot of weather challenges through that quarter and you\u2019ve seen other retailers come out and talk about weather challenges. But we felt the impact of it when there was a giant snowstorm and the customers stayed home, but they were very resilient. They kept bouncing back and they kept coming back into the stores. And we have seen the momentum build as we talked about going into the second quarter.","Here we are almost a month into the second quarter, and as we told you, our expectations were that we expected and guided to 3% to 5% of comp store sales for the quarter. But, quite frankly, on a month-to-date basis we\u2019re beating that number. And whether that will hold or not we\u2019ll see, but we feel pretty good about our customer and our position with our customer at the current time with all the great offerings that we\u2019ve got out there, the great marketing initiatives that we\u2019re driving, and the power of our multichannel distribution with outlet stores, regular malls, off-mall stores and online. So that\u2019s it from customer. I don\u2019t know about AUR.","Ronald Ristau","","Yes, probably if you go back to my comments about what drove the comp this quarter, it was transaction increases in both Kay and Jared and our UK businesses. So transactions have become a much stronger driver of comp, as we predicted they would be this year, because it is true that with commodity prices under somewhat more of a control that price increases we were more reluctant.","I wouldn\u2019t speak to you about what our future price increase plans are, but we always thought that it was going to be important to bring people into the franchise and drive transactions, because we couldn\u2019t be as reliant on price increases and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening. So we\u2019re very pleased with the configuration of our comps in the first quarter and I would expect that that should continue as we go through the year.","Rick Patel \u2013 Stephens Inc.","And, Ron, can you talk about gold hedge losses? I\u2019m just curious how much longer this is going to be a drag on gross margins and to what extent gross margins could potentially increase for the remainder of the year given the flow-through of lower gold prices and perhaps your ability to leverage costs.","Ronald Ristau","","Well, I agree with you. First of all, I hope that the gold hedge losses would stop cycling through the P&L as soon as possible, but we have approximately another $11 million to go as we finish. So it will affect us for the next three quarters by about $11 million as I recall and then we\u2019re pretty much done with it.","Now we don\u2019t have any \u2013 it\u2019s not happened again. So we\u2019re in pretty good shape with all of that and gold does seem to be behaving itself, but we\u2019ll see what happens.","Rick Patel \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Great, thank you and good luck with everything.","Ronald Ristau","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tunick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","","Hi, good morning. This is (indiscernible) filling in for Brian. Thanks for taking our question. I guess we wanted to ask about the UK. Obviously, the 4.2% comp was great but just yesterday Tiffany\u2019s comments on the UK or Europe was a little less bullish. So I wanted to get your view on the macro or the consumer environment in the UK. Do you think your strength is purely driven by the improvements you make to your own business, or you think your target customer in the UK is actually strengthening?","Michael W. Barnes","","I think we have a little bit of both there going, quite frankly. I like to give our team as much of that credit as possible, because they have done a terrific job turning that business around and starting in the direction that we have been aiming at there. I think that we\u2019ve gotten some help from the macro economy that things have settled down in the UK and started improving.","But really the things that I called out, the focus that they\u2019ve had starting really in the fourth quarter and back towards the middle of last year when they really got moving, the focus they\u2019ve had on diamonds and driving that diamond business has been terrific and they\u2019ve seen a lot of great results from that.","They\u2019re doing well with their fashion businesses. Watches continue to perform in that market. They have partnered with our U.S. team very closely. Mark Light and his team here in the U.S. have worked with Seb Hobbs and his team as partners, and they have found best practices to share with one another. The teams have been a lot more focused on a selling approach, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, rather than a tasking approach or an operational approach.","So we feel really good about the way and the direction that the team is going in the UK. We do believe that they are getting better, slowly but surely again. I don\u2019t want to get the cart before the horse here and say, hey, everything is great and robust in the UK. Two good quarters still is not a very long-term trend make, but we continue to make progress and that\u2019s what we need to do. We\u2019ll keep the team focused on what they need to be focused on and we\u2019ll keep driving it forward.","Unidentified Analyst","","Great. And then on the outlets, particularly the Jared Vault concept, can you provide a little more color on how they will differentiate from the Kay outlet stores in terms of maybe the store set up and the product? Also, I guess at the Analyst Day you mentioned outlets, I believe, as a 200-store opportunity. It\u2019s early, but do you think the encouraging Jared outlets\u2019 results may change your thinking there?","Michael W. Barnes","","I\u2019ll answer the first part of your question. We may need to get you to repeat the second part. On the outlets, after we made the Ultra acquisition, we really focused the team specifically on the outlet store business. We\u2019ve got some great people that are driving the marketing for those outlet stores, and it\u2019s specialized marketing. There\u2019s a lot of things that those outlet malls do with their retail partners in stores and we\u2019ve gotten more focused on that. We\u2019ve gotten more focused on marketing to the tourism consumer as well. And even from a merchandise standpoint, as points of differentiation, you can think of our merchandise in the outlets kind of in three buckets, if you will.","One bucket is going to be discontinued type merchandise that\u2019s going to be discounted down for the consumer, so sale type merchandise. The second, third of that business is going to be the continuation of a lot of our strong branded merchandise really at regular price within those stores.","And then the third bucket is going to be made for merchandise, so merchandise that we specifically design and make for our outlets to provide certain values and looks for the type of customers that we attract to that channel of distribution.","So it is somewhat different than our regular stores. We even have some pre-owned watch selections that do very well for us in the outlet stores. And we\u2019re able to get special buys here and there that are one-off type merchandise, which is great for the outlets because it\u2019s kind of a little bit of a treasure hunt mentality for our customers anyway.","People don\u2019t expect to necessarily be able to find the same things day in and day out within the outlets. They want to come in and see what is the nice treasure they can find today and then they\u2019ll come back the next month and see what\u2019s new. So that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s going on with our merchandise within the outlets and how we differentiate that from our regular stores. What was the second question? Did you get it?","Ronald Ristau","Was it how many outlets and what our growth expectations are? Is that correct?","Unidentified Analyst","","Yes. With the Jared Vault concept, would that be another leg of growth beyond conversion of the Ultra stores?","Ronald Ristau","","It\u2019s possible. Obviously, the Jared growth when we\u2019re done with them will have approximately 30, 31, 32 stores and it\u2019s been successful. So we continue to look at the development of new concepts and it\u2019s a viable concept. We have made no decision, but all I can tell you is it looks pretty good and we\u2019ll see how it goes.","Right now, we\u2019re just planning on continuing with the rollout of Kay outlet for probably somewhere in the neighborhood of another 10 to 12, 15 stores, because there are still many opportunities in outlets that we are taking advantage of. So we have made no decision, but it looks pretty good so far.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you. Best of luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Oliver Chen of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Congratulations on all the consistency. Regarding your comments in the press release in terms of the proposed transaction eliminating business execution risk, we do believe there is a lot of complements here with brand, geography and different synergies. If you could elaborate on your thoughts there that would be helpful. Also, as we model gross margin the compares get a little bit easier, but I know that you have strategies in place to think about share. So where should we think about the gross margin for the balance of the year? Thank you.","Michael W. Barnes","","Well, I don\u2019t want to get into a lot of detail on the transaction that we\u2019re looking forward to closing soon. I will give you a couple of color points though. I guess the thing that I hope is that all the investors really understand the business risk associated with a standalone Zale business, quite frankly, trying to achieve their stretch plans. They\u2019ve got some very difficult stretch plans that they would need to hit.","Another thing is it\u2019s really going to take \u2013 that business has been a little bit starved for capital. It\u2019s going to take a lot of capital investment. And we have said openly that we are prepared to make the appropriate capital investments to help that business continue to move in the right direction and to get it to where it needs to get to. It\u2019s not going to be an easy task or a simple task.","This deal, it really lines up well with our company, but the circumstances are pretty unique and somewhat exclusive to a deal between Zale and Signet. As a combined entity we\u2019ll have all the right tools to move it forward with the appropriate amount of capital, the right expertise within both companies, and the ability to drive scale as we move forward.","So as we build our organization for the future, Oliver, I\u2019m pretty confident in our ability to absolutely optimize on our business, especially a combined business with Zale Corporation, to optimize on our profitability, on the opportunities that we have for our team members, and very importantly, on the value for our shareholders. So we just look forward to closing it. And we believe everything lines up well and we\u2019re excited about our (indiscernible) forward.","Oliver Chen \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Thank you. It sounds like capital is very important and good thing for the sake of these businesses.","Ronald Ristau","Capital and working capital. So, anyhow. Let me take the second part of your question.","Gross margin, we haven\u2019t provided any specific guidance, but I think the first quarter is instructive. Our margins were slightly up. We do get some benefit from lower average gold prices. We said it would be offset during this timeframe by this impact of the commodity cost we\u2019re seeing as well as some of the recovery on scrap rates that we have to deal with. So net-net we thought it would a slight positive. We\u2019ve ended up being a slight positive and we would point you to that when you are thinking about the rest of the year.","Oliver Chen \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Great, best regards for the year.","Michael W. Barnes","","Thank you.","Ronald Ristau","","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Lorraine M. Hutchinson \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, good morning. I was hoping you could give us an update on the diamond sourcing business, any early learnings there and how big you think that could be as a proportion of your purchases?","Michael W. Barnes","Well, we continue to move along very well with the acquisition of the factory that we made in Botswana in the fourth quarter last year. Our partnerships with the mining companies continue to develop. We\u2019ve got a lot of very important meetings coming up at the show that\u2019s happening here at the end of the month. And I think, I\u2019ll probably give a much better and more robust update on that. When we get to our next call, but right now things are moving forward as we expected. It is a very important part of our business.","And we are very happy to be where we are at, if anything, I would say we moved a little quicker than we thought maybe we could have. But if someone had asked the question a year or 18 months ago and I\u2019m very happy about that as well. It\u2019s still not a material part of our sourcing, but it\u2019s getting bigger all the time, and it will continue to grow. So it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll give you more color on that at the next meeting. But we are very pleased with the steps that we\u2019ve taken and the direction that is moving in right now and we\u2019re excited about the future there.","Lorraine M. Hutchinson \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Stein of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Jeff S. Stein \u2013 Northcoast Research Partners LLC","First question for Ron, wondering Ron if you could just give us some idea what that capital expenditures might be for the combined entity once the deal closes?","Ronald Ristau","I think that would be somewhat premature. We have talked about that. At a minimum, we have said that we believe that you are in the range of $80 million a year, minimum over next couple of years for the sales business. I think that\u2019s about as far as we go at this point. But it is a substantial amount of work to be done with the infrastructure, the stores, the inventory management systems. There is a lot of rebuilding work that is yet to be done. And we thought about this very carefully as we did all of our due intelligence. So there is a lot of work to get done, a lot of money that has to be invested in the business to drive it. And so it is going to be a rather consequential number.","Jeff S. Stein \u2013 Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. And on the receivable securitization facility, just wondering is there going to be any change in terms of the control?","Ronald Ristau","No, there is no change, Jeff. It\u2019s on balance sheet. There is no change. We do all the collecting of money, the servicing of the receivable portfolio. So it\u2019s essentially transparent from an operational perspective. It\u2019s really a financing vehicle. So nothing changes in who approaches the customer, collection methodologies, all of that stays the same.","Jeff S. Stein \u2013 Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. Approval rates in terms of\u2026","Ronald Ristau","Everything stays, we continue to control everything.","","Jeff S. Stein \u2013 Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Got it.","Ronald Ristau","Okay. Nothing changes in the way that the receivable portfolio is managed.","","Jeff S. Stein \u2013 Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. And final question for Mike, in the past you kind of called out some of the strong brands in bridal, like Neil Lane and Tolkowsky, I didn\u2019t hear that. I\u2019m assuming that when you talk about bridal bands that you are referencing those in particular, so just kind of wondering if you could clarify that and if those brands continue to perform well.","Michael W. Barnes","Yes, I sure well, Jeff thank you. As we said, it was a very strong quarter for us. What drove it in bridal, Neil Lane continues to just be on fire for us. Leo was doing very well. We saw a lot of the fashion diamond business doing well with brands like Le Vian, great, strong partner of ours as well as Artistry fashion diamonds in Kay and Vivid, in Jared and some of the other Jared big brands. Pandora had a great quarter.","We saw a really good quarter with Pandora on the bead side, Lois Hill, the beautifully designed sterling silver jewelry continues to have a lot of momentum and gain strong sales. So we have lot of brands that did really well for us.","On the watch side, we had a lot of our strong partners did well, also TAG had a good quarter, Movado, Citizen had a good quarter. I mean I don\u2019t want to go through all of them, but it was pretty broad-based out there. We have a lot of partnerships that did very well. And our core merchandise assortment continues to do very well as we continue to drive better and more fashion and design even into our core assortment aside from the branded piece of our offerings.","So we feel pretty good and pretty well positioned on how we are moving forward, and we look forward to continuing driving success through the second quarter. For the guidance we put out there and again as far as the full year goes. We feel good about meeting our objectives forward.","Jeff S. Stein \u2013 Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Great, thank you.","Michael W. Barnes","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dorothy Lakner of Topeka Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Dorothy Senghas Lakner \u2013 Topeka Capital Markets","Thanks, good morning everyone and congrats as well. Just in terms of going back to the outlet stores for a second, and how pleased you are with the new Jared Vault, you talked about the mix there. Could you just go over and kind of compare and contrast the mix in the Kay outlets in terms of the different buckets. And then secondly could you talk about kind of marketing spend, marketing plans for the rest of the year. Thanks so much.","Michael W. Barnes","As far as the mix, that one will be easy for us because it\u2019s really pretty much the same. What we are trying to do is drive a mix that's somewhere around a third discontinued discounted merchandise, a third strong branded merchandise and another third kind of made for merchandise special promotions geared specifically for the customer that visits that channel. So it\u2019s very similar on the mix side as far as marketing Ron, do you have any thoughts.","Ronald Ristau","Our marketing program for the remainder of the year will remain very strong. We are excited about the prospects for a significant number of new adds as we look forward into holiday.","We\u2019ll be out there and supporting our brands with every bit of the vigor that we have been over the last several years. So no major changes in our marketing approach. If you are asking specifically about outlets, and if you are, I will just say, there we have a very robust marketing program, which we have developed for outlets which is something that we have really started into last year where we now fully participate in all of the various \u2013 outlet mall operators run a lot of promotional events and coupons at the mall. We participate in all that so our marketing programs for outlets have really become very much stronger over the last six to 12 months and we are seeing great results from that. It\u2019s a very successful program in outlets and it is uniquely developed for them.","","Dorothy Senghas Lakner \u2013 Topeka Capital Markets","","Great, thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Wu of Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.","David W. Wu \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group, LLC","","Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the great results. For the Jared Vault concept can you perhaps talk about the margin dynamics versus the full-price locations? And obviously, given that Jared is a higher end, upper middle market concept, how do you manage the perception of the Jared brand, especially as you grow this new franchise?","","Michael W. Barnes","I will take the brand perception and leave the margin to Ron. That\u2019s what I love about the concept, Jared Vault, David, because if you think about it, it is not like Jared outlet. It is Jared Vault. It is like this valuable treasure type feeling that you are building, not so different than maybe like a Saks OFF 5th or a Neiman Marcus Last Call. Both very high in stores that have successful divisions very much similar to that.","So I think that it is a good fit. We have never seen any issues with the Kay outlets having any issues affecting the value of the Kay brand name in all the regular locations where it is located, and I don't expect to see that kind of an issue with Jared Vault either. I think it speaks to a different customer, but a customer that\u2019s looking for something and wants to be on that treasure hunt, like I mentioned. So I feel pretty good about that. Do you want to talk about the dynamics on the margins, Ron?","","Ronald Ristau","Yes. I mean just in general when we look at our outlet business on a store contribution level, it is every bit as strong as our best mall stores and sometimes higher, because some of those stores tend to be even higher productivity than our best mall stores. So the outlet configuration and profit on a net basis is very, very positive.","The way it moves around between margin and real estate costs and so on there are some slight differences, but net-net from a store contribution perspective it\u2019s fantastic. So, I don't really know what else to say to you about that. The Jared Vault and the Kay will be run with similar structures, they are not dissimilar, so we look for a certain gross merchandise margin out of both of them.","Interestingly enough, the Jareds that we converted, just as a side note, were some of the last Ultra stores that we had, which were actually some of the underperforming Ultra stores that we had. And when we changed them to Jared Vault they just leapt forward, so we will see what the overall profit configuration of that is or how big we make it. Obviously, we have to do a lot more thinking about it, but the initial results were, as Mike","indicated, it really just turned these stores on a dime.","","David W. Wu \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group, LLC","That's great.","Ronald Ristau","So we are excited by the prospect. As I said, it was a pretty challenging test because it was among our worst-performing Ultra stores.","David W. Wu \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group, LLC","Right. And I understand you talked about outlets doing well in the quarter, but can you talk about the comp complexion between full price and outlet stores in the U.S.? If there is anything meaningful to call out?","","Ronald Ristau","","No, we are not going to get into the details of outlets. We said we would stop reporting outlets as a segment, because we take the business in totality and we don't want to keep focusing on one particular segment of the business. So we would not \u2013 all we will tell you is that the outlet comps were very strong.","","David W. Wu \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group, LLC","Excellent.","Michael W. Barnes","The non-outlet stores did very well also.","Ronald Ristau","Yes. I mean they\u2019re not to over focus, both did well, and the Internet did well.","David W. Wu \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group, LLC","Great. And I know you\u2019re early days on testing some new concepts, but can you share with us any of your findings so far and how you envision the sort of the overall store format for both Kay and Jared to evolve over time?","Michael W. Barnes","You know, as usual at this time of the year, David, for competitive reasons we really don\u2019t want to talk about the things that we have in test mode right now. We\u2019d like to get those set and ready for the fall season and on into holiday. And usually we start talking a little bit more about expectations on certain merchandise tests and initiatives more at the next call at the end of August.","David W. Wu \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group, LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Bill Armstrong of CL King & Associates. Please go ahead.","William R. Armstrong \u2013 C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","","Good morning, gentlemen. Could you discuss the factors that you considered when you\u2019re going through the conversion of the old Ultra stores; how you decided whether to convert it to a Kay or a Jared Vault? What were the factors involved there?","Michael W. Barnes","","Well, the real factor is, when we acquired Ultra, the strategy was to leverage our nationally advertised, well-known brand names. And the first strategy was, because we did have a Kay outlet business, we had somewhere between 30 and 40 stores when we acquired Ultra. So we immediately jumped up in the 130 or 140 store range. We had always planned and we did convert as many of those Ultra stores that were not duplicative into Kays. So every outlet mall with a Ultra that did not have a Kay, we put those under the Kay nameplate as of the end of last June, and those stores have done terrific as well. So the Kay business is very strong, too.","We shouldn\u2019t lose sight of that because that\u2019s where most of our outlet stores are and the fact that Jared Vault is still new and it\u2019s only been out there for a couple of months, but it\u2019s just exciting. So the decision was make them a Kay, if there\u2019s not already a Kay, and then that left us with 30-some-odd Ultra stores. And as Ron mentioned, some of those were more of our underperforming outlet stores, and so we started thinking about the opportunities that we had in front of us and we thought why not Jared Vault. Jared is a very successful concept. There is no reason why it could not live side-by-side \u2013 a lot of other high-end retailers in these outlet stores with the likes of the Polos or the Coaches. I mentioned Saks OFF 5TH and Neiman\u2019s Last Call type stores.","We made the test and turned a lot of them into Jared Vaults. It had very good results over a short time period and we thought it\u2019s worth converting the rest of them into Jared Vaults. We believe that we\u2019ve got something that\u2019s very successful here in front of us. That\u2019s really the thought process we had there, Bill.","William R. Armstrong \u2013 C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then just shifting to Mother\u2019s Day and month-to-date, your same-store sales are running well ahead of Zales. You may not want to comment on Zale directly, or maybe you would, but what are you seeing in the market that might explain your outperformance versus Zale or versus the market overall over the last several weeks?","Michael W. Barnes","","Yes, speaking to our performance, I think it always starts with the team that we\u2019ve got out there in the field. They were well trained. They understand all the merchandise offerings that we\u2019ve got out in front of them right now.","The combination of our field personnel and the merchandise offerings and some of the styling and design that we\u2019ve got behind that is just tremendous and it was powerful. We drove, as I said, what we felt was a very strong Mother's Day. We\u2019ve got guidance of 3% to 5% comps for the quarter but, quite frankly, on a quarter-to-date basis we were talking more in between 7% and 8% in that range.","So it has been a great start to the quarter. Our merchandise has been very well received by our customers and we think we are well prepared. We will see what the environment gives to us as we go over the summer and finish out the quarter. We will come back and chat with you guys in August about it, but we feel pretty good right now.","","William R. Armstrong \u2013 C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","","Okay, so there weren't any aggressive promotions on your part that might have driven traffic?","","Michael W. Barnes","No, we didn't drive any additional promotions I don't believe at all, Ron?","","Ronald Ristau","No, not at all.","Michael W. Barnes","And maintained our margins very well.","Ronald Ristau","","As I indicated, what has been happening is our transaction counts keep going up as we draw people into our franchise","","William R. Armstrong \u2013 C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","","Okay great. Yes, that\u2019s very good. Thank you very much.","Michael W.

","I will now turn the call over to Gina.","Gina Drosos","Thank you, Randi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. To begin, I would like to thank all of our Signet team members for their support of our customers and for embracing and leading change as we continue to execute our transformation. ","In my remarks today, I'll start by discussing second quarter results and then preview our holiday plans and the progress toward our transformation. I'll wrap up with some brief comments on our financial guidance. We continue to execute with diligence on our transformation priorities. In the second quarter, we delivered results above our guidance for same-store sales, non-GAAP operating profit, and non-GAAP EPS and grew operating profit year-over-year.","Also, adjusted free cash flow excluding last year's credit proceeds is up 243 million year-to-date, due to effective cost control and disciplined inventory management. Despite weak overall retail industry traffic trends, our transformation initiatives for merchandise and targeted digital marketing delivered improved traffic and sales performance as we moved through the quarter. ","The quarter started off slowly in May and significantly improved in July, with Signet's core North America banners outperforming industry traffic trends for the overall quarter. Importantly, we delivered positive North America same-store sales in the July Prime Day Promotional Week, both in-store and online. ","Here are some highlights of our sales performance. Total company same-store sales were down 1.5% in the second quarter. North America same-store sales were down 1%, inclusive of an 85 basis point unfavorable impact related to a timing change to revenue recognition on service plans, and a planned promotional timing shift into Q1 at Jared. ","eCommerce was up 9.9% in our North America banners, excluding James Allen, and up 4.4% on a consolidated basis. James Allen sales declined 1.5%, a sequential improvement from the first quarter as marketing and assortment changes began to offset pressure from sales tax implementation and the competitive marketplace.","We continue to see benefits from increased newness, which particularly drove strong fashion sales in the second quarter. Fashion grew across all North America banners. Piercing Pagoda continued to deliver double-digit growth for the fifth consecutive quarter. Growth in on-trend gold, our in-house designed Love+Be Loved collection, Disney, and LeVian drove the momentum in fashion. Bridal sales experienced some softness with performance improving as we moved through the quarter. ","Flagship brands, Enchanted Disney, Leo, and Endless Brilliance were strong contributors to bridal sales.","Turning to profits. Second quarter non-GAAP operating profit performance was ahead of last year and is the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year stabilization, reflecting continued stability in North America merchandise margin and strong cost discipline. Non-GAAP operating profit came in ahead of our guidance due to better same-store sales, higher cost savings, and lower credit costs, as well as some benefit from reinvestments shifting into the second half.","Now, we\u2019ll turn to an update on our holiday plans and Path to Brilliance transformation initiatives. Our plans are well underway within our strategic priorities of customer first omni-channel and culture of agility and efficiency. Within customer first, our priorities on improved merchandise, transforming marketing and media effectiveness, and improving our shopping experience, including laying the foundation for our service business to be a longer-term meaningful revenue and margin driver for Signet.","We are executing on our product strategy to build bigger, iconic flagship brands, offer a highly competitive assortment for value-oriented shoppers, especially during holiday periods, and deliver relevant on-trend products. We continue to revamp our product architecture toward more curated, relevant assortment. This holiday, we are positioned with bigger branded product launches, a more competitive selection of gifts and key price points for value-oriented shoppers.","We are strengthening our flagship brands. The Disney partnership continues to expand with new princess anniversary bridal designs and fashion expansion. In Vera Wang, we have new designs for women, and the launch of a new Vera Wang men's collection as well as the expansion of custom design offerings. Neil Lane\u2019s Premier Bridal is expected to expand to a larger number of stores, and we will also have new fashion offerings.","Additionally, we are expanding our colored gemstone bridal offerings across each of our Disney Enchanted, Vera Wang, and Neil Lane flagship brands. ","We are also investing in our fashion assortment. Our holiday plans include amplification of on-trend gold product offerings, including investments in digital merchandising, and continued expansion of our exclusive Love+Be Loved collection, which has continued to perform well. We also plan to expand the recently tested True North Celestial Diamond collection online and to our top 350 Kay stores for holiday. ","In bridal, we are refreshing our exclusive past, present, future product line at Zales. We are also launching a new Zales private collection. This art deco-inspired line was created to celebrate Zales\u2019 rich heritage and diamond expertise since 1924. In addition, we've developed several new exclusive-to-Signet bridal and fashion collections that we plan to discuss after they launch in the third quarter. ","Overall, we believe we have made solid progress on our merchandising strategy toward our goal of reaching an inflection point of newness across our new and existing iconic flagship brands, on-trends merchandise, and value-oriented offerings for holiday. ","Moving on to marketing, we are continuing to implement strategic changes to our marketing model with respect to timing of spend and mix of media, which is driving greater efficiency and effectiveness. The timing of advertising spend has been rebalanced to a more always on model to support bridal throughout the year. ","Given the shorter selling season for holiday this year, we are also moving some spend into the third quarter to begin driving awareness earlier in the season. Piercing Pagoda recently launched its first ever holistic advertising campaign Be More You across digital and social platforms, as well as custom kiosk signage. Each of our banners will have innovative integrated campaigns for holiday with strong banner differentiation and modernized creative. ","We expect to improve return on investment by moving to a higher mix of digital advertising, as well as more efficient targeting of spend. Our new media agency is on boarded, integrated with our teams, leveraging our proprietary data and executing our targeted strategies in the second half of the year. ","Now, I would like to discuss our plans to leverage our full service jeweler capabilities to drive traffic, create higher frequency relationships with our customers and add incremental higher margin sales. We've spent the last several quarters implementing a brilliant at the basics strategy for care, repair and custom capabilities. ","We've provided focused training to our store team members and developed new tools and technology to improve operations and enhance the customer experience. For example, our repair intake that formerly took 20 minutes now takes approximately 7 minutes using our new e-repair ticket system. These efforts have resulted in steady quarter-on-quarter improvement and our repair net promoter score over the last four quarters. ","We have begun implementing website updates, marketing, in-store signage and special events to drive customer awareness of our enhanced care, repair and custom services during holiday and beyond.","Providing piercing services is also a traffic and margin growth opportunity for Signet. Piercing provides opportunities to drive incremental traffic, as well as build customer relationships early to set the stage for future sales to celebrate many life moments, including engagements. We know from our experience at Piercing Pagoda, that piercing skews to an attractive point of entry customer within the average age of 11 to 17. Our research indicates that a distinct group of customers interested in ear piercing would be highly interested in this service at Kay. So we have been testing and learning at a small group of Kay stores leveraging the expertise of our Piercing Pagoda team.","These tests will be expanded further during the fourth quarter, with an expectation of offering piercing services at several hundred Kay stores by early next year.","Overall, while services will be a small incremental contributor in fiscal 2020, we expect it to be a meaningful traffic and revenue driver for Signet in the longer term as we scale our efforts.","Turning to omni-channel, our omni-channel transformation efforts have resulted in a significant increase in online channel adoption, with eCommerce penetration doubling over the last two years to reach 11.5% of sales in the second quarter. This was enabled by strong progress in platform and mobile technologies, integrated omni-channel marketing efforts and custom design capabilities. ","As I've mentioned on prior calls, we are making significant investments in platform and mobile technology in fiscal 2020. The Kay and Jared transition to the hybris platform is scheduled to go live later this month, significantly improving the customer experience on those sites. Our investments in mobile experience, which deliver faster load speeds, higher quality images, and improved curated search go live at sales in the third quarter. ","Kay and Jared mobile enhancements will quickly follow hybris transition, evidencing the speed and efficiency enabled by establishing a common best-in-class technology foundation across our banners. We believe that these changes will set us up to drive higher traffic to our sites and create a more compelling, user-friendly customer experience for holiday.","In the second quarter, we had a strong integrated omni-channel effort during the week of the Prime Day event. Our core assortment offerings both in-store and online and additional eCommerce-only offers drove positive same-store sales and strong double-digit growth in eCommerce for our North America banners during Prime Week.","We are also continuing to build best-in-class customization capabilities through our design your own tools across banners, as well as unique omni-channel programs. Our integrated approach will allow us to expand customization options from multiple vendors more quickly in the future. ","After successful testing, we have also expanded the Vera Wang online design your own tools into the store with sample settings and shapes for customers to try on and create a custom ring. This in-store experiential program was inspired by an offering in our James Allen Washington, D.C. store and is expanding to all sales stores this fall. ","Moving on to the culture of agility and efficiency, our cost optimization efforts positively impacted our second quarter results. We continue to expect $70 million to $80 million in net cost savings in fiscal 2020. Our gross savings are primarily driven by indirect procurement, workforce optimization and lower corporate costs with a portion of the gross savings reinvested in transformative technology and innovation initiatives to drive growth. ","We have finalized our direct procurement negotiations with our vendors, enabling us to accelerate new products, lower our costs, and further optimize inventory efficiency beginning in the fourth quarter. Our three year Path to Brilliance net cost savings goal remains $200 million to $225 million inclusive of the $85 million in net cost savings achieved in fiscal 2019.","Before I turn the call over to Joan, I will briefly discuss tariffs and our fiscal 2020 financial guidance. We are continuing to monitor the ongoing tariff discussions and are hopeful that a long-term agreement can be reached quickly. As we have mentioned previously, the three tranches of tariffs that were enacted in 2018 have no meaningful impact on our business. ","However, our jewelry merchandise is subject to the recently announced List 4 tariffs, which took effect on September 1st. We believe that the actions we've taken to leverage the flexibility in our multi-national supply chain will enable us to cover the current 15% List 4 tariff impact within our fiscal 2020 operating profit guidance range. ","In fiscal 2020, we do not expect to pass along price increases to our customers as a result of tariffs. While it is premature to provide an estimate for fiscal 2021, through both strategic and disciplined effort we have been successful in working with our vendors to move a significant amount of our China exposure to other countries. By fiscal 2020 year-end, we expect our merchandise spend exposure to China to be in the mid-teens on a percentage basis, roughly half of the exposure we discussed on our last call. Going forward, we are continuing to work through mitigation strategies in partnership with our multi-national vendors. ","Turning to guidance. We are reiterating our fiscal 2020 same-store sales and non-GAAP operating profit guidance ranges. As I just mentioned, our fiscal 2020 non-GAAP operating profit guidance now includes the expected impact of tariffs. We also continue to expect fiscal 2020 adjusted free cash flow to be higher versus fiscal 2019, primarily driven by lower inventory. ","As we enter the second half of our fiscal year, we are encouraged by continued growth in eCommerce sales, momentum on our fashion product performance and the positive impact of strong cost discipline on our operating profit. We believe our outlook appropriately balances these signs of operational improvement with the fact that it is still early in the year. The North America retail environment remains competitive and we continue to face challenges in the UK.","With respect to capital management, this morning we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share. We continue to evaluate all potential uses of cash, including investing in the business, dividends, share repurchases and debt repayment as part of our business planning and capital management processes. ","In closing, we have made good progress building foundational capabilities needed to build Signet's leadership in the jewelry category. We are gaining traction on our multi-year Path to Brilliance transformation, and continue to work with diligence to bring critical mass of these initiatives to market, while operating in a dynamic and competitive retail environment. ","And now, I'll turn the call over to Joan. ","Joan Hilson ","Thanks, Gina. And good morning, everyone. In my remarks I will first cover the highlights of our second quarter financial results, then discuss our refinancing plans and conclude with guidance. ","In the second quarter, same-store sales declined 1.5%. In North America, Piercing Pagoda was up double-digits. Sales returned to low-single-digit same-store sales growth and we saw growth in eCommerce. ","Jared improved sequentially adjusted for a planned promotional timing shift and against a more difficult prior year comparison. Kay's same-store sales were down low-single-digits, with Kay's more significant product launches still expected to come in Q3 and Q4. International same-store sales continued to reflect the challenging operating environment in the UK.","Revenue declined 3.9% reflecting lower same-store sales, the impact of net store closures and the impact of foreign exchange. Non-GAAP gross margin was down 60 basis points in the quarter and was impacted by two structural items. First, we continued our strategy of higher sales to third-parties of non-productive diamond inventory from our diamond polishing operations in Botswana to clear excess inventory and generate cash. Similar to the first quarter, this had an unfavorable 65 basis points impact on our gross margin rate. And secondly, as expected there was an unfavorable impact of 25 basis points related to the timing of revenue recognition on service plans. ","Stabilization and merchandise margin in our North America banner and transformation cost savings were offset by these structural impacts on non-GAAP gross margin.","SG&A was down $33 million or 1.1% of sales on a year-over-year basis. This performance was driven by lower corporate and indirect spend as well as lower store staff costs primarily due to store closures. These favorable items were somewhat offset by a $5 million increase in credit costs as we did not anniversary the outsourcing of our non-prime credit business until late in the second quarter. ","Non-GAAP operating profit grew year-over-year reflecting transformation cost savings somewhat offset by lower year-over-year sales. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.51 was nearly flat versus prior year despite a year-over-year tax headwind of $0.11 as we move toward a more normalized tax rate in fiscal 2020. ","Our second quarter GAAP operating profit detailed in our press release this morning includes a $48 million immaterial out of period adjustment related to goodwill impairments taken in fiscal 2019 with respect to Zales and James Allen. This is a non-cash charge, has no impact on Signet's liquidity and does not reflect any underlying change in our outlook for these businesses. ","Turning to balance sheet and cash flow. We are making solid progress, unlocking working capital opportunities and generating higher free cash flow. Our enhanced inventory planning processes are beginning to have impact as we continue to thoughtfully reduce legacy inventory and employ a more disciplined purchasing strategy for new inventory. ","As a result, inventory was down 4%, or $92 million versus prior year in the second quarter and down 5%, or $115 million versus fiscal 2019 year-end. We continue to expect inventory levels to be lower at year-end versus fiscal 2019. We do expect inventory to increase sequentially in the third quarter due to the typical seasonality of our business as we prepare for the holiday season. ","We made continued strong progress on cash, generating $194 million in adjusted free cash flow year-to-date, which was up $243 million year-over-year excluding the proceeds from the non-prime credit transaction in the prior year. ","Now, I would like to provide an overview of our refinancing plans. We expect to enter into fully committed five-year asset based credit facilities of $1.6 billion to refinance our existing credit facility and term loan that mature in 2021 and the outstanding senior notes due in 2024. As part of the refinancing, this morning we have announced a tender offer for the senior notes with the offer completion subject to a majority of the notes being tendered. This refinancing improves our financial flexibility as it is expected to be leverage-neutral. It extends Signet's debt maturity profile and increases available liquidity. These new facilities are also expected to result in slightly lower interest expense versus our current capital structure, which has been incorporated in our guidance. ","We continue to expect our leverage ratio to be approximately 4.0 times by the completion of our transformation plan at year-end fiscal 2021. ","Moving on to guidance, we are reiterating our fiscal 2021 same-store sales guidance of down 2.5% to down 1.5% and fiscal 2020 non-GAAP operating profit guidance of $260 million to $280 million. Our profit guidance reflects net cost savings of $70 million to $80 million with higher reinvestments in the second half of the year. We expect the impact of credit outsourcing to have a neutral impact year-over-year. ","And as Gina mentioned earlier, our profit guidance now incorporates the expected impact of List 4 tariffs. While we exceeded our non-GAAP operating profit guidance in the first half of the year, we are remaining prudent in our outlook as a significant portion of our revenue and the vast majority of our operating profit is generated in the fourth quarter. ","The North America retail environment remains competitive. We also face continued headwinds in the UK, and we are now covering expected tariff costs. ","With respect to fiscal 2020 non-GAAP EPS, we are updating our guidance to $2.91 to $3.23. This EPS guidance update is due to lower interest expense resulting from the expected impact of the refinancing, lower interest rate expectations and strong free cash flow generation in the first half of the fiscal year. ","Our operational plans and transformation goals remain unchanged. Our non-GAAP tax rate guidance is also unchanged. And we continue to expect no share repurchases in fiscal 2020. We expect to close our refinancing during the third quarter and we will provide further details on its impact during our third quarter earnings call. Please note that we have excluded any potential gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt as well as any fees related to the tender offer from the guidance we\u2019ve provided today. ","For the third quarter, we expect same-store sales of down 1% to down 2%. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be a loss of $42 million to $50 million with a non-GAAP EPS loss of $1.02 to $1.16. Our same-store sales outlook reflects the expected benefits of product launches late in the third quarter, balanced by Piercing Pagoda beginning to lap mid-teens prior year comparisons, James Allen not yet lapping sales tax implementation and continuing challenges in the UK. ","Consistent with our Always On media strategy, the third quarter operating profit outlook includes an approximately $12 million year-over-year increase in advertising as well as the favorable impact of net cost savings. The net cost savings in the third quarter are slightly below second quarter levels due to a shift in timing of reinvestment spend. ","As a reminder, the third quarter is our smallest revenue dollar quarter of the year. And as a result, revenue and expense drivers can have a larger impact on growth rates and margin rates. ","To close out my comments, we are encouraged by the progress we have made year-to-date in stabilizing same-store sales and margins, lowering our inventories and generating higher free cash flow. I'm confident that we're on the right track to deliver our commitments for fiscal 2020, as well as our long-term transformation initiative. ","And now I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A section. ","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchison from Hutchison. Your line is open. ","David Buckley ","Hi. This is David Buckley on for Lorraine this morning. Thanks for taking our question. Looking forward, what are the key factors to get the comp growing again? And then can you share any quarter-to-date commentary? Has the improvement that you saw in North America comps in second quarter continued into the third quarter? ","Gina Drosos","Hi, David. It's Gina. I'll take that and then Joan you can chime in with anything incremental. I think the Path to Brilliance strategies that we're putting in place are beginning to get some traction and the key to getting to positive comp growth is really in the customer first and omni-channel initiatives. So, continuing to execute our merchandise strategy around bigger iconic brands, around having the right value offerings for shoppers, especially in key holiday periods and being more on trend. We've made some big moves into gold, into colored gemstones. Customers are very interested in those at this point in time and it's paying off for us. So, I think on the merchandising strategy, that's key. And then I'd also highlight on the marketing strategy, we did hire a new media agency at the beginning of this year, the intention was to leverage the proprietary data that Signet has as the world's largest specialty retail jeweler and be able to more efficiently and effectively target our media spend to the right customer journeys, so bridal messaging to bridal customers, gifting messaging to gifting customers, that agency is now fully on board. And so we're beginning to see those efforts take hold as we go into holiday. ","And then on omni-channel, first and foremost, it was to get us to the right platforms. We haven't had a great performance on particularly our Kay and Jared eComm platforms, over the last couple of holiday periods, as traffic really increases, we have on Zales and Pagoda, since moving to the hybris platform. And so, that along with the mobile investments that we've made, we think are really fundamental to getting us toward positive comps. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citigroup. Your line is open. ","Paul Lejuez ","I am curious as we look out to next year on the SG&A line, are there any investments that need to be made to support the business, or should we expect that SG&A can actually be down next year? And I guess I'm kind of curious if you feel there are any places that may be pulled back a little bit too much that might be hurting topline where you might need to reinvest? Thanks. ","Joan Hilson","So, Paul, I'll take that question. Well, we don't really provide SG&A guidance. A couple of things that I would say about our cost savings program. We have taken out of our cost non-customer facing costs, which we believe has been important in delivering the reinvestments that we need to make to support our top-line sales and our growth. So, as we invest in the hybris initiative and we invest in the Always On marketing strategy that Gina mentioned, that's how we have approached the transformation initiative and made very thoughtful and meaningful reductions in cost to support the growth for the company. ","As we look forward in terms of our investments in the business, we consider all of the operating model that you would think about in a retail company, right. We have store labor investments. We have our operating models in terms of evaluating our real estate strategies. So, we evaluate all of those components as we look forward into the future. So, as it stands right now, we are very comfortable with the cost savings initiatives that we\u2019ve put in place. ","Paul Lejuez ","Just a follow up. I'm curious, I think, when you ex-out some of the timing things in the gross margin line, gross margin was flattish, I believe if I heard you correctly. I was curious if you could talk specifically about merch margin and also by concept, which concepts you're seeing better merch margin on a year-over-year basis versus the remote pressure perhaps by the promotional environment? Thanks. ","Joan Hilson","Sure. We are -- what we're pleased with is, we saw the stabilization in our North America gross merchandise margin which does also incorporate the impact of clearance sales. We would -- we've also embedded our updated view on the impact of clearance sales on our gross merchandise margin and inventory in our updated guidance for the third and fourth quarter and for the year. I would just remind you, Paul, that the 65 bps impact on margin that I mentioned from Botswana and that is also something that we continue to expect as we manage our way through the balance of the year. ","Paul Lejuez ","And by concept, wondering if you can share any insights as to better or worse year-over-year? ","Joan Hilson ","No. What we can talk about is, is North America merchandise margin as stabilized. ","Operator","And we have no further questions in queue. This will conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"18952":["Signet Jewelers Ltd. (NYSE:SIG) Q2 2016 Earnings Call August 27, 2015  8:30 AM ET","Executives","James M.

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. Please note that this call is being recorded today, August 27, 2015 at 8:30 AM Eastern Time.","I would now like to turn the meeting over to your host for today's call, James Grant, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, James.","James M. Grant - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. On our call today are Mark Light, CEO; and Michele Santana, CFO. The presentation deck we will be referencing is available under the Investors section of our website, signetjewelers.com.","During today's presentation, we will in places discuss Signet's business outlook and make certain forward-looking statements. Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. We urge you to read the risk factors, cautionary language, and other disclosures in the Annual Report on Form 10-K that was filed March 26 with the SEC. We also draw your attention to Slide number 2 in today's presentation for additional information about forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you James, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter, we delivered strong top line and solid bottom line results which exceeded guidance. Signet comps increased by 4.2% and adjusted EPS was at $1.28, which was a 19.6% increase over the prior year adjusted EPS. Our success in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was broad-based, with sales and profit growth coming from virtually all of our store concepts, across various geographies, with contributions across our selling channels and from several functional areas. We continue to outperform our industry driven by our competitive strengths. And importantly, we're increasingly confident about our integration synergies. In addition, we're making excellent progress against each of our Vision 2020 strategic pillars.","Before it gets to the second quarter and once it comes for the back half of the year, I wanted to make a few comments about our space in the jewelry industry. We have a five-year compounded annual growth rate of 12% in total sales. Signet has been gaining and continues to gain market share profitably. We consistently outperformed the jewelry market and the total retail market. And based on results to-date, we appear poised to deliver another year of industry outperformance.","Given the fragmented jewelry industry, we believe we have many years of profitable market share gains ahead of us. Our brands, our scale, and our people give us a sustained competitive advantage. Our leading position in the jewelry marketplace has been driven by progress against each of our strategic pillars, specifically in Best in Bridal, which leads me to review our second quarter sales drivers.","From a merchandise perspective, diamond jewelry was strong. Bridal, a strategic focus of ours, grew faster than Signet's overall rate of growth, and therefore, gained relative share. Bridal brands such as Neil Lane, Vera Wang Love, and Tolkowsky were standouts, as well as our non-branded bridal portfolio. Complementing those results has been the continued momentum of Diamonds in Rhythm, Unstoppable Love, and our solitaire diamond earrings programs. The great work of Signet's collective teams around discount controls, commodity pricing, and product design over the past year is now manifesting itself in our financial results, helping to drive not only higher sales and great value, but also higher profitabilities and synergies.","We're also pleased to report that our marketing test initiatives are doing well, and results are encouraging. What we are learning is that our radio and print spend work well outside the times when we're on television. This strengthens the continuity of our brands in the minds of our customers. We'll continue to closely monitor our marketing spend as we move into the fourth quarter. Our key store operation performance indicator improved in the second quarter also. Our store teams are benefiting from longer, more focused district manager store visits.","So in summary, we're executing throughout the organization, and it all shows in our financial results. Not only do we have good momentum coming out of a very productive second quarter, but we also have a variety of new catalysts to drive our business into the second half of the year. Among our merchandise initiative that we are excited about are Miracle Links, which is the perfect pendant for new moms, symbolizing the birth of a new child. We're also proud to announce a new partnership with ALEX AND ANI, which will test in 108 Jared stores beginning in mid-September. ALEX AND ANI is a leading edge trend-right fashion collection that is very popular with the millennials and a natural traffic driver.","We also have the Chosen Diamond, which is a program that we'll test in 60 Jared stores this fall, and is expected to resonate with the sentimentalist customer that Jared attracts. It provides documentation from rough to finished polished diamond, so customers know the steps of their own diamond's journey.","Vera Wang Love continues to do very well on our Zale stores. The cross-selling effort tested so well in Jared that Vera Wang Love will now roll out to all Jared stores this fall. We also will be one of select jewelers who will sell Star Wars fine jewelry and beads this holiday season which will be sold in our Kay stores. And in late October, we intend to launch a new must-have jewelry product that we first referenced at our Investor Conference in June. This collection will be \u2013 which will be in all of our national store banners in the United States, the United Kingdom, and in Canada will be supported with one of our most comprehensive marketing programs in the history of our company.","And speaking of marketing, we applied many of our recent customer segmentation learnings. For instance, Zales will have a new TV creative campaign with higher media weights called Diamond Kind of Love, which has tested very, very well. Kay marketing will be focused in classic to resonate with the gifter customer profile. And Jared will begin running semi-annual special events to launch new products, and in order to stay relevant with select customer who seek value opportunities.","We'll also test a new store design for Zales and for Piercing Pagoda, and we'll continue growing the latest concepts in store design for Kay. Again, all of these designs are lined with our segmentation learnings. And we'll continue to drive custom jewelry, with a new jewelry technology for custom in our Zale stores. These were just some of the many catalysts that we are investing in throughout Signet, and we are just getting started, and there are many, many more to come.","So, on my final slide, I want to take a minute to reiterate a few important points about our favorable position in the jewelry space. Our people are getting ready for the busy fourth quarter selling season. We have just completed successful district manager meetings in preparation for our managers' leadership conferences. Our conference preparations are nearly complete, and there's great excitement around this year's agendas and this year's exciting new initiatives that will be driving home for our field operation organization.","Our pipeline of merchandise is tested and full, we have a variety of line extensions, and new programs designed to be fresh, exciting, consistent with our strategy, and relevant with our core customers at each of their shopping occasions. The merchandise will be supported with new marketing creative that has been placed extremely thoughtfully to maximize its impact. And all this has culminated to generate momentum behind our business as our same-store sales have improved throughout the quarter.","In closing, our business is strong, and this was also recognized by Standard & Poor's as Signet was added to the S&P 500 during the second quarter, which is a great honor to us to be added to this iconic index. I'm extremely confident in Signet's prospects for the near-term, the medium-term, and the long-term.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michele for a run-through on our financials.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you Mark, and good morning everyone. So, let's start with our second quarter sales performance. Signet's total sales increased 15.1% and comps increased 4.2%, above our guided comp range of 2% to 3%. So let me share with you some additional color on our sales and comp performance by division.","So in our Sterling division, total sales increased 5.9% to $858.5 million, which included a same-store sales increase of 3.3%. Sales increases were broad-based across store banners, product brands, and non-brands, as well as omni-channel. Bridal and diamond jewelry also were particularly strong. The average transaction price in Sterling increased by 4.2% and the number of transactions decreased by 2.5% due to merchandise mix.","Our Zale division total sales were $389.3 million for the quarter, which included a same-store sales increase of 5.8%. We saw a particular strength in branded bridal and branded diamond fashion. Sales increases were also favorably impacted by our continued integration initiative around sales associate training, targeted promotional events, and new marketing creative. Also, keep in mind that the prior year quarter had 26 fewer days due to the acquisition occurring on May 29, 2014.","At our UK division, total sales decreased 2.3%, but increased 6.4% on a constant exchange basis. Sales were $159.1 million with a comp sale increase of 5.1%, and that was driven primarily by Ernest Jones. Both UK store concepts reflected strong results in bridal and watches. The average transaction price increased 4.3% and the number of transactions also increased by 1.8%, driven by merchandise mix.","As mentioned in our earnings release this morning, the second quarter comp sales were favorably impacted by 60 basis points associated with an operational change that we made to align Sterling's extended service plans or ESPs with Zale's, in which we viewed Zale as having a best practice related to the extended service plans. This operational change that related to ring sizing triggered a change in the revenue and expense recognition rates associated with our ESPs. So previously, in the Sterling division, the cost of ring sizing for customers who had purchased an ESP were not included as part of the extended service plan claims. So now, since this alignment, the cost for ring sizing for customers who purchased an ESP are included in claims cost.","For those customers who elect not to purchase an ESP and need ring sizing, a nominal fee is charged for this service. So, the net impact is that more sales and profit are now recognized earlier within the Sterling division ESP sale, and this change is entirely non-cash. So again, this operational change is just another example of Signet sharing best practices across the organization. Excluding the impact of this ESP change, Signet's comp sales would have been 3.6%, 60 basis points above the high-end of our guidance.","So, moving on from sales, let me walk you through Signet's consolidated Q2 performance before we turn and analyze Signet's adjusted results. The table you see on Slide 9 provides a reconciliation of Signet's adjusted results to consolidated results. Now, the difference between adjusted Signet and Signet are the columns reflected purchase accounting and transaction costs, which include our integration-related expenses.","So, starting on the right side of the slide, on a GAAP basis, EPS was $0.78 per share, and that was lower than our guidance due to the legal settlement of $34.2 million related to the Zale acquisition appraisal rights matter. This settlement is recorded within transaction cost as SG&A, and the settlement finalizes the appraisal litigation and no further costs associated with this litigation are expected to be incurred.","The next column, however, reflects our transaction costs. Transaction costs were responsible for $0.46 of EPS solution, and that's inclusive of a $0.39 impact from the appraisal settlement we just spoke of. Purchase accounting adjustments, which reflect a reduction to deferred revenue, amortization related to the inventory fair value step-up, and amortization of unfavorable contracts were diluted to EPS by $0.04. On an adjusted Signet basis, the farmost left column on the slide, EPS was $1.28, higher than our guidance of $1.11 to $1.16.","Now, we'll discuss our adjusted results in more detail momentarily, but first let's turn and look at our operating income by division. For the second quarter fiscal 2016, operating income was $100.8 million or 7.2% of sales, reflecting a 20.7% increase over prior year, and that also reflects a 40-basis point increase in operating margin rate.","Components of operating income consisted of the following: Sterling Jewelers was $157.8 million or 18.4% of division sales, reflecting a 21.5% increase over prior year and that was up 240 basis points in rate from last year. Zale operating loss was $2.1 million or 0.5% of division sales and that's inclusive of purchase accounting adjustments. Zale's performance consisted of a $2 million loss for the Zales Jewelry operating segment and a $0.1 million loss from the Piercing Pagoda operating segment. Now excluding these adjustments, and you'll see this in a moment on slide 11, the Zale division operating profit was $3 million, or 0.7%, of adjusted division sales.","Our UK operating profit was $3.2 million or 2% of division sales, and that's up 130 basis points from last year. Other, which primarily consists of our corporate and administrative expenses, and Signet's diamond sourcing subsidiaries, includes $43.6 million of transaction costs, which also includes the $34.2 million related to the appraisal settlement.","So, now, this is the last quarter that we will show the detail of the Zale operations. Next quarter, we will provide Zale details that are consistent with our other divisional disclosures, as we will have fully comped the acquisition. So, the presentation on slide 11 takes adjusted Signet, which is shown on the far right, and then breaks it into two parts. One part is Zale operations, which is shown in the middle column, and the second part in the left-hand column, is adjusted Signet, excluding Zale. Adjusted Signet, excluding Zale, is the rest of Signet and inclusive of finance interest and taxes.","So, from sales to operating income, this gives you comparability to prior year results. In addition, the information is provided to give you visibility as to how the Zale operations performed in the second quarter. And again, I would just remind you that the prior year Q2 had 26 fewer days as the acquisition occurred on May 29, 2014.","So, continuing on, let's look at Signet's adjusted P&L results below the sales line. Adjusted gross margin was $500.1 million or 35.3% of adjusted sales, and now was up 100 basis points, driven principally by higher sales, favorable commodity costs and merchandise synergy initiatives in the Zale division. Excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet gross margin rates would have been 35.7% and that's up 90 basis points, principally driven by favorable commodity cost and partially offset by net bad debt due to higher credit sales in the Sterling division.","Adjusted SG&A was $413.4 million, or 29.2% of adjusted sales, up 80 basis points due to the incremental investments in Zale, principally surrounding advertising, information technology support and employee benefits. So excluding Zale, the adjusted SG&A rate was 27.5%, favorable by 10 basis points over last year. This was driven by store payroll leverage and nearly offset by higher central costs, primarily related to legal fees associated with the appraisal settlement. These legal fees associated with the appraisal litigation will no longer be incurred on a going-forward basis.","Other operating income was $62.8 million. This increase of $9.1 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances.","Adjusted operating income of $149.5 million, or 10.5% of sales, reflect an 18.8% increase and up 30 basis points in rate. This growth was driven primarily by the increase in sales and gross margin. Importantly, excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet operating margin rate would have been 14.4%, leveraging up 170 basis points. This result shows the operating leverage inherent in our business model. Adjusted EPS was $1.28 compared to $1.07, an increase of 19.6% driven by stronger than expected business performance, a lower tax rate and operational change associated with the extended service plans that I discussed earlier. The impact from the extended service plans change was $0.05 on adjusted EPS in the quarter.","We repurchased $60 million of Signet stock in the second quarter and that's in line with our capital allocation plan. At the end of the second quarter, there was $183.7 million remaining under Signet's 2013 share repurchase authorization program.","So, now let's move on to the balance sheet and we're going to first start with inventory. Net inventories ended the year at $2.4 billion, an increase of $68.9 million. This 2.9% increase over last year was driven primarily by first, new store growth; secondly, our diamond sourcing initiative. We continue to become more vertically integrated by procuring more rough diamonds to meet the needs of all of our divisions and to support our strategic initiative to be best in bridal. And finally, those factors were offset in part by strategic initiative to increase Zale inventory turns.","Through focus on eliminating slower turning SKUs and increasing merchandise that's more relevant to Zale's influence customers, we are making significant strides in streamlining the division's inventory. Signet ended the quarter well positioned in inventory as we move into the third quarter ahead of the holiday selling season.","So, now, we'll turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Net accounts receivable increased to $1.5 billion compared to $1.3 billion last year, and that's up 13.5%, driven by higher sales and an increase in Sterling's division credit penetration rate.","Year-to-date, credit participation was 61.6%, compared to 60% last year. The increase in credit participation was attributed primarily to credit decision engine improvements and strong customer acceptance of our credit offerings. The average monthly collection rate was 12% compared to 12.4% due primarily to three reasons. First, our customers continue to opt more for our regular credit terms, which do require a lower monthly payment compared to the 12-month interest-free program. And second, as our mix of bridal increases due to our Best in Bridal strategy, this creates a higher average receivable. Our required scheduled payments do not increase proportionally with the higher merchandise mix shift. And third, just like other consumer loans, more principal is paid off later, so as our portfolio has grown more in the last year, proportionally, more of it will be paid later.","Net bad debt expense for the quarter was $49.5 million and that compares to $41.8 million last year, an increase of $7.7 million, and that's driven primarily by the growth in receivable balances from the increased credit penetration and the change in the credit program mix.","Other operating income was $62.8 million compared to $53.7 million last year. This was an increase of $9.1 million and is due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables as well as a shift away from interest-free programs. So, the net impact of these two items was income of $13.3 million compared to $11.9 million in the prior year, or an increase of $1.4 million. The portfolio continues to perform strongly as evidenced by the net impact of our bad debt and other operating income.","The allowance as a percentage of AR of 7.3% increased over the last year due to timing. That is, in Q2 last year, accounts receivable grew due to the credit decision engine introduction, but the bad debt that would come with any AR growth lagged, so this created an unusually low percentage last year, which we are now lapping.","So sticking with the subject of credit, just a few comments regarding the third-party credit in our Zales stores. We are really looking forward to transitioning through our new partner, Alliance Data Systems. And this transition is expected to occur around fiscal year end, which is a change from our original projection of October.","All the financial and operational virtues of having ADS as our partner remain in place, but will be deferred just a few months due to some administrative issues. We're very pleased that Signet's in-house credit team will be testing a second look credit in late October for Zales stores. Following a successful test, we expect the in-house credit team will fully support all Zale U.S. stores for the holiday selling season.","So, let's move on to financial guidance for third quarter. Signet's third quarter comparable store sales are expected to increase 3% to 4%. Third quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.36 to $0.40, which does include a modest favorable impact of $0.03 from the extended service plan revenue recognition change. From an effective tax rate standpoint, Signet's fiscal 2016 annual rate is anticipated to be 28% to 29%.","Our capital expenditure guidance for the full year remains at $275 million to $325 million and our net selling square footage is projected to grow approximately 2% to 3%. I would also reference you to our news release for further details on how the capital is to be directed. We remain increasingly confident in achieving our synergy targets for FY 2016 as well as our three-year period.","And as we noted in our Investor Day, we see the long-term potential for Sterling operating margins to reach 19%, Zales to reach 15%, and the UK 10%. This represents a substantial margin opportunity in our business. We are very pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you, Michele. In conclusion, we're seeing terrific collaboration throughout all of Signet. Our business continues to gain momentum. Current trends are strong and we are increasingly confident in our ability to achieve our synergy targets. In fact, we're already starting to see the benefits of synergies impact our operating results. And I want to congratulate and thank all of the Signet team members for a great second quarter. We are well positioned for the second half of the year and for profitable long-term growth as direct result of the passion and the dedication of our Signet team.","And with that, we'll now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Congratulations on a really spectacular momentum and all the efforts ahead. Mark, on the products side, you had a lot of great announcements with ALEX AND ANI and Star Wars and the Must Have jewelry item. How do we prioritize which ones will be the biggest drivers for the newness on holiday on a year-over-year basis? And do you guys expect a similar kind of composition in comp between the mix impact and number of transactions as we look forward to holiday?","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","First of all, thank you, Oliver, for the kind words. As far as prioritizing the newness, they all are just part of what's going to get us to have a wonderful fourth quarter. We're obviously very excited about partnering with ALEX AND ANI, it's a test. But our new Must Have program is something that is a first for us and we think this will really move the dial also and is something that would \u2013 is going to cross all of our national brands. So we're very excited about that.","And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, this is the most we've invested into one launch in the history of our company from a marketing perspective. So the new exciting Must Have program is definitely something that we're all excited about. We're excited about all of our new \u2013 some programs could increase traffic and some can just increase average sale. We're just excited about all of them. As far as the...","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. In terms of the comp mix between your average transaction \u2013 price and transaction, our goal and our view of the pipeline of product innovation that Mark talked to is that it's going to drive both of those.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. The favorable commodity cost side, I know in the past, you can use that strategically to also reinvest in the business or engineer product differently, but we're seeing continued good trends there. What's the \u2013 what should we model going forward for how that may impact your gross margin?","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Oliver. So again, I'll just start with \u2013 and I feel like a broken record, because I think I say this every quarter on the call \u2013 we don't give guidance in terms of our gross margin, or break down that gross margin in terms of what the expectations are from lower commodity costs. But what I would tell you is that we expect and we'll continue to see a benefit from the lower commodity prices rolling into our gross margin rate.","The other thing I would just add to that is, remember that we are on an average cost method, so benefits don't always immediately drop to the P&L, but what we're seeing with this longer sustained gold \u2013 particularly as it relates to the gold commodity cost, we should continue to expect to see benefits coming in from commodity pricing.","The other thing I would just add real quick on that, Oliver, is when you look at \u2013 and this was really exciting for us \u2013 when you look at our gross margin, particularly on the Zale side, we're also being impacted by all the great synergy initiatives that we have been and the teams have been working so hard on. So, we're really seeing that take root in terms of a gross margin. I know Mark and I have previously talked about discount controls, we have that up and running. So, besides the commodity pricing which will definitely take the benefit of that, we're really reaping the rewards from our synergy initiative.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And just finally on that topic, why did you \u2013 what would you say as has made you increasingly confident in the synergies, it feels like a more optimistic tone and I guess it's because you've been experiencing more about what's possible. I just wanted to get a context for the upticked optimism in the synergies.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Sure, Oliver . If you think about it, as we've said, Zales has just now comped one year. And so, the more and more we get to, A, know the Zales business; and B, our team \u2013 we have a team that we call a transformational leadership team, is getting their arms around all the opportunities and our teams across our organization is just getting more and more confident and seeing more and more opportunities. And the more we get our systems to enable us, just gives us that more confidence. So, yes, we feel more confident about hitting our synergy goals for a lot of the above reasons, our team members, the benefits of technology and us, just to understand the business that much better every month.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And I would just add to that really quick, Oliver, that the other thing that's also increasing that confidence and albeit it was still relatively immaterial for the quarter, but we are starting to see those synergies flow a little bit faster into our financial results than we originally expected. So, everything that Mark said combined with that is really giving us this increasingly confident view.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. Thanks, Michele. Thanks, Mark. Congratulations and best regards.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you, Oliver.","Operator","The next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Lindsay B. Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Good morning.","Lindsay B. Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wanted to ask about your \u2013 the improvement in comp momentum in Sterling, specifically in Jared, if you could just maybe give a little bit more detail on what drove some of the sequential acceleration. I know that, particularly against an industry backdrop that seems like it's struggling a little bit more, and maybe some detail on how the cadence of comp was across the quarter? Thanks.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you, Lindsay. First of all, we're very happy with the momentum of our Jared business. As good retail merchants do, we investigated everything what's going on in our Jared business, as we do with all of our business, and we're able to test certain different programs. As we stated in the last call, we tested new radio marketing vehicle, it seems to be doing well, as I mentioned in my prepared comments. We have new products that we've been testing, whether it be the Vera Wang Love that I shared with you or the Miracle Links that I shared with you.","And in our business, it's always about the people, and our operational team came up with a focused, targeted effort as it relates to in-store customer experience and they were spending more times in the stores. And lastly, we have tested some targeted promotions that were more targeted to dealing with the customers in Jared. So a combination of all of the above is why we believe that Signet's Jared division is continuing to do well. And we feel pretty good about the Jared business going into the fourth quarter also.","Lindsay B. Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And would you be able to provide any detail on the cadence of comp across the quarter? And then, just a follow-up question I have is, it's exciting to hear about the ALEX AND ANI testing, can you help put into context, you said 108 Jared stores, maybe how when you've tested prior initiatives, whether it's Vera Wang Love or even when you started with PANDORA, how those testing \u2013 how that testing looked in comparison, and how, as you ultimately went to full rollout, what we should think of in terms of timing of getting those in stores and incrementality of comp? Thanks.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Sure. First of all, Lindsay, we don't comment on the cadence of our comp increase, so I can't talk to you about that. As far as the ALEX AND ANI test, first of all, the test begins in our Jared stores, 108 of our Jared stores in September, so we have no data as of yet. But I will tell you that 108 stores out of our Jared portfolio of roughly 250 stores is a pretty healthy test for us, and we feel pretty good about ALEX AND ANI. But again, it's a little bit less than half of the portfolio of Jared, but we feel good about it. We're excited about the opportunities of our team members to work with ALEX AND ANI, and we're looking forward to seeing some new millennial customers walking at our door, looking for this fashionable product that's something we really haven't offered in the past. So, we're very excited about the test and we'll update the market on this when we get to the season.","Lindsay B. Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks so much.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Stephen Albert - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. This is Stephen Albert on for Lorraine. I just wanted to get a little bit more. On the fashion-wide launch, the channel-wide fashion launch that you're planning for, for holiday. How has the initial test been going for that? And then also a second question on the synergies, you mentioned you're seeing them rolling in faster, how much did you recognize of the 20% this year in the quarter? And then, how about a breakdown across gross margin and SG&A.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Okay. I'll take the question about the fashion launch, and Michele will talk to the synergies and the gross margin. As far as the fashion launch, you need to understand that we've done a lot of research. And so we had first started with customer research as it relates to the product and the concept behind the product, and our research was just phenomenal as well as any research that we saw and \u2013 than that we've had seen in the past.","Then we put certain items in the stores and a good test in all of our stores, it was tested very well. So, from our perspective, both from the research perspective and from the in-store test perspective, we think we've got a real winner here for the fourth quarter. And as I stated earlier, it will be announced to the public by the end of October or so. Michele, you want to talk to...","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, so in terms of the synergies and again, you're correct, what's made us much more confident in terms of our view of our synergies is we are starting to see those benefits roll in a little bit faster than we had originally anticipated. It's still overall, I'd say, relatively immaterial to the quarter as a whole. And on a net basis, the guidance we gave for our fiscal year 2016 was about $30 million to $35 million range, or 20% of the $150 million to $175 million. So that is largely to come between the Q3 and Q4 quarters, and we would anticipate that the realization of those synergies over those quarters would be somewhat proportionate to the size of those quarters.","The breakdown of what we're seeing at this point in time within the quarter has primarily been a lot of the benefits are coming in on the sales and the gross margin side. And the initiatives surrounding our training, targeted promotions, cross-selling, on the growth margin side, a lot of the work that the teams have been doing over the merchandise assortment, the discount controls that we talked about, a lot of those are really taking root.","Now, on the SG&A side, we're not yet quite seeing those benefits there, because what we're doing is making a lot of investments back into the Zale division to kind of support the sales and gross margin initiatives. So, these investments include what I talked about on the call, the advertising, the IT support. So, right now, there's a little bit of a lag between those investments that are sitting in SG&A and when we get the leverage on the sales side coming through.","Stephen Albert - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Next question is from Rick Patel with Stephens. Your line is open.","Rick B. Patel - Stephens, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning and congrats on the strong results in a tough environment.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Rick B. Patel - Stephens, Inc.","Lots of new products this fall. I guess what are you going to deemphasize in order to make room for these new initiatives? And then can you also remind us how much of the assortment represents branded products today, and how that's going to change going forward and also the margin implications of that?","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thanks, Rick. As far as what we're going to deemphasize, I wouldn't target anything specifically, it's just a matter of what we're going to focus on and we're going to react to what the consumers react to. So, I don't want to say that we're deemphasizing any of our product categories. It's just how we determine what goes on air and on TV and what is advertised in print. So, I don't want to say there's anything we're deemphasizing, I want to say there's a lot of exciting new programs that we will be emphasizing.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And in terms of the composition of our branded portfolio, it's about 32% on the Sterling side and then Zale, it's somewhat lower than that, which represents the opportunity and part of the initiatives that we've been working on over the past course of the year to increase that branded portfolio. We talked about the introduction that we made with the Unstoppable Love. So we'd expect to see that portfolio increase on the branded side.","Rick B. Patel - Stephens, Inc.","And then also a question on supplementing Zale's credit program. So based on the initial work you've done, can you put into context how many more credit transactions you might be able to capture versus what ADS is able to cover, any color on what that opportunity would be like going forward?","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So, this is really exciting for us. Again, I have to give kudos to our team, because they've really have done a great job in order to get everything up and running, in order to start the test pilot that we'll be doing in October. I can't really give you context in terms of how many more credit transactions. What we do know is ADS, they are actually able to approve at yet a deeper level than our current credit provider in Zale. With our in-house credit team, we're able to yet approve even at a deeper level over ADS. So, there is some benefit in terms of us becoming a second look provider to the Zale, so I would leave it at that.","Rick B. Patel - Stephens, Inc.","That's great. Thank you very much.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Simeon Siegel, with Nomura. Your line is open.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Congrats. Great results.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thanks, Simeon.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","So, anything you can share on the new Jared concepts, the new stores? Looks like there was a nice uptick in the new store productivity there. So, any color on how those are doing. And then just two quick clarifications from me. Mark, did you say that \u2013 in the prepared remarks, did you say comps improved throughout the quarter? And then Michele, just wanted to confirm that the current third quarter guidance doesn't include any ADS benefit? When did you say that should start hitting the P&L? Thanks.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","As far as the new Jared concepts, the Jared Vaults are doing very well. It's a Jared outlet concept and we're very happy with the performance of Jared Vault. Our Jared Jewelry Boutiques, we still have about, I think eight of them, still too soon to tell, and we're still watching the results of those. And we just opened up a Le Vian by Jared in Roosevelt Field up in New York and again, that just opened, it's too soon to tell. So, of the three Jared concepts, we're very happy with Jared Vault and we're still watching Jared Jewelry Boutiques and Le Vian by Jared.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","And then, Simeon, just point of clarification, because we have a lot of acronyms that are flying around. Did you say ADS or the extended service plans?","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","The Alliance. Yeah, yeah, sorry, the Alliance \u2013 the Alliance Data.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Okay, okay. I just want to make sure that I heard the question correctly.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","And also, Simeon, I did not talk to increasing comps during the quarter. So, I don't know where...","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","We just said our comps had improved throughout the quarter.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Throughout the quarter. We weren't specific about the cadence.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So, what I would say is, the guidance that we provided into Q3 incorporates any consideration of us doing the in-house second look program. And then as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the Alliance Data Systems, that will kick in towards the end of the year.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot guys. Best of luck for the rest of the year.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Simeon.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thanks, Simeon.","Operator","The next question is from Joan Payson with Barclays. Your line is open.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on the great result this quarter.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you, Joan.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Joan.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I was hoping you could talk a little bit about bridal, because it sounds like that continues to outpace the total, especially at Sterling. It's half of the business now, but how high do you think it could ultimately be in terms of mix? And also, is that bridal growth of product of the overall market and category, or is Signet taking share at a faster rate than the overall business?","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Well, thank you for recognizing our bridal growth. We see bridal as a \u2013 our bridal category growth as a journey and something that we don't have a ceiling on. And we believe, and I've said this before, that in our business, it's the closest thing that we have as to a necessity, and that our bridal business continues to grow with enhanced customer service behind the counter, understanding how to connect with the customers as it relates to our bridal sale, which is very unique.","We continue to have new and exciting bridal brands that continue to do well with Vera Wang Love and Neil Lane continues to do well and Tolkowsky continues to do well. And we're always testing new bridal service both in our branded and our non-branded products. And we just believe that the bridal category for us is something that is a journey and that we will not have a ceiling.","As it relates to the market, the weddings have been pretty constant, not growing a lot, and what we're seeing is we believe we're gaining market share. And we believe we're gaining market share both from a unit perspective, but we're also seeing our average selling price of engage rings going up, and believe part of that is due to the consumers are getting engaged at an older age and it's benefiting us, and that we're selling a higher average bridal engagement ring, and we think that's something that'll continue going into the future.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And also could you talk a little bit about whether there has been any recent changes to the overall jewelry category momentum in the U.S. and maybe the promotional environment as well?","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","As far as the promotional environment, Joan, we're not seeing getting more promotional. I know as it relates to our business, what we're trying to do is take our promotional dollars and be more thoughtful and more targeted in how we are using those dollars and it's working. So as an overarching answer we're not seeing the industry being more promotional, and at Signet, we're being more targeted with our promotions.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Mark and Michele. Have a great day.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you, Joan. You too.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Joan.","Operator","The next question is from Scott Krasik with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, everyone. Let me add my congratulations.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you.","Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Just a couple questions, I guess. First, the portion of the synergies that you had always targeted relative to sales synergies. Are we seeing that now in terms of the introduction of Vera Wang Jewelry at Jared, are there other major things that we're going to see in 2016, and maybe talk about how you quantify that and how you're tracking to it?","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So let me start, and Mark, if you have any additional comments you want to add, feel free. So, we are starting to realize, as I mentioned, the benefits. I would say right now, a lot of it does relate to the cross-selling initiatives we put in place, and these synergies work both ways, right? So, particularly as we look at the Vera Wang, a lot of the initiatives we had on the Vera Wang side surrounding our marketing creative, the product assortment, we're seeing a benefit on Zale side of that. We're also, as Mark had indicated, on the Jared side with the cross-selling they are rolling that out to all of our stores. So, we're definitely well on our way as it relates to the cross-selling synergy goals that we had in place. We expect that that will continue in terms of our cross-selling initiatives throughout the remainder of the year and going into next year.","The other big element as it relates to synergies on the sales side that we had talked about was on the repairs. So, that is one that we're still working through that initiative as it relates to our repair sales, which there in a lot of underlying systems support that we really need to get that initiative up and running. So, there's been a lot of work that we've done to-date on that, and I think that's one that you would expect to see probably more so in FY 2017.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","And just to pile on, on Scott, the selling that Michele talked is definitely, exactly appropriate. Also, as it relates to selling, it's just \u2013 the synergies that we're sharing best practices in selling behind the counter is very important. Some of our best practice, relates to engaging with our team members, leadership conferences, career development schools, training, those are all the type of synergies that we're sharing with the Zales team, and we cannot talk enough about what's going on in our gross margin line. You saw what happened in the second quarter, our gross margins are a big part of our synergies. We talked about discount control. We talked about some mix factors. We talk about commodities. So, gross market is also a big part of our synergies going forward, and as you said starting off in the second quarter.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, and which is that one other thing I would just pile on is targeted promotions. So, this has been another great sharing best practice in collaboration among our divisions, relating to what we've referred to as our preferred customer or guest service event or event \u2013 sales events. So, we've had a lot of great learnings and synergy initiatives, and realizing the sales synergies associated with these targeted promotional events.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","And to pile a little more, because we are excited about this, because this needs to be said. What another nice thing that we're learning, speaking about promotions and other aspects of the business, is we're learning a lot from the Zale business. They've had some unique promotions that we're testing in Sterling, which is working well as we talked about the ESP operational changes, so it's going both ways from Sterling to Zale, and we're sharing that with our UK business. So, we are excited about the opportunities in the synergy area and feel very confident about those.","Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Awesome. And then, just last. Michele, I think you were maybe trying to temper expectations in terms of the pace of improvement in the Zales operating margins as we get into next year. But you said you're getting synergies maybe a little earlier than expected and you have this opportunity to be a second look provider, which will contribute something for Zale. So, maybe are you a little bit more optimistic in terms of the pace of the improvement in the Zales margins versus June?","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","I \u2013 so, what I would say, I mean I was very optimistic in June, when I talked about our medium-term and long-term operating margin opportunities associated with Zale, and that medium term being low-teens or call it 12% and long-term being 15%. I was very confident then and I remain extremely confident on our ability to achieve those goals.","Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. All right. Well, thanks and good luck.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you, Scott.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research. Your line is open.","Janet J. Kloppenburg - JJK Research","Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on a nice quarter. Just a couple of follow-on questions. With regard to ALEX AND ANI, I assume that's an exclusive assortment that you'll be marketing? And I'm wondering Mark, if it is successful, which I assume it will be, will that be a brand that could be transferred across other concepts in your brand portfolio? I also was wondering about the platform launch for October, what the ASP and margin profile of that, I believe it's a fashion jewelry launch, but I'm wondering if it would tally higher ASPs and margins that could potentially help to benefit the P&L more than we are expecting at this time? And lastly, Michele, on the commodity pricing, we're seeing gold pricing being pretty soft on a go-forward basis. So I'm wondering if that should provide some favorable input pricing for you next year in terms of gross margin gains? Thanks so much.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you, Janet. First, I'll make it very clear, I didn't say anything about an exclusive assortment from ALEX AND ANI. What I said was, we're testing ALEX AND ANI in 108 of our stores. I did not mention any type of exclusive assortment. As I've said, we're really excited about...","Janet J. Kloppenburg - JJK Research","Mark, I was asking whether or not they were developing a line exclusively for you or if it was product that was currently in their line?","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","It is a pride to working with ALEX AND ANI as in our stores, there's nothing that's exclusive and as of yet, and while working with ALEX AND ANI, we'll see how the test goes, and we're we are very excited...","Janet J. Kloppenburg - JJK Research","Okay.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","...about that opportunity. As far as the must-have product that we're going to have in the fall that we're kicking up at the end of October, we are very excited about it. We're not going to share price points or gross margins because we don't do that, but obviously, we see the benefits in getting incremental sales. And so, we're excited about the opportunity to bring in new customers and existing customers to find a new must-have products that will benefit on the top line, that's what we're looking for.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And then, in terms of the commodity pricing, yeah, assuming that we still have sustained softening in the gold price, we'll continue to be able to reap the benefits of a lower input or commodity cost going into the back half of this year and that would continue as we look forward into next year.","Janet J. Kloppenburg - JJK Research","Great. Thanks so much and good luck.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you, Janet.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Janet.","Operator","The next question is from Bill Armstrong with C.L. King & Associates. Your line is open.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, Mark and Michele. On the commodity costs, we know diamond prices has been under pressure. In general, if diamond prices are down, just take a number, 10%, does that have a kind of umbrella set on other precious gems as well \u2013 rubies, emeralds, et cetera? So in other words, do they tend to trend in the same direction?","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Okay. Let me start with the tail end a bit. No, they do not. Rubies and emeralds and sapphires, others semi-precious or precious gems do not have any indication on diamond pricing, they're not interconnected, and so let's start with that.","So let me give you a little bit of background of what's going on with the \u2013 in the diamond market. First of all, the diamond prices that \u2013 has been reduced, and what's happening with the diamond market is primarily what's happening with the \u2013 kind of the slowdown of what's going on in Asia and the Middle East. And the diamonds that are heavily sold in the Asia and the Middle East are higher quality diamonds than we sell at Signet. They're VS quality from a GIA terminology and better. And our quality of goods is not \u2013 as a whole, we sell VS \u2013 as a whole, we don't sell that higher tier of quality of diamonds. So the opportunities where diamond prices are lowering is really more in the higher-end rough and the higher-end polished goods. It doesn't mean there may not be an opportunity for us. But for right now, what's happening in the diamond market, those lower-priced opportunities are in the higher-end price or higher-end quality of goods. Now, also remember that we're, on a cost averaging perspective, that I'm sure Michele will talk about soon, so when and if we see opportunities to increase savings on our diamond purchasing, it takes a while to get through the system, I don't know you want to talk to that...","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, yeah, I mean just to add a second, when you think about our averaging cost method, we don't immediately recognize the benefits of lower commodity pricing, it also works inversely the same if there is higher commodity prices that doesn't immediately manifest itself in our P&L because of our average costing method. It's really \u2013 it's when we get into the sustained lower pricing or a sustained change in pricing that we start to see it come through the P&L, which is really the case on the gold side. We've now, for a good year now, we've been seeing the lower gold cost, and that is driving the benefits in our income statement.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Right, right, I understand the average costing method. So, just to be clear then, when you're talking about getting the benefits of lower commodity costs, in your case, we're really looking at gold and metals rather than stones?","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, yeah, that's absolutely correct, Bill.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Okay, okay. Okay. And then, just the one other quick follow-up on the ESP ring sizing adjustment. I think you said you had a $0.05 per share benefit in Q2, and we should see about $0.03 in Q3. Should we also see something like that in Q4 and Q1, and then it will anniversary after that?","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So, in terms of the impact that we talked in the prepared remarks, as you said about the Q3 impact \u2013 the modest impact there, when you think about the Q4 impact, we would anticipate again a modest impact on our earnings per share related to the extended service plan change. What I would say is, given that Q4 is our biggest sales quarter, that impact will be higher than what we guided in the Q3, but proportionately, it will be lower to EPS at a $0.07 impact.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then \u2013 again, you \u2013 once we get to Q2 of next year...","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","... then we're anniversary and we're on an even footing?","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Correct. That...","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","And if...","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","And that's definitely correct, Bill.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Stein with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Congrats on the quarter. And \u2013 so a couple of questions. Just to follow-up on Bill's question, is the expected savings from the \u2013 or the expected benefit from the ESP change in Q4 going to be larger, likely to be larger than it was in Q2? And secondly, is the expense impact of that embedded in gross margin or SG&A?","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So let me address that. As I just mentioned with Bill, we would anticipate the impact in Q4 would be slightly larger than Q2, just given the size, the higher sales volume we have in Q4, but in proportionate to EPS, would be substantially lower at $0.07 of an impact. In terms of the expense, that does fit in gross margin.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. Great. And the delay in the ADS contract, given the fact that you expect $22 million benefit on an annualized basis, should we just assume that there will be a negative $5.5 million impact roughly in Q4? And this is what we've been modeling.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So, not that we're ready to give Q4 guidance, but just to help you out on that front, Jeff, in terms of the prepared remarks though we talked about is, yes, ADS will be affected in January versus what we originally anticipated in October, and the financial virtues remain the same with a $22 million annual benefit related to the lower merchant cost. What we have done though is, with these second look credit actions that we're going to be taking in October with the plan that that will roll out before the holiday season, that would mitigate any deferral of impact from that ADS.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Perfect.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Does that help, Jeff?","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Yeah. That does. Couple of other ones real quickly. This transaction drop at Sterling of 2.5%, you alluded to mix. Can you amplify on that a little bit?","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, sure. So, let me \u2013 in terms of the transaction when I referenced mix, again, what we are seeing is more transactions in terms of our bridal and our higher selling price items and that, from a transaction standpoint, is someone offset by lower ticket transactions.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. And were your bridal units up in the second quarter, number of units sold?","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","I'm \u2013 let me just double-check and we'll get back to you on that one. I want to say, yes, that would be the case, but I don't have that information at my fingertips.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. And final question on marketing. For your new fashion product, are you putting out incremental marketing dollars or is this going to take away at all from other collections that you would normally spend X millions of dollars on it?","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Our impressions as a whole for all Signet in the United States will be up. And what we're doing is we are investing dollars in this new program that this is going to first time we'll cross over all three of our national brands. So, our impressions will be up, and will lead to determine what we put on TV, we make a very thoughtful decision as it relates to categories. And so, we feel very good about our portfolio in putting on TV and advertising this year.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thank you.","Mark S.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. James Grant, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","James Grant","Good morning. Yes, welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2015 call. On our call today is Mark Light, CEO and Michele Santana, CFO. The presentation deck, we will be referencing, is available under the Investor section of our website signetjewelers.com.","During today\u2019s presentation, we will in places discuss Signet\u2019s business outlook and make certain forward-looking statements. Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially.","We urge you to read the risk factors cautionary language and other disclosures in the annual report on Form 10-K that was filed with the SEC on March 27 of this year and in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q that was filed with the SEC on September 10 of this year. We also draw your attention to Slide Number 2 in today\u2019s presentation.","And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark.","Mark Light","Thank you, James, and good morning everyone.","In the third quarter, we delivered solid topline results. Signet comps increased by 4.2% led by the Sterling and UK divisions. From a merchandize perspective, Signet's branded bridal, fashion diamonds, and watches, all performed well.","Our strength by selling channel was broad based with outlets and eCommerce delivering strong results. Signet's third quarter profit as anticipated was diluted by the seasonally low sales volumes and high fixed cost of our Zales division as well as the UK to a lesser extent. Signet did not own sales in the third quarter of last year.","As a result year-over-year profit metrics were lower, but importantly, adjusted EPS of $0.21 exceeded expectations and when measured on an apples-to-apples basis versus last year, our EPS was up $0.05 or 11.9%.","Our acquisition integration activities are progressing well and we remain well prepared for the holiday season. I'll take you through some of our initiatives in a few minutes.","Let's now take a closer look at Signet's third quarter sales performance by our divisions and SEC operating segments. Sterling's third quarter total sales were $692.8 million that was up 9.7%. Same store sales increased by 6.8%.","Kay comps led the way with a strong 7.5% increase, while Jared increased by 6.5%. The Zale division delivered total sales of $331.4 million and a comp decline of nine tenths of a percent. This was due primarily to the late timing of new inventory replacing slow moving collections as well as some distractions from initiatives implemented in the third quarter to position us for the holiday period.","Our U.K. division's third quarter total sales were at $151 million, up 8.4% or 4.7% on a constant currency basis. Same store sales increased by 3.7%, which was by the way the best in seven years for the third quarter, which was driven by diamonds and watches.","Signet's sales growth was driven in part by eCommerce sales of $44.8 million, which is an increase of 96.5% due to the addition of Zale this year, but the growth rate was at 27.6% if you exclude our Zale division.","We've a variety of drivers behind our third quarter sterling results, most notably it was due to our sustainable competitive strength that include our superior customer experience, exciting merchandize offerings, creative marketing and a multi channel approach.","The guest experience is central to our success and we remain focused on the training and development of our store teams. We had a very successful and well received Managers Leadership Conference in the September, October timeframe to kick off our fourth quarter holiday preparations at the store level.","The main merchandizing initiatives which drove third quarter results in the Sterling division were bridal brands Neil Lane and Leo along with fashion brands Le Vian and Diamonds in Rhythm. We introduced new TV bridal ads in the third quarter, but the real payback for those ads will be in the fourth quarter, not only because of the fabulous new creative, but also because of the efficiency of the buys and the placement of those ads.","We also saw success across selling channels in eCommerce and outlets in malls and in free standing stores.","In the U.K., the initiatives around store operations, merchandize and an Omni-channel approach are all making a difference. We've made a variety of store operation improvements that are driving better sales productivity.","The U.K. sales increase was driven principally by the benefits of strategic moves we've taken around diamonds based upon a better understanding of our customers and the type of products, pricing and promotions that they require.","Our store team member training is more focused on diamonds. Our point of purchase displays are more powerful. We're dedicating more space to diamonds, and bridal diamond brands performed well such as Forever and Perfect Fit in our H. Samuel stores and Le Vian, Tolkowsky and Neil Lane in our Earnest Jones stores.","Our success in Diamonds and Bridal is not coming at the expense of watches. We're seeing increased results in watches with our luxury brands performing strongly. We also re-launched the H. Samuel and Earnest Jones websites in October. They are designed to be cleaner, deliver more content and education and present our brands better while maintaining the ease of use that we've always possessed.","In addition to eCommerce progress, the first few Earnest Jones outlet collection stores have opened, which is strengthening our U.K. multi channel approach.","Now I would like to talk about our Zale acquisition and some of the accomplishments that we've made recently. In the third quarter, the Zale division brought together almost 1500 of our store managers along with our field and home office leadership and this was the first time this was done in over 10 years and we brought our managers to focus in on our strategy and make sure they are ready for the holiday selling season.","All of our store managers underwent Vision 20-20 training to gain an understanding of how they fit into the wider Signet organization and to align their efforts to the company strategy.","The multi day's session featured a breakout session on best in bridal. The managers refresh their product knowledge around the division's two premier bridal brands, which are Vera Wang Love and the Celebration Diamond. With a focus on sales behaviors that drive improved closure rates. The meeting also provides the managers with tools to better coach and develop their teams in order to improve the guest experience.","We've also strengthened our fourth quarter marketing approach. Holiday TV started for Zale's on November 5 and for People's on November 10. Zale's and People's are our stores in Canada. Both have new commercials for Vera Wang Love and the Unstoppable Love program. In addition, People also has a new commercial featuring Arctic Brilliance, which is a Canadian mine diamond.","We also target our TV ad placements more appropriately to our customers. In addition our Black Friday activities, print advertising and in-store events are all much more robust. A study with Bain & Company is underway to increase our understanding of our store brand positioning, our value propositions and the opportunities for growth with the primary focus on our Zale, Kay and Jared store brands.","Regarding merchandize, we continue to test cross selling of certain collections. Some of the more high profile brands of Zale are testing in Kay and vice versa. We look forward to more actual data from the high volume fourth quarter.","We've also made some aggressive changes stepping up the merchandize mix of Vera Wang and Unstoppable Love and eliminating nearly 10% of the division's inventory in favor of faster moving collections, such as those I just mentioned.","We're making strides of an integration and I said in the news release this morning, we expect to deliver a $150 million to $175 million in cumulative three year synergies from January year end 2015 to January year end 2018 and I am confident about the position that we are in today and the position where we're heading.","As for the fourth quarter, we are ready to win this holiday season. We've several initiatives to drive business that are underway in each of our divisions. I spoke to you moments ago about the power and the value of the Zale leadership conference. We also completed conferences in our Sterling and U.K. divisions as well with just as much enthusiasm and accomplishment.","Also in the area of store operations, this will be an exciting holiday selling season for roughly a 150 new Kay stores that have our brand new Kay store design, which is shown here on Slide 8. The stores feature side by side selling, branded boutiques and innovative use of technology within the store. We've been testing this concept for nearly two years and after a very successful result, we've been rolling this concept out during the year and we'll continue to do so into the future.","In merchandizing, we've strong balance of line expansions and existing product brands and we're also testing two exciting new brands, Earthly Treasures Smithsonian collection in our Jared stores and Sofia collection by Sofia Vergara in our Kay stores.","In marketing, we've developed dynamic new creative for our TV ads including an ad that we produced for our Kay stores called Penguins that was ranked by advertising age as one of the top new ads in the first week of November. We've also launched new advertising creative for our H. Samuel stores in the U.K. and we've increased viewer impression in the holiday selling season for our store brands H. Samuel, Zale's, People's and Jared's.","In all our divisions, we believe we've improved upon our store events as well as the content and cadence of our seasonal promotions. And for my final topic, I would like to just say a few words on our diamond procurement.","Today we announced that we entered into an agreement with DeBeers. Our DeBeers site advances our strategic diamond sourcing efforts to the next level and following last year's purchase of a diamond cutting factory in Botswana we believe, as a DeBeers site owner that we're now far ahead of most of our industry peers.","We'll continue to expand our vertical integration and procure more rough or unpolished diamonds over the long term. This provides us greater access to supply and a growing supply and demand gap.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Michele for a run through on our financials.","Michele Santana","Thanks Mark and good morning everyone.","So let\u2019s start by reviewing the third quarter sales. Mark has just offered a similar overview of the numbers on Slide four, so I will point out just a few highlights.","In the Sterling division, total sales increased 9.7% to $692.8 million, which included a same-store sales increase of 6.8%. Sales increases continue to be driven by a balance between both the number of transactions and the average transaction price, the number of transaction and the average transaction price.","The number of transactions increased in Sterling by 3.7% and the average transaction price increased by 2.7% driven by fashion jewelry collections and branded bridal. Zale division total sales were $331.4 million for the quarter, which also includes an $11.5 million unfavorable revenue impact due to purchase accounting adjustments.","Under purchase accounting rules, Zale's deferred revenue was reduced on its opening balance sheet earlier this year by $90.5 million resulting in a permanent reset of the associated revenue to be recognized.","This adjustment will continue to have an unfavorable non-cash impact to Zale revenue over the next several years and will diminish thereafter. U.K. division total sales increased 8.4% or 4.7% on a constant exchange basis to $151 million and that was driven primarily by diamonds and watches.","The average merchandise transaction value in the U.K. increased 6.3% primarily driven by sales mix. In terms of merchandised transaction, the U.K. division decreased 2.9% driven by H. Samuel and that related to volume reduction in watches, gold jewelry and guests.","Moving on, over the next couple of slides we\u2019ll look at Signet\u2019s consolidated Q3 performance before we turn and analyze Signet\u2019s adjusted results. On Slide 11, the table provides a reconciliation of Signet\u2019s adjusted results to consolidated results. The difference between adjusted Signet and Signet are the three columns reflected purchase accounting, severance cost and transaction cost.","On a GAAP basis, EPS was a loss of $0.02 and that was per share -- and that was in line with Signet\u2019s guidance and this loss includes a $0.02 loss from unanticipated severance related to the CEO change, which is reflected in the table. Purchase accounting adjustments include a reduction to deferred revenue, amortization related to inventory fair value step up and amortization of unfavorable contracts or dilutive to EPS by $0.12.","Transaction cost including advisory, accounting and integration cost were responsible for $0.09 of dilution. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.6% and the forecasted effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 is 29.3%.","Next I'll walk through the breakout of operating income by division. Operating income of $10.7 million or 0.9% of sales consisted of the following components; Sterling Jewelers operating income of $68.1 million or 9.8% of division sales up 20 basis points from last year, Zale division operating loss of $34.5 million or 10.4% of division sales.","Note that the loss in the quarter is consistent with Zale's pre-acquisition trend of positing a loss in the third quarter given the relatively small amount of revenue in this period. Zale's Q3 loss consist of a $26.7 million loss from the Zale Jewelry operating segment and a $7.8 million loss from the Piercing Pagoda operating segment.","Now that does include cost of $13.6 million related to purchase accounting adjustment, which we just discussed on the previous slide. Excluding the impact from accounting adjustment, the Zale division's operating loss was $20.9 million or 6.1% of division sales.","The U.K. operating loss was $2.7 million or 1.8% of division sales, reflecting an improvement of $1.7 million from last year and was the best Q3 operating performance in four years. This performance is attributed to a focus on growing topline combined with cost control measurements.","Other primarily consist of our corporate administrative expenses and Signet's diamond store sale subsidiaries and also includes $11.4 million of loss related to transaction and severance cost. To help provide comparability to last year, we're also presenting our results on an adjusted basis, which excludes a purchase accounting adjustment, severance cost and transaction cost.","The presentation here on Slide 13 takes adjusted Signet, which is shown on the far right side and is shown on Slide 11 and then breaks it into two parts. One part is Zale operations shown in the middle two columns and the second part in the left hand column is adjusted Signet excluding Zale.","Adjusted Signet excluding Zale is the rest of Signet inclusive of finance interest and taxes. From sales to operating income, this column gives you an apples-to-apples comparability to prior year results. In addition, the information is provided to give you visibility at how the Zale operations performed in the third quarter.","Now recall that we had guided for sale EPS dilution of $0.19 to $0.21. Actual dilution was $0.17 resulting from higher margins and lower expenses than planned in the quarter. We anticipate providing this incremental detail for you until we establish precedent for Signet results post acquisition when we lap these numbers in the third quarter of next year.","Continuing on, let's review Signet's adjusted P&L results below the sales line. Adjusted gross margin was $363.9 million or 30.6% of adjusted sales and that was down 40 basis points versus last year. The decrease in rate was driven by the addition of Zale, which impacted the gross margin rate by 80 basis points. Sterling and U.K. gross margin rates were higher by 50 and 80 basis points respectively and that was due primarily to lower commodity cost and leverage on store occupancy cost as a result of higher sales.","Adjusted SG&A was $381.7 million or 32.1% of adjusted sales and that was up 190 basis point versus last year. Again this increase was driven mostly by the addition of Zale, which impacted the rate by 110 basis points. The remainder of the increase in rate was attributed primarily to the timing and store operations expense and incremental advertising in Sterling and U.K. divisions.","In addition, higher central cost associated with headcount and bonuses also impacted the SG&A adjusted rate. Other operating income was $53.5 million. This increase of $7.7 million was primarily due to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances.","Adjusted operating income in the third quarter was $35.7 million or 3% of adjusted sales. Excluding the impact of Zale, Signet operating margin was flat to last year at 6.7%. Adjusted EPS was $0.21 compared to $0.42 in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. On a comparable basis that is when excluding this year's impact from the newly acquired Zale and capital structure and financing, EPS was $0.47 or an 11.9% increase over last year.","Now let's move on to the balance sheet and let's start with inventory. Net inventories ended the quarter at $2.7 billion an increase of $1 billion or 62.6% over last year's third quarter. The increase was driven almost entirely by the acquisition of Zale.","To a lesser extent, inventory levels were also impacted by Sterling division increases around bridal brand expansions, lose diamonds and new stores. We believe our inventory level and assortment are well positioned for the fourth quarter.","Moving on, let's turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. In-house credit remains an important component of our Sterling division's business and a competitive advantage. Net accounts receivable increased to $1.29 billion compared to $1.12 billion last year, up 15% driven by higher sales and an increase in the credit penetration rate.","In the year-to-date, credit participation was 61.7% compared to 58.9% last year. The increase in credit participation was attributed primarily to credit decision engine improvement made in April of this year, higher outlet credit participation and strong guest acceptance of our credit offerings.","The average monthly collection rate year-to-date was 12.1% compared to 12.3% last year as guests continue to opt more for our regular credit turns, which requires lower monthly payments as opposed to the 12-month interest free program.","Next I\u2019ll move on to credit statistics focusing on year-to-date metrics, which minimizes the effect of seasonality. Year-to-date, our net debt expense was $105.8 million compared to $92.9 million last year or an increase to $12.9 million and that was driven primarily by growth in the receivable balance from increased credit penetration and change in the credit program mix.","Year-to-date other operating income which is a primarily financed charge related was $161.2 million compared to $139.1 million last year, an increase of $22.1 million and is due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables as well as the shift away from interest fee program. So the net impact of these two items was income of $55.4 million year-to-date compared to $46.2 million in the prior year, an increase of $9.2 million.","Operating improvements made to our decision engine has helped increase credit penetration without adversely affecting the net impact of our bad debt. The portfolio continues to perform strongly and as evidenced by the allowance as a percentage of ending accounts receivable decreasing 10 basis points from 7.5% to 7.4%.","Now let\u2019s move on to some other highlights on the balance sheet. We now carry $1.4 billion of long term debt. The debt is very cost efficient at an average interest cost of 2.6% and our finance trust includes a balanced mix of short, medium and long term debt. In the quarter we used $145 million of our credit facility for seasonal inventory needs and we anticipate that this will be fully repaid by fiscal year end.","In terms of Signet's capital structure we continue to evaluate our working capital and cash flows associated with Zale. During the third quarter we did make some minimal share repurchase and we will look to the results of the holiday selling season and that will change fiscal 2016 share repurchases. We ended the third quarter with cash of $87.6 million.","Now let me share with you our guidance. Fourth quarter Signet comparable store sales are expected to increase 3% to 4%. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.95 to $3.05 and adjusted EPS is EPS less the two sets of adjustments shown on slide 19 being purchase accounting and transaction cost.","Now within adjusted EPS Zale operations are expected to be accretive in the fourth quarter by $0.36 to $0.40. Annual adjusted EPS is projected at $5.51 to $5.61 and that is up from the previous full year guidance we provided of $5.38 to $5.54. And the fiscal 2015 annual effective tax rate is anticipated to be 29.3%.","Capital expenditures guidance for the full year is $240 million to $250 million and net selling square footage is projected to grow 45% to 47.5% inclusive of Zale or approximately 4% when excluding Zale. I would also reference you to see our news release for detailed by store comps.","That concludes my prepared remarks on the financials and now I'll turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark Light","Thank you, Michele.","In conclusion, I would like to thank all of our Signet team members for their hard work, their efforts, their focus on our business plans and for their contributions to a successful quarter. And now we\u2019ll take time for some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Simeon Siegel with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks, good morning guys, nice quarter.","Mark Light","Good Morning, third quarter.","Michele Santana","Simeon Siegel","So, given the increase in Sterling gross margins despite everything about promotional environment, how do you view that gross margin line going forward into holiday and then beyond? How do you think about the commodity costs?","What benefits do you see from a more rational pricing environment given that you no longer have a meaningful competitor? And then just regarding the replacement of the nonproductive inventory of Zale, when do you see the opportunity to get the new product fully ramped up? And maybe any thoughts you can share on the road to deposit comps, EBIT growth, etc. for Zales? Thanks.","Michele Santana","Sure, so why don\u2019t I start with on your gross margin question? In terms of the gross margin and how we see that going forward, again for the holiday season at this point we don\u2019t anticipate it to be more promotional any more so than last year. We do see the benefits coming through of our lower gold cost which will continue to help the rate that's offset slightly by some of the lower trading recovery we get with the lower gold cost.","Directionally what I was saying is that on our full year basis we would expect to I'd say broadly maintain maybe some slight increase and our gross margin rate driven by the combination of the lower commodity costs I just spoke about as well as sales mix associated with that.","The other thing I would just add to that real quick, in terms of gross margin rate on our primarily more so on our UK Division is again we really remain focused on driving incremental gross margin dollars in that business and less so on the rate. So I would just add that, and I'll turn it over Mark if you want to address the second question on the unproductive inventory.","Mark Light","Sure. Hi Simeon. So as far as the inventory for the months of primarily September and October we pulled back over $100 million of slower turning inventory out of the Zale stores and the Zale Division.","We have been obviously buyback the goods and we believe are fully up to speed now getting those goods back in the place and the goods we're investing back and as I mentioned in my comments are programs like Vera Wang, programs like Unstoppable Love, programs that we believe they were not backing the inventory as well as they could to maximize sales and that all is in place right now and pretty much has gotten in the stores by the first of November. So\u2026","Michele Santana","Yeah, I would just add that there was a little bit of the timing how we originally planned and how it actually occurred with a little bit slower back-ended in the third quarter, but as Mark indicated we're fully ramped up at that inventory in the fourth quarter.","Simeon Siegel","Great, thanks a lot guys, and good luck for the holiday.","Mark Light","Thanks Simeon.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Stein with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 Kushan Akhtil","Hi guys this is [indiscernible] for Jeff. I just had a question on any takeaways from the cross brand selling test? Are the test stores both in malls they will overlap and where there is a single store may have seen any cannibalization? Thank you.","Mark Light","Yeah, in reference to the cross-selling, first of all just to remind everybody, we put Sterling and we put Zale brands in fifty of our case stores and Kay stores and 30 of our Jared doors and we also put Neil Lane and we put Le Vian and Jane Seymour and 50 Zale stores and we have it at also 30 Peoples doors.","And it is way too soon to take a read on it. We've got basically in our stores we've been in each of those divisions for the last two weeks or so, it is way too soon to read. At the end of the fourth we'll get a better sense of what's going on, on that front. So long answer to your question is it is too seen to get any read as of yet.","James Grant","We'll take the next question please?","Operator","The next question is from Rick Patel with Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead.","Rick Patel","Hey, good morning everyone, congrats on the strong momentum into holiday.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Rick Patel","Can you talk about your promotional cadence that you are planning for holiday? I know last year things were a little tricky with the winter storm during the key promotional time. So how do you expect to approach things this year? And then secondly, how do you feel about the health of your consumer in general just given we've heard so many discretionary retailers talk about difficult trends so far in the fall?","Mark Light","Okay thanks Rick. As far as our promotional cadence, we as Michele mentioned, I mentioned we don\u2019t, we're not going to promote any more this year over last. We don\u2019t see any reason to do so. We thought that you can tell by our results our customers are doing just fine and that we don\u2019t see any reason to promote more.","We are going to do for specific of the Zale divisions we are going to be, have a little more direct and targeted promotions to the customers that we know and how they react. So you'll see some different promotions from Zales than the previous years, but it won't be any more deeper discounts or any more promotion promoting going on.","So the cadence will be the same as last year for our Sterling and UK Division. Zales, you'll see some differences we specifically have the new batches coming out in the middle of December which is what we called preferred customer weekend promotion which we believe gives our sales associates and our Zale Division an opportunity to trade off and add on through more of these promotions that they've had in the past. The second, that was\u2026","Michele Santana","If a customer, in terms of you know how our customer or our kind of customers are doing it, again we are seeing that customers are turning up at our stores.","Mark Light","Yeah, we believe because our customers are much more of a premeditated customer, meaning that they either know that they have to get a Christmas gift or a birthday gift, or an engagement ring, so it's a premeditated type of shopping experience and they are thinking about it.","And due to our incremental advertising that worked well we have been doing and we will be doing and we believe that with our better creative and better placement of our ads that we\u2019re able to get that premeditated customers thinking about giving, gift giving into our stores more so than our competitors sell due to our extra advertising, our great customer services, some of the new brands and extension of brands that we\u2019re offering to our guests and customers.","Rick Patel","","Got it and then a question on the diamond supply contract, can you just touch upon how this is going to affect cost of goods over the next year or so? Given that the strategic initiative is it safe to assume that you'll incur some higher costs to insure diamond supply in the future?","Mark Light","","I\u2019m going to start off just kind of give a little bit of overview and let Michele talk about the effect and cost of goods. First of all, for us this is a very exciting event. We\u2019ve been as a retail company been really working on getting a DeBeers site for years. And the benefit of partnering with a company like DeBeers who is still the leading diamond miner in the world is they really understand rough.","And what they, they have the ability of assorting the rough literally in over 10,000 different qualities and when you can get rough assorted the way DeBeers assorts rough and makes it easier for us to have better quality type of criteria that works better for our customers and the type of diamonds that we sell.","So it\u2019s really a big thing for us to get into DeBeers site and get the wonderful assortments that DeBeers can offer and they can really cater that box as I called it or the site more so for our customers.","So the big initiative and the strategic initiative is really first and foremost is about getting the control of the supply and understanding the rough supply market. Now obviously there will be some benefits in gross margin and COGS I'll let Michele talk to that as far as the future and the benefits of that.","Michele Santana","","Yeah, yeah, in terms of how we would expect to see that impact our cost of sales, we really don\u2019t go and disclose the numbers and how it is kind of moving through in our expectations, but to Mark's point we are going to be able to buy diamonds more efficiently and more effectively.","So there will be some benefit that shows through on our gross margin line items. It really is though, about securing our source and a consistent source of diamond supply. It is I would say first and foremost the primary benefit of our arrangement with DeBeers.","Rick Patel","Thanks very much and good luck this holiday.","Mark Light","Thank you, have a good holiday.","Michele Santana","","Thank you.","","Operator","","The next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Hutchinson","","Thank you, good morning.","Mark Light","Good morning.","Lorraine Hutchinson","I noticed that the Zales standalone operating margin was flat this last year and I just hoping you can provide some context around that?","Michele Santana","Yeah, Lorraine hi, it's Michele, good morning. In comparing to last year again, there is a few things that you have to take into consideration because it really isn\u2019t an apple-to-apples comparison. There is a number of things flowing through their operating margin which no longer seems to be the case and one item I'd call out there is the LIFO they are on the LIFO system no longer that is a part, so you would have an impact in last year versus this year.","Kind of pulling at us out I would say roughly when we look at the comparisons to last year it's kind of what we would have expected, you know given we are really just starting to get our arms around this business, putting on an initiative, gaining traction as we move forward. So we weren\u2019t expecting to see a major, I guess bump or increase in operating margins at this point when you do even get a down to an apple-to-apples basis.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Great, thank you.","Michele Santana","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","The next question is from Joan Payson with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joan Payson","Hi, good morning and congratulations on the strong quarter.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Joan Payson","So it looks like the Zales dilution this quarter was a little bit better than anticipated. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about where the upside came from if there was any shifting of costs? And then also in terms of the outlets it looks like the remaining conversions are now finished between the Ultra Stores and the Jared, so if you could please talk a little bit about the outlet performance in the quarter and what that looked like?","Michele Santana","Yeah, so why don\u2019t I start in terms of Zale dilution, it was favorable as you indicated $0.02 to the guidance we had provided and that was primarily driven by they were higher margins than what we had planned and I think some of that we\u2019re starting to see the early signs of even this reengineering thing, the merchandise assortment that the sales mix is bringing in higher margin. So we\u2019re starting to see some of that already take shape in the Q3.","The other part is on the expense side, and it wasn\u2019t so much I would say a shift in cost from Q3 to Q4. But it was really lower expenses than what we had planned. One of it related to the leadership conference that expense actually did come in lower than what we had planned.","We\u2019ve also had some benefit coming in on our broken and damage inventory. So by pulling out the unproductive inventory from the stores, we\u2019re actually seeing the benefit with lower cost associated with broken and damage inventory, so that would be the other expense that came in favorable for us. And with that then Mark if you want to address the second question.","Mark Light","Yes, in reference to the Ultra Stores we don\u2019t report the Zales part separately. I will tell you that within our Sterling division we are very pleased with Ultra performance, they're doing very, very well. And as you stated we no longer have any Ultra Stores.","The whole Ultra portfolio in our Sterling division are either Kay outlet stores or the Jared Vault stores and they are doing very well. We\u2019ve learned a lot from the best practice over the two years of what is the best way of operating outlet stores or and how they are supposed be operated and then it's really working out very well for us.","We\u2019re also very excited that in our UK division we are going to open this year about half a dozen brand new Ernest Jones outlet collection stores first time for that division and that will be open here and we see opportunities opening more of those into the future.","In our Zale division we\u2019re looking for to working closer with the Zale outlook stores to try to share those best practices that we\u2019ve learned over several years and looking for some upside opportunity for the Zale outlook going in the future.","Joan Payson","Great, thank you.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Dorothy Lakner from Topeka Capital Markets, please go ahead.","Dorothy Lakner","","Thanks and good morning every one. Just wanted to talk about marketing, if you could just refresh us in terms of the increase in the dollars spend year-over-year? And then just in terms of the timetable going forward on Zale you know you\u2019ve been to able to actually effect quite a bit of change very early on in this acquisition.","So just wondered what we should be looking for as we move into 2015 and beyond? What kinds of things you want to accomplish and what\u2019s the timetable there?","Mark Light","Thanks Dorothy. I\u2019m just covering your last question and I\u2019m going to kind of get you kind of actually a little differently. We were able to make some changes for Zales in the fourth quarter. Just to remind everybody we just took over Zales in June and a lot of plans were in place and the inventories are in place and there\u2019s certain things that we are able to effect, such as the marketing buy, we\u2019re able to buy the Zales TV along our Kay and Jared buys we're able to make them more efficient, more productive buyer we believe, where as we are also able to place the Zale ads which we believe were more targeted appropriately towards the Zale customer than they have done historically.","So we\u2019re able to change the advertising of it and we are going to increase impressions on Zales TV this year, year-over-year it will increased impression for Zales, so we got more efficient by better targeted advertising placements towards what we think is the appropriate customer segment. And we have new creative for Zales, but we were able to make some changes not loads of changes.","We have to keep every ground in that, we\u2019ve only owned the company for several months and a lot of things were in place. We are still confident and feel very good about the changes and the enhancement we can make over the next two and three years.","But for the fourth quarter we were able to change some advertising as I stated, we\u2019re able to invest in some more inventory at Vera Wang and some other faster-turning vehicles, and we\u2019re able to start training the team members and some of our best in bridal training tactics and really that\u2019s the a lot of stuff we\u2019re able to do there\u2019s a lot more to be done going into the future.","Michele Santana","And Dorothy just to give you a little bit more color in terms of marketing spend, in the quarter our ratio on that percentage of sales on marketing was up about 50 basis points over the prior year and that's driven by a combination of increases in our Sterling division which we had increased over bridal in Q3 this and something focus on our UK division as well with our H. Samuel TV ads and then there was also an increase in terms of the Zales division and the investments that we made in the marketing side.","So from a dollar prospective it is an increase of about $15 million and about 50 basis points increase and just in a quarter to date basis. Just to kind of give you a sense on our year-over-year basis, we\u2019re up our ratio was actually as a percentage of sales is flat to last year, but we\u2019re up about $33 million and again that\u2019s kind of driven by increases across all businesses, but significant dollar increases by bringing in Zale this year.","Dorothy Lakner","Great, thanks so much and good luck for holiday.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","","Operator","The next question is from Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Ike Boruchow","Hi everybody. This is actually, Tom Nikic on for Ike. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering about the SG&A expenses. I noticed that excluding Zales they were still up 13%.","I was wondering if that's just marketing or if there was something else going on there? And then my second question was about merchandise margins by geography, I was wondering if there was a meaningful difference between the US and the UK if one was up big or anything like that? So thanks very much.","Michele Santana","Sure, so let me start with on your question on SG&A and yes, our adjusted basis and when you pull out Zale, we did have an increase in SG&A in the Sterling and UK divisions and that was primarily driven by higher advertising cost. We talked about the investments we made in the Sterling division around Bridal in Q3.","The other component was timing related to store operations expense, primarily the leadership conference and when those expenses hit this year as opposed to last year. And then the other element in there that impacted the adjusted Signet rate when you exclude Zale is our central cost which is higher than last year and that's driven by a couple of factors.","One is associated with headcount increases and the other component is associated with bonuses and just overall performance hitting our higher bonus percentage.","And then I think your second question related to merchandize margins and really we have steered away from and don\u2019t disclose merchandize margins in total or really across divisions.","I would just reference you back to overall our disclosures on the gross margin basis where we did see an increase of 50 basis points in gross margin on our Sterling division and then the offers on increase of 80 basis points in our UK division, again that was driven by leverage on our store occupancy costs as well as we did see benefit coming in on our lower commodity costs particularly the gold.","Ike Boruchow","All right, thanks very much and good luck for holiday.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Michele Santana","Thank you, I appreciate it.","Operator","The next question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen","Thanks a lot, congratulations and Mark congrats on your elevated role.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Oliver Chen","Regarding the longer term picture with the Zale Corp opportunity on increasing sales productivity, is the main category there opportunity bridal? And then I did have a question on the comp guidance, should we assume that the run rate may be similar between in the Zale Corp and negative single versus Sterling?","And you guys had volatility last year on week-to-week basis, is there anything, do you anticipate the run rate being volatile off of those comparisons in terms of what you're seeing in the marketplace now?","Mark Light","So okay, so I think those are three questions. I'm going to start with the first one which the question was in reference to, if we believe the big opportunity for Zales in relation to merchandize assortments is in the bridal category, and I will say yes, we believe there is an opportunity in the Bridal category.","There is no question that they are one of the top bridal brands in Vera Wang in the country as it relates to the bridal engagement rings and we believe there is opportunity to really take Vera to next level, invest in the inventory, invest in marketing, invest in in-store training in the whole bridal category. But we also believe there is great opportunities in the other parts of business.","We think there is big opportunity to enhance their fashion assortment and enhance their fashion diamond business. We think that there is a scenario of the business they really haven\u2019t done a really great job in and we think there is upside potential there.","And there's a lot of other parts of the business that there is great potential that we believe there is great opportunity in enhancing the repair business which is a very important business in our industry as it relates to not only because of this nice margin that this has been more importantly, that when you fix a customer's heirloom piece they could be a customer for life in how you take care of their repair item is just that if not more important than new merchandize product.","And there is a lot of areas of the business that we'll share with you going down the road over the next two to three years that there is a lot of opportunity outside of just the bridal assortment. So that's the answer to that question. ","Michele Santana","Yeah and Oliver maybe I can jump on your question in terms of the cost items we provided and what I would steer you to is really we're providing the cost guidance on a total basis with all of our business divisions we're really not breaking it down between say Sterling and the UK division. So with that maybe just add a little bit color and I think your thought process is kind of right on in line.","But we do expect that we'll continue to maintain our strong sales momentum in our Sterling and UK division. The other thing that I would add too is bear in mind in the UK division we are up against a high hurdle rate of last year.","Last year fourth quarter was 5.7% and that when we started to launch and that we focus on the selling of our diamonds in the bridal components that we do have a higher hurdle there on the UK side.","And again I would just steer you back to Mark's earlier comments on the Zale that even that we do believe we put in initiatives or gaining traction for the holiday period, it really has been a short time period since owning Zale and we're only able to effect so much within this time period.","So we're being cautious on Zale and particularly the sales line during this holiday selling season. And then I think Oliver, you had may be one more question on the run rate or the volatility week by week leading up into the holiday selling season.","Oliver Chen","Yes, I know last year you gave certain degree of flexibility for the store folks to give compelling values to customers. So as you anniversary that, just are your thoughts on volatility may be a factor in terms of how comps are manifesting?","Mark Light","No, I think as we sit today Oliver and I own the right to change their mind depending on what happens out in the next eight weeks or so or six weeks, right now no.","We believe that we are positioned well and we won't have to use that tool like we did last year because if you remember last year, although a lot of it was because we had horrible, horrible winter storms and one of the biggest weekends -- and one of the biggest promotions we have in mid December. So we felt we lost a lot of that momentum because we lost all those customers in the East Coast.","So we use some flexibility on making sure we closed some deals to customers that missed out on that event due to weather. So we gave our stores the opportunity to discount more. Unless there is a weather issue or something happens in the macroeconomic environment, we don't believe we're going to need to use those same tactics this year.","Oliver Chen","Okay. Just our final question is congrats on the strategic sourcing initiative. Is that across all grades of diamonds? Were there particular grades where you felt supply versus demand was particularly important to ensure that? And do you see yourself having more vertical integration going forward? What are the next steps as you look to the challenges that the long-term may face in matching supply and demand?","Mark Light","Yes just to remind you and everybody that this rough initiative of ours is in our best case scenario this year maybe 10% of our total diamond purchases or total lose diamond purchases and longer term, we will never get to any way near the majority of our purchase.","We need to stay in the polished diamond market. It's an important part of the market, but we do plan on growing this initiative further and we've stated up to 20% of our -- up to 20% or more of our needs will come out of this initiative.","As far as the grades, it's primarily that right now because we're getting from DeBeers in the open market are primary the nicer qualities called SI1 and better and so it's really going into heavier, into our Jared division.","We'll stay in tune to the market place. We would like to get into more qualities, but right now it's more in the higher end type of goods that we're getting through this particular initiative.","Oliver Chen","Okay thanks. Best regards for the holiday season.","Mark Light","Thank you. Same to you.","Michele Santana","Thanks Oliver.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Light.","Mark Light","Thank you. Thank you to all of you for taking part in this call. Our next event for the investment community will be our holiday sales call on Thursday, January 8, when we will review our November, December sales announcement.","I want to wish all of you a very happy and healthy holiday and Thanksgiving and thanks again. Good bye.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"19117":["Signet Jewelers Limited (NYSE:SIG) Q1 2020 Results Earnings Conference Call June  6, 2019  8:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Randi Abada - SVP of IR","Gina Drosos - CEO","Joan Hilson - CFO","Conference Call Participants","Rick Patel - Needham & Co.","Simeon Siegel - Nomura Instinet","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo","Tracy Kogan - Citigroup","Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group","Westcott Rochette - Evercore ISI","Operator","Good morning. My name is James and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Signet Jewelers Fiscal 2020 First Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I'd now like to turn the call over to the SVP of Investor Relations, Randi Abada. Please go ahead.","Randi Abada","Thank you, James. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. On the call today are Signet's CEO, Gina Drosos; and CFO, Joan Hilson.","During today's presentation, we will make certain forward-looking statements. Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. We urge you to read the risk factors, cautionary language and other disclosures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form10-Q. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly update forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a discussion of the non-GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, investors should review the press release we posted on our website.","I will now turn the call over to Gina.","Gina Drosos","Thank you, Randi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call.","To begin, I would like to thank all of our team members who provide outstanding customer service every day and who are doing important work delivering our Path to Brilliance transformation initiatives to our customers.","In my remarks today, I'll start by discussing first quarter results and then move on to progress of our transformation. I'll wrap up with some brief comments on our financial guidance. Our first quarter results reflect progress against the year two Path to Brilliance priorities we announced on our last call. We continue to improve our operations, while navigating through a very competitive U.S. retail landscape with soft traffic trends and a difficult UK macro environment.","While it is early in the year, we continue to grow e-commerce sales, are beginning to see some momentum on our fashion product performance and our commitment to cost discipline is positively impacting operating profit. Additionally, we've made solid progress on inventory management and generated strong free cash flow in the quarter.","Here are some highlights of our first quarter performance. We delivered same-store sales growth at the lower end of our guidance range, with total company same store sales down 1.3%, e-commerce was up 12.6% in our North America banners, excluding James Allen and up 5.3% on a consolidated basis. James Allen experienced continuing pressure from the implementation of sales tax.","In brick and mortar, we continue to see softness in transactions and high levels of competition in key promotional periods. We continue to execute on our new product strategy to build bigger, iconic and inspirational flagship brands, offer a highly competitive assortment for value-oriented shoppers, especially during holiday periods and deliver relevant on-trend products. In the first quarter, we continue to see benefits from the ongoing refreshment of our assortment with a percentage of sales from new merchandise increasing year-over-year in North America.","In bridal, our flagship brands Disney, Vera Wang, Neil Lane and Leo were up high-single digits, offset by some softness in non-branded bridal and continuing declines in legacy collections. Fashion sales were up across all our North America banners, with on-trend gold and our in-house designed Love + Be Loved collection positively contributing to growth in fashion.","Turning to profits and cash flow. Our first quarter non-GAAP operating profit performance was similar to last year, reflecting broad scale cost efficiencies, some benefit from the timing of SG&A expenses and an increase in advertising. We stabilized North America merchandise margin in the quarter despite a highly competitive environment in key promotional periods and implementing a strategic effort to lower inventory.","As I discussed on the last call, we are focused on generating higher free cash flow in fiscal 2020. In the first quarter, free cash flow was $80.8 million versus $1.8 million in the prior year first quarter, largely driven by improvements in working capital, together with disciplined capital spending.","We are implementing enhanced inventory planning under the leadership of our new CFO, Joan Hilson and our new Chief Merchant, Toni Zehrer. And we continue to expect inventory to be lower year-over-year at the end of fiscal 2020.","Now, I will discuss our Path to Brilliance transformation plans. We are underway on our fiscal 2020 growth initiatives under our strategic pillars of customer-first omni-channel and culture of agility and efficiency. These initiatives build on the foundational capabilities developed in year one of Path to Brilliance with investments in systems, capabilities, product assortment, and store experience funded by driving out costs customers don't see or care about.","Beginning with Customer First. In product, we continue to build our iconic and inspirational flagship brands. Our Disney partnership continues to expand with the inaugural film collaboration between Zales and Disney bringing the magic of the Aladdin Cave of Wonders to a real-life jewelry collection.","Our exclusive designs feature beautiful Jasmine-inspired design details and embodies the style and trends that the Zales customer expects. The Aladdin launch is performing well, and we believe it has elevated customer interest across the entire Enchanted Disney product portfolio.","In bridal, we continue to refresh the assortment with new designs for our flagship brands, Vera Wang and Neil Lane. Additional new core bridal designs as well as enhancing customer choice through the innovative virtual assortment now available in all Jared stores. We are seeing positive results from the refresh of our fashion assortment. Our on-trend new core assortment in gold continues to be a growth driver and our Love + Be Loved fashion collection is performing well. Love + Be Loved is Toni's first in-house design collection that was launched in a limited number of stores in the fourth quarter holiday.","We expanded the collection more broadly across the Kay banner during the first quarter, added color and personalization options and ran our first Loved + Be loved advertising campaign at Mother's Day. We are seeing early indications that Love + Be Loved has potential to grow into a meaningful proprietary fashion brand with several designs selling out after the marketing campaign began.","On a smaller scale, we are introducing more men's options across our product lines, including Gold, Love + Be Loved, Disney and Vera Wang. We've implemented full volumetric testing of new product lines, which is helping to shorten the product development cycle by giving us a faster read on the sales potential of new ideas. Several of the proprietary collections currently in test at select stores are showing encouraging early results as we build a competitive, differentiated product assortment for holiday and in fiscal 2021. ","While we are encouraged by the positive results of our new products in the first quarter. As I mentioned during our last call, fully evolving our assortment is a multi-year journey given the long jewelry purchase cycle. Customers are responding to our higher levels of newness, but we do have some headwinds to sales in fiscal 2020 from legacy products that are nearing the end of their life cycle.","Moving on to marketing. We've made strategic changes to our marketing model to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness. The timing of advertising spend has been rebalanced to a more always-on model to support bridal throughout the year and grow our share of gifting occasions, such as birthdays and anniversaries.","We expect to improve return on investment by moving to a higher mix of digital advertising, as well as more efficient targeting of spend. We invested in a customer data platform last year, which is providing insights that our new data savvy media agency will utilize as they work with our team to build more efficient and effective buying plans.","Additionally, new creative agencies for each of our core banners are helping modernize our content and messaging, while making progress in differentiating the brand equities. Recent new campaigns include Enchanted Disney Aladdin at Zales, the first Love + Be Loved campaign at Kay and an innovative, integrated bridal and fashion campaign at Jared.","We will launch summer bridal campaigns with new creative content for Zales and Kay and we have strong plans for new targeted data driven integrated campaigns for holiday. Our Voice of the Customer net promoter system, which was launched in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 continues to provide actionable data and insights.","During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, each North America banner reached its highest net promoter score since the inception of the program. Most importantly, we are seeing high levels of team member engagement with the program. Store managers receive real time feedback about performance in their store, which is a key enabler of elevating our customer centric experience.","Turning to omni-channel. In fiscal 2020, we are substantially increasing our investment in platform and mobile technology and continuing to build best-in-class customization capabilities. The Kay and Jared transitioned to Hybris, a significantly more contemporary dynamic platform already in use on Zales and Piercing Pagoda is currently on track and expected to launch in Q3 ahead of holiday.","The Hybris platform enables an enhanced customer experience with faster load speeds, higher quality images and improved curated search. Our second priority for fiscal 2020 is, our investments in mobile experience, which include faster load speeds, search and browse functionality and personalized curated product pages. These mobile initiatives are expected to go live throughout this year at Zales with Kay and Jared following post the Hybris conversion.","We are also continuing to build best-in-class customization capability, including the recent introduction of the Vera Wang Love tool at zales.com and enhancements to make our current design your own programs more mobile friendly.","In the first quarter, we saw the number of orders generated by our online bridal design your own tools nearly doubled and we believe the customization enhancements we are making this year will be positive contributors to e-commerce growth. We believe that these changes will set us up to drive higher traffic to our sites and create a much more compelling online experience across all of our North America banners.","Moving onto culture of agility and efficiency. We continue to focus on operational excellence, agility and creating a continuous culture of cost optimization, which we saw positively impact our first quarter results. We are raising our fiscal 2020 expected net cost savings to $70 million to $80 million versus $60 million to $70 million previously. With savings primarily driven by indirect procurement, workforce optimization and the lower corporate costs.","Our direct procurement negotiations with our vendors to lower our costs and optimize working capital began last year. And we are in the process of finalizing agreements which will impact our fourth quarter holiday purchases and also benefit fiscal 2021.","We are also testing field labor optimization initiatives to better service our customers by deploying our team members more effectively during peak periods. Our three-year Path to Brilliance net cost savings goal remains $200 million to $225 million inclusive of the $85 million in net savings achieved in fiscal 2019.","We continue to expect our category to be an omni-channel category with an optimized smaller portfolio of stores, representing a competitive advantage. We plan to close approximately 150 stores in fiscal 2020 and expect overall store count at the end of the transformation plan in fiscal 2021 to be lower than fiscal 2020 year-end levels.","By the end of our three-year transformation plan, we believe we will have materially reduced our exposure to lower grade malls and simplified our portfolio by exiting most of our regional banners, while developing new concepts to drive growth.","Before I turn the call over to John. I will briefly discuss our fiscal 2020 financial guidance. We are revising our same-store sales guidance range to down 2.5% to down 1.5%, reflecting first quarter results at the low end of our sales expectations, lower traffic expectations and sales trends we saw in May. We are revising our non-GAAP operating profit guidance to $260 million to $280 million, which embeds our revised same-store sales expectations and higher cost savings.","As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we made strong progress on lowering our inventory levels in the first quarter and expect to generate higher adjusted free cash flow in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2019.","Let me comment briefly on the subject of tariffs. The three tranches of tariffs that were enacted in 2018 have no meaningful impact on our business and are currently factored into our 2019 guidance. There is potential for an additional four tranche of tariffs, which could impact us. But because there is still uncertainty around it, we don't believe this issue warrants a change to our financial guidance at this point.","Our exposure to Chinese goods is approximately 30% of our merchandise spends. We are developing contingency plans to activate the flexibility of our multinational vendor base to minimize the impact on our business and on our customers.","While we do have flexibility in our supply chain, there is also a potential pricing impact to our US customers if these tariffs are enacted. We are hopeful for a speedy resolution and we'll continue to update you when there's more clarity on this matter.","In closing, we made progress in the first quarter stabilizing our North America merchandise margins, delivering cost savings and more efficiently managing inventory with a focus on cash generation.","We remain confident that Path to Brilliance is the right strategy to improve the trajectory of our same-store sales and drive higher profitability over the long term. The team is highly focused on executing our transformation initiatives and we look forward to updating you on our progress as we move through the year.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Joan.","Joan Hilson","Thanks, Gina. And good morning, everyone.","I'm pleased to be here today on my first earnings call as Signet's CFO. And I'm excited to join the Signet leadership team. I look forward to meeting with many of you in the months to come. In my remarks, I'll cover the highlights of our first quarter financial results, then discuss our guidance and conclude by sharing my initial priorities.","Beginning with our first quarter results. In the first quarter, same store sales declined 1.3%. North America showed strength in Piercing Pagoda and e-commerce, offset by softness in bricks and mortar in our larger banners. International results continue to reflect the challenging operating environment in the U.K.","Revenue declined 3.3% reflecting lower same-store sales, the impact of net store closures and the impact of foreign exchange. Gross margin expanded 220 basis points in the quarter and was impacted by a number of structural items. First, the outsourcing of our non-prime receivable portfolio resulted in a benefit of 320 basis points as we lapped two months of bad debt expense in the prior year quarter.","Second, there was an unfavorable impact of 65 basis points related to higher year-over-year sales of diamonds to third parties from our diamond polishing operations in Botswana. The sale of these diamonds that cannot be used in our own banners, with the objective of recovering our cost generates cash flow, but has an unfavorable mix impact on our gross margin rate.","We expect higher year-over-year sales of diamonds from our Botswana facility in the remainder of fiscal 2020 and have incorporated the margin rate impact in our guidance. And finally, as expected, there was an unfavorable impact of 25 basis points related to the timing of revenue recognition on service plans. Importantly, we stabilized merchandise margin in our North America banners this quarter.","SG&A was down on a dollar basis year-over-year, with higher credit costs due to outsourcing and incremental investments in advertising fully offset by lower staff cost on a smaller store base, cost savings and a timing shift in expenses of $5 million. SG&A was higher as a percentage of sales, reflecting deleverage from lower sales.","Non-GAAP operating profit was in line with prior year, with the benefits of credit outsourcing, largely offset by higher advertising investment as we implement a more always-on strategy. We continue to expect advertising spend to be down slightly on a full year basis.","Non-GAAP EPS of $0.08 reflected flat operating profit and a lower share count, offset by a more normalized higher tax rate versus prior year. We continue to expect a higher tax rate will impact our EPS during the remainder of fiscal 2012.","Moving to balance sheet and cash flow. We made progress in managing inventories with first quarter ending inventory up slightly versus fourth quarter levels, while continuing to bring in new assortment. Free cash flow was up $79 million versus a year ago, largely driven by inventory discipline.","During the first quarter, we adopted the new standard for lease accounting. Our prior financial statements remain in accordance with the old accounting standards, the impact of the adoption was recognition of operating lease assets of $1.8 billion and operating lease liabilities of $1.9 billion. The new standard does not have a material impacts to our income statement or statement of cash flows.","Now I move on to our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2020. We expect second quarter same-store sales to be down 2.5% to down 3.5%, inclusive of an estimated 35 basis points unfavorable impact of the Jared promotion that moved into the first quarter of this year from the second quarter last year. And an estimated 45 basis points unfavorable impact from a timing change to revenue recognition on service plans.","The guidance includes sales trends we saw in May and expectation of continuing traffic challenges, difficult U.K. macros and sales tax headwinds at James Allen. As a reminder, we have a tougher prior year sales comparison in the second quarter versus the first quarter.","Operating profit is expected to be $35 million to $40 million in the second quarter. This outlook reflects an expected unfavorable $7 million to $9 million impact from credit outsourcing, higher advertising and lower sales, partially offset by cost savings.","We lapped the non-prime transaction late in the second quarter. As a result, we will have higher credit fees and SG&A on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.23 to $0.30 reflecting a higher year-over-year tax rate of 16.5% to 17.5%.","Moving on to full year fiscal 2020 guidance. As Gina mentioned earlier, we are revising our full year same-store sales guidance to down 2.5% to down 1.5%. Please note, that the fourth quarter has an easier prior year comparison versus the earlier quarters. We are revising our operating profit guidance to $260 million to $280 million, reflecting our revised store sales - same-store sales outlook and higher cost savings.","Our operating profit guidance incorporates a flat overall year-over-year impact of credit outsourcing, inclusive of our expectations of an increase in the non-prime MDR in the second half of fiscal 2020. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $2.88 to $3.17. And as previously communicated, reflects a higher year-over-year tax rate and no share repurchases.","Now, I would like to make some comments on our outlook for inventory, free cash flow and leverage. We made progress on more efficient inventory management in the first quarter, but have more work to do to lower our inventory levels as we move through the year. We do expect inventory to be down versus prior year by the end of fiscal 2020.","In fiscal 2020, we believe improving our inventory position and focusing on disciplined working capital management will result in an increase in adjusted free cash flow versus prior year, exclusive of the prior year credit transaction proceeds. Now with respect to leverage. We ended fiscal 2019 with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR ratio of 4.3 times.","At the end of our transformation plan in fiscal 2021, we expect our leverage ratio to be approximately four times. This leverage ratio is calculated under our historical methodology, which includes lease obligations as debt under a five times rent methodology. For full details of our leverage ratio calculation methodology, please see our 2019 Form 10-Q.","Our fiscal 2021 leverage outlook is based on our guidance range for fiscal 2020. Our projections for EBITDAR and free cash flow and the amount of cash we want to maintain on our balance sheet.","To wrap up my comments, I'd like to share that after my first eight weeks, I believe there are real opportunities to drive value creation in a number of important areas. My early focus will be on driving cost savings to provide fuel for reinvestment in growth and enabling higher profitability. Unlocking working capital and opportunities primarily through more efficient inventory management and implementing robust forecasting and financial analytics.","And now, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rick Patel from Needham & Co. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Rick Patel","Question on your digital performance. So you're seeing lower comps for James Allen, but higher comps for e-commerce in the legacy banners. Can you just help us understand the disparity in your expectations for the rest of the year? And as we think about your product strategy at James Allen, would you consider selling branded merchandise there to reinvigorate sales?","Joan Hilson","So, we continue to expect growth in our overall e-commerce business for the year. As I talked in my remarks, our omni-channel strategy for the last over a year and a half has really focused on making improvements in the customer experience, both by reinventing our web platforms and by adding new functions and features, especially to the mobile experience, so things like our configurators which - we've seen the sales virtually double in those in just a year will continue to be emphasis for that program.","James Allen continues to add more states collecting sales tax. In the first quarter, California came on board, and so we expect continuing headwinds on James Allen for the rest of this year, certainly, as we weather all those changes in sales tax. We do sell branded merchandise on James Allen.","We have a number of designer bridal jewelry brands that we carry, and they do very well. We have a very discerning customer who comes to James Allen, nice transaction value, ticket value there. And so, we make sure that we're offering a broad range of not only high-quality diamonds, but also beautiful semi-mounts from different designers.","Rick Patel","Could you also touch on the outlook for gross margins? After the impact of credit outsourcing, it is completely in the base. How should we think about gross margin progression as we think about the various puts and takes? And big picture, where do you see the biggest opportunity to drive gross margin improvement for the underlying jewelry business?","Joan Hilson","So, the big picture response to that is that, as we drive through our inventory management program and effectively manage through our clearance, which is truly in the guidance that we've given for the year, we believe that as we continue to implement those programs that will be able to positively impact gross margin.","In the long term, the cost initiatives that Gina mentioned in her prepared remarks on procurement is also very important to improving the merchandise margin. And as we look at the - as we look at the stabilization of merchandise margin, and turn to growing our services business, that will also help us to have a positive impact on our merchandise margin.","Gina Drosos","The only thing I would add on that is, as you know, we changed our merchandise strategy last year. The first pillar of that is building differentiated proprietary brands, Love + Be Loved is being a good example of that. And so, we see that as an opportunity also to build margin over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel from Nomura Instinet. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Simeon Siegel","Can you - first off, any color you can give on the current comp trends just given the comments about the softening retail traffic? And then, Gina or Joan, just recognizing the significance that Q4 plays into your business model, can you help with what you are embedding for 4Q EPS within the full year guide? And then just lastly, Joan, just wanted to clarify did you say you expect the MDR to increase in the back half? Thank you.","Gina Drosos","Hi, Simeon. So, I'll start out and then I'll turn it over to Joan for, I think, your last two questions. On the first one, we have seen some softening trends in May that is embedded in our guidance. Consistent with many other retailers, we're seeing some softer traffic trends. We do continue to see a higher percentage of sales from our new merchandise. And as we work through some of our legacy collections and get a higher percentage of new into our stores, we think that we have - we are strengthening our closure opportunity certainly for the people who are coming in.","Also have a number of training initiatives going on with our field team. They continue to be one of our biggest competitive advantages, so that as traffic trends go down, we're still creating a differentiated and truly best-in-class customer experience in the store.","Joan Hilson","Simeon, to address the credit impact. As I mentioned in Q2 quarter, Q2 was the last quarter we lap the completion of the outsourcing of non-prime portfolio. So, we have additional SG&A costs related to sales to our non-prime customers with no offset for elimination of bad debt expense, which we had in Q1.","So, that's why it's higher in the second quarter. And then, I did mention in our comments that we have incorporated an expectation of an MDR change for the second half of the year into our guidance. And as a reminder, we have updated our credit guidance for full year fiscal 2020 to flat from flat-to-slightly down, given the performance that we saw in the first quarter.","Simeon Siegel","And then anything in terms of the Q4 EPS that's embedded in the guidance?","Joan Hilson","Well, what I can tell you is that, when you look at our guidance in - the guidance range for the year, on the low side, the first half is down 2.4%, in the back half on the low end is down 2.7%. On the high end, front half of the year is down 1.9%, and in the back half of the year, the high-end could be down 1.2%.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Go ahead please, your line is open.","Ike Boruchow","I guess to follow up on Simeon's question about May. Gina is there any way you could help us with where the softness is. Is it across the entire portfolio or is it more specific to one of the banners understanding that Jared has more headwinds than some of the others with the legacy bead business, Pandora business, just kind of curious if you could help us understand where that weakness is coming from.","Gina Drosos","Yes, what we're seeing is largely a decline in the retail mall traffic. We have a number of initiatives that we've put in place. As you saw from the first quarter numbers, the softness that we experienced was largely in James Allen and in Zales; James Allen, we expect to continue given the sales tax issues. Zales saw some softness on unbranded bridal, and so we've put some new programs in place to really shore that up from a product standpoint, and have a new advertising campaign as part of our always-on media model launching this summer.","So, I think we've got some good initiatives coming, but like all retailers, we saw softening in the traffic trends in May. The only thing I would add to that is that, as a reminder, we mentioned that there was a promo-shift from Jared into the first quarter from the second quarter of last year.","Ike Boruchow","And then just two quick ones for you Joan. On the SG&A, I believe you said there was some kind of timing shift that help you in Q1. I assume that's going to hurt Q2, was wondering if you could quantify that for us. And then I think you said, free cash flow should be up year-over-year ex the credit sales. So just to make sure my numbers are right does that mean free cash flow should be above, I think it was 120 million in free cash last year?","Joan Hilson","Yes that's accurate for the free cash flow for the year and then the SG&A was favorable by 5 million in the first quarter. We expect that to impact the balance of the year not fully in the second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citigroup. Go ahead please, your line is open.","Tracy Kogan","It's Tracy Kogan filling in for Paul. I have two questions, the first is a clarification, you guys mentioned I think 30% of your goods coming from China. And I just wanted to find out if that just on jewelry or does that include non-merchandise items like boxes and packaging. And then my second question was about the credit penetration, but within the credit penetration and whether you saw increased penetration of the leasing sales? Thanks.","Gina Drosos","So I'll take the first one the 30% referred to merchandise, there is additional but quite small impact on boxes packaging, things like that in the quarter and just like we are in merchandise we have a multinational supply chain. And so, we are looking at opportunities to work that with our vendors and reduce any impact to the company or to customers through pricing and now let Joan answer the second.","Joan Hilson","Well, we don't give guidance sort of the details around our leasing program itself our credit penetration. The plan participation rate was 50% versus 51.1% in the prior year first quarter. And just as a reminder, on the Q4 earnings call we guided to a slight decline in payment participation rate for the year.","Tracy Kogan","Any color you can give on the leasing, whether customers are, maybe you can quantify but just whether anecdotally customers are gravitating toward that choice?","Gina Drosos","Yes, we feel that leasing based on what we're seeing with the leasing option is a positive for us with the non-prime customer those that would have normally participated with that offering are migrating nicely to the leasing program. So we see it as a positive and a good offering an important to our customer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Go ahead please, your line is open.","Dana Telsey","I noticed on the commentary - and welcome Joan, that now there is \u2013 around 150 store closures before it was more than 150. At the end of the day, where do you want to be for each concept in terms of stores and anything different in the UK from here in the U.S. and is there more rent negotiation opportunity for you? Thank you.","Gina Drosos","So we are anticipating closing at or around the 150 stores this year. As you know last year we over delivered the guidance that we had given on store closures. So I think we continue to take a very disciplined and analytical approach to store closures. Looking at trade areas, looking at sales transference really making sure we are creating a smaller but more optimized store base since we see that as a competitive advantage.","What we have guided. Is that by the end of the transformation program the three years. We expect the store count to be lower than it was at the beginning. So I anticipate that this program of discipline will continue. At the same time, we work on growth concepts as well to be able to successfully make sure we're covering all of our banners and our customer base. Piercing Pagoda is an example of a banner that has consistently been growing very well.","And so we have a discipline around looking at new concepts on the other hand. In terms of UK versus U.S., we have store closures going on in both markets and the process is similar. And in terms of rent negotiations absolutely, we continue to leverage our scale and partnership with larger landlords to work on optimizing our space, but also negotiating rent reductions.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Omar Saad from Evercore ISI. Go ahead please, your line is open.","Westcott Rochette","This is Westcott on for Omar. Can you give an update on the bridal category where your bridal penetration is, as a part of your sales now versus a couple years ago and what you think is going on in that category?","Gina Drosos","Sure, so what I said in my prepared remarks is that our bridal category was down in the first quarter. We saw strong growth from our iconic flagship brand across the board. Neil Lane, Vera Wang, Disney, Leo, all of those were up high single digits. And so the newness that we're bringing, the emphasis on those proprietary brands has been important and is showing good dividends for us.","Non-branded bridal is where we saw a bit of softness in the quarter, especially in Zales and in Kay and then James Allen as you know is really 100% almost a bridal business. I mean it's really heavily skewed to bridal. In terms of penetration numbers, percentage of sales and things, that's not something that we have talked about.","Westcott Rochette","Could you say directionally versus a couple years ago, whether the penetration of bridal is up versus fashion or\u2026?","Gina Drosos","Well I think bridal is incredibly important to us and so we are working to grow both. In the first quarter, we saw some growth in the fashion part of the business, which was like \u2013 you know helpful and represents our strategy to build gifting especially at non-holiday periods and to attract female self purchasers into our business.","Westcott Rochette","And just one other question and far as the employees being up to speed incentivized on how to use the credit and implement the credit effectively. Where do you think the employee education and incentive structure is to employ all of the credit options available to the customers?","Gina Drosos","So I think now we have gotten to a mix of financial offerings for our customers. That represents a competitive advantage with you know the prime lending, the subprime lending and also the leasing program that we have in place. After we experienced some operational issues surrounding the conversion to that a little over a year ago we put more than 80 technology fixes in place and significant training for our in-store personnel and that's something that we haven't stopped.","We, in the first quarter had a four-hour training for all of our sales associates to work on how they present our different financial alternatives to our customers. So I see that as an ongoing opportunity for us to build that competitive advantage.","Operator","Since that there are no further questions. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us today. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"18955":["Signet Jewelers Limited (NYSE:SIG) Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call March 24, 2016  8:30 AM ET","Executives","James Grant - Vice President, Investor Relations","Mark Light - Chief Executive Officer","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Scott Krasik - Buckingham Research","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo","Simon Bowler - Exane","Anne Samuel - JPMorgan","Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company","Dorothy Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","Brian Tunick - Royal Bank","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Signet Jewelers Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded today, March 24, 2016 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. I would now like to turn the meeting over to your host for today\u2019s call, James Grant, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, James.","James Grant","Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 year end earnings call. On our call today are Mark Light, CEO and Michele Santana, CFO. The presentation deck we will be referencing is available under the Investors section of our website, signetjewelers.com.","During today\u2019s presentation, we will in places discuss Signet\u2019s business outlook and make certain forward-looking statements. Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. We urge you to read the risk factors, cautionary language and other disclosures in the annual report on Form 10-K that will be filed later today with the SEC. We also draw your attention to Slide #2 in today\u2019s presentation for additional information about forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures.","And now, I will turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Light","Thanks, James and good morning everyone. Signet Jewelers had excellent fourth quarter. Our results demonstrate our solid fundamentals and that we are managing all key operational aspects of the business.","I will start with a few remarks on our financial highlights leaving with details from Michele and then get into the operating highlights. Our total sales in the fourth quarter increased by 5.1%, which was significantly higher than the jewelry market as a whole. We not only gained share we gained profitable market share.","Signet comp sales increased by 4.9%, which was among the fastest growth of any U.S. retailers. Due to strong top line and prudent management of our expenses, our operating margin expanded by nearly 200 basis points and our earnings per share were up about 20% as well. Earnings growth was also among the top of the industry. While delivering a terrific fourth quarter, we also set the table for growth into the future. Our synergies from the Zale acquisitions are playing out faster than we first expected. We delivered $60 million of synergies in fiscal 2016, above previous expectations and we raised our multiyear synergy guidance. I will get to those details in a couple of minutes.","Next, I would like to discuss the sales drivers of the fourth quarter. There are variety of related and overlapping initiatives that drove the fourth quarter performance, which included innovative merchandising, cross-selling, engaging marketing and solid store execution with superior customer service. Results were led by our Ever Us program, which is our much talked about new jewelry collection, which is offered across all of our national brands and leverages our scale in the jewelry industry. We use our customer knowledge and our expertise in jewelry design to develop an innovative two-stone diamond ring collection with marketing that appeal to a broad range of customers celebrating life and expressing love. As for the future, the Ever Us collection is now testing line extensions for the Christmas of 2016 and we hope to highlight these innovations as the year progresses.","Earrings as well as bracelets, many of which innovative fastening systems were attached were also very successful in the fourth quarter. And bridal also grew in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s important to note that bridal business is a stable grower and insulates us from some of the volatility that traditional retailers face. Bridal brands such as Vera Wang Love, Neil Lane, Tolkowsky and the Forever Diamond, which is exclusively sold in our H.Samuel stores led the way. Marking initiatives such as our new television creative did very well. We applied learnings from our customer segmentation study, especially around Zales and Jared and increased our advertising ways. This brought our merchandise to life in the form of compelling stories, which really resonated with our customers.","A few comments on the drivers of our leading store banners. Kay Jewelers led the way with a 7.4% comp sales increase and a 9% growth in total sales. This strong performance on top of last year performance reflects a 2-year comp increase of 12%. Zales lured very strong results, driven by Ever Us and Bridal. Piercing Pagoda results were driven by gold, diamonds and religious jewelry. And Ernest Jones continued its momentum driven principally by diamond fashion and bridal jewelry as well as prestige watches. And lastly, the store operation processes that will enhance Zales and Jared during the third quarter appeared to help the fourth quarter results as well. Our team members have embraced change and we are very pleased with our store execution.","Our business performance since our holiday sales call resulted in a strong finish to the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. The momentum continued into the first quarter giving us confidence in what promises to be a strong fiscal 2017, which is reflected in our quarterly and our annual guidance. Since the holiday sales call, there has been a disconnect between our track record of strong financial results and our strategy for long-term success and the external market perception of our valuation. As such, we decided to pre-release our fourth quarter results.","We reiterate our capital allocation strategy with an aggressive buyback policy that will allow us to take advantage of what we view as a significant buying opportunity. We also considerably increased our dividend to reflect our strong flat cash flows and reward our loyal shareholders. The demonstration of long-term commitment that executive management has in Signet\u2019s business, the Board approved and fully supported by executive management an increased level of share ownership requirements. We raised our synergy guidance due to significant progress of integrating Zale within Signet. Initiatives are delivering favorable results faster than we first believed and we have a deep pipeline of work streams from which we deliver our numbers over the next 2 years. So, let\u2019s take a look at those numbers for a second.","As a result of the Zale acquisition, Signet will realize significant operating profit synergies. We increased our net synergies target to a range of $225 million to $250 million, which is nearly a 50% increase. Of the synergies remaining the next 2 years, we expect to realize 70% by January end 2017 driven principally by gross margin and operating expense synergies. We increased our expectation, because we now have been operating Zales through two holiday seasons and have much more confidence in the operations.","We have a larger pipeline of initiatives, more of them are working and they are working faster. Some of the big initiatives that have been going on or will go on this year include product sourcing, indirect material procurement, discount controls, promotions and event coordination, cross-selling, extended service plans, labor scheduling, TV and media efficiency, improve jewelry peers and much, much more. It\u2019s very important to know that our synergies are being realized in all of our businesses and all of our divisions, in multiple lines of our income statement and will favorably affect the financial performance of Signet for years to come.","So, let me give you a couple of examples. When you think about our Ever Us collection that was so successful this past quarter, it did largely well because of the credibility built by being sold in each of our national store banners or our repair business, which has been generating incremental profit because of our process changings, our in-sourcing, our technology upgrades and other factors and this phased-in approach \u2013 this is a phased-in approach, so it will favorably impact sales and operating expenses for years to come. By many messages that we are running Signet as one company, not a pre-acquisition entity and a new one, we are improving Signet results by running our overall business better.","With that, I would like to talk about last year. It was an outstanding year for Signet and I want to take a moment just to review some of the notable accomplishments in fiscal 2016. We made significant strides in transforming Signet from a company composed of three divisions with redundant infrastructure into one company supported by leaders who manage each functional area across the entire company. We delivered over $6.5 billion in sales, up over 14%. We were added to prestigious S&P 500 Index. We made important strides in cross-selling our powerful brands, such as Vera Wang Love and Neil Lane Bridal to increase their profiles. We introduced Ever Us, arguably one of the most significant innovations in the jewelry industry in years. Innovation in watches and fitness around the industry essentially activates a risk as a more high profile part of the body to accessorize. In response, Signet successfully sold bracelets with innovative fastening as well as our core watch brands such as Movado and Citizen.","After researching several ways that we could go about improving Zales repair business, we committed to a primary method whereby our Jared design and repair service centers will handle the vast majority of the volume. This change is newly underway and off to a very good start. We deployed learnings from our customer segmentation study into marketing, store design and selling techniques. Several synergy around gross margin contributed and we have a lot of one way left to go. We manage brands well, successfully extending merchandise lines led by Diamonds in Rhythm. Our store design team had several wins extending \u2013 testing new store concepts for Zales, Jared and Piercing Pagoda.","We elevated the efficiency and the effectiveness of our omni-channel approach to selling through greater personalization and customization, along with targeted digital marketing. We made significant enhancements to our selling process at Jared and Zales, which we believe improve their guest experiences. We gained significant market share profitably and expanded our operating margins along the way. And lastly, we allocated our capital very intelligently, increasing the dividend, repurchasing stock and maintaining liquidity and balance sheet strength. And everything that we are doing operationally is meant to maximize earnings per share growth for our shareholders, which we achieved by getting over 20% this year.","And with that, I will now turn it over to Michele to take a look at the financials.","Michele Santana","Thank you Mark and good morning everyone. So, let\u2019s start with our fourth quarter sales performance. Signet\u2019s comps increased 4.9% on top of a 4.2% comp increase in the prior year fourth quarter. Total sales increased 5.1%. And on a constant exchange basis, total sales increased 6.4% for the quarter.","Now, looking at total sales and comp performance by operating segment let me share some additional color. In Sterling Jewelers, total sales increased 6.9% to $1.45 billion, which included a comp increase of 5%. Sales increases were driven by particular strength in diamond fashion jewelry, including Ever Us, diamond earrings and bracelets. This merchandise mix is droving higher average transaction value of 6% with a decline in the number of transactions of 2.3%. Innovative collections typically with higher ATV, such as our Ever Us, sold faster and gained relative share within our portfolio.","The Zales jewelry operating segment\u2019s total sales increased by 2.2% to $577 million and 5.2% on a constant currency exchange basis. On a geographic basis, our Zale U.S. sales increased 6.3% and cost increased by 5.4%. Our Canadian sales declined 15.8% and 0.4% on a constant currency basis with comp sales decline of 0.8%. Canada sales were impacted primarily by the Western region of Canada, where lower oil and gas prices led to a recession earlier this year. Across stores, sales were driven primarily by diamond fashion jewelry and bridal. Now similar to Sterling, this merchandise mix drove a higher transaction value of 6.2%, with a decline of 2.1% in the number of transactions.","Piercing Pagoda total sales increased 8.3% to $78 million with comp sales of 6.4%. Sales increases were driven by gold and diamond jewelry and this merchandise mix drove a 10% increase in average transaction value, while transaction count declined 2.7%. Looking at our UK, in UK, our total sales increased 1.7% to $283 million or 5.9% at constant currency rate and included a comp sales increase of 4.7%. Diamond jewelry and prestige watches were the primary drivers of sales increases, which also drove a higher average transaction value of 3.7%. The number of transactions increased by 1.1% driven by diamond jewelry and beads.","So, moving on to the sales, we will look at Signet\u2019s consolidated Q4 performance before we turn and analyze Signet\u2019s adjusted results. So on Slide 10, the table provides the reconciliation of Signet\u2019s adjusted results to consolidated results. The difference between adjusted Signet and Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and transaction costs, which includes our integration-related expenses. Starting on the right side of the slide, on a GAAP basis, EPS was $3.42 per share, representing a 20.4% increase over prior year EPS of $2.84.","The next helm-over reflects our transaction and integration cost. These costs relate to consulting costs for integration, an acceleration of severance cost of $7.1 million in Q4 related to organization changes that will benefit FY \u201817 and beyond, and an acceleration of information technology cost of $3.7 million in Q4 related to implementation cost associated with global systems that will also drive future synergies. In total, transaction and integration costs were responsible for $0.15 of EPS dilution. Purchase accounting adjustments, which reflect a reduction to deferred revenue and amortization of unfavorable contracts, were dilutive to EPS by $0.06.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.6% or 100 basis points lower than prior year. Our annual effective tax rate was 28.9% or 60 basis points lower than the prior year rate of 29.5%. And on an adjusted Signet basis, which is the far most left column, EPS was $3.63, an increase of 18.6% over last year.","Looking below the sales line at Signet\u2019s adjusted P&L results. Our adjusted gross margin was a little over $1 billion or 42.6% of adjusted sales. That rate was up 170 basis points to last year due primarily to synergies, favorable commodity cost and leverage on store occupancy cost. Our rate continues to benefit from synergy-related initiatives, that includes discount controls, extended service plans, vendor terms and other gross margin enhancing programs.","Sterling Jewelers\u2019 gross margins increased by 120 basis points and that was due to improved merchandise margins related to favorable commodity cost and leverage on store occupancy. The Zales division\u2019s adjusted gross margin rate increased 270 basis points due primarily to realization of synergies that favorably impacted merchandise margins, distribution cost, store operating costs and rent and occupancy. UK gross margin increased 80 basis points due primarily to store occupancy leverage.","Adjusted SG&A was $666 million or 27.8% of adjusted sales compared to $629 million or 27.5% of sales in the prior year. The increase of $37 million in SG&A was driven by higher advertising of $7 million, higher store staff cost of $11 million associated with higher sales volume and higher central cost. The increase in central cost was driven by higher recurring IT expense, higher levels of depreciation, investments in product research and development and standardization of employee compensation among North America.","From a rate perspective, the higher central costs were partially offset by leverage on advertising and store payroll resulting in an increase of 30 basis points in our SG&A rate. Other operating income was $63.7 million. This increase of $9.6 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. Adjusted operating income was $418.4 million, an increase of 15.7% over prior year fourth quarter. Our adjusted operating margin rate was 17.4% of sales. This 160 basis point expansion over prior year was driven primarily by increase in sales and gross margin. Adjusted EPS was $3.63 compared to $3.06 last year, an increase of 18.6%, driven principally by stronger business performance.","So, let\u2019s move on to the balance sheet and we will start with inventory. This is the first year end since the acquisition of Zale that we have an apples-to-apples result. Our strong year end inventory position reflects the success of our continued focus on optimization of Zale inventory. Net inventory ended the year at about $2.5 billion, an increase of just 0.6% compared to our annual sales growth of 14.2%. This relationship to sales was driven by solid inventory management across virtually all of our product categories, divisions and locations. We increased Zale inventory turn by reducing unproductive inventory, rightsizing store level inventory closer to Kay averages, and improving clearance inventory management. We also improved inventory turnover through better sourcing terms and the performance of Ever Us. As we move through Q1, our inventory levels and merchandise assortment for fiscal 2017 are very well-positioned.","So moving on, we will turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. So before we discuss our in-house credit metrics, I wanted to spend a few minutes to speak more holistically on our in-house credit operations. We have provided and operated in-house credit for 30 years and it gives us a number of competitive advantages. Our in-house program is an integral part of our business, which builds customer loyalty and enables incremental profitable sales that will just not occur without a consumer financing program. In addition, there are several factors inherent in the U.S. jewelry business that supports the circumstances through which consumer financing is uniquely positioned to generate profitable incremental sales for Signet. We know from our deep history of borrower behaviors that the emotional connection our customers have to their jewelry purchases supports repayment history.","In addition, due to our scale, we are able to administer our credit programs very efficiently and effectively. Credit also complements and supports our Best in Bridal strategy. Bridal, which is the closest thing in jewelry to a necessity, represents about half of our annual business. About 75% of our Sterling division bridal sales utilize our credit program. This provides us with the opportunity to develop long-term customer relationships, market to our customers and maximize our customer\u2019s long-term sales productivity.","So, with that as a background, there are several points that I want to make sure are very clear to our investors regarding our credit portfolio. First, our credit program is designed for rapid repayment that minimizes risk and enables the customer to make additional jewelry purchases using their credit facility. On average, our receivable portfolio turned every 9 months much quicker than a typical credit card provider. The weighted average minimum monthly payment required is about 9% of outstanding balances, which is nearly double what a typical credit card company would require.","Further, on our monthly repayment terms, which unlike most credit card repayment terms don\u2019t decline as a customer repays his or her balance, which helps to facilitate the quick collection of our loan balances. Second, there is no long-tail associated with our credit book. We fully take the expense of any loan that has aged 90 days on the recency. If and when it won\u2019t reach 120 days recency and 240 days contractual, it is charged off against the provision. Third, our underwriting standards are proven and have been consistent over a long period of time. This consistency in our underwriting also is demonstrated in our weighted average FICO score for the portfolio. For FY \u201816, our weighted average FICO was 662 and have been in the mid 660s for numerous years. The FICO scores of the new customers in our portfolio in FY \u201816 at 684, was higher than the average for the total portfolio.","Fourth, to age our portfolio, we measured delinquency and establish loan allowances using a form of the recency method. This form of recency which we have used since the inception of owning our in-house credit relies upon qualifying payments determined by management to measure delinquency. A qualifying payment can be no less than 75% of the scheduled minimum payment and increases with the delinquency level. Once an accountholder is more than three payments behind, the entire year past due amount is required to return to current status. Of all the payments received in the fiscal year, 97% were equal to or greater than the scheduled monthly payment, which is true in fiscal 2015 as well.","Fifth, and this is perhaps the most important to understand, is that regardless of aging method use over one portfolio, the balance sheet and income statement will yield the same result as under U.S. GAAP, receivables must be stated at the net realizable value. So in other words, the net charge-off to the balance sheet and the net bad debt expense in the P&L would be the same under both recency and contractual aging. There is no difference between the two when it comes to our financial statements. We have provided in appendix to our presentation that summarizes our qualifying payment rules. In addition, I refer you to our expanded disclosures in our 10-K that we will file today relating to underwriting, credit monitoring and collection and our portfolio aging. We hope that these expanded disclosures are found to be helpful.","So, with that behind us, let\u2019s look at our financial metrics related to our Sterling division in-house credit. Our year end net accounts receivable increased to $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year, representing a 12% increase, driven by credit penetration rate and higher average purchases. Our fiscal 2016 credit penetration rate was 61.5% and that compares to 60.5% last year. The higher participation rate was driven primarily by growth in bridal and Ever Us, both with higher average transaction values. The average monthly collection rate for fiscal 2016 was 11.5% compared to 11.9%. Our monthly collection rate is calculated as cash received divided by accounts receivable.","The change of rate over prior year is due primarily to two reasons: First, as our mix of bridal increases due to our Best in Bridal strategy, this creates a higher average receivable. By design, the repayment rate is lower as the price point of merchandise increases. Bridal has a higher average credit sale and therefore, the repayment is longer. So, this leaves a higher outstanding receivable to be collected. And second, like other consumer loans, more principal is paid off later in the life of the loan and interest is paid earlier. So, as our portfolio grow more in the last year proportionally, more of it will be repaid later. Our allowance as a percent of AR increased 20 basis points due principally to higher receivable balances and higher bad debt.","So, continuing down Slide 14. Our fiscal 2016 net bad debt was $190.5 million and that compares to $160 million last year. The increase of $30.5 million was driven principally by higher penetration and receivable balances. Interest income for finance charges which makes up virtually all of our other operating income line on our income statement was $252.5 million compared to $217.9 million last year. The increase of $34.6 million was due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables base. The net impact of bad debt and finance income generated a full year operating profit of $62 million compared to $57.9 million in the prior year.","As you can see on the slide, similar trends also existed for the fourth quarter between net bad debt and financing cost. In addition, as we have disclosed in our February 29 pre-release, our year end valuation allowance and non-performing metric improved as management had expected compared to the third quarter. This improvement was driven not only by the normal seasonality we customarily see, but also due to an excellent credit execution and credit marketing initiatives designed to favorably influence credit receivable mix. The visibility that we have into our credit portfolio performance, which includes daily collections, weekly roll rates to 30, 60, and 90 days and other meaningful indicators, leads us to remain highly confident in the strength of our credit portfolio performance. All of these considerations are factored into our Q1 and annual guidance.","So, moving on to capital allocation, I would like to reiterate our priorities for capital structure and our capital allocation strategy that we first introduced at this time last year. We have a strong balance sheet that will allow us to invest in our business, execute our strategic priorities, ensuring adequate liquidity and returning excess cash to shareholders. Our investment grade ratings are important to us, because long-term, we may return to the debt market. Our adjusted leverage ratio target is to be at or below 3.5x. We ended fiscal 2016 at 3.7x. And as our EBITDA grows in fiscal 2017, we anticipate that we will have additional leverage capacity. We are actively evaluating use of this capacity under the tenets of our capital allocation policy. We plan to distribute 70% to 80% of annual free cash flow in the form of stock repurchases and\/or dividends, assuming no other strategic uses of capital. And in recent years, we have grown both dividends and share repurchases. Our share repurchase authorization is considerably higher now given the recently announced $750 million buyback authorization to go along with what was already left on the existing authorization of $136 billion.","So, now let\u2019s talk about our financial guidance. Signet\u2019s first quarter comparable store sales are expected to increase 3% to 4% and first quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.90 to $1.95, a growth rate of 17% to 20%. We anticipate repurchasing approximately 125 million of Signet\u2019s stocks during the first quarter. We are also initiating annual earnings guidance, along with our customary quarterly guidance. And we are doing this in order to more effectively communicate the effect of the upwardly revised synergies, which Mark discussed and the timing of how these synergies will flow. To foster a more long-term view of its model, Signet intends to continue with annual earnings guidance in lieu of quarterly earnings guidance after fiscal 2017.","For fiscal 2017, we anticipate comps of 3% to 4.5% and adjusted EPS of $8.25 to $8.55, a growth range of 20% to 25%. We are planning for the strong earnings flow to come about through both gross margin and SG&A leverage. We anticipate expanding our gross margin rate through higher sales and realization of synergies and the SG&A leverage should flow due to marketing and organizational design efficiencies.","Our annual effective tax rate is anticipated to be about 28%. Capital expenditure guidance for the full year is $315 million to $365 million driven by a combination of store remodels, store growth, information technology and facilities expenditures. Net selling square footage is projected to grow 3% to 3.5% and this is greater than what we have previously guided of 2% to 3%. Most of Signet\u2019s new square footage growth is slated for real estate venues other than enclosed malls and is focused on higher ROI store banners.","In closing, we are extremely pleased with our financial performance and the progress that we have made on our synergies today. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark Light","Thank you, Michele. To sum up, we had a great quarter and a wonderful year. We accomplished so much as I discussed on Slide 7 and 8. Best of all, we grew our adjusted EPS north of 20% for the full year and we anticipate hitting that mark again in the coming year. I sincerely want to congratulate and thank all of Signet team members for their hard work and the wonderful accomplishments. Last year was great and this year is looking even better.","And with that, we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Krasik with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Scott Krasik","Yes. Hi, everyone. Thanks. Congratulations.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Scott Krasik","So, I just wanted to ask about sort of customer acquisition, advertising, obviously you made a bit of a strategy shift around holiday and I think that you have continued it. So maybe talk about the opportunity there and additional opportunities if there are?","Mark Light","Sure, Scott. Thank you, again. When it comes to what we are doing on customer acquisition through our advertising specifically, the learnings that we have gotten from our segmentation study has really helped us out to focusing on our store brands primary customer. So for example, in Zales, we have a primary customer and we have adjusted our advertising creative to capture more of the Zales segmented primary customer, which is different than that of Kay\u2019s and Jared and we have got wonderful reactions of consumers and from our store staff just seeing people coming in and really reacting to the ad so well and we did the same for Jared as well. And also Kay was kind of on the mark the most with their customer segmentation. So, with the guy being the hero in the ads and everything else. So, what we did is not only did we enhance the creative, we also increased our marketing spend. So, we increased our spend for Zales this fourth quarter. We increased our spend for Jared this fourth quarter. And Kay is kind of at a point where we don\u2019t think it\u2019s beneficial to increase the spend. What we did is we spread Kay\u2019s advertising to start earlier in October and to talk about the bridal business, which we believe that definitely benefited Kay\u2019s throughout the fourth quarter. So, it\u2019s about increasing our marketing spend thoughtfully and targeted. It\u2019s about enhancing our creative to make sure we are capturing that segmented customer better within our store banners.","Scott Krasik","Okay. And then just sort of following up, thanks, on the enhanced store operations maybe specifically to Jared, still not seeing some of the trends you are seeing in the other division. So, maybe talk about the outlook for Jared specifically over the next 6 to 9 months?","Mark Light","Sure. Jared, you got to understand, Jared is different in the mall and that by the way is competitive in competitors set of Jared is primarily obviously outside the mall. And if you look at the jewelry industry as a whole and I mentioned it earlier, if you look at Jared for the year, Jared actually captured profitable market share and it\u2019s compared to the overarching jewelry industry. And again, the majority of Jared customers is outside the mall and the majority of jewelry customers are outside the mall. So, to compare Jared and Kay and Zales is just not really a fair comparative. That being said, we did have a lot of good learnings through our segmentation study that shared with us that we need to talk to and communicate with those customers differently both from a marketing perspective and from a selling perspective. And we had some enhancements to our selling techniques in our Jared stores. We think it\u2019s doing better, but this is a transitional stage for Jared. We are actually very excited by Jared opportunity this year. These transitions don\u2019t happen overnight, but we believe come to the fourth quarter that Jared has a lot of wonderful advantages that we have announced already that we are going to have Pandora shop-in-shops on our stores and we believe Pandora is a tremendous partner and will increase our food traffic coming into our stores. We have now are putting Vera Wang is now in our Jared stores. We have unique advertising for Jared, Vera Wang and we also are going to have some more unique Vera Wang product within our Jared stores and we also have a very special program that is perfectly targeted to the Jared customer that we call the Chosen Diamond. We will talk more about this, but it was tested in the fourth quarter did extremely well and it\u2019s where our customer can literally track their diamond from the point in the mine that it came out of to our cutting factor in Botswana and track it all the way to the point where it\u2019s on their beautiful spouses or spouse-to-be\u2019s hand. So, we are very excited about what\u2019s going to happen for Jared this year, but it takes time to transition the business. But I want to end with we still believe Jared is capturing profitable market share when you compare to the overarching jewelry industry.","Scott Krasik","Okay. Well, good luck with that. Thank you.","Mark Light","Thank you very much.","Michele Santana","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Mark Light","Good morning.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Your full year comp guidance implies acceleration from the first quarter, 3 to 4. What do you see as the biggest drivers of this whether from a banner or a product perspective?","Mark Light","Well, thank you, Lorraine. A lot of it comes from what I have just said to you. In our business, it\u2019s a lot of business happened last year is really all targeted to the back half of the year. A lot of our initiatives, the benefits of the synergies that we are getting, the benefits of the changes I just mentioned, discuss relates to what we are doing in Jared\u2019s are all really do we build up and you get a lot of those benefits to the back end of the year in the fourth quarter and primarily a lot of the synergies that we discussed. So, that\u2019s the majority. I hope Michele, do you have any?","Michele Santana","No, I think that\u2019s really it when you think about the seasonality of the back half. And we talked about on the synergy flow through that, that will when we did the pre-announcement kind of flow with the seasonality more back half loaded and so that\u2019s why you see the acceleration in the annual guidance from the Q1.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Great. And then as you model gross margin for this year, what type of bad debt reserve hit are you incorporating into that guidance?","Michele Santana","Yes. So again, we don\u2019t guide by particular line item in the P&L. What I would tell you is we went out, we have given you the top line, we have given you the bottom line. To give you a little bit more, I guess, a directional basis that might help you is I would say that we probably expect the trends to be broadly similar when you look at a net bad debt expense and finance charge income of what you have seen this past year.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Michele Santana","You are welcome.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Ike Boruchow","Yes, hi, everyone. Good morning. Congratulations. I guess, Michele, just a question for you. So, just going back to your Analyst Day when the synergy number was about 150 to 175, I think you talked about the fiscal \u201818 Zale margin being about a 9% margin. So, now that you have commented that the synergies are roughly $75 million higher, how should we think about the Zale margin, because I know those synergies are kind of spread around, but the majorities in Zale? Can you just help us is that 9% still the number we should think about or now should we start thinking low double-digits?","Michele Santana","Yes. So, good morning, Ike. So, a couple of things. When we talked about back in the IR data, 9% margin that was just looking at the flow-through of synergies and what we said is when you look at other growth within the Zale business, that, that was really more like the 12% or so number. So, that\u2019s in my mind, I think of it more as a 12 versus the 9. And then we said long-term, we saw the Zale margin getting to 15%. So, the one thing, Ike, I would say is that and Mark had mentioned this in the prepared remarks, the synergies are flowing across our business division. And so that\u2019s not to say that I have just cautioned you to think that the majority of this is flowing through sales. It really is across all of it. With that said, sure, the higher synergies does imply that there is higher, medium, and long-term operating margin expectations. And so I think if you take that upwardly revised synergy guidance and just flow it through, split it and flow it through from the guidance we gave on IR Day, you will get the updated and we will get you to the updated margin number.","Ike Boruchow","Got it. And then you had commented that medium to longer term, you were thinking more of a mid-teens margin, just the follow-up question will be are you thinking higher than that now or are you just thinking more we can realize that maybe sooner?","Michele Santana","What I would tell you is there is always two pieces, right, is it more and is it quicker? So, we are seeing the acceleration and part of the synergies. We upped the synergy guidance. And just by the pure mathematics of that, you would have to assume that the margin increases.","Ike Boruchow","Okay, great. Congratulations.","Michele Santana","Thanks, Ike.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simon Bowler with Exane. Your line is open.","Simon Bowler","Hi, team. Just a quick question for myself, just with regard to the increase in square footage growth in the year ahead, just wondering if that\u2019s a timing impact that\u2019s coming through there or whether you have got a view that actually your square footage potential when we compare to what you have previously communicated at Investor Day is beyond that, that we have heard before?","Mark Light","Yes, good morning, Simon and thank you. No, it\u2019s more of the first, Simon. We believe that now that we have a better handle on the Zales operation, we believe we have an opportunity to grow our brands faster and farther. And with this year, the numbers on a gross basis is up to 178 stores this year and Michele mentioned it. The majority of that is coming from our Kay stores as we see Kay mall opportunities. We are also going to open up a good amount of Jared stores this year. We are going to open up a good amount of Zales stores this year. And we will be opening some Piercing Pagoda stores this year. So, we have stronger and better confidence in our business models and we are \u2013 so, it\u2019s an increase of rate not moving stores growth up earlier, it is just pure increase of growth of our company going forward.","Simon Bowler","And I know you don\u2019t want to give kind of multiyear or out-year guidance, but in terms therefore when we are thinking about modeling kind of year 2, 3, 4 beyond, we should be thinking of higher rates than the notion perhaps your communication before might have implied?","Mark Light","We are not going to give any specifics, but I will tell you that obviously the more and more confidence we get in the business and the more and more confidence we have in our models, specifically in Zales, we will see a potential opportunity of increasing that run-rate. Look we said this before, Simon, we believe the mid-market in the U.S., let\u2019s just talk the U.S. is a $41 billion market opportunity. Through Signet Jewelers, through all of our brands last year, we did about $5.5 billion. We see tremendous opportunity to grow within our existing brands, within our segmented customers, within the U.S. and the other markets that we operate in, but specifically see tremendous opportunity of capturing more profitable market share in the latter years in the U.S. for certain with our existing brands.","Simon Bowler","Very clear. Thanks Mark.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anne Samuel with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Anne Samuel","Hi, guys. Congrats on a great quarter.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Anne Samuel","On quarter-to-date so far you gave a little bit of comment about it in the release, but we have been hearing from a handful of retailers that the domestic consumer is returning to a more normal trend kind of relative to the fourth quarter. Can you provide any color on if you are seeing a similar improvement in the consumer environment?","Mark Light","Well, obviously, Anne, if you take a look at our guidance at 3% to 4%, we are seeing similar trends of the fourth quarter, not obviously as robust as you saw, but we are seeing similar trends. I mentioned this on my prepared statements that we have the benefit that over 50% of our business is in bridal category. And it is the closest thing that Michele said that we have is a necessity. So, that is the nice stabilizing business that we have that I believe other retailers will have the benefit of that business. So, to answer your question, in our guidance, we are seeing 3% to 4% in the first quarter. So, those are the type of run-rates we believe we are going to experience.","Anne Samuel","Great, thanks. And then just one question on the gross margin line, when you think about the core business outside of the synergy benefits, can you provide any color on what puts and takes you are seeing there? Are you continuing to see favorable commodity cost benefits? Thanks so much.","Michele Santana","Sure, Anne. So again, Mark had in his remarks mentioned this and I just caution anybody from we don\u2019t operate our \u2013 we don\u2019t operate Signet as a pre-acquisition company and a new entity. Our synergies flow across all of our divisions. And so I really don\u2019t want to go through and try to breakout gross margin expectations based on that. In the comments, the prepared comments we talked about, we are really excited about our gross margin expansion that we expect to see in fiscal 2017. And when we think about that expansion, it will primarily be driven by synergies as we move forward. Commodity cost is always a factor in our gross margin. What I would say though think about that we are on the average inventory cost, so changes in gold don\u2019t flow-through as quick in our P&L. This is primarily a synergy driven gross margin expansion on both sides.","Anne Samuel","Great. Thanks so much.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Stein with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Jeff Stein","Good morning, guys and again I appreciate the detail on the credit. So, question for Michele on the guidance and this is just kind of back of the envelope. And I am wondering if perhaps maybe you are being a little bit conservative on your guidance, because if you take the $6.85, $6.86 that you earned and then you tax effect the synergies \u2013 and let\u2019s say we use the midpoint of the synergy savings \u2013 that\u2019s about $1.30. And then you have got the ADS credit benefit this year that you didn\u2019t have last year, that\u2019s another $0.20. The way I am adding it up, it looks to me like you are getting a $1.50 lift from synergies and credit and that would take you to about an $8.40 number. So, it would seem like you are just kind of adding the synergies and the credit benefit with no organic growth from the core business. So, I am wondering if I am looking at it the right way or perhaps missing something.","Michele Santana","Well, here is what I would say, Jeff. Again, it goes on the heels I really, really caution anybody from taking the synergies and trying to look at the synergies and then what\u2019s happening in the organic growth. This is very much integrated. It\u2019s not split that way and it really is not a fair characterization as we don\u2019t operate our business as I mentioned before in a pre-acquisition mode and a new one. Synergies flow across our business. And so for example and I know Mark also provided this during the prepared remarks, a portion of our revenue includes revenue synergies, such as cross-selling. He gave Ever Us as an example, which is a permanent part of our business and so that\u2019s in our synergy number. It\u2019s mutually benefiting all of our divisions across the board. So, you really can\u2019t start pursing out what\u2019s core and what\u2019s not core. The other comment I would say, Jeff, is just keep in mind this is the first time that we are issuing annual guidance and it is early in the year. So stay tuned, we will see how the year develops. And also, just want to remind you that when you look at the annual guidance we did provide the EPS growth range I mentioned of 20% to 25%.","Jeff Stein","Right, right. Just one more follow-up question real quick and that is do you have a depreciation and amortization estimate for the current fiscal year?","Michele Santana","You know what, I don\u2019t actually have one handy, but that\u2019s something we can probably circle back with you on, Jeff.","Jeff Stein","Great, thank you very much.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Oliver Chen","Congrats on a really strong finish to a great year. Mark, as do you look forward to the second half of this year, what would you isolate as a key product or marketing initiatives and just general ideas that will be good for us to prioritize in our mind as catalysts? And Michele, as investors continue to think about the credit metrics, as we model our thoughts for next year, how should that net impact line look and allowance as a percentage of ending accounts receivables, just expectations for how that should trend? And I think, it\u2019s interesting how you have ADS on the Zale Corp side and Sterling is internal. So, how do you think about ROIC when you compare those two businesses and you think about your corporate and financial strategies? Thanks.","Mark Light","Thank you, Oliver. I will take the marketing and merchandising question, obviously. On the marketing front, Oliver, in the second half, there are several things. First of all, we are continuing to refine our creative to get closer and closer and get continued REITs from our segmented customer as it relates to Kay, Zales and Jared\u2019s. And by the way, we just did a segmented study, segmentation study in the UK for both our H.Samuel brand and our Ernest Jones brands and we also are conducting and just finished a study of our Peoples brand in the United Kingdom \u2013 excuse me, in Canada. So, we will continue to refine our creative to make sure we are penetrating and connecting more to those segmented customer appropriate to the appropriate banners. In addition to that, we will continue to invest thoughtfully and strategically in targeted additional marketing spend for all of our brands where appropriate.","So, on the marketing side, it\u2019s continued refinement of the creative to connect to the segmented customer and increased investment in TV media and an increased investment digital, we are putting a lot of time, money and effort behind our omni-channel experiencing and making sure that there is a connectivity from the digital perspective whether it be online to in-store and then the connectivity is we are putting a lot of investments in the special omni-channel experiences that can only be differentiated by us. On the merchandising side, we have a lot of exciting news. I mentioned that the extensions in Ever Us. I will tell you that historically in the jewelry industry, when a beacon program is announced and a beacon program in the past for those of you who don\u2019t understand or are tied to jewelry industry are programs like the past, present and future anniversary band, which is 15 years ago, or the Journey necklace. These are programs that are called beacon programs and we call our Ever Us program a beacon program as we focus in targeting and highlighting one item to expand and usually year two is a better year for beacon programs. Consistently, year two outperforms. So, we are excited about the year two, because the customers are just getting the idea and understanding what Ever Us represents is gaining momentum. So, we are just seeing a naturally lift and the more and more customer understand Ever Us is a huge benefit, but compounded with that, we are testing extensions, we are testing earrings, we are testing bracelets, we are testing different styles of rings. So, Ever Us is still a very exciting opportunity for the second half of this year.","I mentioned in Jared, we have an exciting new diamond program that we are in test mode, that\u2019s Chosen. We are very excited about our shop-in-shop Pandora stores within our Jared stores. We have got other items that are in innovation laboratory that are being tested as we speak. We are, as you can see from our guidance, we feel very excited about our exciting initiatives when it comes to marketing and merchandising. And it also \u2013 you didn\u2019t ask about it and we will share with you the more and more we engage with our field forces, the better they get, the more we train them, the better they can deliver a superior customer experience, because after everything is said and done, the most important equation is how that customers served across the counter and delivering those established products. So, that\u2019s my answer to that part of the question, Michele.","Michele Santana","Alright. So, I will take the credit. So again, what I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are seeing stability in our credit metrics and very confident in terms of our credit portfolio performance, all of which is factored in our Q1 and our annual guidance. So with that said, I think this kind of hit on also the heels of Lorraine\u2019s question, but directionally, in Q1, when you see the relationship of our net bad debt expense and finance charge income, we\u2019d expect that to be broadly in line with last year, I think there is a timing of an account sale in last year\u2019s numbers, so you have to take that into effect and it would be broadly the same. And on a full year basis, as a percentage of sales, that net relationship of bad debt and finance charge will also be broadly in line with fiscal \u201816. And I would make the same comment when you think about the allowance as a percentage of our receivable. Getting into ROI in terms and the hybrid approach that we have with ADS and our in-house, which really is a unique case for us. First of all I think, Oliver, it\u2019s really important to note that our overall credit portfolio is still highly profitable and we have successfully managed this portfolio over 30 years in all types of business cycles. The virtues of having our in-house credit program, given the sales and earnings flow-through when you think about the interest income, the lifetime value of our credit customers, how it complements our best in bridal strategy, I mean all of these factors really provide a competitive advantage for us to operate this in-house credit program. Now with that said and as you mentioned, we have ADS that\u2019s providing the credit in Zale, so we do have this optimal test case in front of us and this hybrid model will allow us to continue to evaluate the pros and cons of an in-house credit program. And this is no different than any other aspect of our business that we always are continuing to evaluate our business in ways to enhance shareholder value.","Oliver Chen","Thank you, that\u2019s super helpful. And approval rates on the credit customer and the FICO scores they have been consistent, is that correct, we just had an investor incoming on this topic and I wanted you to elaborate there if possible?","Michele Santana","Yes. They have and so this is obviously one of the new credit metrics that we have disclosed and you will see that in the 10-K that\u2019s filed later today. Again FICO is an element, it is not the only element that we use in terms of our underwriting, but we have seen a very consistent trend in terms of our FICO scores for a number of years.","Oliver Chen","Okay. And Mark, just finally, omni-channel comp like a really great ongoing initiatives, what are the next chapters here, I know that customer has a special element of trust whether it\u2019s in-store pickup is the key role, but what do you think are the major strategic efforts over the medium term and is mobile a big part of the opportunity ahead? Thanks.","Mark Light","Thank you, Oliver. Yes, mobile is huge. Obviously, I think most business, but definitely in ours, more and more of our omni-channel experience is starting on mobile and it\u2019s transitioning more and more going there. And it\u2019s just tying the experiences, Oliver. You will see us this year we will be working on enhancing our Zale\u2019s e-commerce platform and working on making sure that we have more connectivity to our e-commerce sites and to the activity going on in stores. So you will see a lot more of the connectivity of our stores to our online experience and tying everything together. Now, it\u2019s going to take time, we can\u2019t do this all overnight, Oliver. But we have \u2013 we will be sharing more with you once we have some more of tests vetted out. But we see omni-channel being a critical part of the jewelry experience. And I have said this before, but arguably in our business, more than any other retail, because we know that a vast majority of jewelry and diamond customers go online first. They need to educate themselves online is one of the things that we have done as we put together a website called Jewelry Wise, which is an educational website that just answers customers questions about diamonds or emeralds or gold and questions they have and just experiencing \u2013 letting customer experience education about our products is another way and collecting all of this education in-store and online.","Oliver Chen","Thank you, best regards and hanks for the details. And it sounds really exciting ahead, thanks.","Mark Light","Thank you, Oliver.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dorothy Lakner with Topeka Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Dorothy Lakner","Thanks. Good morning everyone and congratulations as well. I wondered if you could provide a little bit more color on your cross-selling efforts, I know you have spoken a lot about Vera Wang and how well that\u2019s done, obviously Ever Us is being sold across all banners, but kind of where are you in the process and what else might we look forward to in as you move forward. And then additionally, just any color you could provide on \u2013 you talked about new store concepts performing well, I just wondered if you could provide a little bit more color on that? Thank you.","Mark Light","Sure. Thank you, Dorothy. On cross-sell, first of all as you mentioned, Vera Wang has been a tremendous success, specifically in our Jared stores and is doing very well in the Ernest Jones stores in the United Kingdom. So we see an authority to taking Vera Wang Love and like I said in Jared, making it \u2013 refine it a little more and make it a little bit different for the Jared customers. We see exciting opportunity for that. And our UK stores are just \u2013 the test is doing well and we see rolling Vera Wang into all of our UK Ernest Jones stores. Neil Lane has been doing very well in our stores in Canada. We have Neil Lane in all of our Peoples stores in Canada. We have Open Hearts by Jane Seymour in all of our stores in Canada and we are doing very, very well with both of those brands in our Canadian Peoples stores. We also see opportunity \u2013 we continue to test Neil Lane in our Zales stores. We are not fully rolling it out now, because we are still going to make sure that there is no major cannibalization going on. But to your point efforts like Ever Us is just critical to the success of our cross-selling. It just reinforces the importance of making sure that we have the opportunity to show something that, because there are products in our industry that are just in every brand everywhere, solitaire rings or solitaire pendants and we believe there are certain brands that we can develop and certain designs and trends we can develop like Ever Us that will be able to be sold in all of our brands and that\u2019s critical to the importance of our business.","And we continue to test, Dorothy, we will be continuing looking and testing all of our different opportunities for cross-selling, but those are some of the major, major lifts. As far as the new stores go, our Kay stores, our Kay off-mall stores, our Kay stores continue to do very well. Our Jared stores continue to perform well. We are just now ramping up, you will see a ramp up opening about \u2013 projected to open about 30 new Zales stores this year and we are feeling pretty good about opening the Zales stores. We will see we didn\u2019t open up many last year, but we will see how they do. So, this year is a good year for us that we are opening up a lot of Kay off-mall stores, which as Michele said, it gives us the highest return and we see great consistency in the performance. So, Kay off-mall continues to do well. And Jared continues to do well. We are just getting into Zales and Piercing Pagoda we are very excited about the opportunities of new Piercing Pagoda\u2019s stores and our new store designs behind the Piercing Pagoda brand.","Dorothy Lakner","Thank you and good luck.","Mark Light","Thank you, Dorothy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with Royal Bank. Your line is open.","Brian Tunick","Yes, can you guys hear me?","Mark Light","Yes, we can.","Michele Santana","Yes.","Brian Tunick","Alright. Super, thanks. Good morning and again thanks for the clarity. I guess following up on the credit book again, the question of should you guys own it, should you guys sell it? Can you maybe talk about, is that an ongoing conversation? I am sure the last 5 or 6 months you probably have that conversation more, but can you maybe talk about the pros and cons of owning the credit book when you look at customer-centric companies like Nordstrom that has sold theirs? Can you maybe talk about how you think about that? And then also on the composition of the comp, the negative transactions, can you maybe parse out are you seeing any difference in mall versus outlet or strip centers just sort of what\u2019s happening within the transaction component? Thanks very much.","Michele Santana","Sure, Brian. So \u2013 and first of all, I can\u2019t speak to Nordstrom in terms of why they made the decision to do what they did with their credit portfolio. I can only speak to Signet\u2019s in-house credit, which we really do view as the competitive advantages for all the reasons that I have covered. How much it really complements our Best in Bridal strategy. And when you look at the scale that we have and the rich history that we have in terms of our borrowers, we believe that it still makes good sense for us. It still remains highly profitable for us. And as we said, we have managed this portfolio in all types of environments. But with that said and it is no different than any other aspect of our business or any \u2013 it\u2019s no different than what we have done in the past that we are always continuing to evaluate ways that we enhance our operating income, shareholder value. So, that\u2019s where I would leave that discussion in terms of the in-house credit performance. In terms of your question on the transaction, I mean, that\u2019s something \u2013 we are just not going to go down to the details in terms of how those transactions were off-mall, in-mall, I would leave it at that.","Operator","And we have time for one more question and that question will come from the line of Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Mark Light","Good morning.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","I wanted to just ask you touched on a lot of this, but just to get a better perspective on in 3Q, we saw the net profitability of your credit book weaken year-over-year and in 4Q, it improved. What exactly happened between 3Q and 4Q that drove that sequential improvement?","Michele Santana","Sure, sure. So, when we backed up and we had mentioned in Q3, a lot of that was what\u2019s magnified by the size of the quarter. But with that said, we did see \u2013 I mean experienced higher bad debt expense and that \u2013 component of that was driven by the credit receivable mix. So when we move to fourth quarter and as we had expected to see improvement in our credit metrics, we did. But it all didn\u2019t happen in Q4. What we did is we started deploying credit marketing initiatives in Q3 and really these initiatives were aimed at more of the higher or better quality credit customers to favorably influence what our credit mix was. And so some of these types of initiatives were in like in Jared, you get 10% off, it was hey credit card reactivations, reminder you have open to buy with us, come in and make a purchase. So a lot of those initiatives just combined with credit execution really drove the favorable results that we saw in Q4 as it related to the metrics. And, as I mentioned we continue to see the stability in our credit metrics and very confident in terms of our credit portfolio performance as we move into fiscal 2017.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","I think you had also talked about better collections rates, can you touch on that process?","Michele Santana","Yes. So, in terms of the actual collection rate, the number I provided for the fiscal year in the prepared remarks is down over last year. But what we have seen in the fourth quarter and it\u2019s not so much from a rate perspective, but there is always nuances in terms of the effectiveness of customer collection and so that was just one element I would say in the fourth quarter that did help influence the credit metrics.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up, could you talk about what\u2019s your average unit cost outlook is or input cost for fiscal \u201917. And then I think you had also touched on the opportunity to take a bit of pricing selectively across your portfolio, how you are feeling about that? Thanks.","Michele Santana","Sure. So overall, we have mentioned that we do expect to have gross margin expansion so that would obviously encompasses our estimate or views in terms of input costs. I think we know and what I would call out on gold, gold has been increasing, but what I would say is remind everyone with the average inventory cost method we are on, we are not prone to sharp increases or decreases that flow through immediately in the P&L. So I think we feel good in terms of where we sit on the gross margin. Diamonds, I think we are kind of maybe flat, small increase from that point. I don\u2019t know Mark if there is anything you want to add on, on the diamond side?","Mark Light","No, I think you are right. I think the info [ph] right now, in the polished diamond market is small single-digit increases potentially flattish it depends on what the marketplace looks like go into the future.","Michele Santana","Yes. And that\u2019s an area where in the past, we have been successful on the heels of commodity cost increases, pricing that negates the \u2013 any margin impact we would see.","Mark Light","Which everything is built into our guidance.","Michele Santana","Absolutely.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","And opportunity for price increases this year?","Mark Light","There are potentially opportunities for price increases which is \u2013 everything is built into our annual guidance, but yes there is opportunity for price increases.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Okay. Thanks guys.","Michele Santana","Thank you, Lindsay.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Light.","Mark Light","Sorry about that. With that, I will say thank you to all of you for taking part of this call. Our next scheduled call is on May 26, where we will review our first quarter earnings results. Thanks again, and goodbye.","Operator","Thank you.

Please go ahead, James.","James Grant","Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. On our call today are Signet Chairman of the Board, Todd Stitzer; CEO, Mark Light; and CFO, Michele Santana.","The presentation deck we will be referencing is available under the Investors section of our website, signetjewelers.com.","During today's presentation, we will in places discuss Signet\u2019s business outlook and make certain forward-looking statements. Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. We urge you to read the risk factors cautionary language and other disclosures in our annual report on Form 10-K.","We also draw your attention to slide number two in today\u2019s presentation for additional information about forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Todd. ","Todd Stitzer","Good morning. My name is Todd Stitzer and I\u2019m the Non-Executive Chairman of Signet. Over time, I've met and conferred on numerous occasions with many on this call. As you know, one of my responsibilities is to serve as a bridge and sounding board between our shareholders and management.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. I apologize, but there will be a slight delay in today's conference. Please hold and the conference will resume momentarily. Thank you for your patience.","Okay. We\u2019re back in the conference now. Please go ahead.","James Grant","Okay, folks. Turning it over to Chairman Todd Stitzer.","Todd Stitzer","Okay. Well, start again. Good morning. My name is Todd Stitzer and I\u2019m the Non-Executive Chairman of Signet. Over time, I've met and conferred on numerous occasions with many on this call. As you know, one of my responsibilities is to serve as a bridge and sounding board between our shareholders and management.","I take this responsibility very seriously. So, this morning, on opening our discussion to provide significant context that addresses many of the questions we've heard from you during and following the media attention focused on the company last week relating to a long-standing arbitration case on pay and promotions.","We chose today in this forum to discuss these matters with you because this is a complex matter that cannot be reduced to a simple soundbite or a clever phrase. The Signet board and management team have absolutely no tolerance for discrimination or harassment and we have had strict antidiscrimination and anti-harassment policies and practices in place for decades.","The portrait of Signet painted in recent media reports is irreconcilable to me, with the company that I have served as a director and as chairman for more than five years. We have taken seriously the allegations of sexual harassment prepared in connection with the pending arbitration matter, many of which go back decades. The allegations of sexual harassment focused on our leadership were denied under oath.","By numerous indicators, Signet outperforms national averages in the percentages of its store management staff who are female. In their 2016 Women in the Workplace Report, McKinsey and Company found that percentage representation of females in non-senior management of US corporations across all industries was 37%.","The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 44% of all first-line retail sales supervisors are female. In the jewelry, luggage and leather goods subsector of the same report, the percentage of female first-line supervisors is 61%.","At Signet, 68% of store management staff are female and the company's ongoing efforts to promote women in the workplace is reflected at all levels of leadership. Our better-than-benchmark level of female representation is the direct result of our steadfast commitment to practices that focus on all aspects of the employment experience at our company.","In addition, again, according to McKinsey, 29% of all C-level executives in the retail sector are female. At Signet, 33% of all C level executives are female and 4 of Signet\u2019s 11 or 36% of its independent members of its Board of Directors are female. The latter is almost double the average percentage of female directors at S&P 500 firms, which according to a 2015 Catalyst report is less than 20%.","This is the portrayal of Signet which our board, our management team and our value team members recognize as their own. Not the purported parallel universe represented by others.","You can find information about the real Signet under the corporate responsibility tab on our Signet website.","I will now address as best I can, for a pending legal matter, the facts surrounding this pay and promotion arbitration case. This case was filed in 2008, is focused on the company pay and promotions practices for women in certain positions within our field operations team, not sexual harassment.","In fact, there are no legal claims on behalf of the class alleging sexual harassment. Let me repeat, there are no claims on behalf of the class alleging sexual harassment.","As a board, we have taken the pay and promotions allegations in the case very seriously from the outset. We have thoroughly examined the facts and we believe the allegations have no merit.","Accordingly, we have defended the company vigorously in this litigation. And the outcome of the case will be determined primarily by statistical analysis, not salacious claims.","The case is complex. And we believe there is significant confusion regarding the number of declarants who have made allegations of sexual harassment, which I want to clarify.","The injunctive relief class certified under Title VII automatically includes 69,000 current or former female employees who worked at Signet between 2004 and the present. 43 \u2013 read that, 43 \u2013 of the class members or about 0.06% of the class allege they experienced any form of sexual harassment. And many of these allegations pertained to incidents that purportedly occurred from the 1990s to 2005.","Let me be absolutely clear. Even one instance of sexual harassment is unacceptable. I cannot really comment further except to emphasize that Signet has sought to continuously advance our journey of improvement in workplace practices.","During the last decade, we focused on consistently improving our policies and practices around equal employment opportunity and workplace culture. Examples of concrete steps we\u2019ve taken include adopting employment policies and practices aimed at ensuring equal career advancement via standardized processes for setting salaries and promotions based on objective, measurable metrics; implementing training and performance measurement tools to cultivate leadership traits and prepare team members for promotion within our organization.","As a result of these employment and advancement initiatives, today, as noted above, more than 68% of all store management staff are women. Providing further EEOC approved training courses to help managers recognize and prevent workplace behaviors that do not respect all team members, including field operations leaders and those who attend our annual managers and sales meetings.","Based on these efforts, all of which have been sponsored and supported by our executive leadership team, we believe Signet has a sound framework of policies and practices and a strong workplace culture built on a foundation of equal opportunity and respect.","We have a culture in which capable women thrive professionally and advance, and the data support our success. We also know that our commitment to fairness, equal opportunity, integrity and respect in the workplace require continuous review and improvement.","Today, as we continue our quest to be an employer of choice, we are announcing a number of additional steps to assure ourselves, our shareholders and our team members that our policies and practices are functioning as intended, and to identify areas where we can further improve.","First, the board is forming a new committee focused on respect in the workplace. The directors who will serve on the new committee include Virginia Drosos, CEO of Assurex Health and prior group president of Procter & Gamble; Marianne Miller Parrs, formerly Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of International Paper Company; Eugenia Ulasewicz, who served as President of Burberry PLC Americas division; Helen McCluskey, former CEO of The Warnaco Group. Helen will chair the committee.","These women comprise all our female directors and all are very familiar with the company since they joined the board between 2008 and 2014. The board has charged the committee to focus on programs and policies to support the advancement and development of our female team members.","Second, the new committee plans to appoint an independent consultant to conduct a thorough review which will cover current and future company policies and practices regarding equal opportunity and workplace expectations, including those covering non-harassment training and reporting, investigation and non-retaliation.","At Signet, we do not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind and we want to be sure that the framework we have in place for reporting and responding to any such issues is robust and effective.","Third, the committee will establish an independent ombudsperson office to act as an informal third-party avenue to provide confidential advice to employees, to address concerns regarding the issues in the workplace, and to provide options and strategies to assist them in the resolution of workplace concerns.","The ombudsperson is in addition to our currently available resources and will provide additional assurance to team members and management, so that fairness and respect will always be the touchstone of how we treat each other.","It is the intention of this board and the senior management team to make certain that our culture and our team members are fully supported at every level because culture and people have made Signet the leading company in our industry.","Let\u2019s now shift to credit, customer service and business performance issues. As noted earlier, I spoke to many shareholders personally last year. We have valued your input, a direct result of which was forming board subcommittees last June on credit and customer experience.","These committees have met regularly since then and are actively and directly engaged with management.","Here is an update on progress. The credit committee, led by myself, and the management team led by our CFO, Michele Santana, are currently deeply engaged in negotiations supported by Goldman Sachs to outsource our credit business. After evaluation of the various options available to the company, outsourcing is our preferred option. Let me repeat. Outsourcing is our preferred option.","The negotiations are complex and time-consuming and it\u2019s critical we negotiate and execute a transaction that creates value for shareholders and minimizes the potential disruption to our business from any potential transition.","As just one example of the complexity of a potential transaction, the recency aging methods we use in our credit business are integrated into our financial systems, which need, as a part of any transaction, to be transitioned to the financial system of prospective partners, all of which are based on contractual aging methods.","While we're encouraged by our progress, there are no guarantees that we\u2019ll be successful in our outsourcing efforts. However, in the absence of an outsourcing transaction, we continue to believe there are opportunities to optimize our credit business that will create value for our shareholders.","Finally, in regard to our credit business, we absolutely reject any notion that Signet manipulates either its numbers or its customers. The great American retail business was built on consumer credit provided by retailers. While we respect that this system is in transition, we are providing a valuable service for our customers, enabling them to celebrate life and express love.","As a public company, our financial statements, which include the result of credit operations, are annually audited by a big four accounting firm. The consistent results of these independent audits validate our compliance with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.","It\u2019s regrettable that our use of the recency aging method, a credit business management tool, which we've applied in our credit business consistently and successfully for over 30 years, has been distorted by certain members of the financial community to advance their own narrative about our business.","In reality, the recency method actually enables customers to better maintain their credit rating. And we are after all interested in serving our customers.","That being said, should we decide to retain and optimize the in-house credit business, we will change to contractual aging.","Turning to customer experience, based on the company's investigations, reports of systemic diamond swapping are categorically false. But to address any customer concerns and prevent any potential one-off incidences, the company is taking a number of steps. In order to continue to improve our tracking process, we've initiated a capital-intensive measure to provide additional insurance for our customers \u2013 the roll-out of proprietary digital gem scopes that create a digital pictorial record of a jewelry piece as it moves through our process.","While we believe this represents a competitive advantage and another \u2013 this should go a long way to make our customers feeling even more secure in doing business with and it will be \u2013 these gem scopes will be in all of our national brand stores by the end of the year.","We believe this presents a competitive advantage and another reason why customers should be confident in choosing Kay, Jared and Zales for their fine jewelry.","The customer experience committee, chaired by Dale Hilpert, former CEO of Foot Locker, has also been directly involved in the company's decisions to adapt the organization structure and leadership, which you\u2019ve recently heard about, to the needs of today's omnichannel retail environment.","This also includes making recent changes in internal and external IT resources and Mark will discuss these changes in his presentation.","Before I conclude on these opening remarks, I'd like to focus on the elephant in the room, performance. With the backdrop of the company's recent performance, the decline in the company's share price and the recent media focus on the aforementioned arbitration, a number of you have asked me about management\u2019s fitness for purpose.","I've also been asked whether information regarding the lawsuit was taken into account when Mark was appointed CEO. Let me address the latter question first. As a board, we have been briefed on this litigation since 2008. As noted earlier, many of the allegations publicized in connection with the case go back decades.","When evaluating whether to make Mark chief operating officer in 2014, we, obviously, reviewed his business performance and evaluated, with advice from counsel, the allegations that were described in connection with the case, reviewed the available information, the time frames involved, and the context in which it was offered.","Based on our review and evaluation, we appointed Mark as COO. When the previous CEO departed the company, we conducted a further confirmatory review, and Mark was appointed CEO.","Over the past decade, particularly since 2009, our management team under Mark's leadership has guided quarter-to-quarter and year-on-year growth that has been consistent and high quality.","As you'll hear from Mark himself, benchmarked against others in the jewelry industry and the retail industry generally, our results have outpaced the pack. And this doesn't include the results of the Zale acquisition.","Turning to Zale, while the integration is not fully complete, the 2014 acquisition of Zale has been a success. This major strategic move required executive leadership with highly refined industry understanding to integrate and define synergies to unlock the kind of benefits we\u2019re now seeing. We are confident we will deliver an incremental $70 million of synergies by the end of fiscal 2018, which means we will have delivered $250 million of cumulative synergies from this value-creating transaction.","This stands in stark contrast to the results achieved in most acquisitions. We acknowledge that we've had a challenging 2016 or fiscal 2017 due in part to our own shortcomings as well as a challenging retail and jewelry category environment.","Our performance during the holiday season was significantly impacted by issues in our Sterling e-commerce platform, which we have worked furiously to address. Just to be clear, had our Sterling e-commerce platform performed at the level of the Zale platform, it would favorably impacted Q4 comp store sales by 100 basis points and full year comp sales by 60 basis points.","To summarize, our board is very focused on management's performance. During the course of a very challenging year, the board and I have become much more actively involved with the business and will continue this enhanced level of involvement as we take seriously our responsibilities to guide and evaluate the strategic direction of the company on behalf of all of our shareholders.","We believe the antidote to business challenges is strategic vision and effective execution. While the board currently believes, the Signet senior management team is the best situated to deliver in both of these key areas, you can be sure that we will be intensively engaged and very focused on ensuring capable execution of these key initiatives.","Let me now turn the call over to the executive management team. Mark?","Mark Light","Thanks, Todd. And good morning, everyone. I would like to start by discussing some of the key points we would like you to take away from our fourth-quarter presentation.","In a challenging retail environment, our team delivered some wins in certain fashion jewelry categories and selling channels. Our sales decreased, our EPS increased and our fourth-quarter financial overall were in line with the revised expectations.","We also managed our SG&A and inventory well, which not only helped earnings, but also increased our free cash flow substantially year-over-year. We delivered more than our anticipated synergies through operating expense management, which helped us protect our profit, our profit margins and our cash position. The P&L benefits of our synergies, which are net operating profit contributions, were offset by the slow sales environment and our business investments.","We have important initiatives in our business this year around line extensions, clienteling and more. But perhaps the most significant opportunity is adapting to the retail environment with an extensive omnichannel focus. We have realigned our executive organization structure to reflect customers\u2019 multichannel interaction with us. ","We are greater technology investments to improve customers\u2019 online experience. And our digital marketing and online presence will be more pronounced than ever.","We delivered on our balanced approach to capital allocation. And for the year, we repurchased $1 billion of our stock and increased our dividend for the sixth year in a row.","And lastly, as announced last year, we\u2019ve initiated annual same-store sales and earnings per share guidance in lieu of quarterly in order to foster a more long-term view on Signet which is how we think about our business.","Now, let\u2019s move on to some of the drivers for the fourth quarter top line. From a category standpoint, diamond fashion jewelry, led by earrings and bracelets were top performers.","Our Ever US two-stone diamond jewelry collection sales more than doubled year-over-year and Vera Wang Love collections did well driven by thoughtful line extensions, distribution and marketing.","From a selling channel perspective, Kay off-mall stores performed relatively better than mall stores. Also, Piercing Pagoda delivered another outstanding period of growth, driven by sales of 14 carat gold jewelry, which include chains, religious jewelry and children\u2019s jewelry.","As for what drove the fourth quarter sales decline, there were a few related factors that were secular and company specific. First, the retail promotional environment. Share-of-wallet competition for disposable income among all types of retailers and selling channels was exacerbated by significant discounting. While Signet was more promotional than last year, we chose to balance our promotion level to predict margins.","Second, the US jewelry industry. According MasterCard SpendingPulse, jewelry and watch sales were approximately flat in the fourth quarter, with brick-and-mortar stores down about 6% and e-commerce up over 20%.","The industry \u2013 the jewelry industry did not perform as well as overall retail. Independent jewelers, forced to discount, liquidated in numbers not seen since the recession and costume jewelry outgrew fine jewelry.","Third, dynamics around our selling channels. Clearly, there was a secular shift to online. Signet\u2019s e-commerce sales were significantly lower than expectations due to the underperformance of technical enhancements applied across all of our Sterling division store sites, especially in Kay and Jared, which use a common e-commerce platform.","Sterling e-commerce enhancements did not perform to expectations when exposed to the high fourth quarter volume, resulting in purchasing disruptions. Importantly, the growth we experienced in Zale\u2019s e-commerce was very encouraging.","Our mall stores underperformed primarily because of lower customer traffic and deeper jewelry promotional activity elsewhere, which we chose not to match and protected our margins instead.","We are responding with a variety of initiatives and process improvements around the omnichannel experience, merchandise innovation, IT modernization, square footage reduction and store operations improvements.","I\u2019ll get into more specifics on slide nine. Although fiscal 2017 had its challenges, Signet delivered several important accomplishments in our stores and demonstrated good financial management.","Key merchandise brands and categories had a good year, such as Ever Us, Neil Lane, Vera Wang Love, Endless Brilliance and Chosen, plus bracelets, necklace and earrings. Piercing Pagoda and our Kay stores off-mall delivered higher sales.","Good expense management which helped us deliver operating margin expansion of 120 basis points. Our free cash flow increased by $184 million to $400 million. Ending inventory was flat, due principally to prudent management, including the realization of big improvements within the Zale\u2019s merchandise portfolio.","We executed substantial share purchases and several executives and board members were buyers also. ","And for the sixth year in a row, we increased our quarterly dividend. And we have substantially liquidity and an attractive yield.","We entered into a private investment in public entity with Leonard Green. The transaction was a significant vote of confidence in the Signet operating model. We opened our books and we shared significant amounts of information. And with the benefit of full due diligence, Leonard Green invested $625 million in Signet. We delivered on our synergy targets and improved the efficiency with which we do business.","In fiscal 2017, we delivered $120 million in synergies. For the full year, the Zale division delivered an operating income of $73 million and an adjusted operating income of $90 million. Those are increases of 41% and 15% respectively, which led to operating margin expansion.","I won\u2019t go into depth on each of these drivers listed on slide seven and the detail behind each one, but as you can see, we\u2019ve got a tremendous amount of activity going on to fully optimize the business. The unit economics of every pair we do at Zales is better. We are utilizing discounts with greater discipline.","Across Signet, we buy more effectively than ever. And that includes diamonds as well as products and supplies not for sale. Our Zales stores inventory is turning faster. Our distribution center consolidation gets underway this year. We've eliminated duplicate corporate positions and we better aligned store compensation and total rewards throughout Signet. These examples and other projects are positioning us well to build upon our long history of growth and improved profitability.","Before we get to opportunities for fiscal 2018, a few words on the jewelry industry. In the last 25 years, the jewelry and watch industry in the United States has grown at a 3.8% compounded annual growth rate. During that time period, the industry has seen some dips, but the industry has been generally resilient.","At present, the industry is certainly facing some challenges, but we believe those challenges, as in the past, are short-term in nature. Over the last seven years, post-recession, Signet US total sales have grown at a 12% compounded annual growth rate. Even without the Zale acquisition, our US compounded annual growth rate is 7% over that timeframe. Signet has consistently outperformed the jewelry industry.","Given the fragmented industry, we believe we have many years of profitable growth and market share gains ahead of us. Our brands, our scale and our people give us a competitive advantage. We are in a consolidating industry. According to government figures, jewelry in the US is growing in dollars and declining in the number of stores and we have three of the most preeminent brands in the jewelry space.","Now, I\u2019d like to discuss some of the strategic initiatives underway that will help us improve upon fiscal 2017 and lead us to success in fiscal 2018. The retail sector as a whole has seen an accelerated shift in customer behavior with significant movement towards more online browsing, shopping and purchasing.","Signet is responding in a number of ways to succeed in this evolving retail landscape. We\u2019re focused on the customer first omnichannel experience. It is clear that relentlessly delivering an exceptional omni-channel customer experience is a retail imperative.","We have recently realigned our organization around this imperative, in which we created a new role of president and chief customer officer. This role sharpens Signet\u2019s focus on delivering an exceptional and unified omnichannel experience.","Under the strategic umbrella, Signet must be agile, it must be innovative and have the ability to adapt to technological advances and customer preferences.","This year, we\u2019re focused on the following. Initially and immediately improving the customer experience of our Sterling division websites. Technical enhancements have begun and will continue for the next few months. For example, we expect page load speeds to be cut into half as compared to the holiday season, which by the way is in line with retail norms, and this will be done by Mother\u2019s Day.","Over the next few months, we\u2019ll have renewed and targeted focus to improve online traffic. For example, the site architecture enhancements will improve the search engine optimization rankings and we will enhance the content of our sites and increase user-generated content.","In the summer, the new Zales e-commerce platform will launch. This has been part of our technology upgrade plan for some time and we provide a better user experience and a more efficient operating model for the company.","In fiscal 2018, we\u2019re substantially increasing investments in digital marketing, especially in search. We\u2019re investing in enhanced data analytics to achieve a comprehensive view of our current and future customers.","We believe we have one of the largest jewelry customer file of emails, customer profiles and more, and we will use this information as well as our valuable credit data to be smart digital marketers.","Additional technology investment will be tested this year to enhance the customer journey and experience. For example, online wish lists and bridal configurators. ","From a merchandise perspective, innovation remains a top priority. We have fresh new merchandise line extensions and redesigns of certain key collections. We\u2019re building upon existing trends, devoting more resources and store space to hot categories. At the same time, our pipeline of new ideas is full of strong candidates being tested today for possible holiday season rollout.","We continue to make investments in IT modernization that will provide the backbone for the future, enabling successes and operational efficiencies. In fiscal 2018, we expect to implement an enterprise-wide finance and human resource system. Also, the North American warehouse management system that enables us to consolidate Zales distribution center into Akron.","We\u2019re also adjusting to changing customer shopping behaviors and we have taken the opportunity to accelerate store closings, especially within our regional banners. We anticipate closing stores to improve the overall profitability of our store base. In addition, new store openings will be focused on Kay off-mall centers where we have a higher return.","These actions, coupled together, further enhance our diversified real estate portfolio, between mall and off-mall locations. ","And finally, we will improve store operations execution by gathering more useful data about our customers\u2019 experience that will drive action to improve our customer conversion.","That concludes my prepared remarks. And now, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Michele.","Michele Santana","Thank you, Mark. And good morning, everyone. ","All right. I\u2019m going to start with covering Signet\u2019s fourth quarter sales. For the fourth quarter, Signet\u2019s comps decreased 4.5%, against an increase of 4.9% in the prior year fourth quarter and compares to a two-year comp hurdle rate of 9.1%.","Total Signet sales decreased 5.1%. And on a constant exchange basis, total sales decreased 3.3% for the quarter.","Sales on an operating segment basis were as follows: In Sterling Jewelers, total sales declined 3.7% to $1.4 billion; comps decreased 4.9% compared to an increase of 5% last year and compares to a two-year compound rate of 8.7%.","Average transaction value increased 7% and the number of transactions decreased 11.4%. ATV increases were driven primarily by higher value diamond jewelry coupled with declines in select lower average selling price points, such as our Charmed Memories.","The Zales Jewelry operating segment\u2019s total sales decreased 3.8% to $555 million. Comps were down 5.2% against the two-year comp increase of 8.2%. Average transaction value increased 2.4%, while the number of transactions declined 7.4%. ","Increases in higher price point diamond fashion jewelry and bracelets were more than offset by unit declines across all other merchandise categories.","On a geography basis, our Zales US total sales decreased 3.5%, while comps decreased 4.9% against a two-year comp hurdle rate of 8.6%.","In Canada, total sales declined 5.6% and comp sales were down 7.2% against a two-year comp rate of 5.8%.","For the Zale Jewelry operating segment, declines were broad-based across merchandise categories and impacted by underperformance in the mall channel.","Piercing Pagoda total sales increased 7.2% to $84 million, with comp sales up 5.7% and that\u2019s on top of a 6.4% comp last year and a two-year comp rate of 9.1%. Average transaction value increased 12.7%, while the number of transactions declined 5.6%.","Sales increases and ATV were driven by 14 karat gold, religious and children\u2019s jewelry, while unit declines were driven primarily by fewer piercings.","In the UK, our total sales decreased 19.5% to $228 million, but decreased 3.3% at constant currency rates. Comp sales declined 3.8% on top of a 4.7% increase in prior-year and a two-year comp hurdle rate of 12.2%. Average transaction value increased 8% and the number of transactions decreased 11.8%.","Stronger sales of prestige watches and bridal jewelry were more than offset by lower sales in select fashion jewelry and fashion watches.","So, moving on from sales, we\u2019ll look at Signet\u2019s consolidated and adjusted results. So, seen on slide 11, we\u2019re presenting this reconciliation for the final time reflecting the impact of purchase accounting as well as IT implementation expenses associated with global systems that will drive future efficiencies and cost benefits.","IT and other non-routine expenses, as well as purchase accounting, will be a factor in fiscal 2018, but these costs will be lower than FY 2017. As these costs are no longer unique to Signet and are becoming less material, we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s necessary to provide a separate presentation and non-GAAP reconciliation on a going forward basis. ","The difference between Signet and adjusted Signet on this slide are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and integration costs. So, starting on the lower left portion of the slide, on a GAAP basis, earnings per share was $3.92. In the next column over, purchase accounting adjustments of $2.2 million were worth $0.03 of EPS dilution. This was driven primarily by deferred revenue adjustments related to acquisition accounting.","The next column over reflects our integration costs, which relate primarily to consulting expenses associated with IT implementations, severance related to organizational changes and expenses associated with the settlement of miscellaneous legal matters pending as of the date of the Zale acquisition.","Net integration cost of $6.1 million were responsible for $0.08 of EPS dilution. On an adjusted Signet basis, in the far-right column, by adding back the $0.11 worth of adjustments, our adjusted EPS was $4.03.","So, going below the sales line of Signet\u2019s adjusted P&L results, our adjusted gross margin was $947.2 million or 41.7% of adjusted sales, down 90 basis points. This decline was driven principally by lower sales, leading to deleverage on fixed costs as well as more promotional activity in the holiday period. This was partially offset by the adjusted gross margin rate improvement in the Zale division of 40 basis points as a result of a higher merchandise margin rate of 120 basis points associated primarily with synergy benefits. ","Adjusted SG&A was $603.8 million, and that is down $62.2 million from last year. Our SG&A rate of 26.6% leveraged 120 basis points despite lower sales due to expense reductions over the prior-year. The decline in dollars was driven primarily by lower variable compensation, including both short-term and long-term incentives, as well as other factors that I\u2019ll elaborate in a minute.","Other operating income was $59 million or 3% of sales. The increase of $5.3 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances.","Adjusted operating income was $412.4 million, down slightly by 1.4%. However, our adjusted operating margin rate was 18.1%, up 70 basis points due to strong operating expense management in a lower sales environment.","Adjusted EPS was $4.03 compared to $3.63 last year, an increase of $0.40 or 11%, and that\u2019s driven in part by a more favorable effective tax rate as well as fewer shares outstanding.","So, taking a closer look at our adjusted SG&A, our teams continue to focus on cost controls and savings. Our adjusted SG&A expense declined $62.2 million or 9.3% in the fourth quarter. The cost control, coupled with synergy benefits, resulted in significant leverage as I previously noted.","Within SG&A, the biggest expense component is payroll. Store and corporate payroll declined due primarily to lower variable compensation, which fluxes with sales, as well as lower corporate short-term and long-term incentive compensation. In addition, synergistic benefits around payroll also contributed in part to the decline.","Favorable foreign exchange in the UK was also a factor. We reduced advertising expense, primarily in the Sterling division. This was due to a change in the mix of commercial spots and reductions in certain media, such as direct mail and catalog, that have a lower ROI associated with them.","In other expenses, the main driver was lower merchant fees in the Zale credit program. These savings were partially offset by an increase in information technology projects which Mark had previously discussed.","So, before we move on to a few balance sheet highlights, I want to touch briefly on synergies. In fiscal 2017, we delivered an incremental $120 million in synergies, for a cumulative two-year total of $180 million. Our synergies were primarily generated in gross margin and in part in SG&A related to the key activities that Mark had outlined.","The FY 2017 synergies protected our profit and cash generation in what turned out to be a challenging year. The slowdown in our fiscal 2017 sales and its unfavorable impact to our profit, coupled with our IT investments, offset the financial contributions of our synergies. As we move into FY 2018, our focus will continue to be on additional gross margin cost savings and SG&A.","So, moving on to P&L, I\u2019ll focus on a few balance sheet highlights. So, for inventory, our year-end inventory position reflects the success of our continued focus on inventory optimization.","Net inventory ended at $2.45 billion. Our teams did a good job of managing inventory levels in a slow environment. The flat inventory level, on a total annual sales decline of 2%, compared relatively well to many other retailers, many of whom have had less success managing inventory levels and generating cash in this highly promotional and challenging period.","We saw sound, prudent management of inventory across categories and divisions. It\u2019s also worth noting that the Zale division inventory declined at a faster rate than Signet overall. And this is directly related to the synergy-producing initiatives that Mark described earlier, which we call inventory turnover improvement.","Finally, Signet benefited from foreign exchange on inventory procured in currencies other than the relatively strong US dollar.","So, now, we\u2019re going to turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Given the seasonality of credit sales and collections, it is much more instructive to look at full-year credit metrics rather than a quarter.","Fiscal 2017 credit sales in the Sterling division were $2.44 billion, down 0.5%. Although lower, the in-house credit sales were more favorable than the division\u2019s total sales decline and, therefore, gained relative share in the mix of tender.","Our in-house credit predation was 62%, up 50 basis points on the relative strength of organic sales versus non-credit sales.","Gross accounts receivable increased $96 million or 5% to $1.95 billion. The receivable grew even though credit sales and unit sales were down due to higher credit participation, a higher average transaction value on what was financed, and due to the collection rate.","The average monthly payment collection rate for fiscal 2017 was 11% compared to 11.5% last year. Our monthly collection rate is calculated as cash payment received divided by the beginning accounts receivable.","The decline in the collection rate is due principally to a continuation of the shift in credit plan mix and an increase in the average transaction value of what is getting financed. As a result, monthly payments are higher dollars, but lower as a percent of balances, thereby resulting in higher receivables outstanding to be collected.","Interest income for finance charges, which makes up virtually all of the other operating income line on our income statement, was $278 million compared to $253 million last year. The increase of $25 million was due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivable base.","Our net bad debt was $212 million compared to $191 million last year. As a percent of receivables, the nearly flat bad debt allowance, which you\u2019ll see in a moment, was driven primarily by low receivable growth, which was a symptom of the overall sales decline. The net impact of bad debt and finance income generated an operating profit of $66 million, up $4 million from last year.","So, now, I\u2019ll take you through some of the key Sterling division allowance for doubtful account metrics. Our total valuation allowance, as a percent of gross receivables, was 7.1% in the fourth quarter. The slight increase of 10 basis points was driven by the impact of lower sales, leading to lower receivables growth.","As new, current receivables come on to our portfolio more slowly than the steady and predictable growth in the allowance, it impacts our ratio a little unfavorably. On a sequential basis, the ratio was down 80 basis points, the same as prior year, reflecting seasonality changes.","The non-performing portion of our receivables as a percent of the gross AR was 4.1% in Q4. This was unfavorable by 10 basis points both year-over-year and on a sequential basis due to the slower credit sales.","So, before I move on to our financial guidance, just a few words about our credit strategic review. We are making great strides in evaluation of the alternative scenarios. An outsourced model would involve two lenders, a primary and a secondary. We have made progress in terms of our potential primary partner and we are heavily engaged in analysis and discussions with potential secondary partners. We have stated in the past, we are motivated to announce a resolution as quickly and as prudently as possible in order to remove uncertainty around this issue for all of our constituencies.","So, a few highlights regarding capital allocation. Coming out of fiscal 2017, the key tenets of our capital allocation strategy remain in place. Strong balance sheet for flexibility, investment grade ratings, and adjusted leverage ratio goal of 3.5 times and distributing about three-quarters of our free cash flow through buybacks and dividend growth. We had a great year of free cash flow, generating $400 million, an increase of $184 million.","We repurchased 11.2 million shares for about $1 billion, and that includes $625 million to offset dilution from our preferred convertible offering. This significant buyback activity demonstrates our commitment to providing shareholder value and our confidence in the long-term value of this company.","And finally, as Mark has mentioned, we increased our dividend for the sixth year in a row.","So, turning to our financial guidance, today, we are initiating annual guidance for fiscal 2018. Same-store sales are expected to be decrease a low to mid-single-digit percentage. While we\u2019re confident in our strategic initiatives to drive business this year, we have also factored in three negative comp quarters in a row, a tough retail environment particularly through Valentine\u2019s Day, and certain opportunities that may not come to fruition until holidays. We think modestly negative comp guidance is fair.","While we\u2019re not guiding quarterly comp sales, there are a few items that are worth highlighting. As published in our news release this morning, fiscal 2018 is a 53-week year, which has important timing implications for Q1 and Q2 around Mother\u2019s Day. About 300 to 350 basis points of same-store sales and about $0.12 to $0.15 worth of EPS should shift between Q1 into Q2.","In addition, the 53-week year also increases Q4 total sales, but has no impact on EPS for that period due to advertising expenses in that last week. The 53rd week is estimated to be worth about $75 million in sales and is excluded from comp sales calculation.","Directionally, we would anticipate that our quarterly comp sales are affected by the anniversary that they are up against. We expect to leverage gross margin in fiscal 2018 with SG&A deleveraging. We anticipate synergies of about $70 million, in which $50 million of that is expected to flow through gross margin, which should produce leverage, while the remainder flows through SG&A.","Key initiatives driving gross margin include repair, discounting, procurement, and corporate streamlining of our processes. From an SG&A perspective, key initiatives continue around organizational structure and payroll savings. We plan to continue investing in IT, which carries incremental expense, and as such, we anticipate SG&A to deleverage on lower sales.","Key investments relate to omnichannel and other IT projects that will strengthen our customer service proposition and our infrastructure for the long-term.","Earnings per share is expected to be $7 to $7.40. Now, keep in mind that this EPS range is as reported. Last year, integration costs, which were excluded from adjusted EPS, were $24 million. This year, they\u2019ll be in a range of $13 million to $15 million and consist primarily of severance and IT implementation costs.","Also, this year\u2019s EPS will still have the effect of purchase accounting adjustments of approximately $17 million. This is flat to last year, but excluded in last year\u2019s adjusted EPS. So, these expenses in FY 2017 do not go completely away in FY 2018. They just don\u2019t warrant a non-GAAP presentation.","The effective tax rate is expected to be 24% to 25%, driven by the jurisdictional mix of our pretax earnings. Tax reform agendas remain a priority in the US as well as outside of the US. Our effective tax rate guidance excludes any potential effect from tax reform.","The weighted average common shares outstanding for the year should end up at about 74 million to 75 million shares. This includes the as-is converted impact of our convertible preferred shares. It does not include any impact from the resolution of our credit strategic review. When we complete the review, we will communicate any potential incremental impact to our share count.","The mix of our capital expenditures will change in favor of technology and omnichannel investments. Consistent with that strategy, store square footage is projected to be flat to down slightly, primarily due to accelerating the number of regional store closings.","With that, that concludes my prepared remarks and I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark Light","Thank you, Michele. I\u2019d like to close by saying, although the year did not go exactly how we would have liked, we still believe we have many years of profitable growth and market share gains ahead of us.","Our brands, our scale and our people give significant competitive advantage. I would like to thank all the Signet team members for their hard work and dedication during the fourth quarter and throughout the entire fiscal year.","And with that, we\u2019ll now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Co.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Sheila Reginis [ph] in for Oliver. Thank you for taking our question. Just in terms of your credit review, if possible, could you just elaborate more on what has given you more comfort around the option of outsourcing your credit business and viewing it as the preferred option versus keeping it in house?","Michele Santana","Sure. So, as I mentioned on the call, and I described that we\u2019re looking at that outsourcing alternative. We\u2019ve identified that we would work with a primary and a secondary lender. So, that gives us our view in terms of potential path for outsourcing.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Just to clarify, it's more about the structure?","Michele Santana","It\u2019s the structure \u2013 that\u2019s correct.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. Good morning. Mark, I was wondering if you had any numbers around the private jeweler closures that you could share with us. Seems like that's been a big factor in sales.","And then also for Michele, if there's \u2013 is there an opportunity to reduce expenses at this point given the expectation for sales declines? Thanks.","Mark Light","Thank you, Lorraine. As it relates to jewelry store closures, according to the Jewelers Board of Trade, there was an increase of stores that were ceasing operations in the fourth quarter of 52% year-on-year. It was also stated by the Jewelers Board of Trade that it was the biggest decrease of store closures \u2013 or the biggest increase of store closures since the recession. I don\u2019t have the number off the top of my head, but I believe it\u2019s around 1,200 stores that closed year-over-year.","Michele Santana","And to your second question in terms of the expenses, absolutely. That is what management does. We focus on our expenses and that\u2019s factored into our guidance. You can look at our results for fiscal year 2017. Our total sales declined $156 million on an adjusted basis, but our EBIT was virtually flat. So, we do have the levers of expenses.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Michele Santana","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with Nomura\/Instinet. Your line is open.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. Good morning guys. Michele, can you help contextualize \u2013 I know you spoke about it a bit, but can you just help contextualize your comfort in that gross margin leverage, just despite negative comps, and I think you guys are lapping some impressive cost synergies?","And then just quick clarifications, just looking at the 165-plus closings, are you planning to close all the regionals this year and any help on the timing of the closures and openings?","Michele Santana","Sure. In terms of \u2013 I\u2019ll take your first question on the gross margin and our level of comfort. Well, I mentioned on the prepared remarks, the Zale gross margin rate increased, and that was driven primarily on the heels of 120 basis point increase in the gross merchandise margin rate.","So, we have confidence in the initiatives that Mark outlined that are really focused on gross margin \u2013 repair, discounting, we\u2019re getting the cost savings from our centers that are moving through our profit line based on our inventory turns. So, we feel very confident in terms of our initiatives around gross margin and the ability to leverage on that gross margin as we look out into next year.","In terms of the regionals, we will still end the year with some regionals. We will accelerate, as Mark and I had alluded to on the call, this year, but there will still be a small residual that is left at the end of FY 2018.","Simeon Siegel","And Mark?","Mark Light","If I could add, the majority of those stores will close by the end of the year because most of the leases terminate by the end of the year. And those regionals stores that will be staying open are very profitable regional stores and we don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not accustomed to closing profitable stores. So, that\u2019s why those stores will be open by the end of the year.","Simeon Siegel","Great, thanks. And then, Mark, just to the point about the e-com channel growth, so when you think about that, are there differences you're seeing between bridal and the rest of the business?","Mark Light","Yes. As it relates to our business, the bridal penetration at e-commerce is lower than we sell in our brick-and-mortar stores. We do sell lower price point items more on e-commerce.","But that being said, Simeon, we see opportunities of gaining momentum on the bridal business. I mentioned we\u2019ll be testing a bridal configurator that we think will enhance the bridal experience on e-commerce, but yes, there is a difference, bridal penetrates much more in the stores than it does online as of to date.","Simeon Siegel","Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.","Brian Tunick","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Two questions, I guess. Mark, from your perspective, you keep calling out the mall traffic declines and, obviously, sounds like February was down almost 10% for mall traffic. Is your customer telling you that they're not coming in and doing research anymore online, and it's more of an impulse item? Just curious why you think the jewelry purchase has changed so much and why you're calling out mall traffic.","And then on Michele's point, I think you mentioned on the credit sale, there would be an update or an impact on the share count. Is it wrong to think that if you were to go through a credit sale, that you would look for an earnings-neutral deal and you would use the proceeds to buy back stock?","Michele Santana","Let me just start with that and I\u2019ll flip it over to Mark to talk about the online. I guess, two comments. One, it wouldn\u2019t be wrong to think that way, but it\u2019s premature for us to comment on that. At the time, we make the decision, we will update you in terms of any impact on what that means for our share count and share buybacks related to that.","Mark Light","Brian, as it relates to jewelry shoppers, we know \u2013 and we\u2019ve surveyed this heavily \u2013 the vast majority of jewelry shoppers go online first to educate themselves about our business, to educate themselves about diamonds. It\u2019s a product that a lot of consumers just don\u2019t understand.","So, we believe that shopping traffic is declining in the jewelry category as well because of going online first to educate themselves. We\u2019re not \u2013 we can\u2019t just escape that the mall traffic is down because we do have a lot \u2013 half of our business is gift-giving business and that is affected as well by more traffic.","That being said, we\u2019re going to make tremendous enhancements to our online and omnichannel experience that we think will benefit our store and our store brands, both online and in-store.","Brian Tunick","Great. Thanks and good luck.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Tom Nikic","Hey, good morning, everyone. This is Tom Nikic on for Ike. I wanted to just ask about general category trends. I know that your comps have been negative for a couple of quarters now and some of the department stores have talked about doing better in fine jewelry and making that a focus. Can you just talk about broader trends in the jewelry industry and maybe what the competitive set is looking like? Thanks.","Mark Light","Yes. As it relates to the competitive set, Tom, as we stated, it was a very promotional fourth quarter and, quite frankly, first part of this year. A lot of our department stores competitors did heavy, heavy discounting, specifically in the jewelry category, and we just elected not to participate and cut our margins to that level.","As I stated earlier, there was a tremendous increase of independents and store closures, one of the largest increases of store closures since the recession. And a lot of those independent jewelers were having liquidation sales and discounting products very, very much. Again, we decided not to participate and preserve our margin.","That being said, over the years, the jewelry industry, as we said, has been resilient and there have been dips in the industry and we have seen the recovery as Signet has done on a consistent basis. And we believe, with all the investments we\u2019re putting in technology and innovation of new product and working on our marketing and digital marketing, that we still believe that long-term Signet has a great opportunity of capturing profitable jewelry market share.","Tom Nikic","All right. Thanks for taking my question. Good luck for this year.","Mark Light","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Krasik with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Scott Krasik","Yes. Hi, everyone. I'm just going to try and sneak three quick ones in first. So, Michele, first question, if you did have to keep the credit in house and transition to a contractual accounting, would that assume that you would have to have a material change in the penetration level of credit sales?","Number two, it seems like you have about $0.30 in transitory costs or expenses in your guidance for FY 2018. Do those go away in FY 2019?","And then number three, do we take the convertible or the preferred dividend out of net income? Or because it's assumed in the share count, is it not included in calculation for EPS? Thanks.","Michele Santana","Okay. So, you did. You snuck in three quick questions. Yeah, I guess your first question, in terms of \u2013 if you assume that we wouldn\u2019t be successful in an outsourcing scenario and moving to a contractual, it really has no implication in terms of the credit penetration rate. So, I\u2019m not sure if I fully understand what you\u2019re trying to get at there, but there is nothing that I\u2019m aware of that would have an indication on our credit penetration.","Secondly, the $0.30, you\u2019re correct, it\u2019s about an implied of purchase accounting and integration cost in FY 2018 that\u2019s factored into the guidance. When you think about FY 2019, some of those costs will go away. Keep in mind, with purchase accounting, that actually will drag on for a period of time. Primarily, it\u2019s with the deferred revenue, but it will continue to be lessened as we move past FY 2018.","And the third question, Scott, you had on the convertible, that\u2019s factored both into \u2013 like our numerator and denominator on how do you calculate your earnings per share. So, I think you\u2019re fine in terms of probably how you\u2019re looking at it.","Scott Krasik","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research. Your line is open.","Janet Kloppenburg","Good morning, everyone. Mark, I wondered if you could talk about the particulars of the fashion jewelry business, some of the lower AUR businesses where you were met with some promotional activity from competitors and lost some share. What's the outlook there for that business as we go forward?","And I think it's great that you're trying not to promote much, but if the pricing pressure continues, I'm just wondering how far you'll let market share erosion go in light of pricing pressure. Thank you.","Also, Michele, could you talk about inventory levels and if they are aligned by brand where they should be? Thank you.","Mark Light","Thank you, Janet. As it relates to fashion jewelry, when we analyzed our results from the Christmas selling season, we saw that there were certain price points in fashion, lower price points, call it $200 to $700, that we did not do as well as we expected to do.","Our merchandising team is very focused on finding key fashion trends and testing key fashion trends in those price points and we\u2019re focused right now on testing some different products and programs and brands in those price points. And we believe that we will have the opportunity to gain that market share back in those price points. What we did in the fourth quarter didn\u2019t connect with the consumers. We\u2019ll learn from that and we\u2019ll take our learnings and make sure that we do much better in those price points for this year and going into the fourth quarter of this year also.","Michele Santana","And, Janet, if I could just add on to what Mark said, just understand the comments in terms of our expectation to leverage gross margin next year, that also includes that we anticipate there will be promotional activity for Signet this year. So, it\u2019s all netted into our guidance.","Mark Light","Thank you, Michele. One other thing, Janet, I want to make sure it\u2019s clear, we\u2019re also much more focused this year. There was a dynamic shift on what was happening in the jewelry industry and we\u2019re focus much more on women customers specifically, and specifically fashion-oriented products that are attractive to women. So, it\u2019s something that we are very focused on. We\u2019ll be doing a lot of testing and research on those fashion products.","Michele Santana","And then, Janet, I\u2019ll take your second question related to inventory, which I believe is the inventory aligned by brand, we still have a continued opportunity with our Zale banners to optimize our inventory levels, and that will continue to be an ongoing initiative to drive a faster inventory turn rate.","Janet Kloppenburg","Thank you.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.","Dana Telsey","Good morning. Can we talk a little bit about the store closures that you're doing? What do you see is the impact on sales and profit? And the investment in omnichannel, what should we \u2013 how much will it be of the Capex? A And what should we see coming through to the holiday season this year? Thank you.","Michele Santana","So, your first question in terms of the impact of the store closures on sales and profit, the stores that we\u2019re closing and accelerating, we actually believe, will have a benefit to our existing mall stores when we look at sales transfer, and it should only actually help to strengthen our top line and our profit for this year. ","And I missed your second part of that question.","Dana Telsey","The investment in omnichannel. Can you take us through what initiatives should we be looking at this year in order to wind up the holiday season a better holiday than 2016?","Mark Light","Yes, Janet. There are several initiatives. And I said in my prepared comments \u2013 let me just get my notes here in a second. We are investing, specifically in digital marketing, and we are investing in enhancing our architecture that we believe will enhance our content \u2013 our customer content review. We are investing in making sure \u2013 heavily in the Zales platform. We\u2019re actually putting Zales because their platform is a platform that does not have a future. So, we are investing heavily in a new platform, which is a hybrid platform, for our Zales brand. There\u2019s a lot more invested and we can talk about in more detail, Dana, after the call, but we are investing in digital marketing, we are investing in a huge new platform for Zales and we\u2019re investing in the architecture to get it corrected for our Sterling brands.","Dana Telsey","And just quick question. More color on the Mother's Day shift. Is advertising moving or the different \u2013 May 8 last year, May 14 this year, anything we should take away on Mother's Day given the earnings impact of what's changing?","Michele Santana","I think I said \u2013 you saw it in the release and I mentioned on the call. What I would say is that there is a shift, out of Q1, into Q2 of about 300 to 350 basis points as it relates to sales. And the EPS number I gave you would also factor in any movement on the advertising side as well.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Michele Santana","Thank you, Dana.","Operator","We are out of time for further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Light.","Mark Light","Thank you all for taking part in this call. Our next scheduled call is to report the first quarter of fiscal 2018. It\u2019s on May 25.

On our call today are Mark Light, CEO; and Michele Santana, CFO. The presentation deck we will be referencing is available under the Investors section of our website, signetjewelers.com.","During today's presentation, we will in places discuss Signet's business outlook and make certain forward-looking statements. Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. We urge you to read the risk factors, cautionary language, and other disclosures in the Annual Report on Form 10-K that was filed March 26 with the SEC. We also draw your attention to slide number two in today's presentation for additional information about forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thanks, James, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we delivered very strong top line and bottom line results. Signet comps increased by 3.6%, and earnings per share metric showed impressive increases over last year. Most notably, adjusted EPS was $1.62 which was 25.6% increase over the prior year. And when measured on apples-to-apples basis versus last year by excluding Zale, our EPS was up $0.06 or 4.7%.","Each of our divisions had same-store sales increases, led by our UK division with an increase of 6.2%, while our newest division, Zale, had a 5.6% increase. The Sterling division had a 2.3% comp store increase, which was the division's 22nd consecutive quarterly comp increase. In terms of merchandise, Signet bridal and fashion diamond collection performed well across the organization. And by selling channel, our broad-based strength was evident with outlets and eCommerce delivering strong results.","Now let's focus on the performance by our divisions, starting with our Sterling division. Sterling delivered a 2.3% comp sales growth led by Kay with an increase of 3.6%; Kay's 25th consecutive quarterly increase. Kay saw strength in diamond jewelry across its merchandise portfolio in bridal and fashion, branded and non-branded, and a variety of products. Examples include Neil Lane Bridal and Tolkowsky, Diamonds in Rhythm, fashion pendants, and solitaire earrings and rings, and watches were strong also.","We launched Pinterest and Instagram for Kay in time for Mother's Day. These are brand new marketing platforms for our customers. And nearly every field operation's key performance indicator improved year-over-year. Importantly, our customer service index scores are the highest they've ever been.","Our Jared store had comp sales increase of 0.2%, while our total sales were up 4.4%. Jared had success around fashion collections such as Neil Lane Designs, Diamonds in Rhythm, Lois Hill, Earthly Treasures by Smithsonian and Le Vian. And in watches Movado and Citizen were very strong. And our Vera Wang test continues to perform well in our Jared stores. We recently launched a test of incremental radio advertising in several markets, markets that helped strengthen our bridal position. In addition, we also launched Jared's first-ever brand book used for direct mail marketing and in-store use.","We continue to drive our critical traffic-building repair and design center business. We recently launched a new manager training system for our design and service centers in our Jared stores to enhance our artisans' ability to deliver high-quality product in even faster timeframes. Given the investment and our initiatives in our Jared business, we feel we are well positioned to capture profitable market share.","Now moving on to our Zale division. Zale delivered a strong first quarter of 6.1% comps due to variety of planned investments and initiatives around merchandising, marketing, and field operations. Beginning with merchandising, our branded bridal and fashion diamond collections performed very well led by the Vera Wang Love collection, the Celebration Diamond and Unstoppable Love.","As we continue to focus on expanding depth versus breadth in our merchandise assortments, our current brands continue to drive sales growth. The Zale store teams are scoring well on key customer service and selling skills performance indicators. They are highly engaged and executing better than ever. In the first quarter, there were a variety of other successes beyond our Zale store performances. Our Peoples stores in Canada and our Piercing Pagoda stores throughout the United States all delivered comps in excess of 6%, and eCommerce performed very well also.","Driving results is the continuous phenomenal collaboration between all of our division team members to Signetize our business. And speaking of Signetizing, several areas are actively engaged in collaboration, such as field operations, marketing, and merchandising. And we're also seeing benefits from consolidated real estate and diamond-buying teams as well as alignment around our human resources departments. And we are in the process of finalizing our technology road map for the next several years, which will include a single IT function for the enterprise, a roadmap of common technology platforms for us to expand and grow our business and digital experiences that enable us to know our customers intimately, while seamlessly servicing them.","In the UK, the main drivers include initiatives around diamonds, success in fashion merchandise and watches, and a continued focus on sales rather than test (06:34). The UK continues to drive diamond sales with their improved sales training and marketing initiatives geared towards bridal customers. Perfect Fit, the Forever Diamond, Neil Lane, Leo and Tolkowsky all were strong in the first quarter as well as Le Vian diamonds. And our Vera Wang test performed well also. Outside of the diamond category, watches and beads also did very well.","Our UK division experienced strength across all selling channels. eCommerce sales increases were higher than total Signet eCommerce sales increases. And our new outlet stores performed well. Our UK division continues to embrace a culture of collaboration and is focused on continuously enhancing their diamond-selling skills journey.","Signet continues to gain profitable market shares in both Sterling and in our Zale division as well as for Signet overall. We have a highly collaborative team-oriented mindset as we integrate our businesses. We continue to see progress against all of our strategic pillars and specifically in best-in-bridal. And our omni-channel approach is clearly thriving as we see strength across all of our selling channels.","So to sum up, we're seeing terrific contributions and collaborations from all of our divisions. Zales continues to gain synergy and operational momentum. The UK has shown unprecedented comp growth as a result of our collaborative culture. And Sterling has consistently shown strength with positive comps and operating results. I feel as good as ever about our future for the near, the medium, and long term.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Michele for a run through on our financials.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. So starting with our sales performance, I'll point out a few highlights which Mark just provided an overview of the numbers. In our Sterling division, total sales increased 4.5% to $944.2 million, which included a same-store sales increase of 2.3%. The average transaction price at Sterling increased by 4.7% and the number of transactions decreased by 3%. This was driven by our merchandise mix including bridal and higher price point fashion collections.","Our Zale division total sales were $437.1 million for the quarter, which included a same-store sales increase of 5.6%. Total sales also included an $8.6 million unfavorable revenue impact due to purchase accounting adjustments related to deferred revenue. As Mark indicated, sales were particularly strong in our Zale division in branded bridal and branded diamond fashion.","In our UK division, total sales decreased 3.4%, but increased 6.6% on a constant exchange basis. Sales were $146.5 million with a comp sales increase of 6.2%. The average transaction price increased by 3.6% and the number of transactions increased by 2.6% due to merchandise mix with strong performance in branded bridal, fashion diamond jewelry and fashion watches.","Moving on from sales, I'll walk through Signet's consolidated Q1 performance and then we'll turn and analyze Signet's adjusted results. So, on slide eight, the table provides a reconciliation of Signet's adjusted results to our consolidated results. The difference between adjusted Signet and Signet are the columns reflecting purchase accounting and transaction cost with transaction cost including our integration-related expenses.","On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.48 per share and at the high end of our guidance. Purchase accounting adjustments, which include a reduction to deferred revenue, amortization related to inventory fair value step up, and amortization of unfavorable contracts were dilutive to EPS by $0.09. Transaction costs were responsible for $0.05 of dilution. Transaction costs related to our integration were $0.02 per share higher than first anticipated and that's primarily due to timing associated with various consulting expenses.","Now let's move on and we'll look at operating income by division. Operating income of $176.2 million or 11.5% of sales consisted of the following components. Sterling Jewelers was $178.2 million or 18.9% of division sales, and that's up 50 basis points from last year and a record Q1 high. Zale operating income was $15.5 million or 3.5% of division sales, inclusive of purchase accounting adjustments. Zale's performance consisted of $10.4 million of profit from the Zale Jewelry operating segment and $5.1 million from the Piercing Pagoda operating segment.","Now when excluding cost of $11.4 million related to purchase accounting, which we just previously discussed, the Zale division operating profit was $26.9 million or 6% of adjusted division sales. Our UK operating profit was $0.5 million or 0.3% of division sales versus no profit last year. Other, which primarily consists of our corporate and administrative expenses in Signet's diamonds sourcing subsidiaries, includes $6.4 million of transaction costs related to integration activities.","We're continuing to show the detail of adjusted Signet and the Zale operations to give further visibility into our results, which we'll expect that we'll do this until we fully comp in Q3. After that point, we'll provide Zale details consistent with our divisional disclosures.","The presentation on slide 10 takes adjusted Signet, which is shown on the far right and then breaks it into two parts. One part of Zale operation is shown in the middle column and the second part in the left-hand column is adjusted Signet excluding Zale. Adjusted Signet excluding Zale is the rest of Signet inclusive of finance, interest and taxes. From sales to operating income, this gives you comparability to prior year results. In addition, the information is provided to give you visibility as to how the Zale operations performed in the first quarter.","So, continuing on, let's review Signet's adjusted P&L results below the sales line. Adjusted gross margin was $581.4 million or 37.8% of adjusted sales and that was down 80 basis points versus last year. The decrease in rate was driven by the addition of Zale, which impacted the gross margin rate by 90 basis points as Zale currently operates with a lower gross margin structure than that of the Sterling division. Excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet gross margin rates would have been 38.7% and that would be up 10 basis points primarily due to favorable commodity cost.","Adjusted SG&A was $450.9 million, or 29.3% of adjusted sales, and that was up 70 basis points versus last year's rate of 28.6%. Excluding Zale, the adjusted SG&A rate was also 29.3% and that's due to higher planned advertising expense in our Sterling division and higher central cost due primarily to legal and payroll related costs.","The increase in advertising expense, as Mark had previously mentioned, is due principally to the launch of new Jared radio and print advertising among a variety of other marketing initiatives and investments that impacted the rate by 40 basis points. This higher SG&A ratio is a function of investing for future growth and we expect our SG&A run rate to improve this year. Other operating income was $63.5 million. This increase of $9.5 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances.","Adjusted operating income in the first quarter was 12.6% of adjusted sales. Excluding the Zale division, the adjusted Signet operating margin would have been 15.3% leveraging up 20 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $1.62 compared to a $1.29 in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. On a comparable basis, that is when excluding this year's impact from Zale and capital structure and financing, EPS was $1.35, representing a 4.7% growth over last year. Our strong operating results affords us the opportunity to repurchase $21.9 million of Signet stock in the first quarter, in line with our capital allocation plan. At the end of the first quarter, there was $243.7 million remaining under Signet's 2013 share repurchase authorization program.","Now we'll move on to the balance sheet, and we'll start with a look at our inventory. Net inventories ended the quarter at approximately $2.5 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion or 63% over last year, and that's driven in part by sales growth of 45%. The inventory level increase was driven primarily by the acquisition of Zale. To a lesser extent, inventory levels were also impacted by new store growth of $40 million and higher diamond inventory of $56 million associated with our bridal business and our diamond sourcing initiative. This higher level of diamond inventory reflects our continued initiatives around our best-in-bridal strategic pillar.","Now let's turn attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. In-house credit remains an important component of Sterling division's business and a competitive advantage. Net accounts receivable increased $1.5 billion and that compares to $1.3 billion last year, up 14.7%, driven by higher sales and an increase in the credit penetration rate. Our credit participation was 60.7% compared to 58.1% last year. The increase in credit participation was attributed primarily to credit decision engine improvements made in April of last year, higher outlet credit participation, and strong guest acceptance of our credit offerings.","The average monthly collection rate was 12.6% compared to 13.2% due primarily to three reasons: first, our customers continue to opt more for our regular credit terms, which require lower monthly payments compared to the 12-month interest-free program; second, our mix of bridal increases due to our best-in-bridal strategy and this creates a higher receivable \u2013 average receivable balance. Our required scheduled payments do not increase proportionately with the higher merchandise mix shift; and finally third, like other consumer loans, more principal is paid off later, so as our portfolio has grown more in the last year, proportionately, more of it will be paid later.","So, let's move on to few other credit specifics around our in-house finance programs. Net bad debt expense for the quarter was $28.1 million compared to $22.3 million last year, an increase of $5.8 million, and that was driven primarily by the growth in receivable balance from increased penetration and change in the credit program mix.","Other operating income was $63.5 million compared to $54 million last year. This was an increase of $9.5 million and is due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables as well as a shift away from interest-free programs. So, the net impact of these two items was income of $35.4 million compared to $31.7 million in the prior year, or an increase of $3.7 million. Our portfolio continues to perform well as evidenced by the net impact of bad debt and other operating income, as well as the allowance as a percentage of accounts receivable being fairly consistent.","So now we'll move on to our financial guidance. Our financial guidance for the second quarter Signet comparable store sales are expected to increase 2% to 3%. Second quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be a $1.11 to $1.16. As a reminder, adjusted EPS is EPS less the two set of adjustments that are shown on slide 15 being purchase accounting and our transaction cost related to integration.","Our Q2 comp sales projection reflects continued sales growth and a strong hurdle rate achieved by Signet last year driven by Sterling with a 6.7% comp increase. Our test guidance also reflects our current sales run rate. And our guidance also reflects our proven ability to protect our bottom line and to drive financial results through EPS growth.","From an effective tax rate standpoint, Signet's fiscal 2016 annual rate is anticipated to be 28% to 29%. And the difference versus fiscal 2015 is principally the full-year effect of owning Zale and having our capital structure in place. Capital expenditure guidance for the full year is $275 million to $325 million and our net selling square footage is projected to grow approximately 2% to 3%. And I'd reference you to our news release for further detail by division.","And lastly, I'd like to reiterate our confidence in delivering our operating profit synergy goal of $150 million to $175 million, which if using our current weighted average shares outstanding, equates to about $1.90 to $2.20 of earnings per share within the three-year period ending January 2018. As we previously guided, 20% of the synergies will be achieved by the end of fiscal year-end and will be back-end loaded to the second half of this year. As a result, synergies are not a material component of our Q2 EPS guidance.","That concludes my remarks on the financials, and with that I'd like to turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you, Michelle. In conclusion, we've seen terrific contributions and collaboration from every division. And I want to congratulate and thank all of the Signet team members for a great first quarter. The dedication and passion delivered significant value for Signet shareholders and positions us for growth into the future.","And now we'll take some time for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question is from Dorothy Lakner with Topeka. Your line is open.","Dorothy Senghas Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","Thanks and good morning, everyone.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Good morning.","Dorothy Senghas Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","Congratulations on a nice start to the year.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Dorothy.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you, Dorothy.","Dorothy Senghas Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","Just looking over the comp results, Sterling obviously has had many, many quarters of growth here, but Kay seems to be performing a bit better versus Jared. Is that just a comparison? I know last quarter you talked about some softness in particular areas of Jared's business. So, I just wondered if you could put a little color around that?","And then also for Michele, maybe a bit more color on how you see the synergies sort of playing out in the back half of the year? Thanks.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you. I'll take the first one, Dorothy. As far as Jared goes, I want to stop and say that we believe that Jared is definitely gaining profitable market share against their competitive set. And as you said, Dorothy, Jared has had positive comps for a while now. Jared itself has had 21 out of 22 quarters of positive comps. And so, we feel, relative to the Jared business, we are definitely capturing profitable market share.","That being said, we're always focused on enhancing and improving our business, and as I said in my prepared remarks, we are testing incremental radio to see how we can drive the business. We're testing new direct mail marketing. We have a lot of new exciting programs in place that we're testing for the fall season. So, we're very confident that we can continue to capture profitable market share for Jared going forward.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, Dorothy, on your synergy question, we have a clear line of sight in terms of our achievement of the synergies in the back half of the year. Previously and as part of my prepared remarks, had mentioned we've guided to 20% of realization of synergies for fiscal 2016. And broadly, those synergies would follow that curve we talked about with 30% between revenue and cross-selling, 20% from SG&A and 50% in gross margin. So I think it roughly will follow that. And other than that, we're not going to really break down that synergy guidance, that 20% between what we expect to fall in Q3 and what we expect to fall in Q4. But we would expect to start seeing the synergy realization in the back half of the year.","Dorothy Senghas Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","Versus really not any in the second quarter?","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, that's right, Dorothy.","Dorothy Senghas Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","Yes.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","We said previously our expectation was it would really be immaterial terms of synergies realized in Q1 as well as Q2. And that this was really a back-half of the year story with synergies.","Dorothy Senghas Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets","Yes, great. Thank you so much for the clarification.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Thank you, Dorothy.","Operator","Your next question is from Joan Payson with Barclays. Your line is open.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Congratulations.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Morning. Thanks, Joan.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Joan.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, in terms of Zale having the kind of strong growth that it had in this quarter, is this the type of growth we can expect to see from that concept going forward or do you expect even further acceleration as more new initiatives are introduced?","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I'll start off and then I think Mark could add a little bit of color. One of the expectations, I would say, is Zale, given it's really low on the maturity curve in terms of growing that top line, you would expect that they're going to see acceleration of their sales at a much faster rate than what we would see with our other divisions. And, Mark, do you want to add some comment in terms of the pace or continued trend?","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Well, I don't know if you want to lock in the 6.1% for all your modeling...","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","...but we do feel good about where the Zales business is going. And as Michele mentioned, as it relates to maturity curve, a lot of the business opportunities and initiatives that we're sharing with the Zale division come from initiatives that we've learned and were successful in our Sterling division for years. So as we've said in our release, we do expect the Zales to have stronger increases going forward than the Sterling division. Whether or not they're at this rate, we certainly hope so, but we'll do everything in our power to make sure that we can do as much as possible.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. And then in terms of the second quarter guidance on the comp blend, the 2% to 3%, it's a little bit slower than what we've seen for a while now. What do you expect is driving the deceleration? Is it based on the tougher Sterling comparisons or something that you've seen so far in the season?","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","First of all, I think Michele mentioned in her comments, we are going up against strong hurdle rates and we definitely have to take that into consideration when we look at our guidance. So it starts with hurdle rates and then it goes into we're making investments for our business and a lot of those investments are back-ended, but we still think that our guidance is going to be a healthy \u2013 is a nice increase for the business for the second quarter.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. I would just pile on to Mark that it is a comp growth of 2% to 3%. We talked about the hurdle rates and the continued consecutive quarterly comp growth that we're expecting to achieve and current run rates have been factored into that. And then when you look at our EPS guidance, I think it all comes down to our proven ability to execute and drive EPS growth.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Joan.","Operator","Your next question is from Simeon Siegel with Nomura. Your line is open.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Good morning.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","So, Sterling saw a gross margin improvement which you called out. Could you talk about the impact you'd expect to see going forward from the promotional environment and then the commodity costs? And then just, Mark, to your point about the initiatives going on at Jared's, can you talk about the drivers that could spur the reacceleration, kind of your market share commentary? And then maybe any thoughts when you'd expect to see sales impact from that increased advertising? Thanks.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","So, why don't I kick it off with the gross margin, and again what I would say, Simeon, is we don't give full-year guidance in terms of our gross margin, nor do we give quarterly guidance on what those gross margin levels are expected to be, but to give you some flavor in terms of directionally, we would expect that we're still going to see some benefit coming through from our lower commodity cost associated with our gold pricing.","From a promotional standpoint, again, I would say that we're no more promotional than we have in the past, so I don't think promotions really have an effect or play into what we see on the gross margin line item. And I guess, Mark, do you want to talk through some of the Jared marketing questions?","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Yes. First of all, as I said, we have tested incremental radio advertising in certain markets. We actually built the Jared division, when we started with Jared, before we could afford national TV we built the Jared division on continuity radio. And having radio is a wonderful way to develop our business and kind of describe what Jared's all about.","So we're getting back into testing the radio, see that we can get a lift in served market and specifically for our best-in-bridal program for the Jared business. So, advertising is something that you don't see automatic sales lift. It's a building effect. And we always test programs in the spring season to get a good understanding of the elasticity and what we can do some type of relations as it relates to what type of growth we could expect in the fall.","So, a lot of this (29:01) is very common for us to test different type of programs in the spring to hopefully roll it through the fall. So, you've got incremental advertising as it relates to radio, which was in the test mode. As I stated, we have our first-ever branded book in our Jared stores, so both customers, current customers can get direct mail and our stores can sell off of that and that's something we hope and as we analyze the results something we can carry through the fall.","And there's certain product launches that were in test right now, Simeon, which I'm not going to share with you for competitive reasons that we're very excited about that could be very strong launches or extended tests for the fall season, and one which I mentioned was Vera Wang. We're finding early results at Vera is her product is actually definitely doing very well with the Jared customers.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks a lot guys and good luck for the rest of the year.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you, Simeon.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Ike B. Boruchow - Sterne Agee CRT","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thanks, Ike.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Ike.","Ike B. Boruchow - Sterne Agee CRT","I guess I wanted to focus a little more on the Zale business. I guess, first can you give some color on their \u2013 I'm sorry if I missed this \u2013 on their gross margin performance in the quarter year-over-year since we don't have the like-for-like compares to really look at?","And then also when we start to think about the synergies, Michele, that you mentioned flowing into the P&L in the back half, how should that process evolve? Should we begin by seeing procurement benefits that would benefit the gross margin line or would we start by seeing cost saves on the SG&A or is it both simultaneously?","And then the very last question would be the ADS agreement at Zale. Should that start to add a few million dollars in EBIT to the segment every quarter beginning in Q4 this year or how should we think about that?","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","So, in terms of the gross margin with Zale and really there is not a good comparison for you, unfortunately not. We didn't have them at Q1, and if you look at what their reported gross margins would have been, it's really apples and oranges because they were on a LIFO basis. So, I really can't talk directly to the gross margin other than we know it is lower than our Sterling division and it is an area of focus as it relates to our synergies.","We anticipate 50% of our synergies are going to come through gross margin between our merchandising and sourcing initiatives which really kind of leads then into your second question on how to think about those synergies and is it SG&A versus gross margin. I think you're going to start seeing them coming through a little bit both at the same time. When we talk about our gross margin synergies, we'll start seeing some from the procurement process.","The other one we talked about from a gross margin standpoint is our discount controls, and so that is something that we've been currently working on, on getting more of a systematic, more visibility into the discount control process at Zale. So, I think that's when we could start seeing it at the tail end of this year, as well as we'll start getting some of that SG&A savings coming in on the back half. So, I think it'll be a little bit of a blend between those two.","And then your final question, Ike, in terms of ADS, you're correct in that. Our ADS contract goes into effect in October. So, we will have, at the tail end of the year, ADS in place. And we would expect to see some benefit for that last quarter of the year.","Ike B. Boruchow - Sterne Agee CRT","Got it. Thank you.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","And just to remind you, Ike, on that front, from a synergy standpoint, we did exclude our ADS savings, which if you quantify that full-year effect, is $22 million. That was excluded from our synergy number. But I think we'll see some benefit at the tail end of our fourth quarter.","Ike B. Boruchow - Sterne Agee CRT","And is the ADS benefiting in gross margin or SG&A?","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","It will be in SG&A.","Ike B. Boruchow - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay, great. Thank you.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Ike.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Scott Krasik with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi, everyone.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Hi, Scott.","Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Let's pick that up. Having some problems with the phone. Hi. Can you hear me?","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Yes, we can.","Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Sorry about that. Okay. Good quarter. Just qualitatively or quantitatively, I think Mother's Day is probably the signature event in 2Q. Can you talk about how people responded to your events there? And then there's a lot of talk around fashion watches starting to slow. You called out some pretty good results in watches. How would that affect your business if people buy more fashion jewelry? Will they buy better watches? You thoughts there as well. Thanks.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Yes. As it relates to Mother's Day performance, Mother's Day is 10 days of our entire second quarter. So, we feel we've obviously took Mother's Day in consideration and we feel good about the guidance that we gave you all. So that's as much I'm going to say about the Mother's Day performance.","As it relates to fashion watches and fashion jewelry, fashion watches specifically the Movado brand is doing very well with us; our Citizen brand which has a lot of fashion styling within their brands are doing well, and continues to gain momentum and doing well. And then our UK our timepiece business is doing very well also. So, as a whole, I'm not sure I understand the question completely, but how does fashion watches have an effect on fashion jewelry? We don't see a lot of tradeoff there. It's pretty much a different customer set than it is in the fashion world, but there's components of it. What we see more commonly is within fashion jewelry you may have a tradeoff of diamond necklace versus a bracelet or something of that nature. Hopefully, that answers your question, Scott.","Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","It does. And then just more specifically to the beading part of your \u2013 and the charm part of your fashion jewelry business.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Yes. In the UK our bead business is very strong. In our U.S. businesses, whether it be Sterling or Zales, we continue to see improved run rate from the numbers that we shared with the market in the fourth quarter. So, there is definitely an improved run rate going on and the bead business is an important business for us. And we continue to partner with all of our bead partners to continue to enhance our assortment and enhance our promotions and enhance our marketing.","Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Awesome. Thanks, guys.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Jeff Stein with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Good morning, guys. I'm wondering as we look at your comp guidance for the second quarter, can you talk to us a little bit about what the assumptions are for the various divisions? In other words, kind of what is the assumption in U.S., UK, and Zales? Thank you.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Jeff. Thanks for the question. Jeff, unfortunately, we don't break down the guidance between the expectations whether it's store brand or even geography. I mean, all I would add to that is directionally, our UK, they really have some strong momentum going. We're really pleased and proud of the performance that they have. But beyond adding that little bit of color, we don't break it down by geography.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. And I noticed that in the first quarter, you closed 11 stores in the Zales division, and I think if I recall back in Q4, you kind of indicated that we were looking or about flat for the year. So, are you going to be adding locations or has anything changed with regard to plans for openings and closings in that division?","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Yeah. In the Zale division, Jeff, we expect to open up to 35 stores, about 25 Zales and 10 Piercing Pagoda store locations. And we plan on netting out a basically flat growth. We got 11 so far and there's a chance that there'll be another 20, 25 closed. But we watch that \u2013 literally we watch it every month, every quarter because a lot of these stores that used to be core-performing stores now that are getting some of the synergies and the benefits of the collaboration from Signet, they slowly turned to profitable stores that we have seen over the years both in our UK division and our Sterling division. But for now, we plan opening up to 35 stores, 25 Zales, 10 Piercing Pagodas, and probably closing about the same amount and being flat as far as square footage going through the Zale division.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you. And one quick one for Michele. The other operating income line, you showed a real healthy increase there. Would that be kind of a run rate we should look to continue through the balance of the year or was there something in Q1 that would cause it to be higher than Q2 through Q4?","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","I would say, Jeff, there was nothing unusual in Q1 that would have caused that to be higher but again, as you know, we won't give guidance for the full year on a financial line item or even on a quarterly basis. I think you can just look at our run rate to make some assumptions.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks much, Jeff.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot on solid results, guys. Thank you.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Oliver.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning. I know you've been doing studies, strategic studies on the brand architecture as it relates to the opportunities and cross-sellings and the synergies on that side. Could you just elaborate on what might be possible in terms of making sure you segment your brands optimally across your banners? And then on the holiday, it would be nice if you could just give us a little refresher on what you're most excited about in terms of year-over-year innovation as you look forward to the holiday selling season.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Okay. As far as the brand segmentation studies, thank you for bringing that up, Oliver, because you are giving me a global opportunity to do a commercial here. June 24, we are hosting the investor conference, and at that time, we will be sharing with the market our brand segmentation and how we plan on taking our brands into the future, our store brands.","But I'll give you a very quick overview, Oliver, because I won't give any adjustments, but the bottom line is the core of our customers in the U.S., Zales, Kay, and Jared's are within the mid-market. They actually have different customers, different base customers within that mid-market. And it's very clear to us that there is different segmentation within the mid-market. And we will define those segmentations to the market and to all of you at the investor conference. You can understand from our research and understanding our core customers how we can take our core customers for each brand. It was one of the nicest things that we found during the analysis of the Zales acquisition, is that Zales customer within the mid-market is actually different than that of Kay's and Jared.","And so, we're going to have strategies and initiatives how we can penetrate those segmented customers even further. So, I need a lot more time, Oliver, to get into it. And so, please come to the conference and we'll be able to discuss it in more detail.","As it relates to what we're most excited about the holiday, I'm not going to share too much, Oliver, because we have a lot of competitors out there. But I will tell you that between our merchandising and marketing teams, there's a lot of exciting new tests in place, as much if not more than I've seen in our company over the last several years that we are excited about launching during this fall season.","And again, I'm not going to share with you, but I will just give you that I've been here a long time and we've got this particular upcoming holiday season we've got more in tests that we're excited about than I remember for the last couple of years. So, I'll leave you with that and hopefully the customers react in the same way as I am excited.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Okay. Thank you, that's helpful. And as we look across retail, wearable technology does seem to be occupying the minds of consumers. And I know that you have an awesome bridal business, as well as a unique proprietary brand portfolio. But is that something you're seeing or thinking about as you plan product and demand creation on the marketing side?","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","First of all, it's something we're definitely thinking about. Anybody who's selling any type of product being worn on their body, their wrist, their neck is a competitor of ours. And wearable technology is something we're all over. And we're obviously talking to all of our current partners and we're looking at the opportunities of what we can do to be in that facility and something we're all over.","As it relates to our current watch business, it is not affecting our watch business. Our business, as you've heard and seen is, our watch business is doing well in the UK and the U.S. But we are all over wearable technology. We'll stay very close to it, and I'm sure in the near future, you'll start seeing some opportunities for the Signet business probably in the next year timeframe, but we are definitely all over it.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","The last thing is on Jared. You've talked about it on the call. Thank you for the details. But what's story for the nature of the opportunity in the product assortment? Are you thinking that the gifting side of the business in terms of \u2013 just curious with respect to the price points of the portfolio where you felt like maybe you could install on more products or brand newness?","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","I think on both fronts of the business, we see opportunities. On the gifting side, we definitely have some tests in place with some exciting things that hopefully will run through the Christmas season if the tests continue to do well. And on the bridal side, as I stated, Vera Wang is testing very well on the bridal side and the bridal business is of critical importance and if we're going to be best in bridal, our Jared business needs to continue to invest in the bridal business. So, on both sides of the business, we are testing and looking into enhancing both our gifting and our bridal business in the Jared business as well as our entire business. But obviously, Jared's got a little bit more focus on it.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys. Best regards for the spring and summer and holiday.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you. Same to you, Oliver.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Oliver.","Operator","Your next question is from Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research. Your line is open.","Janet J. Kloppenburg - JJK Research","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for all the detail this morning. Mark, just one more question on Jared. I'm wondering if you think that your initiatives can drive traffic improvement in the second quarter or if your second quarter guidance on comps sort of assumes that there will be an unchanged trend, but perhaps that it should improve as we move through the rest of the year?","And then with respect to Zale, I wondered about the training program and to upgrade the associates and how far along we were in that process because I think it's helping a lot?","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you, Janet. As far as Jared goes, built into our guidance is our \u2013 within that overall guidance, Jared business is built in that and we're not going to get much more detailed into that. But I will say, as I said earlier, is that of what we do during the first and second quarter, there's a lot of testing going on for the fourth quarter. So, a lot of the testing that we're doing will help benefit the third and primarily the fourth quarter.","As far as Zale's training programs go, I've said this over and over, but diamond selling training is a journey. There's no destiny. And the Zale teams are doing tremendous on, first and foremost, understanding the basics of how to share with customers the features and benefits of selling a diamond, specifically selling Vera Wang and branded diamond programs. And we continue to enhance that journey and taking further in further steps in enhancing the Zale training team. So, we have basic training going on now and we will advance the next level of training. We're right now getting their teams ready for career development training for next year. So, this training is a true journey. And quite frankly, we have a very good template in our Sterling division that we're sharing with the Zale team and again going back the maturity curve, it will help the Zale business continue to grow. But it's not something that happens overnight.","Janet J. Kloppenburg - JJK Research","Thank you, Mark.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Rick Patel with Stephens. Your line is open.","Rick B. Patel - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thank you, Rick.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Rick.","Rick B. Patel - Stephens, Inc.","It's been about a year since you've closed the Zale deal, so can you take a step back and reflect on how the integration has played out so far? Perhaps what surprised you to the upside and worked out better than you initially expected? And then on the flipside, what's been more challenging than you maybe initially planned for?","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Sure. I would say that what's \u2013 I won't say it surprises. What pleasantly pleases us is the way the Zale team members are engaging with not only our team but also collaborating with us and really embracing our strategies. The Zale team members both in the stores and in their home office really are embracing the Signet culture and the Signet values and the Signet strategies very well. And I've been through a lot of acquisitions, and one this big for the team members to engage and embrace our strategy so well is something that we're just so very pleased about at this pace.","We've shared this before, and it's something we expect that with Zale having some of the financial problems they had over the year that they did invest in their technology in the business. And we expected there to be a lack of investment, and we expected them to be behind the Sterling divisions in technology. When you get involved with this and you really understand the business, we were surprised at how far behind they were in investment technology and how much we have to get involved and invest more into their technology.","That being said, we have plans for it, we have a great new Chief Information Officer named Dan Shull, who we have a hope would roadmap the technology strategy in place. But the technology was something that was a little worse than we expected it to be.","Rick B. Patel - Stephens, Inc.","Can you talk about pricing? Do you feel comfortable with where you are with the adjustments that you've made this year or should we expect some more refinements as we go through the year? And as a follow-up, can you talk about the market prices for diamonds right now and how you expect they will impact input cost in the future quarters?","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","As far as pricing \u2013 and, Michele, you could talk about more details, there was no major price increases. There were some subtle prices increases done in all of our divisions. It wasn't major. And the marketplace is a challenging retail marketplace out there. So, I wouldn't plan on more increased pricing right now. Right now, we want to capture a profitable market share, but I wouldn't plan on more price increases. And what was the second?","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So, in terms of diamond pricing, Rick, what we've said at the onset of the year and what we're seeing is really kind of a low-to-mid inflationary increase in the diamonds. And again, it always depends on cut, quality, size, et cetera. But low-to-mid is kind of where it heads out and what we're seeing on the diamond inflation side, and then earlier we talked about on the gold front that we are continuing to see the lower commodity cost. So, that's how you should be thinking about it.","Rick B. Patel - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks. Good luck for the rest of the year.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thanks, Rick.","Michele Santana - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks very much.","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Okay. We'll take one more question and \u2013 we'll take one more question, operator.","Operator","Certainly. Your final question is from Bill Armstrong with C.L. King & Associates. Your line is open.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, Mark and Michele. Just one more on Jared. So, it sounds like your overall transaction count was down. Were there specific product categories or areas that were weak and that you think offer some opportunity as we move through the back half of the year?","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","Of course, there are some categories that are weak, and then the ones that are strong I shared with you earlier. I don't want to get into the product categories because our job as retail merchants is to constantly refine and enhance our business. And that's what I keep on sharing with you, Bill, is that our merchants right now are diligently looking at what's doing well, what's not. They're testing other opportunities and gift-giving programs, so we continue to enhance our traffic, but it's important to understand that the average sale going up is definitely part of this best-in-bridal strategy.","And so, we expect the average sale to go up. We want those units. We want to continue to increase transaction, of course, so we've got programs in place. But as a whole, the Jared market and the Jared business is different than the mall business. And it's just something we believe firmly that we've captured profitable market share because a lot of our competitors outside the mall are having challenges in the retail jewelry marketplace. So, we believe Jared is capturing profitable market share, and then for the fourth quarter, we'll have a lot of new programs in place to continue to do so.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Are you concerned with any possible slowdown in spending by maybe the higher-end consumer on jewelry or other fashion categories or discretionary categories?","Mark S. Light - Chief Executive Officer and Director","No, we're not really concerned. Actually we've done a lot of \u2013 we've done a lot of research and a lot of surveys. And the most important thing that we know is that our products, jewelry is definitely in favor with the customers, we've favored and it hasn't changed. So, customers still very much appreciate and like to use jewelry to express their emotions. So, we're not concerned.","If I had to say we're concerned of anything is other than us, we would like for more of our industry to advertise more. We need our industry. We are the only big national advertiser out there. And to compete with the other products for that discretionary income is we need our industry to advertise more. We are going to, but our product is in favor, and customers definitely like to express emotion through our products. So, no, we are not concerned about that.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Mark S.

We're very pleased with our second quarter and first half results. And now we're focused, really, on our second half of the year, particularly our important fourth quarter holiday selling season.","For the first 3 weeks of the third quarter, we've had a positive start in both the U.S. and the U.K., which is a nice trend reversal in the U.K. Keep in mind, though, that we're only 3 weeks into the quarter and we have seen a lot of noise out there in both the macro retail environment and obviously, the geopolitical scene. But we do have some major events beginning soon, in fact, this weekend, we have a major event and continuing into later September and October. And we remain well prepared for the second half, especially with Q4. I'll discuss some of our strategies for holiday in just a couple of minutes.","Turning back to the second quarter. We delivered a solid financial performance in Q2, driven by the excellent execution of our strategies, which led to sales growth and earnings growth, excluding our acquisition late last year. Our second quarter comps at Signet increased by 3.6%. The U.S. division comps grew at a 4.9% rate on top of 8.2% last year, while the U.K. comps declined by 2.4%.","We also had tremendous continued momentum within our consolidated eCommerce space as we grew by 28.9%. This all led to operating income of $105.5 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.84, were at the high end of our guidance. Excluding Ultra, our diluted earnings per share were $0.90.","Let's begin by taking a look at the U.S. division performance. The U.S. total sales were at $741.1 million, and that was up $39.2 million or 5.6%. The U.S. same-store sales increased by 4.9% in the second quarter. Kay comps increased a strong 5.8%, while Jared increased at 5.5%. The success in both concepts was driven by particular strength in bridal, color diamonds and watches. Within these categories, our branded merchandise continue to do very well. Kay and Jared experienced increases in both transaction counts and also, average transaction value. So it was a nice mix in the increase.","And in the U.S., eCommerce performed very strongly with sales up $6.7 million to $25.3 million, which was an increase of 36%. The U.S. division operating profit declined by 4.9% with a 15% operating margin. But excluding the dilutive effect of the Ultra acquisition, operating income was $119.3 million and operating margin was 16.8%, up 10 basis points. It was another great quarter for the U.S. team numbers.","Now let's take a look at what's really driving the business. The drivers of our performance were our sustainable competitive strengths. In particular, our great customer experience, our investment marketing and broad customer acceptance of our powerful merchandise offerings, especially our exclusive and differentiated brands. The customer experience is really central to our success and we remain focused on the training and the development of our store teams, including the best use of in-store sales enhancing technology. Branded, differentiated and exclusive merchandise continue to perform well, particularly among some of the brands you see here listed on Slide 5 like Neil Lane, Tolkowsky, Le Vian, Open Hearts by Jane Seymour, et cetera. We also saw success across selling channels. As I mentioned, in the U.S., eCommerce sales were up 36%. This was driven in part by 14 million visitors to our sites. And the amazing thing is, over 40% of those came in through mobile devices.","Now I'd like to talk a little bit more about our outlook business. As most of you know, Ultra was purchased to build out an outlook strategy. Outlooks are seeing stronger customer traffic and development trends than any other retail selling channel at this time. By the end of this year, we expect to be operating approximately 120 Kay outlets and 39 Ultra Stores. Operationally, our strategy is working well and we're on plan. We have converted to Kay the nearly 70 stores we set out to convert from Ultra. Our field teams are up and running and they're in training as we speak. The IT has been integrated, including our in-house credit program. Credit penetration and our converted outlets is approximately 40% and growing. Now that's up from the low 20% as a stand-alone Ultra Stores before the acquisition.","We're also transitioning the merchandise mix to leverage the Kay brands, and we're creating made-for-outlet product to further differentiate from the Kay mall stores and also to meet the demands of the bargain-seeking outlet customer. From a financial perspective, we're on plan as well. The first half EPS dilution was $0.09, as was forecast, the third quarter dilution should be relatively minimal. And then in Q4, we continue to expect to be accretive. So overall, we're very pleased with the initial performance of this strategy and the acquisition, and we expect to see continued improvements over time from where we are today.","Now I'll turn to the U.K. Total sales in the second quarter were $139.1 million, down $12.9 million or 8.5%. Comp sales decreased by 2.4% compared to an increase of 2.1% in the second quarter last year. The total sales decline of 8.5% was due primarily to 3 things: The impact of closed stores was $5.6 million; the same-store sales decrease, $3.4 million; and currency fluctuation that hit us for $3.9 million. In Earnest Jones, which reported a negative 2.4% comp, the number of transactions increased driven primarily by strength in the branded bridal and watches, excluding Rolex, and average transaction value was lower. And that's primarily due to the impact from Rolex being offered in fewer stores compared to the prior year. In H.Samuel, which also reported a negative 2.4% comp, the number of transactions declined. That was due to lower traffic and store closures. This resulted in lower sales across many merchandise categories, but was partially offset by strength in branded bridal products. Sales in both of the businesses were impacted by lower B transactions.","eCommerce sales were $5.9 million, which was up $0.3 million or 5.4%. Our U.K. websites attracted 7 million visitors in the quarter. And unbelievably, 45% of those came in through mobile devices. The operating loss was $0.8 million, an increase of $0.5 million from last year, and that's primarily due to lower sales partially offset by cost reductions. I'd like to thank our U.K. team members for their continuing efforts to improve the business there.","So how do we win back the back half of the year? While we remain confident in our ability to deliver outstanding product ranges that meet our customers' desires and we've tested a lot of new programs with great results. We have exciting new products that will roll out in the second half including our exclusive differentiated brands, some of which you see pictures here on Slide 8. In bridal, we're line extending Leo Artisan, and we're also extending the very successful Neil Lane Bridal line. We will also expand colored diamonds, which have been really hot in the past year, and this includes the Artistry brand at Kay and Vivid brand at Jared. In Le Vian, another hot fashion brand for us, we'll roll out proven styles and new colors supported by special events. The Open Hearts new Wave Collection is producing great results, and we're expanding this brand as we did The Family Collection last year. The initial tests indicate Wave is another big winner for the brand. We'll speak more about our merchandise initiatives at our Investor Day conference on October 8, and I hope you can all make it there.","We'll continue to build upon our digital ecosystem as well, launching a new eCommerce website kayoutlet.com in September to support our outlet strategy, as well as enhanced Kay and Jared mobile websites. These initiatives, together with the variety of other new and exciting product offerings, will, we believe, produce an exciting and successful holiday season. Our team of merchants have done a great job and they're continuing to stay at the forefront of new products and trends.","We also have new and memorable ad campaigns ready to launch for the holiday season. We're increasing our advertising investment and we'll have a greater number of television impressions over the holiday compared to last year, as well as a much higher digital media profile. Plus our enthusiastic and our well-trained sales teams are primed and ready to support the merchandise initiatives. With all of this in place, we believe we're well positioned for the back half of the year and as I mentioned, especially the holiday selling season.","And now I'll turn the call over to Ron for more color.","Ronald W. Ristau","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by explaining sales in more detail. For the quarter, total sales for Signet increased 3.1% to -- or I'm sorry, $880.2 million compared to $853.9 million last year. Our same-store sales increased 3.6% compared to 7.1% growth last year. In the U.S., the total sales increased 5.6% or $39.2 million to $741.1 million, which included a same-store sales increase of 4.9%, as Mike discussed.","Our non-same-store sales were up 0.7%, which includes a 4.2 % increase for Ultra, and a 3.5% decrease for the U.S., excluding Ultra. This is caused by the timing shift due to the 53rd week in the calendar last year. The reported number in the second quarter of last year includes a $32.2 million benefit from the calendar shift of a Mother's Day promotion. The U.S. sales increases were driven by particular strength in bridal colored diamonds and watches and both Kay and Jared experienced increases in transaction counts of 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively. In addition, Kay increased average transaction value by 4.7% and Jared by 3%","In the U.K., total sales decreased 8.5% or $12.9 million to $139.1 million, while comp store sales decreased 2.4%. The total sales decline primarily due to the same-store sales decline of $3.4 million or 2.4%, the impact of closed stores of $5.6 million or 3.7% and currency fluctuations of $3.9 million or 2.4%, which were unfavorable.","The U.K. merchants showed particular strength in branded bridal and watches, excluding Rolex. In our H.Samuel brand, transaction counts declined by 5.4%, but increased in average transaction value by 1.4%. And Ernest Jones experienced an increase in transaction count of 2.2%, while average transaction value decreased by 8.9%, primarily due to the Rolex impact. Signet eCommerce sales were $31.2 million, up $7 million or 28.9% continuing on their strong trend.","Now let's take a look at the components of operating income. Our gross margin was $309.7 million, a decrease of $1.5 million. The gross margin rate was 35.2%, down 120 basis points in the quarter. The inclusion of the results for Ultra increased gross margin dollars by $5.7 million. However, it reduced the consolidated gross margin rate by 50 basis points and the U.S. gross margin rate by 70 points. The Ultra gross margin is lower than the core U.S. business due to lower store -- Ultra Store productivity and the impact of Ultra integration expenses.","Gross margin dollars in the U.S. increased by $1.3 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2013, reflecting higher sales offset by a gross margin decline of 180 basis points. Let's get into that. The lower U.S. gross margin was primarily attributed to the following components: Gross merchandise margin decreased by 50 basis points, which was entirely attributed to Ultra, the core business ran even to last year; and store occupancy and operating expenses deleveraged by 70 points, of which 40 basis points was due to Ultra and the remaining 30 basis point change was a result of the impact of the year-on-year calendar shift and an increase in the number of store openings. The U.S. net bad debt ratio increased to 4.9% of sales compared to 4.5% of sales in the prior year second quarter. The increase in the ratio was primarily due to growth in the outstanding receivable balance. I will explain further in a moment.","In the U.K., gross margin dollars decreased $2.8 million, primarily reflecting the impact of decreased sales and currency fluctuations, offset by gross margin rate increase of 40 basis points. Currency translation costs were $1.1 million of the decrease in gross margin. The gross margin rate increase was primarily driven by the sales mix.","Our selling, general and administrative expenses were $250.5 million, and as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points to $28.5 million. With the inclusion of the results of Ultra, increased SG&A by $13.5 million, and increased the consolidated SG&A rate by 70 basis points if we exclude Ultra to the SG&A leverage. And I will discuss this in more detail on the next slide.","Our other operating income was $46.3 million or 5.3% of sales compared to $40 million or 4.7% of sales last year. The increase was primarily due to higher interest earned on the higher outstanding receivable balance. So our consolidated operating income in the second quarter was $105.5 million representing 12% of sales. This was 100 basis points lower than last year, and is primarily due to Ultra. As we exclude Ultra, our consolidated operating margin was 13.3%, up 30 basis points over the prior year.","In the U.S. division including Ultra, our operating income was $115 million -- $111.5 million or 15% of sales compared to $117.3 million or 16.7% of sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. When we exclude Ultra, the U.S. divisions operating income was $119.3 million or 16.8% of sales, up 10 basis points. The operating loss for the U.K. division was $0.8 million, an increase of $0.5 million. And therefore, our consolidated operating income led to fully diluted earnings per share of $0.84. And if we were to exclude Ultra, the fully diluted earnings per share were $0.90, up $0.05 or 5%.","Now some additional detail on SG&A expense. Our SG&A remains well controlled. As I mentioned, SG&A expenses were $250.5 million compared to $240.3 million in the second quarter of last year, up $10.2 million, and as a percentage of sales they increased by 40 basis points to 28.5%. This is primarily caused by Ultra, which added $13.5 million to our expenses driven by the operations and onetime acquisition cost. When we exclude the impact of Ultra sales and expense, the SG&A expenses decreased $3.3 million and leveraged by 30 basis points to 27.8% of sales, primarily as we leveraged the U.S. expenses. SG&A expenses in the U.K. declined $2.9 million reflecting the impact of our cost reductions and the currency fluctuation impact, and this represented a slight deleverage due to the lower sales.","Turning to our share buyback program. Of course, we continue to look at the variety of ways to deliver shareholder returns. Beyond reinvesting in our operation, we've taken a shareholder friendly view towards the use of our cash. In the second quarter, we authorized a $350 million share repurchase program, of which $325 million remains. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 375,000 shares of Signet stock at an average price of $66.74 per share. We ended the quarter with cash of $212.9 million, positioning our company well for the holiday season.","Our net inventories ended the quarter at $1,417,700,000, an increase of $104.9 million or 8% for a year ago. But let's look at the reasons for this: The increase is primarily due to a $41.7 million increase in inventory for Ultra, and a $32.3 million increase in diamond inventory associated with our rough diamond initiative. Excluding these items, our core inventory increased by 2.4%. Our inventory is well positioned for the holiday season and we expect, by year end, to be closer to prior year end inventory levels as the inventory impact of Ultra and of rough diamond initiative will be less significant on a year-over-year comparative basis.","Now let's turn to credit, which remains an important component of our business. Our accounts receivable increased to $1,152,100,000 up 11.6% for the quarter. In the quarter, credit penetration, excluding Ultra, was 60.4% compared to 59.4% last year, attributed to increases in our bridal and branded product sales. It should be noted that our credit offerings were rolled out to Ultra stores in late June, and we have seen an initial strong response, as Mike discussed. However, as a group, it is currently less than our historical base, which is why our credit penetration with Ultra is 59.1% versus 59.4% last year. We believe credit usage in these stores will continue to grow as we are in the early units. The average monthly collection rate this quarter was 11.9% compared to 11.1% last year, as customers continue to opt for our regular credit terms, which required lower monthly payments as opposed to the 12-month interest rate program.","In the quarter, our bad net -- our bad debt expense increased to $36.5 million in the second quarter, an increase of $4.9 million driven primarily by growth in the receivable balance, which accounts for approximately 75% of this interest. The remaining increase is attributed to a variety of factors including slightly lower collection efficiency. As an example, the training and hiring of new staff that handle our volume increase has had a slight impact. And changes in the credit mix, for example, our regular credit terms, which carried longer repayment terms versus the 12-month interest free, is experiencing a slightly higher expense. We continue to believe the portfolio is performing well.","Offsetting the bad debt expense was an increase in other operating income, which is primarily interest income on the higher outstanding receivables and the shift away from the interest-free programs. The income on the portfolio was $46.3 million or 5.3% of sales in the second quarter, an increase of $6.3 million. Now the net impact of these 2 items, the bad debt expense and the other operating income, was income of $9.8 million in the second quarter as compared to $8.4 million in the prior year, representing an increase of $1.4 million. As we look forward, we believe the third quarter will be impacted in a similar fashion, with bad debt increasing versus last year's percentage of sales by 34 basis points, and other operating income increasing 34 basis points, with the 2 largely offset. This, will again, will be primarily driven by growth in the receivable balance. In the year -- year-to-date, we see a similar trend of increased bad debt, offset by increased other operating income, with a net impact benefit of $5.3 million.","Now let's turn to our third quarter guidance. For the third quarter of Fiscal 2014, the company currently expects same-store sales to increase in the low-single-digit range. As a result, earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.43, based on an estimated $80.5 million weighted average common shares outstanding. In the second quarter, we completed key introductions for the integration of Ultra as planned. And in the third quarter, we expect Ultra dilution to range from 0 to negative $0.02. For the full fiscal year, we anticipate having a range of approximately $80.4 million to $80.8 million weighted common shares outstanding. For the full year, the company expects capital expenditures in the range of $180 million to $195 million, which includes cost related to the opening of 75 to 85 new Kay stores, and several stores in the U.K., our store remodels, digital and information technology infrastructure buildouts and outlet store channel integration.","Thank you. And I will now turn the call back to Mike.","Michael W. Barnes","Thanks, Ron. In conclusion, I'd like to once again thank the Signet team worldwide for their contributions to a very successful quarter. We'd now be pleased to take any questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rick Patel from Stephens.","Rick B. Patel - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Can you help us think about what happened to Ultra's gross margin on a sequential basis, just comparing the first quarter to the second? On the surface, it looks like things got a little worst, but we're just trying to understand if it has to do with product, pricing or if it's just a transitional thing that you're going through right now?","Ronald W. Ristau","Well, Rick, you mean the operating margin in Ultra?","Rick B. Patel - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Gross margin.","Ronald W. Ristau","The operating margin in Ultra was affected in the second quarter by onetime exit costs. So therefore, the loss was about $0.06 in the quarter as we had previously indicated. And as we said, the entire loss in Ultra, about $0.09 in the first half of the year, a lot of that is related to transitional and onetime costs. So as we move forward we don't, of course, next year believe that, $0.09 expense will continue.","Rick B. Patel - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And do you have confidence that the gross margin part of Ultra or at least the impact of that to the total gross margin line is going to improve as you go through the year?","Ronald W. Ristau","I believe it will -- I believe that the gross margin in Ultra will do a little better, yes.","Rick B. Patel - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. And then can you talk to us about how we should be thinking about SG&A for the remainder of the year? I'm curious if you can achieve a leverage in the back half and how we should be thinking about the fourth quarter specifically, given last year's 53rd week and the acquisition of Ultra?","Ronald W. Ristau","Well, we don't give specific guidance on that. I think our SG&A spending, as I indicated, was well controlled. If you look at our SG&A spending, excluding Ultra, we actually leveraged it. And we believe that our excellent control in SG&A will continue as we go through the year. That's probably the best I could say about that. We all experienced some deep -- we'll experience some deleveraging as it relates to Ultra, but we expect that the base business will continue to perform well.","Michael W. Barnes","I would just add to that, pretty much what Ron said, and as he talked about in his remarks earlier and that is, we have had a successful transition of Ultra now. We had a dilution of $0.09 in the first half of the year, it's going to be very minimal in Q3 and then it's going to become accretive. So as we continue to ramp-up these new Kay stores that we've converted, things should look better over time.","Rick B. Patel - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just the last question around made-for-outlet products, just curious what you've learned from Ultra so far and how we should be thinking about that going forward?","Michael W. Barnes","That's a great question, Rick. We've learned a lot. And prior to the acquisition, we were a much smaller player in the outlet market and we were operating the stores primarily as normal Kay stores within the outlet realm. And there's a lot of specialized marketing, not just merchandise but specialized marketing that we've learned from them that we're going to put into place going forward, that we think is going to be a real win for us. But also doing made-for product allows us to kind of engineer the product so that we can gear it for the bargain-hunting consumers that want to shop the outlet malls. And so we're going to have a much more desirable product mix out there for those consumers that like to shop the outlet malls. So we think that with the learnings that we got, both from Ultra and now that we have a really solid team of people moving forward with a pure outlet strategy, that we're just going to see more and more improvement over time. And like I mentioned, this is a channel of distribution that's actually growing in the U.S. They're building new developments. I think they're slated to have another 51 outlet malls opened over the next 3 to 5 years, I'm not sure what the timeline was on that, but I heard that number the other day. And we want to be a part of it. We want to be the leader in the outlet industry. We're going to have 120 outlet stores for Kay by the end of this year compared to only having about 30 last year. So we think it's a big win for us, and we're looking forward to driving that part of the business.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jennifer Davis from Lazard Capital Markets.","Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","First, Ron, could you help us understand third quarter guidance? I guess I was a little bit surprised to see you guide to a decline in earnings. I mean, I think maybe a part of it is the fact that Ultra is a lower margin business still. And then a follow-up to that would be, how long do you think it will take for the outlets to reach the productivity levels of the Kay outlets?","Ronald W. Ristau","Sure. Well, the third quarter is -- Ultra is, of course, a fact in that. And you could see in our statements that we think Ultra will be -- it won't really contribute and it might contribute negatively by a couple of pennies. We do believe it will become accretive in the fourth quarter of the year. And we've always said we can't predict how rapidly the productivity should increase, although we are seeing some good results out of the stores that we have converted to Kay and some light sales increases there. So we're hopeful that next year will be significantly better than this year with results in Ultra. And more importantly, as Mike indicated, that Ultra is only a part of our outlet strategy. We've opened and we'll have, just exclusive of Ultra, 53 total stores that were just Kay to begin with, because we've opened up quite a number of them this year. So by the end of the year, we'll be operating 120 total combined Kay outlet stores and about 39, I believe it was, Ultra Stores. So as it goes forward, the outlet strategy should become a much greater contribution. But it's not just from the Ultra Stores, it's the Ultra Stores as well as these new Kay outlet stores that we are opening up. When we think about the guidance in the third quarter; number one, we've given a, hopefully, a prudent view of what we believe comps will be. We do expect that we will see some impact in our margins as it relates to the issue that we're having in bad debt, which we believe will be primarily offset by other operating income. We have projected, for now, because we'll be doing a lot of test work in the third quarter in our U.K. business. But the U.K. business will continue to lose money in the third quarter, as it always does, but we've been a little a conservative with our U.K. business because our idea is to allow them great latitude for testing on new products and to try some different things to get ready for the all-important fourth quarter to make sure that we're 100% positioned there. So third quarter is our lowest quarter of the year, as you know. And very small movements can cause some changes in the level of operating EPS for the quarter. For the full year, we think we're in very good shape and we just have to get through this third quarter.","Michael W. Barnes","Yes. Jennifer, this is Mike, I would just add on to that, reiterate Ron's point. This is our smallest quarter of the year. Having said that though, as I mentioned, we started off positive in both the U.S. and the U.K. And 3 weeks does not a quarter make, obviously, but we just wanted to give you an update on the trend as we start the quarter, as we usually do, at least the directional trend. But we're trying to be prudent with our guidance. Again, there's a lot of noise out there and gosh only knows what's happening to the geopolitical climate with all that stuff going on. So we think that we're well positioned to outrun the competition, whether we're in good times, bad time or indifferent times. And that's really the key here. We need to outpace the competition in whatever environment is given to us. And that's what we always try to do. And frankly, in tougher times, we -- generally, it's a little bit, in my opinion, it's easier to gain market share in tough times than it is in good times because people start running for the hills. While we still have our strength, our financial flexibility, we're able to invest, and we're continuing to invest in so many great strategic initiatives. And we're going to talk a lot about those at the Investor Day on October 8. So this is a situation where we feel great about the back half of the year, we feel well prepared, we think the team is well prepared, and we're just being prudent. We like to be good forecasters of our business.","Ronald W. Ristau","And there's one other point I'd like to make, Jen, for your excellent question. In the third quarter this year, we have increased our advertising a little bit because of some new exciting programs that we're going to be running in September, October time frame. And we've taken a prudent view on the sales impact on that, but we have included in our guidance the additional advertising spending. So that's also having some impact...","Michael W. Barnes","That we didn't have last year.","Ronald W. Ristau","Yes. It's having some impact on our guidance, and we'll see how it all turns out.","Ronald W. Ristau","And that third quarter TV advertising was not part of our program last year.","Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","All right. Great. And no, I completely understand the fourth quarter is when you generate about 50% of your earnings. So obviously, the fourth quarter is a quarter that matters. So Ron, can you quantify maybe how much you are planning on losing in the U.K. in the third quarter?","Ronald W. Ristau","I -- well, we've never been that specific, although I'd say that the level will be a little greater than that experienced last year.","Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then one more question...","Ronald W. Ristau","Unless the business surprises us and gets a little better. We're planning it conservatively outside.","Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then, finally, with your online merchandise. Do you think you have an opportunity to expand that and begin to carry online exclusive merchandise? And if so, when do you think we should start seeing that?","Michael W. Barnes","Well, I think that what we have the ability to do is have an expanded range online which, I guess, you could call that exclusive because it's not in the stores. We have physical limitations within the stores. And then online, there are no physical limitation. The other thing that we're doing is, and this is a really exciting program, is we're really ramping up our custom jewelry manufacturing. And this goes beyond personalizing a ring. We've had build a ring for a while where you can pick a ring, you can pick the metal, silver, 14 karat gold, et cetera, you can pick diamonds, emerald, rubies, whatever, and you can kind of build the ring. But we've got a custom program in place that we're really putting a lot into where people can actually design custom jewelry themselves. They can walk in with a sketch and our guys have the ability to put it into 3D CAD renderings and design it out and get it custom made and delivered. And what's the delivery time on that Ron, do you remember?","Ronald W. Ristau","Like less than 2 weeks.","Michael W. Barnes","It's like 2 weeks or less delivery. I mean, this is custom-made jewelry to their specification. So it's pretty exciting program and it's in early stages right now, but it's something that we believe has a lot of legs to it for the future. So a lot of the personalization that we can do. But yes, I think that what we can do with our online business is we can have a much broader product offering, and then it's going to drive great performance for us. The U.S. was up 36%, I mean, the growth that we have seen recently online has just been spectacular. And we're looking forward to continue driving that business at full speed.","Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","All right. Great. And congratulations, Mike and Ron, you both -- you guys have done a great job since you started. I mean, with the Ultra acquisition, expansion of outlets and online, and all of the strategic initiatives. So best of luck.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Stein from Northcoast Research.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","A couple of questions. First of all, gold jewelry. With the price of gold coming down, are you beginning to see -- first of all, are you changing your strategy at all with regard to how you either price gold or perhaps bringing in more gold product to your customers now that it's becoming more affordable? It seems to me that gold jewelry sales have began to pickup in the U.S. during the second quarter, and I'm wondering if you're seeing that and what your strategy is in the segment of your business for holiday? Obviously, that's more of the fashion part of the business and therefore, could weigh more heavily in the back half of the year.","Ronald W. Ristau","Okay. That's a very good question. As it relates to gold, a couple of key points. Number one, the gold prices have -- were favorable. They're much more favorable a couple of months ago, but they seem to be right now. But I would remind you that number one, we're on an average costing system. So it will take us a little longer to realize the impact from gold swings in our P&L. It's not as dramatic as somebody on different inventory system, so I'll just make that point. We also see, with gold, some dynamics that are in our P&L that you might not be thinking about. Number one, is it's favorable to us, of course, in our purchase of gold. It's also unfavorable to us as we scrap gold and go through our turn-in programs and so on. So there's some negative signal throughout our P&L, along with the benefits that we get. And we are working through some losses that we had on our hedge positions from earlier in the year, as we have disclosed that. So all those things together are playing into the way we think about this. Be that as it may, there's still a benefit from gold. Has it changed our strategy in pricing, I'll let Mike speak to that a little bit. But in the U.S., our pure good business is not a lion's share of our business, and it's more -- we do have some in the U.K. And in the U.K., we have moved to take price adjustments in the U.K. and we are seeing some response in people repurchasing gold where it had been on declining trends. So that's probably the biggest manifestation that I could speak to. Mike, I don't know if you want to add to that.","Michael W. Barnes","Yes. I would just add to that, Jeff, that -- Ron mentioned the U.K., we have taken price adjustments in the U.K. to bring prices down, quite frankly, because of the move that we've seen in gold price. We tested that and it tested out very well. And we've just, for the fall, kind of put it into motion. So we have high hopes that, that's going to help what has been a difficult gold business for us in the U.K. Because the U.K. does sell a pretty good amount of gold, they we have a little bit more balanced merchandise mix in the U.K. Whereas 75% of our business is some type of diamond jewelry-type jewelry in the U.S. So we think that we're going to get a benefit in the U.K. from the gold. We will see the benefits as it rolls through our inventory but to Ron's point, it's on an average basis. So it takes about a year for changes in prices to really roll through. And to his point, on the scrap side, you get that hit immediately as you're scrapping. So there's a couple of different moving parts in there. Overall, net-net-net, it's going to be a benefit, like Ron said. And we're hoping that the prices remain stable.","Ronald W. Ristau","And I hope we don't wake up tomorrow and see gold back at the $1,700, Jeff.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","One additional question, Ron, and again, this gets back to the third quarter. In your prepared remark, you've kind of indicated that you expect your credit income to be up in the third quarter. Ultra is going to be kind of breakeven. So I'm just trying to isolate how much of your guidance in Q3 is just being cautious and conservative? And how much of it, is, for example, of this bump in marketing, or is credit expected to possibly get worse before it gets better? And if that's the case, maybe you can talk a little bit about some of the execution issues you're having on training and so forth?","Ronald W. Ristau","Sure. Well, first, I don't believe credit will get worse before it gets better, let me be clear about that, it just won't work. What I said about the third quarter was that I expect it to be up. There's 2 components to it, the bad debt, which sits up in our gross margin. And I think that, that will be up 30, 40 basis points versus last year, primarily on the basis on mix -- I'm sorry, on the mix itself, on the base of growth and receivable balance, and with the small little impact from the mix and efficiency, as I've discussed in the second quarter. I believe that, that will be largely offset by increases in other operating income so that the 2 will move in tandem and have de minimis impact on the P&L, Jeff, net, okay. Well, when I think about the guidance for the quarter, number one, we have included in there some additional spending on advertising. We have prudently not really projected a lot of sales on that. We'll see how it turns out. It's really the first time we've done this. So that is impacting our guidance somewhat, so that spending range is impacting the numbers, for sure.","Michael W. Barnes","It's an interesting dynamic, Jeff. As the non-financial guy here in the room, I find it very interesting that as customer shift more to our regular interest-paid program, they get lower payments, but it stretches out the payments longer. Because you have that receivable sitting out there for a longer time period, it generally doesn't operate quite as well as a 12-month interest-free program, but you get the benefit of collecting that interest. And as a Ron mentioned earlier, on a net basis, we actually came out to the positive, I think it was $1.4 million.","Ronald W. Ristau","Yes, that's correct.","Michael W. Barnes","So it's a little bit of a trade off there, but because of the interest collections going up at the other operating income, it actually has been a positive net for us in the second quarter.","Ronald W. Ristau","And for that point, Jeff, that the metric that we evolved and grown, you see us using and we present it, by the way, which is bad debt as a percentage of sales, it will go up because the receivable balance is growing at a faster rate than sales because of the penetration increases. And we've been talking about that for, I think 2 years now, but that is going to go up somewhat. But it's driven by the volume increase, and that's a pretty easy number to calculate.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Sure. And Ron, could you possibly quantify the increase in marketing spend, the incremental marketing spend for Q3?","Ronald W. Ristau","I don't think we could be that specific. I really can't be that specific. It's significant but not a huge number. Problem you have in the third quarter is that small movements in these numbers move the EPS a couple of pennies. So it looks -- because it's a small quarter, you get more -- a little more distortion, which I'm sure you know from working the model yourself.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Armstrong from CL King & Associates.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just to follow-up on some of that. So the bad debt issues, are these training or -- and internal issues, are there any issues with your customer mix and maybe consumer ability to pay?","Ronald W. Ristau","No. I wouldn't say there's any issue with our consumers ability to pay. Our overall credit portfolio statistics continue to remain very strong. And I want to make sure that you understand that point. When we look at the bad debt issue, again, about 75% of it. So in the quarter, we had a $5 million increase in our bad debt, about $3.5 million, $3.6 million of it is directly traceable to increases in the volume with the residual being comprised of several things: Number one, is the impact of this change in the credit programs that people are selecting. Remember this phenomena started like last year and we're seeing now, as it works its way all the way through the cycles, that it's increasing the risk up slightly. I mean, it's a couple of hundred thousand dollar impact in there, maybe as much as $0.5 million. And the residual we're having of some short-term issues because of the 12% growth from the receivable balance that we experienced is that we've had to bring on a lot of new people and train them and get them up to speed, and we're seeing some -- it's a high-volume activity. So as you make small changes in the activity that pass through the collection, we've seen some impact there, which we hope to correct as we go forward in the next quarter or 2. But I don't see that there's anything wrong with our consumers' ability to pay. Consumers are behaving strongly. They are making more than the minimum down payments very strongly. They are using the credit appropriately. Our credit approval rates remain relatively consistent to prior years, so there's no big change in anything that we're doing there. So I don't want to cause any alarm, but I do want to properly describe the situation as mostly volume with some tweaks, if you will, in the collection profile, primarily caused by the change in these programs.","Michael W. Barnes","Yes. All the indicators that we track that speak to the health of the consumer have stayed very strong. And not only are they making more than the minimum down payment, but they're continuing to overpay their monthly payment at a strong rate as well. So the indicators, as far as the health of the consumer, have been good.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, part of this guidance that reflects the higher advertising expense, but it sounds like you're not -- you're assuming no actual sales benefit from it? So I guess, why bother doing these advertisement?","Ronald W. Ristau","Well, people have to test things every now and then. We have to see what happens and you try to do something that is a little different. I didn't say we didn't put any impact, I said we've been conservative of the impact. We'll see how it all turns out. If you never try anything new, then you never get a different result, so sometimes you have to try and test things. And we've tested these programs, and we believe they'll be effective. So let's see what happens.","Michael W. Barnes","Yes. It's a new program that we haven't done before. And it's a test, so we were naturally conservative on the impact. But of course, yes, we expect to see some impact from it.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And just kind of broadly, mall traffic is kind of soft, the panel retailers are reporting softness in sales. Are you guys seeing any impact on that maybe more on the fashion jewelry side compared with the bridal side?","Michael W. Barnes","Well, as we said, we started off on a positive in both the U.S. and the U.K. But with the macro retail environment being what it is, we've all seen the same reports from the companies that you're referring to on the apparel side, we're being prudent about our expectations to some degree. But we started off positive and we feel well prepared for the back half of the year. So that's kind of where we're at. We've given the guidance out there, and we've given a little bit of directional color on how we started off in August, and that's pretty much as far as we can go along those lines.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just final question. It looks like you've increased your store openings by about 5 units this year. Anything to call out there with the -- maybe the thought process behind that?","Michael W. Barnes","Yes. The real estate team is doing a great job. Ron and I have been asking these guys to continue finding these great locations that they've done so well at over the years and to speed it up, because the stores that we're opening have been doing very well and we are stretching into other areas. We began, a number of years ago, opening Kay off-mall stores, in centers, power-type centers, et cetera, they've done very well, just like Jared has. And so we have asked them to continue doing the great job they're doing and find some more successful real estate for us. And they're succeeding at it, thank goodness. So we're very pleased to be opening the number of stores that we are. I think it's fantastic. We're in a little bit of a growth mode here with the acquisition and -- plus the organic stores that we're opening, we're excited about the future. And we think we've got a great long-term strategy to really drive this company higher and higher over time.","Operator","And our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just one longer-term question on credit. As you roll the programs out to your outlet customer, how do you expect that to change your bad debt reserves or metrics?","Ronald W. Ristau","Well, it's a very good question. We don't have a different scoring mechanism for outlet customers as opposed to normal mall customers. So the outlet customers must meet the same credit granting profile, if you will. So we do not expect that it will be significant in any way. What we saw as we rolled it out, as a Mike indicated, just to reiterate, when we purchased the company, the credit penetrations were in the low-20s, given the programs they were offering. We started in late June to roll out our credit offering to the stores, so they really have been at it a little better, not even 2 months yet. And it jumped from the low-20s up to around 40, okay. Because people have to learn how to sell the credit and how -- what the benefits are and so on, but we thought that, that was a very good short-term impact, that was a movement about a 6-week period. We're not experiencing, as of yet, nor do we anticipate to experience, any major changes in the bad debt because the way people select the program is the same, and the programs they select are the same. So therefore, it shouldn't be different. It's not like the credit consumer there is less worthy. We'll see how the approval rates go. We don't know, over time, whether the approval rates will be the same or different, but that should -- as long as you're not changing the criteria, what should change is the approval rate. If it's a lower quality credit, then it should be lower approval rates. But we don't have enough information at this point in time. Does that answer your question?","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It does, yes. And then when you think about the holiday calendar with 6 fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, do you view that as a comp hurdle? And how are you changing your marketing and merchandising to reflect that?","Michael W. Barnes","Well, what that means is that every single week and every single weekend are very important. And so what it means is that we've taken very careful look at our calendar. We've made sure that we feel we have a robust calendar with events, with marketing. We've upped our marketing spending and impressions during time frame. So it just means you have no -- there's no room for error. And you've got to be right on top of it. And we are, I can assure you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Tunick from JPMorgan.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Two questions, I guess, maybe Mike, just on the bigger picture side. What do you think the industry consolidation looks like from here? Do you expect the pace of industry closings to slow? Are you seeing the department stores reenergize and doing something different in the category? And then on the U.K. side, can you maybe talk about the recent management changes you've made and how that affects your thoughts. On maybe getting back to that, I think you said 10% operating margin goal longer term?","Michael W. Barnes","Sure. Thank you. On the consolidation side, it has slowed as we have gotten further and further from the old dark days of the recession 5 years ago or so. And -- but I think it's stabilized and it continues to consolidate, albeit, a little bit slower year-to-year-to-year. We believe that we're primed to continue to take market share from that consolidation. It's interesting, and I'm glad you mentioned the department stores, because one of the things that we focus on here is making sure that our team understands. Know who your customer is and don't be focused on only specialty retail jewelers. Because there are these big guys out there like the department stores of the world and some of the mass merchants that are considerable competition to us in the mid-market jewelry. And we have to realize that, focus on it and continue to drive great product selections that our customers desire to win that game. It was just fairly recently, a couple of years ago, that we overtook Wal-Mart, quite frankly, and became the #1 jewelry retailer in America. Not just the #1 specialty retail jeweler, but the #1 jewelry retailer. So even as the specialty retail jewelry market has consolidated down, we've continued to grow, not only within specialty retail jewelry, but also within jewelry in general, as far as retailing in America. So we feel very good about continuing on that path that we've been on and we think that we're well prepared to do that. As far as the U.K., we have had management changes there. Rob Anderson has decided to leave the company and we have promoted Sebastian Hobbs, who was our Commercial Director for the past 2.5 years, to the Managing Director position in the U.K. Seb is a great leader. He's got a great eye for the commercial business out there in the marketing side of things. So we think that he's going to continue to drive the U.K. to become better and better in their product offerings and their marketing objectives and in really driving the business. We've also had some -- a promotion on the store operations side. We've promoted an 8-year veteran to the position of Director of Store Operations, and she is a fantastic individual. It's working out very well. The transition has gone very well. As I said, we actually started all positive first 3 weeks of August, which was a nice trend change. And I know that's not a long trend, but we'll take what we can get and continue to build upon it. So there's a lot of exciting things happening. We're also continuing to really work in collaboration between the U.K. and the U.S. teams. And this is an exciting thing. They're more collaborative than they have ever been. In the U.S. management team, starting at the top, with Mark Light as the CEO, our Senior Vice Presidents of Merchandising, of Store Operations, they're all very excited to be working in collaboration with the U.K. And the idea is, we want to find best practices wherever they sit. Best practices can come from anywhere and they can be executed everywhere. And so we're having the teams work together to find the best practices, and this is a long-term strategy for us. And we believe it's going to be very successful. We've already started working on a lot of the same product ranges, the U.K. tested the Neil Lane range last year. It did very well, and they're rolling that to a lot more stores for holiday. So there's a lot of exciting things happening in the U.K. Everyone is really pumped up about the direction that we're going. We do still have our eye on that 10% operating income, and we believe that we can get there. And we believe that we've got a team on the ground that can make it happen working in close collaboration with our team here in the U.S.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Mike, that sounds very exciting. Just one quickly for Ron. On the 75 to 85 stores this year, is that the right place for us to be thinking as far as next year as well from a planning and budgeting perspective? Is that the right either square feet or growth rate?","Ronald W. Ristau","I would tell you that -- I would certainly stay -- we'll probably say more about this at our Investor Day. I don't think our range in the future will be significantly different, although we'd really like to give you an update at our Investor Day on that issue as we take a look through our budgets and so on. We're seeing, as Mike indicated, some nice real estate opportunities. Were doing a great job in our real estate community with that. And I don't think it will be materially different, but before I lock an exact range I'd like to defer and wait until then.","Operator","And our last question will come from Oliver Chen from Citigroup.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Regarding the environment that we're seeing now, we are seeing national specialty competitors get a little bit stronger, probably thanks to a lot of execution around similar strategies on better proprietary product and bridal. So what are your thoughts there in terms of your competitive flexibility going forward and what kind of leverage you may have? And also, how was the competitive environment in your view?","Michael W. Barnes","Thanks, Oliver. Yes, you're absolutely right. Our competitors are not standing still. They're all running at us. And of course their goal is to take the business, and we won't let them have it. We intend to continue gaining profitable market share. And a lot of the successful things that we have done over the years, people are going to emulate those. And if it's a successful strategy, it might work for them as well. And there's a lot of competitors out there that are trying to do that. So what we have to do is we've got to continue moving fast. We've got to be innovative, we've got to be fresh, we've got to have new products and we've just got to stay in front of it. And that's the best way to compete in this industry. We've got a team that can do that. This team is nimble, they're very experienced and they're continuing to drive some great ideas in marketing, great ideas in execution in the field, great marketing merchandise. This is what we have to do to stay in front of it. And that's what we are doing. We intend to stay the #1 jeweler in America and in the U.K., and we're going to do everything in our power to keep moving forward. That's our job. Their job is to try to catch us. Our job is to try to keep them in the rearview mirror. So we're working towards that, and I believe that we're going to be successful. We have worked on some big strategies and we have a strategic vision with a lot of great new innovative ideas going forward. We're going to talk a little bit about strategy at our October Investor Day conference on October 8. So I hope that you and everyone else can be there because it's going to be an exciting day. And we'll lay out a little bit more about what we're doing to really win in this environment.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","As a final one, Mike and Ron, could you just share us what's your thoughts on the health of the consumer? From this perch, we're just getting all these mixed messages, I was just curious on your thoughts on how the consumer feels and if they're thinking there's continued volatility in the market place or if you think that they feel encouraged about the ability to spend?","Michael W. Barnes","I think the consumer is fairly healthy, but they run in cycles. And I think that from what I've heard from the macro environment, they've been focused a lot on different categories and it moves around. I saw a positive comment about the gross domestic product this morning coming out in the U.S. So hopefully, the consumer will continue to gain strength over time. Again, we can only talk about how we feel, and we feel well positioned for the back half of the year unless we see some dramatic trend changes or have some big black swan event that hits us. So I think we're well prepared and I think the consumer will be there for us.","Operator","And I will now turn the call over back to Mr. Barnes for closing remarks. Please go ahead.","Michael W. Barnes","Thank you so much. And thanks to all of you for taking part in this call. We really appreciate it. Our next scheduled call is on November 26, when we'll review our third quarter results. But remember, before that, we do have our Investor Day conference in New York City, and that's on October 8. I hope to see you all there. Thanks again, and goodbye.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Cliff, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]","I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. James Grant, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","James M. Grant","Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2014 earnings call. On our call today are Mike Barnes, CEO; and Ron Ristau, CFO. The presentation deck we will be referencing is available under the Investor section of our website, signetjewelers.com.","During today's presentation, we will, in places, discuss Signet's business outlook and make certain forward-looking statements. Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. We urge you to read the risk factors, cautionary language and other disclosures in the annual report on Form 10-K that was filed with the SEC on March 28, 2013. We also draw your attention to Slide #2 in today's presentation, and I'll now turn the call over to Mike.","Michael W. Barnes","Thanks, James, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our third quarter results driven by the excellent execution of our strategy. This team has done a great job on delivering results. Now we remain focused on our important fourth quarter holiday selling season. We are very pleased with the start of the fourth quarter during the first 3 weeks. We continue to feel well prepared, and we're looking forward to a good Holiday Season. Of course, not withstanding any type of negative macro events as the largest part of Holiday is still in front of us. But again, we are very pleased with our start to date.","Turning back for a little color now on the third quarter. Our third quarter comps at Signet increased by 3.2%. U.S. division comps grew by 4.2% compared to a 1.2% increase last year, while U.K. comps declined by 0.9%.","eCommerce sales were up 16.3%, and that's an impressive growth rate considering the U.S. anniversary-ed its website relaunch of last year. This all led to operating income of $51.6 million and earnings per share of $0.42. Excluding Ultra, our diluted earnings per share were $0.45.","Now let's break this down starting with the U.S. division performance. U.S. total sales were $632.1 million, and that was up $56.5 million or 9.8%. U.S. same-store sales increased by 4.2% in the third quarter. Kay comps led the way with a 5.8% increase, while Jared increased by 3%. The success in both concepts was driven by particular strength in bridal, color diamonds and watches. And U.S. eCommerce performed well with sales up $1.7 million to $16.2 million, an increase of 11.7%.","The eCommerce team was not only up against the Kay and Jared website relaunches in prior year but also incremental marketing support to drive those relaunches.","The U.S. division operating profit declined by 7.7% with a 9.5% operating margin. Ron's going to add a little bit more color to this here in a few minutes. Excluding the dilutive effect of the Ultra acquisition, operating income was $64.2 million, and operating margin was a double-digit 10.6%. It was another very solid quarter for the U.S. team members.","Now moving onto a few comments about our outlooks. Our strategy continues to be validated every day. We're pleased with the Ultra integration, and we've executed a variety of initiatives to increase outlet sales productivity. Early on, we put in place the systems, store signage and the field operations training. And we're continuing to see the benefits of the Kay rebranding in the majority of the stores also for progressing on our merchandise assortment and specialized marketing programs, specifically for the outlet programs. And as we move forward with our outlet strategy, we continue to see benefits in our real estate site selection. By the end of this year, we expect to have approximately 160 outlet stores with good long-term potential for more. Also by year end, the portfolio of stores should be a business in excess of $200 million in sales.","Now I'll turn to the U.K. for a little bit of color. Total sales in the third quarter were $139.3 million, down $1.3 million or 0.9%. Comp sales decreased 0.9% compared to an increase of 2.3% in the third quarter of last year. eCommerce sales were $6.6 million, and that was up $1.5 million or a very strong 29.4%. Our U.K. websites attracted 8 million visitors in the quarter, and out of those, 52% were through mobile devices. The operating loss was $4.4 million, and that was an improvement of $1.1 million from last year. As a reminder, the U.K. division typically makes all of its annual profits in the fourth quarter. I would like to thank our U.K. team members for their continuing efforts to improve our business there.","Now to wrap up my remarks. We feel strongly that we are well prepared to win this Holiday Season. It all starts with our well-trained, enthusiastic sales teams, and they are primed and ready to support our merchandise initiatives. We've got many exciting new collections that are well tested and in-store now. Most of these programs were rolled out during the third quarter, and so their first full quarter of impact will be Q4. Examples, you see some of the examples shown here on the slide. In bridal, we introduced larger center stones for Neil Lane, inserts and wraps for Tolkowsky, and the Leo Artisan Diamond at Kay. We expanded our successful color diamonds, and these have been extremely hot. These programs are branded Artistry at Kay and Vivid at Jared. In Le Vian, one of our better fashion brands, we've rolled out proven styles in new colors supported by special events. Our Open Hearts Wave collection by Jane Seymour, which is done very well since its introduction last year, incorporates blue diamonds now into each design, and it's offered at wider price ranges.","We're also driving success across selling channels. We've enhanced our digital ecosystem by enhancing the Kay and the Jared mobile websites; we have created mobile apps now for both Kay and Jared; and in the U.K., we are rolling out tablets to our stores. We have new, exciting and memorable ad campaigns as well, launching in the Holiday Season on television. In fact, you may have seen some of those ads already. And they're also launching within our digital ecosystem.","Finally, we're securing and manufacturing additional, reliable and consistent supply of the diamonds for our customers through our direct diamond sourcing initiative. The new factory in Gaborone, Botswana, is an exciting part of this initiative.","I tell you, with all these great initiatives in place, again, we believe we're well positioned for a great Holiday Season and beyond, and we've had a good start so far. And now, I'll turn the call over to Ron.","Ronald W. Ristau","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by explaining sales in more detail. For the quarter, total sales for Signet increased 7.7% to $771.4 million compared to $716.2 million last year. Same-store sales increased 3.2% compared to 1.4% growth last year.","In the U.S., our total sales increased 9.8% or $56.5 million to $632.1 million, which included a same-store sales increase of 4.2%. Our non-same-store sales were up 5.6%, which includes a 4.8% increase due to Ultra, and a 0.8% increase for the U.S., excluding Ultra. The U.S. sales increases were driven by particular strength in bridal, color diamonds and watches. Both Kay and Jared experienced increases in transaction counts and average transaction value.","In the U.K., total sales decreased 0.9% or $1.3 million to $139.3 million. Comp store sales decreased by 0.9%. Bridal and diamond sales increased in the third quarter. And in our concepts, the number of transactions increased, while the average transaction value declined, with Ernest Jones particularly impacted from Rolex being offered in fewer stores. Watches, however, were strong in Ernest Jones when we exclude the impact of Rolex.","As Mike mentioned, Signet eCommerce sales were $22.8 million, up $3.2 million or 16.3% for the quarter.","Now let's review the components of operating income. Signet gross margin was $239.2 million, an increase of $3.8 million. The gross margin rate was 31%, down 190 basis points. The inclusion of the results for Ultra decreased the consolidated gross margin rate by 60 basis points and the U.S. gross margin rate by 80 basis points.","In the U.S., gross margin dollars increased $6 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2013, reflecting higher sales offset by a gross margin rate decrease of 220 basis points. The lower U.S. gross margin rate was primarily attributed to the following: a gross margin rate decline of 100 basis points, 60 points of which were attributed to Ultra, with the remaining decrease primarily due to the net impact of gold hedge losses associated with the decline in gold prices earlier this year. In addition, lower gold spot prices reduced the recovery value on trade-ins and inventory, causing the 40 -- a further 40 basis points decline in the gross margin. Store occupancy deleveraged by 20 basis points primarily due to the inclusion of Ultra, and a change in the U.S. net bad debt expense reduced gross margin by 20 basis points as the U.S. net bad debt ratio to sales increased to 5.6% compared to 5.4% of sales in the prior year third quarter. The increase in ratio was primarily due to growth in the outstanding receivable balance from increased credit penetration and a change in the credit program mix.","In the U.K., gross margin dollars decreased $2.2 million, primarily reflecting the impact of decreased sales and a gross margin rate decline of 140 basis points. The lower gross margin rate in the U.K. was primarily attributed to a 60 basis point decrease in the gross margin rate due to increased promotional sales, and a 50-basis-point decline due to lower recovery value on inventory scrapped, with the remaining decrease primarily deleveraged of expenses on lower sales.","Signet selling, general and administrative expenses were $233.4 million, an increase of $10.8 million as a percentage of sales improved 90 basis points to 30.2%. I will discuss this in more detail on the next slide.","Our other operating income was $45.8 million or 5.9% of sales as compared to $39.7 million or 5.5% of sales last year. This increase of $6.1 million was primarily due to higher interest earned from higher outstanding receivable balances in the United States. So our consolidated operating income in the third quarter was $51.6 million, representing 6.7% of sales, which was 60 basis points lower than prior year. However, excluding Ultra, our consolidated operating margin was 7.5%, up 20 basis points over the prior year.","By segment, the U.S. division's operating income, including Ultra, was $60.3 million or 9.5% of sales compared to $65.3 million or 11.3% of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. When we exclude Ultra, the U.S. division's operating income was $64.2 million or 10.6% of sales. The operating loss for the U.K. division was $4.4 million, an improvement of $1.1 million, and our fully diluted earnings per share were $0.42. Excluding Ultra, fully diluted earnings per share would have been $0.45.","Now some additional detail on SG&A expenses. As I stated earlier, SG&A expenses were $233.4 million compared to $222.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, up $10.8 million and as a percentage of sales, improving by 90 basis points to 30.2%.","In the U.S., SG&A expenses increased by $9 million, primarily due to higher sales. And as a percentage of sales, they were essentially flat as spending remained well controlled. The inclusion of the results for Ultra increased SG&A by $8.4 million, which was partially offset by expense reductions in the U.K. and corporate, totaling $6.6 million.","Our SG&A remains effectively controlled and well focused. Net inventories ended the quarter at $1,644,900,000, an increase of $136.4 million or 9% from a year ago. The increase is primarily due to a $41.4 million increase in inventory for Ultra, and a $19.5 million increase in diamond inventory associated with our rough-diamond initiative. Excluding these items, our base inventory increased by 5%. Our inventory is well positioned for the Holiday Season, and we expect to end the year with inventory at appropriate levels go-forward.","Now credit. Credit remains an important component of our business. The net accounts receivable increased to $1,123,500,000, up 12.6% for the quarter. In the quarter, the credit penetration, excluding Ultra, was 64.2% compared to 62.7% last year. This is attributed to increases in the bridal and branded product sales and strong consumer acceptance of our credit offerings. We have seen thus far strong response to the Ultra credit offerings rolled out in late June. However, as a group, it is currently less than our historical base, which is why we break out the credit penetration with Ultra, which was 63.3% versus 64.2% without Ultra.","The average monthly collection rate this quarter was 11.7% compared to 12% last year as customers continued to opt for our regular credit terms, which requires slightly lower monthly payments as opposed to the 12 months interest-free program.","Our bad debt expense was $35.1 million in the third quarter, primarily driven by growth in receivable balance from increased credit [ph] penetration and a change in the credit program mix. Our consumers continue to utilize and manage credit effectively. Offsetting the bad debt expense was an increase in other operating income, which was primarily interest income on the higher outstanding receivables and a shift away from interest-free programs. The income on these programs was $45.8 million or 5.9% of sales in the third quarter. The net impact of these 2 items was income of $10.7 million in the third quarter compared to income of $8.4 million in the prior year, an increase of $2.3 million.","In the year-to-date, we see a similar trend of increased bad debt due to growth in the receivables, offset by increased other operating income with a net impact of $46.2 million versus $38.5 million last year. So the net benefit year-to-date is about $7.7 million.","Now reporting -- turning to our fourth quarter guidance. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the company currently expects same-store sales to increase in the low- to mid-single-digit range. In the fourth quarter, gross margin is expected to be at a minimum relatively consistent with prior year, reflecting improvement versus the third quarter. As a result, earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.40 based on an estimated $80.3 million weighted average common shares outstanding. For the full year, the company now expects a tighter range of capital expenditures estimated in the range of $180 million to $185 million, which includes the opening of 75 to 85 new Kay and Jared stores, store remodeling, investments in digital and Information Technology infrastructure, outlet channel development, and the purchase of the factory in Botswana.","Just as a further note, I'd like to point out that in the fourth quarter and beyond, Ultra will not further be broking out as Ultra no longer exists and has been integrated into Kay, and Kay outlets will not be reported as a segment of the business.","Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back to Mike.","Michael W. Barnes","Thanks, Ron. And in conclusion, I'd like to once again thank the Signet team worldwide for their contributions to a successful quarter. And now,, I'd be pleased to take any questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ike Boruchow from Sterne Agee.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I guess, Mike, you talked about being very pleased quarter-to-date even though a lot of the heavy lifting is ahead of you. Can you just talk about some of the trends you're seeing with your off-mall and your mall, Kay and Jared locations, as mall traffic seems like it's been pretty choppy lately? And then also any commentary on Kay with a 6% comp, Jared with a 3%? Any differences you're seeing there from your customers or any reason why Kay should continue to outperform Jared? Just, any high-level thoughts there?","Michael W. Barnes","Yes. Yes, I'll give you a few high level thoughts. Obviously we give our official guidance that Ron just went through, and we just give a little bit of a directional outlook of how the quarter has a started. And like I said, we're very pleased with the way the first 3 weeks have gone. We think that we're well prepared to have a full, very good Holiday Season notwithstanding events that could happen out there. Kay just led the way with a really strong comp number of 5.8%. Powerful, that the business was great. Jared was still very good, and it's still well within the guidance that we gave it at 3%, and it's doing extremely well also. We think that both of the concepts could have a great Holiday Season for us going forward. There's a couple of things, Ike, that really are driving this business. One of them happens to be unbelievably great merchandise offerings. And a lot of this, as I mentioned in prepared remarks, really just got set in the third quarter. And so we feel like we're well prepared to drive those merchandise offerings into the fourth quarter. We mentioned without going into too much detail for obvious competitive reasons, bridal continues to be extremely strong for us. Color diamonds are really hot right now. And our watch business has been good also. And we've got some unbelievable offerings coming in there. Now to support those offerings, this is the first year that we've actually moved our advertising back and started advertising in October. I think that the additional advertising and marketing that we have done, the team has done a fantastic job of driving it. We have a lot of brand-new ads out there. You're probably seeing a lot of them already. Any of you guys out there that are football fans certainly have seen some. And a lot of the most popular network TV shows we're on. So we have very high-quality advertising supporting unbelievable merchandise offerings. I think that's what's driving the business, and I think that there is very good opportunity for us to continue to drive that business strongly for the fourth quarter, and quite frankly, we're looking forward to Holiday.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dorothy Lakner from Topeka Capital Markets.","Dorothy S. Lakner - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just tagging onto that question, I have seen a number of Kay ads. I haven't seen Jared ads. I wonder if there were any differences in the schedule of rolling those ads out as Jared is more skewed towards the fourth quarter versus the third. And then just any comments you might have about the overall environment that you're seeing heading into the Holiday Season?","Michael W. Barnes","Hi Dorothy, this is Mike. Honestly, I think it's just a matter of the timing of when you have been watching because we've got a lot of Jared ads out there as well. Now we do have more impressions for Kay than we do Jared. So there is a better chance that you would see Kay ads. But we do have Jared. We started them at the same time, and we have some new ads for Jared as well as Kay, and so, they're both out there pretty strongly right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on Ultra. You had originally guided the dilution flat to a negative $0.02 and you came in at minus $0.03. Can you just give us some update on how that business is doing versus your expectations, and if you still think that will be accretive in the fourth quarter?","Ronald W. Ristau","Yes. I think the Ultra integration has been going extremely well. All of the operational aspects are that have gone very smoothly. In the last call, what I estimated it would be $0 to a couple of pennies loss and it came in at negative $0.03. The reason for the slightly lower number is that we have seen some slight disruption as we've changed the product mix and the selling methodologies and the discount structure in the -- what was the old Ultra chain into Kay. Some of those stores are struggling a bit with sales. We expect that this will all turn around with additional training exposure to our systems, and we do expect that Ultra will definitely be accretive in the fourth quarter. So what I would say is that probably just a little bit of, I would call it, growing pains in the third quarter. About $0.01 off where we thought we might come out. It would be very strong into the fourth quarter, and our total outlet business, as Mike indicated, has just been terrific. So the conversion -- Ultra in a sense, will no longer exist. It now exists as Kay. Our Kay outlet strategy go-forward is very powerful, very strong. A lot of the learnings that we've learned from the Ultra integration has been applied to our core organic Kay stores, which are doing terrific. And I would say that as we move into next year, it's going to be a very powerful business. We'll put behind us all of the one-time transitional and disruptive costs that we incurred this year, and we should be all systems go as we move into 2015.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then the fourth quarter guidance, you spoke about flat gross margins versus down close to 190 basis points in the third quarter. What are the key factors that will help you get to flat in the fourth quarter?","Michael W. Barnes","Yes. I think that's a good question. Number one, in our fourth quarter, it's often much higher than our third quarter, primarily driven by leverage on sales. But we've also taken a very thoughtful look at our promotional pricing, our fourth quarter product mix, and our expectations importantly, for increasingly favorable commodity costs. Because in the third quarter, part of what we witnessed was that through our average system our commodity costs improved, but they didn't improve in the third quarter because of the low sales volume and slower turn that we experienced. It will get much more dramatic into the fourth quarter given the change in some of the commodities that have moved, and so for all those reasons together, we're very confident that our margins will expand. I say at least flat by the way. I didn't say flat. I said, at least flat.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Tunick from JPMorgan.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Two questions. First, I guess Mike, if you think about the consumer out there, can you talk about sort of where the price points are shaking out at Kay right now? Can you talk about what you're seeing at different price point ranges? And then Ron, I missed it for the fourth quarter, on your comp guidance, did you say what you expected the U.K. business to perform at? And just what kind of changes are you making in the U.K. business from what you've seen through the first 9 months?","Michael W. Barnes","Thanks, Brian. As far as the pricing with the consumer out there, we're continuing to see, really, a very good mix of price and units driving our increases out there. So it's really a pretty good balance. We are seeing continued AUR improvements. I think that that's a very positive note for us. But we're also seeing unit improvements, and we like to see that balance because we want to drive both, quite frankly. I'll let Ron maybe provide a little bit more color if we have more detail on how much that has changed. The one thing I would comment on, I made this comment in the prepared remarks as well on the U.K., is that the fourth quarter is far and away, not only is it the strongest quarter for all of us but especially in the U.K. And that's really where they turn highly profitable. So we are well positioned in the U.K. as well, and we hope to have a strong Holiday Season. It's still been tougher over there. We had a slight negative comp, very slight at 0.9%. But we believe that we are in good position, and we are looking forward to the Holiday Season there as well. Ron, do you have any other color on the AURs or the price?","Ronald W. Ristau","Of what we have experienced in the fourth quarter? No, I don't think I -- because I went through that in the third quarter.","Michael W. Barnes","Yes, third quarter.","Ronald W. Ristau","As I indicated in both -- in both of the U.S. concepts, we experienced increases in both transaction counts and average price into the third quarter, and we would expect it in the fourth quarter that the mix would remain similar, that we would get both increases in transaction and some pricing benefit as we move forward. There's nothing in the fourth quarter that's substantially different than anything we have experienced all year long as I guess what I would say. To your question on the U.K., beyond what Mike has said, we essentially came in relatively flat in the third quarter. We would hope to get -- I would think we'd hope to get slightly positive, but we don't break it out separately as far as guidance for U.S. and U.K., so I couldn't go beyond that.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. If I could just throw in one more about the 53rd week. Can you just make some comments, remind us sort of how much [indiscernible] before earnings in that?","Ronald W. Ristau","Sure, sure. I have that exact impact. It was $0.02 in operating income, so it was $56 million in sales. It was an operating loss of $2.7 million, so that's pretax. And then on an after-tax basis, it had an impact of about a $0.02 loss in the 2013 year.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Wu from Telsey Advisory Group.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","First, in the U.K., obviously it looks like conditions softened a bit through the quarter given that you previously talked about it being positive in the first 3 weeks of August, and you had to become a little bit more promotional, which clearly impacted the gross margin. Can you elaborate more sort of on what you're seeing there, and if you expect promotions to remain high during the holiday season?","Michael W. Barnes","Yes, David. Thank you. In the U.K., again, it was a touch soft with a very slight negative comp, almost flat, 0.9%. We are very cognizant of the competitive landscape over there, and we watch our competitors very closely. And so we did drive promotion a little bit heavier to help drive sales and garner the business in that market, and I believe it's certainly the right thing to do because we need to grow our business. And it is working out okay for us. We improved the losses in the U.K. year-over-year by $1.1 million, which was a very positive. So obviously, a lot of the other initiatives that we have tackled in the U.K. have worked out for us, and we're making a lot of progress. The management team is extremely motivated over there. We had a great sales conference. We are working together more and more with our U.S. teams, and we're working to find more and more best practices and take a lot of successes that we see over here in the U.S. and be able to drive those more in the U.K. We're driving the brands harder in the U.K. We're looking at the merchandise offerings with a much keener eye than we ever have, and we're looking at the marketing activities and how we can continue to drive that business. It's going to take some time, and we knew that. But I feel like that we are making progress, and that we will see a lot more progress in the future there. Again the Holiday quarter is so important in that market, and we feel like we are definitely well positioned. The merchandise is in the stores. We've got much-improved windows in our stores compared to prior years, and we're looking forward to Holiday there. So I think that we have a big opportunity to continue to turn that business around, and we still believe we can drive it up to the double-digit operating income over time.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","And it was encouraging at least to see that you were able to really tightly manage expenses in the U.K. during the quarter. And I was wondering if you could talk about sort of the cost cuts that are happening there, if we should expect a similar level of benefits of SG&A in the fourth quarter?","Ronald W. Ristau","We should expect that we're going to stay tight on the spending, Dave. We've been very careful with the costs there, but we also understand that we can't save our way to prosperity in the U.K. division. It's helpful. We think we did a good job in cost management. But you should see -- you'll see it be very tightly managed without being specific about how much more, but we'll be tightly managing it. But what I'd love to do is actually find ways to find -- spend a little more money in advertising and programs that will be effective there. But that won't be for this year. That'll be for the future.","Michael W. Barnes","I think that's an important point. Let me just add on to that. Ron clicked on an important point. We do want to drive our business through marketing and advertising there. We're also -- because of the strength of our company and our balance sheet, we are continuing to invest in all the important initiatives in the U.K. We continue to remodel stores that we need to. We are expanding as we see fit. We're continuing to build our shop-in-shops, especially in the watch areas. So we're tackling a lot of initiatives over there in a very positive way, and we're looking at the long term and the future of that market. As the market leader, having the largest market share in that market, it's important for us to continue to grow that business and expand our leadership model.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great. And then just lastly, on the Ultra acquisition. Can you perhaps talk about the introduction of the in-house credit program and the differentiated merchandise into the Ultra Stores, and if you've so far, you've seen a noticeable step up in sales performance?","Ronald W. Ristau","Yes, what we're seeing is, as we have converted, we have of course put in our credit programs and changed the product mix. So right now what we've seen is, the credit mix is getting traction there. The credit penetrations are in the mid-40s versus our chain, which was in -- seasonal in the third quarter at or around a little over 60. So it was in the mid-40s, so that was very good and very helpful. And the product mix is a 2-edged sword. We think that the product mix will become much better accepted over time. However, there has been some, as I've indicated, mix issues as we've been working through the older inventory and -- because we didn't just replace all the inventory. We've been doing it on a -- perhaps a more gradual basis. So I believe that the product mix will become more favorable with some short-term disruption, as I've indicated because of the fact that, in some of those stores, we have a higher percentage of older inventory that needs to be worked through, which should correct itself as we move through the fourth quarter. But overall, the total outlet program is just terrific, as I said, with some small glitches of conversion and so on but nothing that is in any way strategic. The strategic view of it is that it's fantastic.","Michael W. Barnes","Yes, David. I'll just add on to that a little bit. Ron mentioned that we were in the 40s in our credit mix. That jumped from the low 30s, when they were...","Ronald W. Ristau","It was 20s.","Michael W. Barnes","I'm sorry, it jumped from the high 20s when they were Ultra Stores, and that happened pretty quickly, as we've rebranded those as Kay, we are also seeing on the merchandise side, Ron mentioned that a little bit. Now that we have got a full outlet strategy, we've got a team behind this, and we are really focused on how to drive the outlook business as a separate channel and how to get the right mixture of closeout products, made-for products, some full-priced products, especially in the brands. We're really excited about the opportunity that we have to drive that business. And as Ron said, we're still working through a lot of the inventories that they had when we took them over. And again, we're so excited about this outlet opportunity. We've been through 3 quarters. Now we've gone through our first year. Now we have annualized Ultra starting with this quarter, and I think the progress that we've made in one short year is just pretty remarkable, and it's going to be a growth driver and a profit driver for us for the future.","Ronald W. Ristau","Absolutely, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rick Patel from Stephens, Inc.","Sal Adamo","This is Sal Adamo filling in for Rick Patel. My question is on, can you update us on which inning you are in for your real estate strategy in the U.K.? Can you give us an update on how many store closures we can expect next year across both of your concepts?","Ronald W. Ristau","I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understood the question.","Michael W. Barnes","Which inning we're in on our rationalization of U.K. real estate?","Ronald W. Ristau","Oh, which inning? I would guess that we're in the top of the fourth somewhere, okay. Because we're closing the stores, and as we've indicated, we have not seen that we would be buying out of any leases or anything of that nature because the economics are not favorable. And so most of these leases will close on lease expiration. We have indicated that there were probably another 75 or so stores to close -- 75 or 100 stores to close in the U.K. ultimately. I don't have the exact numbers for next year yet. Round numbers, I would guess 30 to 40, but I wouldn't hold me to it. And we'll update that as we go through our budgets over the next couple of weeks and months. And to have more to say about that probably by the time we get into the ICR conferences after Christmas. But you can expect to see more closures and -- because it's very important for us to stay focused in the malls in the U.K. where the consumers are gravitating and to reduce the nonproductive real estate of which there is too much. I hope that answers your question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Oliver Chen from Citigroup.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Regarding the environment, could you update us on traffic and volatility and what you're seeing with that in the marketplace with respect to department store competition? And also, how you could evolve your pricing and average unit retail? Also from a longer term perspective, if you could just update us on your developments in terms of purchasing the diamond polishing business and the longer term view for the strategic logic there?","Ronald W. Ristau","Well I'll take the first part of it and then Mike will take the second part on the strategic policy. But relative to traffic, I mean, all I can say is that what we've seen is that traffic in our stores is positive and trends are positive, and we feel we're well positioned for a very good holiday season. That's the best way I could think about it. As it relates to pricing over the long term, our pricing depends upon the quality of the products that we introduce and the targets that we achieve relative to the products. So we've had a record of slowly increasing our average unit retails, and I would guess that, that would somewhat continue.","Michael W. Barnes","I'll add a little bit more on the AURs. It's not just a matter of raising prices. We are also driving -- part of driving higher AURs is the fact that we're providing our customers with more and better choices at higher price points. A lot of the brands that we sell have higher AURs than some of the core nonbranded product. The customer is gravitating more and more toward that branded environment. I think it's going to continue to become more important, not less important. I mean, Oliver, you follow a lot of brands, so you know how important branding is, not only in our business but overall in the marketplace. So I believe that we will continue to see that drive our businesses. Some of the great brands that we have, have higher AURs, the new Neil Lane's in the bridal aspect, the fantastic Le Vian brand that we carry in the fashion realm. So I think that we'll continue to see that for the foreseeable future. How much, I wouldn't try to guess, but I think it's an important part of our business going forward. Let me take the second question that you had regarding the strategic diamond sourcing. What we have done is, we have purchased this polishing -- cutting and polishing factory in Gaborone, Botswana, Africa, and it is very strategic for us, Oliver. We buy a tremendous amount of diamonds. In the U.S., 75% of our products are diamond related. It's very important for us to work for the long term to have a more secure supply of diamonds. There are not -- diamond supply is not growing in the mines, but the demand will continue to grow, and we believe that we need to get closer and closer to our supply chain. Now this is still not material, particularly in the numbers that we are throwing out there, but this is a starting step for us to really drive our supply chain for the foreseeable future, and it's very strategic and very important. Not only is it the factory that we purchased there but also opening an office in Mumbai, India. We're going to have a permanent presence there. We've had people going in to places like Mumbai and Antwerp every 4 to 6 weeks, making buys. We're going to have a permanent presence, so that as opportunities come, from a buying perspective, we've got somebody on the ground ready to make decisions and able to secure that supply for us as they become available. So that's going to be a huge improvement for us as well. We're working the supply chain in every possible area. And thirdly, I would just say from a supply chain standpoint, we have a lot of very important partners out there that we have worked with for a long time. And they're not becoming less important, they're becoming more important, too. We need to work every piece of the supply chain to the benefit of this company and optimize it. So we're working in many different directions and the partnerships that we continue to forge with our longstanding partners are just as important as the rest of it. So all of these things working in concert together is what, I believe, is going to give us a competitive edge for the long term when it comes to getting the supply diamonds that we need. The last thing I would say about the factory is, having control over what we decide to cut and polish is very important because there are certain cuts that sometimes can be a little bit short in supply. For instance, we have a very strong business in princess cut diamonds, and there have been times where it's been tough getting the supply we need. We've always gotten it, but it's been tight at times. And this gives us the opportunity to cut the diamonds, to optimize what our customers are demanding in our stores, and that's a big win for us. So we're very excited about the opportunity going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel from Nomura Securities.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So just another on Ultra, if I can. Can you just contextualize the Q3 Ultra operating loss? How much of that was one-time integration related? And are there any location or structural differences between the converted Ultra Stores and the other Kay outlets that would keep them at different operating metrics at this point?","Ronald W. Ristau","Well, I wouldn't say that there were too many one-times other than the fact that the primary reason for the loss in the third quarter was, it was sales related. Okay? So in other words, it's just overall lower sales as we made the conversion to the new product mix. So it's not like a one-time cost. So it's one-time, but not a one-time cost, if that makes sense. From a structural perspective, the stores are similar. We don't see if there is any major differences in the stores. When we looked at the real estate portfolio, initially, we were very pleased with it. There's always a few stores that we would have said, \"Gee, we wouldn't have done that store.\" But it's not really significant in the overall mix of things. So I wouldn't say there's any structural problems. There is good and bad malls. There is malls that are stronger and malls that are less strong within the outlet world as there are within any world, whether it is A, B and C malls. But other than that, I wouldn't say -- I mean, Mike, do you have any different opinion on this?","Michael W. Barnes","No, I think, when it comes to the outlets that what we have done is done nothing but strengthen us. Certainly to Ron's point, there are certain malls where we have issues that we need to work on, but that's going to happen in anything. But the important thing is, the majority of the acquisition of the Ultra Stores has just been a huge boom to our outlet business, and it has really popped us up into a leadership role within that channel of distribution, which is something that we sorely lacked before we did this. And it sped up the process tremendously, and they're doing terrific. We are always going to have -- in any portfolio, you're going to have the bottom 20% of your stores that you got to deal with and work on. And it's the same with that as it is with any other real estate portfolio.","Ronald W. Ristau","The other thing I think is fair to mention, and I think it is that you should know if you're thinking about this is, there were about a little better than 30 stores that we did not convert to Ultra -- did not convert to Kay outlet, I'm sorry, that we left with the Ultra nameplate. And what we have seen is those stores were in malls where there were 2 stores. So we didn't want to have 2 Kays so that we left it a Kay outlet and an Ultra in about 35 locations. And the retailers [ph] say that those stores are not doing too good because those stores have to now compete against the Kay outlet. So we have seen some lower than we hoped for performance in the stores that stayed Ultra, and we've got some plans to address it going forward. But I think that's probably a fair call-out and also contributed a little bit to what we saw in the third quarter.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And did you -- have you guys spoken to what your plans would be for those 30 stores?","Ronald W. Ristau","Now we were thinking [indiscernible] what they're doing today, not real estate...","Michael W. Barnes","We got the plans to address it, but we wouldn't discuss it on the call.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Stein from Northcoast Research.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Two quick questions, one for Ron. What does the manufacturing facility that you just acquired, the polishing facility, add to the supply chain in terms of dollar inventory?","Ronald W. Ristau","Well, it added, in total -- the total amount of inventory in the third quarter incrementally was about $19 million. The total inventory was about 50 -- Oh, sorry, give the number.","Unknown Executive","$52 million.","Ronald W. Ristau","$52 million of total inventory in loose inventory that we purchased that we wouldn't purchase if we were not in the rough manufacturing business. But we started doing that a year ago, so it's $52 million in total, $19 million in [ph] the incremental impact in the third quarter.","Michael W. Barnes","Yes, it's important to note that we have been buying rough diamonds for some time now. We just purchased the factory recently, but we had already had inventories of rough. So the incremental is not as much. It's only $19 million.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","I see. Okay, good. And as far as -- can you talk a little bit about the sequential trend in your business during the third quarter in the U.S.? And specifically, any regional call-outs? Any effect that you could measure from the government shutdown at all?","Ronald W. Ristau","No, not that I could think of, Jeff, that we could see or find or point to and say it was the government did this or that. I would say that, from our perspective, it didn't seem to have a lot of impact on our business. We have seen, of course, some improvement in the Northeast, which last year did experience the impact from the Superstorm Sandy. But other than that, I don't know that there is any other regional call-outs that are significant enough that we would make them on the call.","Michael W. Barnes","Yes. I mean, there are little differences here and there and there is, obviously, some regions that are a little bit stronger than others. But really, when you look at it in the aggregate, we have pretty consistent results across the portfolio, across the United States. There are no particular regions that are so weak that you would want to call those out or so much stronger than other regions that you call those out as well.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Got it. And sequentially, month-by-month, any notable change within the quarter?","Ronald W. Ristau","Within the third quarter?","Michael W. Barnes","Third quarter.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Yes, within the third quarter. In other words, when you look at...","Ronald W. Ristau","We generally don't get into month-by-month trends. I think that -- I don't think there is anything significant that we would call out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Hughes from UBS.","Andrew Hughes - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","One of the things you've alluded earlier on the gross margin to at least flat in Q4, could you","[Technical Difficulty]","Ronald W. Ristau","Sorry. Andy, there is a backup noise that's coming through. It seems like someone's talking in the background. We just couldn't understand. I'm sorry.","Andrew Hughes - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'll try again. Talking about the price margin in Q4 [indiscernible] you mentioned that you think it's going to be at least flat. Does that include any currency hedges, and then just what's a patented role after all -- of the gold hedges...","Ronald W. Ristau","No, it includes -- that includes the impact of gold hedges, of course, and what we will be seeing in the fourth quarter is we'll be still having this impact from gold hedges being written off. But what will happen is that the average costing system will have greater impact in the fourth quarter than it did in the third and that will be more of an offset or more benefits realized in the core -- let's call it the core buying process. So we'll still be left with the problem of writing off for these gold hedges over a period of time, but the other activity will offset it, and therefore, it should be a net positive, we believe, in the fourth quarter -- I mean, for the first and second quarters next year, by the way.","Andrew Hughes - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So all other things being equal, you'd expect the reported gross margin into Q1, Q2 be -- for the next year?","Ronald W. Ristau","Well, I think -- well, what I'm saying is, I think that the -- right now, provided there is no changes, we should start to see some favorable -- more favorable commodity costs rolling forward. That's correct.","Andrew Hughes - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just secondly, on the impact of Ultra as well I think you mentioned that...","Michael W. Barnes","The impact of Ultra.","Ronald W. Ristau","Well the impact with Ultra as we go forward, since we annualize against Ultra from the fourth quarter of last year, we made the purchase. It no longer will have the distortive impact that it did throughout the first 3 quarters of this year where it was essentially non-comp. So as we move forward into the fourth quarter and all of next year, we probably would not be calling that out any further because it's no longer macro-distortive to the overall margin rate of the company.","Andrew Hughes - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Would you expect -- I mean, that bumps [ph] the store, so, from here you would expect to make a profit in every quarter. Is that....","Michael W. Barnes","Will Ultra be profitable each quarter next year?","Ronald W. Ristau","Will it be profitable every quarter of next year? I don't know if we are profitable every quarter of next year. The outlet business is a bit seasonal. We're trying to make it more like our Kay store so it will become very -- it won't lose a lot of money like it did this year because this year, the first and second quarter were driven by about $0.09 of one-time costs and our total loss was almost $0.09. So it was very similar toward the one-time cost. So it should do better than breakeven. But it's going to be accretive in the fourth quarter, and we'll have more to say about how the total outlet business develops. We will no longer be addressing Ultra. Ultra, again, is only a subcomponent of our total outlet business, and our total outlet business will be profitable each quarter of next year.","Michael W. Barnes","Yes. And as we said -- yes. I mean, really, it is an outlet business, and it's been consolidated now. So going forward, you'll be hearing us talk about our 160-store outlet chain in terms of any directional comments that we give about it, and our outlet business in aggregate is doing fantastic for us. The organic Kay stores that we had opened were doing well before we made the acquisition. They continue to do well. And the ones that we converted to Kay, which is the majority of those Ultra Stores, also are doing very well. The ones that are left as regional stores are a little bit more difficult. But we have plans to address that and we believe some very good plans to address it. So in total, our outlet business is extremely strong; it's a big growth driver for us; and it's a big profit driver for us. And so we have an opportunity to continue to grow real estate in that channel of distribution, grow sales and grow profits.","Ronald W. Ristau","Yes, I think, in the future, we just need to -- we'll be trying to change the dialogue to reflect that and less focus on Ultra, which no longer exists.","Operator","Our final question comes from Bill Armstrong from CL King & Associates.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So on Ultra, I mean, it sounds like other than some of these lingering inventory transition issues, your integration process is pretty much complete. Is that fair to say?","Ronald W. Ristau","I would say that the integration process is a slam dunk. It's been done with excellence and operational excellence, and hats off to our team that worked on it. We are very pleased with every single aspect of that conversion. And now we just have to work out the residual operational details so that they are no longer with us.","Michael W. Barnes","And we look forward to a very good year next year with it.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Barnes.","Michael W. Barnes","Thank you. And thank you, all, for taking part in this call. We really appreciate your interest and your support. Our next scheduled call is on January 9, and there, we will review our Holiday sales results. So with that, I wish you all a very happy Thanksgiving and happy holidays. And we will look forward to speaking to you early next year. Thank you.","Ronald W. Ristau","Thank you, all. Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

Please go ahead, James.","James Grant","Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. On our call today are Signet's CEO Gina Drosos; and CFO, Michele Santana.","The presentation deck we will be referencing is available under the Investors section of our website, signetjewelers.com.","During today's presentation, we will in places make certain forward-looking statements and statements that are not historical facts or subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. We urge you to read the risk factors, cautionary language and other disclosures in our annual report on Form 10-K.","We also draw your attention to Slide number 2 in today\u2019s presentation for additional information about forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures.","And I will now turn the call over to Gina.","Gina Drosos","Thank you, James. Good morning and thank you for joining today's call. It\u2019s great to be here today on my first earnings call as CEO of Signet and announcing encouraging second quarter earnings and a transformative acquisition. ","Before I get into details about today\u2019s announcements, I want to first acknowledge the tremendous career and contributions of my predecessor Mark Light. He retired last month. I\u2019ve been in touch with Mark and spoke to him this week, his health is progressing well and he is very appreciative of all the support and your well wishes.","Now I\u2019d like to share some background, my initial observations, my immediate priorities, and why I am excited about Signet\u2019s future. As many of you know, I have the privilege to serve as an independent director on Signet\u2019s Board for five years including as a member of the Customer Experience subcommittee and the Respect in the Workplace Committee. ","I know it\u2019s first hands that Signet is a great company with a strong foundation and many opportunities to accelerate its strategy and enhance its competitive advantage in a rapidly changing retail environment. As a director, I have worked closely with Signet\u2019s leadership team. I have helped shape the recently refreshed Vision 2020 strategy, which I am pleased to see is beginning to deliver results.","As you might also know, my career successes to this point are built on consumer-inspired strategies and innovation, changing category paradigms and developing an agile entrepreneurial and efficient approach to business operations often less as more and focus has been an important driver of my success with P&G and Assurex Health.","Over the last months, since my appointment, I have been studying various aspects of our business to start identifying Signet\u2019s highest return focus areas. I have also been getting to know, listening to and learning from our talented and hard working team members, both in the field and in our corporate centers. Our team has incredible passion, dedication and expertise for guiding our mission.","We deliver outstanding value to the thousands of customers that choose us to help them celebrate the most memorable moments in their lives. It is a humbling role and one that we never lose sight of. Doing this well, and improving every day is how Signet became the world\u2019s largest diamond jewelry retailer for a consumer-facing company like ours, this is a key factor and how we will grow our business going forward. ","It is also clear that we still have work to do to better understand how our consumers want to shop and interact with us, how their jewelry desires are changing and how we can vow and delight on by meeting their demands more quickly and whenever and wherever they desire. ","The retail jewelry shopping experience hasn\u2019t transformed in decades and we can leverage our interactions and data analytics to leapfrog our consumer insights and with that, deliver breakthrough innovation in products, assortment, experience, engagement and education.","Next I\u2019d like to highlight our focus on OmniChannel strategy. Our encouraging second quarter performance is a good indication that our OmniChannel strategy is starting to deliver and that we should intensify and accelerate our efforts to innovate and transform. Already more than two-thirds of our consumers start their jewelry shopping journey online and bring photos with them to our stores. ","We can build on their desire to browse and learn by creating more interest, engagement and points of connection through a seamlessly integrated OmniChannel experience. For example, new visualization technologies in store can exponentially multiply access to over 100,000 diamonds in every store via connection to our virtual vault and try on technologies.","Customers can pick-up online merchandise in stores to engage our team of jewelry experts or have products delivered to their home to try on and evaluate. We see the acquisition of R2Net, and the implementation of its digital capabilities as an important step toward achieving this goal. This brings me to building a culture of agility and efficiency. ","I spent 25 years growing, acquiring and scaling brands in the most agile division of a very large company and then spent four years leading a dynamic and very fast-growing technology-enabled company. I know first-hand, what\u2019s having an entrepreneur\u2019s mindset and efficiency mentality was focus on fewer more important priorities and leadership at every level can do to transform a company and culture.","Signet has work to do in this area and we will reward our change agents and entrepreneurs throughout our company. By doing this, we can better unlock our outstanding talent to innovate in all areas of our business. We will test more fresh new ideas faster, products, trends and shopping experiences. ","Signet has taken decisive steps to manage operating costs and deliver efficiencies across the supply chain, but we still have significant opportunities to become a more productive organization. We are committed to driving top profitable market share growth, but we also need to be pragmatic in the environment in which we operate, one that is currently defined by heavy promotional spending.","Against this backdrop, it is critical that we deliver on the top-line, while managing our operating expenses tightly to defend our margin. We will examine all aspects of our business to drive productivity gains and cost savings across the organization and we will share more details on our plans in the upcoming months. ","In order to quickly adapt to the changing marketplace, we will keep building our culture of inclusion and embracing a rich diversity of ideas and experiences to further drive success and innovation while bringing in fresh new ideas from both inside and outside the industry. We will be an employer of choice and a leader in training, engagement, development and diversity.","And with that, I will now tell you more about our transformational decision to acquire R2Net and how it will help us accelerate our customer-first OmniChannel strategy. ","Moving to Slide 4, we are thrilled to add JamesAllen.com, a fast-growing online jewelry retailer to our rich brand portfolio. James Allen has grown sales more than 2.5 fold in the last two years and has a very attractive average transaction value and knowhow to sell diamonds online. Projected fiscal 2018 revenue is greater than $200 million. James Allen also has a very strong millennial appeal which is a key growth demographic for us.","In addition, R2Net owns Segoma Imaging Technologies, together, they offer a robust suite of innovative technologies to deliver a next-generation digital shopping experience for jewelry. This transaction will accelerate the execution of our OmniChannel strategy by quickly ramping up our digital innovation capabilities to more seamlessly integrate our digital and physical retail platforms. ","Signet has been partnering with R2Net for the past decade on our Jared business since 2007 including our Jared Design-A-Ring web platform. Our companies work well together and we believe this existing relationship will help ensure a smooth implementation process. ","As part of the acquisition, we were also bringing a very talented group of employees onboard, our winning team. In addition to his role as President as James Allen Jewelers, R2Net Co-Founder and CEO, Oded Edelman will become Chief Digital Innovation Advisor of Signet where he will report directly to me and assume the responsibility for driving the digital innovation strategy across all Signet brands and as a sign of commitment to the long-term vision of Signet and R2Net, Oded and the other R2Net founders will invest a significant portion of their transaction proceeds in Signet shares.","This acquisition marks an important step for Signet, as we built scalable digital capabilities for our OmniChannel transformation.","And now moving to key takeaways of the second quarter on Slide 5, we delivered same-store sales growth of 1.4%, earnings per share of $1.33 and operating profit margin expansion of 100 basis points. Fashion and branded bridal jewelry led the category growth helped by a stronger response to bridal promotions while Kay Jewelers, Peoples, and Piercing Pagoda led banner growth.","Our encouraging results were underpinned by e-commerce platform improvements, and the strong Mothers Day which led to key learnings around effective marketing through simpler and more targeted messaging. While the industry remains highly promotional, we tightly managed our cost base which helps Signet deliver top-line growth, EPS growth and operating margin expansion during the quarter.","Moving to Slide 6, while I am only a few weeks in, I would also like to briefly update you on a number of critical initiatives that the management team has been leading and that I dived into quickly, starting with OmniChannel. We\u2019ve been working hard since the beginning of the year to stabilize the issues we had on our e-commerce sites and to improve the overall customer experience. ","During the quarter, we made a number of enhancements, including improvements to user experience, traffic driving search engine optimization and digital marketing capabilities and enabling greater integration of digital technology in stores. ","This is reflected in our e-commerce sales increase of 18.1%. Just about ten days ago, we delivered a major upgrade to all of the sales division website the new hybrid technology has immediate search and user experience benefits and also enables easier, future improvements. ","This launch was executed successfully and conversion rates are already trending in a strong positive direction. We will continue to focus on enhancing our OmniChannel platforms and look forward to implementing R2Net to give us a leading e-commerce brand and accelerate digital innovation capabilities.","Moving to the strategic decision to outsource our credit portfolio. During the second quarter, we announced the sale of the prime portion of our credit portfolio and the outsourced servicing of our secondary books to derisk our balance sheet and streamline our focus on our core business. I am highly committed to this decision and to ensuring excellent execution and maximizing value for our shareholders.","Since the announcement, we\u2019ve made significant progress on the transition and are on track to complete this first phase in October, well before holiday. We also launched our lease-purchase program in partnership with Progressive Leasing ahead of schedule and we have been training our store teams to leverage this important tool. Our intention continues to be full outsourcing of all of our credit programs.","We are actively engaged with a number of interested parties on Phase two and are examining a range of alternatives. Michele will provide more details on credit in just a minute.","Finally, I am encouraged by the team\u2019s plan for the holiday season. We will continue to shift our marketing dollars toward digital resulting in more targeted efforts with higher ROI and consumer engagement and building on Mother\u2019s Day learnings, we will have simpler promotional messages with greater integration across marketing channels. ","We will be launching new products, important line extensions and particularly in the fashion and gifting categories. In summary, we believe we are well positioned for the upcoming holiday season, which together with the momentum we gave in Q2 gives us confidence in our ability to deliver our financial targets.","And with that, I will turn it over to Michele to discuss our second quarter results and fiscal 2018 guidance in detail. ","Michele Santana ","Thank you Gina. All right, so turning to Slide 7, for the second quarter, Signet\u2019s total sales were $1.4 billion, up 1.9% year-over-year or 2.8% on a constant currency basis. Comp sales increased 1.4% compared to a decline of 2.3% in the prior year second quarter and compares to a two year comp hurdle rate of 1.9%. ","Other comp sales increased about 380 basis points of favorability was attributed to the performance and later timing of Mother\u2019s Day which shifted to the second quarter. Key events that contributed to this encouraging comp performance were solid Mother\u2019s Day results and a successful July bridal event. ","Overall, total comp sales increases were driven primarily by higher average transaction value across all store banners. We also experienced increases in the number of transactions in Kay, Zales and Peoples while the UK saw double-digit percentage decrease in transactions.","By category, fashion jewelry led the sales performance closely followed by bridal while watches declined with the exception of our Prestige Watches in the UK that had strong sales performance. From a channel perspective, e-commerce led the growth with an 18.1% increase over prior year while those malls and off-mall stores delivered sales growth.","Through the first half of the year, we have learned that agility in our approach to balancing sales and profits is particularly significant in today\u2019s consumer environment. Signet is committed to strengthening its consumer relevance and market share while continue to balance incremental promotions to drive top-line, with expense reductions to offset margin rate declines.","Our wins in the second quarter relating to our promotional messaging that consumers responded very strong to combine with wins related to our ongoing e-commerce initiatives support our full year guidance outlook. ","So now we will move to the income statement. On Slide 8, our gross margin was $457.9 million or 32.7% of sales. This represented a 120 basis point decline over the last year period and principally due to a strategic increase in promotional activity resulting in a lower merchandize margin rate. However, gross margin dollars increased slightly due to the higher sales volume.","In addition, leverage on store occupancy cost of 30 basis points was offset by lower recovery rates associated with Signet\u2019s Jewelry Trading program. SG&A expense was $409 million or 29.2% of sales. ","Total SG&A declined by $6.7 million or 1.6% over prior year and leveraged a 110 basis points.","Included in SG&A were costs related to the CEO separation and R2Net acquisition of $4.7 million, which unfavorably impacted the leverage ratio of SG&A rate by 30 basis points. ","During the quarter, we remained very disciplined and focused on cost reductions to offset the promotional impact on our gross margin rate noted above. Cost reductions were primarily realized in payroll and payroll-related benefits in both stores and corporate as well as other select corporate expenses. ","In the second quarter, Signet recognized a $14.8 million net gain related to the pending sale of a prime portion of receivables to ADS which is expected to close in October. The $14.8 million includes a non-cash gain of $20.7 million related to the reversal of the allowance associated with these receivables partially offset by $5.9 million of credit transaction cost related to legal, advisor and other expenses.","I\u2019ll further discuss the impact of the credit transaction on Signet\u2019s financials in a few moments. Other operating income was $71.9 million. The $1.2 million increase was due to the Sterling division\u2019s higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. ","However, the rate of increase was tempered by a greater mix of reduced rate plans. All of this led to operating margin expansion of 100 basis points. 70 basis points of which was attributable to the net credit transaction impact just described, as well as CEO separation and acquisition costs.","Diluted earnings per share was $1.33, compared to $1.06 in the same quarter last year. As a result of the imminent credit transaction proceeds, we purchased 8.1 million shares or nearly 12% of Signet shares in the second quarter at an average price of $56.91. ","This accelerated buyback was most motivated by the share price and the ability to fund the buyback using our revolving credit facility combined with our confidence in the transaction closing in October. This acceleration of share repurchases drove $0.07 of earnings per share in the quarter.","In addition, $0.08 of earnings per share in the quarter were driven by the combination of the net non-cash gain associated with the credit transaction and related cost, partially offset by cost related to the CEO separation and R2Net acquisition. The Mother\u2019s Day shift into Q2 also favorably benefited EPS by $0.15. At the end of the quarter, there was $650.6 million remaining under Signet\u2019s share repurchase authorization following an incremental authorization of $600 million during the second quarter.","So turning to working capital and free cash flow, a few comments. Net inventory ended the period at $2.3 billion, down 5.6% year-over-year. This was primarily driven by our continued focus on working capital across the business. In particular, we continued to manage Zale stores with less inventory per store to improve prominence and presentation of key collections.","Generally, we are delivering less breadth and more depth in key categories which is driving overall inventory productivity. Effective working capital management led to a solid free cash flow generation through the first half of the year. Free cash flow for the year-to-date period was $304 million, up $96 million compared to the same period last year. ","Changes to accounts receivable also favorably affected free cash flow. Before we turn to our receivable metrics, a couple other quick highlights. We ended the quarter with $303 million of borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility. As previously discussed, we funded the acceleration of share repurchases through our revolver. The weighted average cost of borrowing on the revolver was 2.4% through the first half of the year. ","So with that, we will move to our credit portfolio on Slide 10. So I will walk through our second quarter metrics, and then spend some time discussing the impact of Phase one credit outsourcing for Q2 and beyond. As you know, we are still managing our full credit portfolio until the closing of the transaction which are expected in October at which time, our prime receivables will be sold to ADS.","Therefore, in the first table on the slide, you will see the key metrics for the full portfolio including prime and non-prime receivables. In the second table, we provide a view of our credit portfolio split between prime receivables held for sale and the residual or non-prime receivables. ","So starting with the first table, our second quarter in-house credit sales in the Sterling division were $536 million, an increase of 1.3% over the prior year. In-house credit participation was 61.7%, down a 140 basis points due to lower application volume of approximately 11%. The average monthly payment collection rate for the second quarter was 10.3%, compared to 10.8% last year.","This decline was principally due to increased usage of extended payment credit plans resulting in lower required scheduled payments would expressed as rates. The collection rate decline, combined with slightly higher credit sales resulted in an increase in our gross accounts receivable of $47 million or 2.7% over the prior year.","Interest income from finance charges which makes-up virtually all of our other operating income on our income statement was flat at $70 million to last year. Net bad debt expense was approximately $58 million or $3 million higher than last year and were taken together with finance income generated an operating profit of $12 million. This net combination was down $3 million to last year. ","So this net reduction when compared to prior year is primarily related to lower finance charges associated with the aforementioned increase and reduced rate extended term payment plans which are targeted to higher FIFO profile customers as compared to our average plan.","At the end of the second quarter, reduced rate extended payment term plans represented about 22% of the portfolio, compared to 9% in the prior year. So moving to the bottom portion of the slide, at the end of the second quarter, $1.56 million of receivables representing the portion of the in-house finance portfolio that will be sold to ADS were reclassified as held-for-sale.","Related to this classification, the allowance for bad debt associated with this portfolio was reversed in the second quarter resulting in a non-cash gain of $21 million. The residual gross receivables totaled approximately $736 million at the end of the second quarter. The related allowance in Q2 for this residual part of the portfolio was $140 million or 15% of gross receivables.","For comparison purposes, had the portfolio been bifurcated in the same manner in the prior year, the residual receivables would have totaled $744 million with an allowance of $110 million or 15% of gross receivables in the second quarter last year. ","So turning our attention to Slide 11. I\u2019d like to outline the key financial impacts and considerations beyond Q2 from the Phase one of our outsourcing. As a reminder, Phase one includes the sale of our prime portion of accounts receivable to ADS at par value and the conversion to Genesis Financial as our servicing provider for the remainder of the receivables.","Starting with the one-time cost and gains associated with the transaction in the left-hand box, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve recognized a pretax, non-cash gain of $21 million during the second quarter due to the reclassification of our prime receivables as assets held-for-sale. We also incurred $5.9 million in transaction cost during the quarter. ","For the full year, we expect total transaction cost to be approximately $35 million. So moving to Q3 upon the close of the transaction, one, we expect to receive estimated proceeds of $1 billion, of which $600 million will be used to repay our ADS facility. As we said during the initial announcement of our credit outsourcing, we earmarked the remainder of the proceeds or $400 million for share repurchases. ","Based on the compelling share price and availability on our revolver, we accelerated this intent and repurchased the $400 million of shares in the second quarter. As such, the residual $400 million of transaction proceeds will be utilized to repay the short-term loans associated with the financing of the R2Net acquisition with further residual proceeds used to repay the revolver borrowings.","In addition, in the Q3 period, we will also recognize what is called the beneficial interest gain, initially a non-cash P&L gain that we estimate will be $10 million pretax. The beneficial interest effectively represents a receivable for the present value of expected future profit sharing payments related to the receivables sold to ADS. This asset will then be reduced in the future via payments received from ADS. ","So post closing of the transaction that we expect to occur in October, other ongoing considerations that will impact our operating profit will include the following, of which I\u2019ll also provide the financial impact to Q4. We expect approximately a $22 million decline in our EBIT in the fourth quarter. Now this decline will be driven by the combination of the following, the elimination of the net contribution associated with the prime portfolio, which is finance charge, plus our late fees, less our bad debt expense.","The net combination of these is expected to unfavorably impact EBIT by $28 million. Now this will be partially offset by recurring SG&A savings associated with the elimination on our in-house credit operations, net of servicing cost associated with Genesis Financial, plus the ADS net economic profit sharing. The net SG&A savings is estimated to be favorable to EBIT by $6 million.","The estimated $0.50 accretion in EPS related to the $400 million of share repurchases executed in the second quarter will more than offset the decline in earnings associated with the impacts that I just outlined. In addition, interest expense savings of $4 million related to the ADS facility will favorably benefit net income.","Finally, as I mentioned on the previous slides, post to sales, our allowance metrics will move unfavorably given the sale of our high quality receivables. Our allowance will become smaller in dollars, but our allowance as a percentage of a smaller receivable base will look less favorable when compared to the rates associated with our historical total receivable. I wanted to be sure to explain this dynamic in advance.","Finally, as mentioned in the transaction, that is expected to close as mid-October, ahead of the holiday season and is also expected to have no material impact on our net sales. Signet will continue to fund the sales associated with the non-prime receivables until Phase Two is complete. We have updated our financial annual guidance to include all aspects of these impacts, which brings me to my final slide. ","We are reiterating our fiscal 2018, same-store sales guidance and earnings per share as well as updating components to our annual EPS guidance to reflect the impact of the strategic outsourcing of credit, CEO separation cost and the anticipated transaction cost associated with the R2Net acquisition announced today. Lessons learned in Q2 have caused us to pivot from our previously communicated use in how we achieve our bottom-line. ","As Gina and I have both suggested earlier in the call, we\u2019ve recognized the need to be agile in the current environment with promotional messaging while still being accountable to drive earnings. As a result, we expect to be incrementally more promotional in the back half of the year which will likely result in a slight deleverage of our gross margin rate.","Now with that said, we have identified incremental cost reductions in SG&A that will enable us to leverage SG&A to offset the gross margin rate impacts. So back to the slide, starting with our guidance of $7 to $7.40 and walking down, you will see the net impact estimated from outsourcing of credit is dilutive to EPS by approximately $0.16. ","Again, this includes the effect from a partial elimination of bad debt expense, late fees and finance income, SG&A savings, servicing costs, net profit sharing and interest expense savings. Net transaction costs are estimated to be dilutive to EPS by approximately $0.05 associated with the credit transaction. This includes estimated transaction cost associated with legal, advisors, and implementation expenses, partially offset by the second quarter non-cash gain recognized and the estimated beneficial interest gain to be recognized in Q3. ","CEO separation costs are diluted to EPS by $0.03. Transaction cost associated with the R2Net acquisition are estimated to be dilutive to EPS by approximately $0.10. These costs include legal, advisor, accounting and financing. Our guidance does not include any impact related to R2Net operations post closing. We will update guidance for sales and EPS related to this announcement upon closing of the acquisition.","And finally, our guidance reflects the favorability to earnings per share of $0.50 related to the accelerated share repurchases completed in the second quarter. Our effective tax rate will be closer to the lower end of our previous guidance range at 24%. Our weighted average share count will drop materially by the year end due to the Q2 share repurchases of 8.1 million shares. ","CapEx and square footage guidance remains virtually unchanged. Lastly, as you consider how to model the third and fourth quarters, I wanted to offer these directional comments about same-store sales and EPS. ","Our same-store sales in Q4 will show notable sequential improvement over Q3 driven by one, Q3 is our smallest quarter and there is no key gift giving holiday within. Two, Q4 will have easier comp anniversaries and will benefit from the deployment of several initiatives during the holiday season that we have already seen early successes in the second quarter.","And as you know, Q4 will be a much larger contribution to full year earnings per share versus Q3 as it represents about 40% of our annual operating income. ","That concludes my prepared remarks and with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Gina. ","Gina Drosos","Thanks, Michele. Before we take your questions, I\u2019d like to reiterate a few points. First, I am honored to lead Signet at this exciting moment in our winning history, a time when we will leverage our strengths in new ways, develop new muscles and build our capabilities and culture at an accelerated and energizing pace.","We have many great assets to enable our future success. We have a hard working, talented and passionate team. We have the discipline and operational expertise that sets the gold standard in the industry. We have recognizable and trusted brands that are part of consumers\u2019 most meaningful life moments. But let me be crystal clear. We also have a number of challenges that we need to decisively address.","We operate in a retail environment that is more dynamic and demanding than it has ever been, leading requires us to act faster, smarter and more efficiently. I will not lose sight of this. We will focus on clear strategic priorities that will help us gain momentum and lead growth once again.","I will strive to build a stronger, more agile and more innovative Signet every day. By leveraging our strengths and keeping a laser-focus on what\u2019s needed to deliver growth and profitability, I have great confidence that we will achieve sustained success and create strong value for our consumers, employees and shareholders.","And with that, we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with Nomura\/Instinet. Your line is now open.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks, good morning guys and welcome, Gina. Gina, you are being informed but new perspective to the leadership seat, any updates on your view on store counts and thoughts on the preferred store fleet size and maybe e-comp penetration, especially just given that you just bought an e-tailer. So, if you could dis-aggregate color between the main nameplate concepts and then the regionals, that would be great. Thanks. ","Gina Drosos","Sure, thanks very much for your question and for the warm welcome. We\u2019ve been aggressively managing our real estate portfolio. Year-to-date, we closed 98 stores and opened 53 for a net down of 45. This is focused on regionals and underperforming mall stores. We have a highly analytical point of view on this and are looking at ROIC every quarter on these stores. ","But we do view our retail footprint as a competitive advantage and believe that we can do a much better job connecting our in-store and our online experiences. And that\u2019s important, because while jewelry customers begin their shopping journey online, nine out of ten jewelry shoppers want a store experience before they buy. ","So going forward, we will continue to take advantage of lease optionality to exit unprofitable stores, strategically open fewer new stores with strong potential sales and ROIC and much better connection between the online and bricks and mortar parts of our business. R2Net I think will play a strong role in helping us to build digital innovation capabilities to do this.","Simeon Siegel","All right, great. Thanks, and then, Michele, if I can, I think you mentioned, you spoke about the interest expense. Anyway to think about the interest income for the back half and I know you had said it wouldn\u2019t be material to the statements, but just to clarify as guidance and the balance sheet now reflect contractual accounting for the non-prime book. Thanks.","Michele Santana","Yes, sure Simeon. So couple things that turns us, yes, I did mentioned interest expense savings, but also in my prepared remarks, I talked about the interest income at least associated I don\u2019t know if you are talking about the finance charge income or if you are talking about some other type of interest income. But if you go back through the prepared remarks, that\u2019s included all factored into the guidance. In terms of your question on a contractual basis, let me give some additional color there. ","We expect that when we do convert, when we close the transaction in October, that we will convert to contractual as we move to Genesis. However, for Q3 reporting, our delinquency will be done at the final time on recency basis and the reason for that, Simeon, is due to the cycle billing times and the conversion day that\u2019s happening later in October. ","Beginning with our last seven billing cycles, which we have a total of 25 cycles in October, all accounts going forward will be aged and managed purely on a contractual basis. So you will see when we report Q4, that we will be moved to contractual. So, hopefully that helps. ","Simeon Siegel","Perfect, thanks a lot guys. Best of luck for the rest of the year.","Michele Santana","Thanks, Simeon.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Oliver Chen","Hi, thank you. Your comments are really helpful. We are curious about your comments around the promotional environment and what\u2019s happening with the industry at large and your thoughts on mom and pops and it sounds like you are very agile and thinking about this. But, will the comparison ease in the context on how the environment is evolving relative to your strategies? ","And then on the R2Net deal, could you just help us understand which features are you most excited about to help accelerate your own OmniChannel capabilities, I would be curious about that and generally speaking, how the timing would work and what we should think about and one of the topics you brought up a lot was speed. It could be in relation to that or supply chain, curious about that as well. Thank you.","Gina Drosos","Great, thanks, Oliver. Let me start and then Michele, you can jump in with more details. So first on the promotional activity. So we\u2019ve discussed our strategy to appropriately balance sales and margin and you\u2019ve heard in our Q2 discussion that we are willing in this environment to build profitable market share with higher levels of promotional spending offset by cost savings.","Michele Santana","Yes. Oliver, if I could just add a couple points to that and then we will circle back to your R2Net question. As we said on the call, we are planning to be incrementally more promotional and with that we expect that we will slightly deleverage our gross margin rate and as you know that is a change from how we previously communicated our position before. ","But given the promotional environment and the competition we see in the marketplace and the fact that, we are going to go after market share, we absolutely believe that\u2019s the right thing to do. But equally important, is ensuring that we remain agile and flexible and being able to go after cost reduction to support a lower gross margin rate and ultimately drive the bottom-line. ","And then on your question regarding R2Net, I am really very excited about the technology they bring and the way I think about it is, a pool of existing technology and a really robust R&D pipeline of future technology. So if I talk a little bit about the existing technology there are four critical pieces that I call out, one is diamond imaging cameras, so they\u2019ve developed an in-house capability to create real diamond images in 360 degree HD with a 40 times super zoom on any device. ","So it looks great in a mobile app as well as online, it can look great in our stores, and they are continually updating and improving these cameras. So I think that\u2019s something that we would look to reapply in the reasonably near term. The second is a 3D imaging technology and this is a rendering system which provides interactive videos of any diamond within the ring. ","So, when a shopper is online looking, they can look at the over hundred thousand different diamonds that are online and place that actually virtually into any setting to get a very clear idea of what that ring will look like. It\u2019s unlike anything else that\u2019s available on the internet today. And that links up in my opinion with a ring try on app. ","So that, and you can download those in the app store, I am not sure, you\u2019ve been online that this is really terrific technology and you can put an image of a selected ring to visualize how it would actually look on your hand, not someone else\u2019s hand, a model\u2019s hand, but literally how any ring would look on your hand. ","And then the fourth one I\u2019ll call out which is something that we\u2019ve been talking about already at Signet that I think R2Net can help accelerate our capabilities, is customer service and 24\/7 chat. ","They have great capability 24\/7 that allows customer service team members to be more like jewelry consultants and in real time, they can work with the customer online, point out flaws in a diamond that might be being considered, show comparisons of other diamonds, really terrific technology. So what we\u2019ll do is, first we need to close the deal. ","Obviously, we are thinking that will happen sometime late September and then as we begin to implement technology, we will certainly do that with an eye toward which of these we think could bring the biggest benefit to some of our existing Signet brands without disrupting anything to do with our e-commerce capabilities for holiday.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. And Virginia, just one last question. When you think about the individual banners between Jarred and Zale, there is different aspects from the consumer selling experience versus product execution. Could you just dive a little bit deeper and that where you see those opportunities specific to the banners, because it feels like they are slightly different. ","Gina Drosos","You are exactly right. They are slightly different, Zale, for example has a somewhat different customer than Kay and different from Jarred and I think we have a great opportunity to improve and differentiate our assortment. For example, in Zale, we want to look at higher price point fashion offerings than we\u2019ve had traditionally in the past. ","For Jarred, we are looking at more branded merchandize and ways to really help Jarred elevate its point of view. We see the key competitor if you will for Jarred as regional independents and so how that we positioned Jarred to be able to reach to a higher income and discerning consumer and in Kay, the same, we\u2019ve done very well with bridal brands and so we are looking at how we extend off of those brand names into more bridal offerings but also into fashion. ","So, understanding the consumer and who is shopping, at each of our banners is an important first step that we\u2019ve been working on and from that we\u2019ll be differentiating our assortment a bit more than we have in the past.","Oliver Chen","Thanks. Congrats on the deal. Best regards.","Gina Drosos","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Ike Boruchow","Hi, good morning everyone. Congrats on the nice improvement you are seeing in the business. I guess, Michele, you mentioned gross margin will be down a little bit in 2H and \u2013 correct me if I heard this wrong, but you are planning to offset that with some cost initiatives that you\u2019ve identified. ","Can you maybe talk of the specifics there? Are these initiatives brand new to the business meaning will those cost savings wrap around to the first half of next fiscal year?","Michele Santana","Sure, Ike. So yes, the plan that we have is that given the environment as we talked about, and importantly some of the lessons that we learned from Mother\u2019s Day on how we drove our promotional messaging which was much more streamlined, we will look to offset that through further cost savings on SG&A. So, some of these cost savings are continuing benefits of what we\u2019ve done in the first half of the year. ","So if you look in the first half of the year, SG&A kind of excluding the CEO separation and the acquisition cost associated with R2Net are down about $20 million. Some of those benefits will continue to the back half of the year such as our corporate payroll, store payroll savings. We are also pushing in deeper into certain areas where we see further opportunities in select corporate expenses. ","In addition, we are also making smart reductions in advertising. Part of that is shifting advertising to higher ROI media. For instance, shifting away from some of the traditional media into the social media which is also very efficient in terms of dollars and it\u2019s also supported by research we\u2019ve done and which we know that people need fewer visits to stores. ","So our marketing is going to reflect that. For instance, years ago, the bridal journey required seven store visits on average, but today it\u2019s down to about four as a result of digital. So we are kind of leading into that. So even though we are going to be diving deeper and reducing SG&A, we also at the same time are preserving or improving the customer experience through smarter allocation of our resources. ","Ike Boruchow","Got it and it\u2019s very, very helpful. And then, just a follow-up on, on Phase two, maybe Michele, could you talk about your thoughts on potential timing as well as any other types of options or alternatives that you may be considering internally?","Michele Santana","Yes, so let me give you a little bit more color on Phase Two. I guess, broadly some of the timing around that, very much what we previously said at the time we had announced our phased approach remains in play in terms of our objectives. ","We are actively engaged, as Gina had mentioned on the call in discussions with multiple interested parties, very committed to fully outsourcing the credit portfolio in a timely manner, but keep in mind we are also very focused on ensuring that we close the Phase One transaction in October before the holiday season. ","So we are kind of running a parallel path. What I would say and what we stated previously is that we expect Phase Two to be completed at some point in FY 2019, but we are going to continue to push forward on that path.","Ike Boruchow","Got it. Thanks so much.","Michele Santana","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Your line is now open.","Paul Lejuez ","Okay, thanks guys. Hey, have you thought about whether or not you are going to cross market, James Allen with your existing brands? That\u2019s the first question and then just, I think is bigger picture, you\u2019d focus more on OmniChannel, any early thoughts on the required CapEx investments as you think about next year and also if you could maybe touch on what we should be thinking about in terms of EBIT margin as you move more of your business online as online continues to outperform stores? Thanks.","Michele Santana","Sure, so just starting with your question on James Allen, our initial view is to run that as a largely independent division and keep JamesAllen.com as the very strong fast-growing e-commerce brands that it is now and then look to reapply technologies to Kay.com, Zale.com, Jarred.com and also in stores. ","We will also over time look at whether a showroom type concept would make sense on James Allen to create some in-store excitement around that brand as well. But I think we need to really get into more of an implementation phase before we get concrete ideas on that, but that\u2019s at least the early thinking on that piece. ","Yes, and maybe, Paul, just in terms of your question, I believe one was on CapEx related to the acquisition elevated levels going forward, we have to say, I wouldn\u2019t anticipate any material elevation in our capital expenditures. I think, how we\u2019ll look at is, the result $4 for capital expenditures and we will allocate that based on priority and ROI. ","And then in terms of EBIT margin as we shifting OmniChannel, e-commerce for stores, our e-commerce margin is pretty healthy. Keep in mind, we don\u2019t have the store, the related store expense. So although we do have shipping cost associated with the e-commerce, we are not having that store occupancy expense. So it really isn\u2019t a drag on our margin for us. ","Paul Lejuez ","Thanks. Anything \u2013 can you add anything on your store closings? What sort of recapture rate you see on the sales as you are closing stores?","Gina Drosos","Yes, so I\u2019ll take that one. We typically see around 30% recapture rate that has a lot of upside in it. So it\u2019s not a bad number now, but we think, especially with some of our new client telling system that we\u2019ve rolled out to the field, we have an opportunity to increase that to up over 50% and so that\u2019s a real focus area for us.","Paul Lejuez ","Thanks.","Gina Drosos","I think I have one more point on what Michele was saying about EBIT, James Allen has a significantly higher average transaction value than any of our other websites and that gives us a great learning math for how we can increase the purchase online for the rest of our websites and that in and of itself would be an improvement and EBIT for us.","Paul Lejuez ","Thanks. Good luck guys.","Gina Drosos","Thanks.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with RBC. Your line is now open.","Brian Tunick","Thanks and good morning. Gina, I was curious, I guess, first maybe your view on the softness in the jewelry category overall, what are you seeing there, maybe, any differently, obviously, making a big acquisition on the millennial front today. ","But just curious what you think is going on in the last year and a half in the jewelry category and maybe what could help necessitate it and then maybe, Michele, on capital allocation, can you maybe update us on your views on where the balance sheet and leverage ratios will come in at the end of the year, given this accelerated buyback, the credit sale, today\u2019s deal and maybe how you are prioritizing capital allocation, maybe as we go into next year? Thanks very much.","Gina Drosos","Sure. So, I think that the jewelry sector headwinds are really a combination of overall retail headwinds and the very rapid change in how consumers are choosing to shop. And then secondly, a more sector-specific issue around the lack of excitement and innovation. And those are two things where Signet is well positioned to strengthen our capabilities and to lead. ","I will say that after four years of declining growth, we have recently started to see a reacceleration of the jewelry industry, low single-digit growth year-on-year in the last year and we\u2019ve done a lot of consumer research and we know that consumers of all ages including millenials tell us that jewelry is among the top three gifts that they like to receive and that diamond rings will continue to be how they choose to commemorate their engagements. ","So, I think there is significant resiliency in the jewelry industry across generations and as we can bring more exciting innovation, more visualization, more ability to be able to shop online for a purchase that traditionally people have thought you have to touch and feel and see in store when we can magnify that diamond forty times, turn it around 360 degrees and give people a great view of that online combined with 24\/7 chat with diamond experts, I think will be able to lead a change in jewelry industry growth rates. ","Michele Santana","And Brian, in terms of your question on capital allocation priorities, a few thoughts there. The business has very strong cash flow generating capabilities and so we absolutely remain committed to one, preserving our financial strength and our flexibility to support growth and also maximize our shareholder return. ","This also though includes strategic investments like the acquisition that we just announced today of James Allen and balancing that through returning capital to our stockholders through dividend and\/or share repurchases, so I\u2019d say there is really no change in terms of those priorities that we have previously communicated. ","When you think about the end of the year leverage ratio, what I\u2019d probably point you to is, we\u2019ll probably be maybe low and three times basically be under that. ","Brian Tunick","Great, thanks and good luck guys.","Michele Santana","Thank you. ","Gina Drosos","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Patel with Needham and Company. Your line is now open.","Rick Patel ","Good morning, Gina. Great to have you on the call and congrats on a strong 2Q. Just a couple of questions on the competitive environment. So first, are you still seeing a lot of liquidation in sales gone from the independents like you did earlier in the year or is that lessening? And then second, a major department store competitor is certainly accelerating its focus on jewelry with pretty good results so far. How should we think about this competitive threat and what levers Signet can pull to offset this pressure? ","Gina Drosos","Well, first on the liquidation sales, I would say we are seeing fewer from the independents that we had \u2013 than we had previously. But we are seeing stronger promotional spend from department stores, very price-oriented promotional spend. ","We take a view on this that we are leaders in this business for the long-term and so we are very analytical about our promotions willing to balance those to drive our top-line growth, but profitable share growth winning in bridal, getting stronger in fashion, those are the key things that are most important to us. It certainly is not all about price in our context. ","So we are working harder to combine our promotions with equity building, advertising and other marketing. So that we make sure we are building our brands over the long-term.","Rick Patel ","Can you give us some more color around the new initiatives for holiday? I am just curious about what\u2019s going to be different from last year from a merchandizing perspective in terms of your existing brands and any other new brands you might look to scale that you may have tested over the last few months?","Gina Drosos","Yes, so, I don\u2019t want to give away too much from a competitive standpoint, obviously, but we have a number of new fashion brands that we\u2019ve been working on. Some of those are brands with \u2013 which really speak to the heart and soul of consumer passion and which they think are great and some of which are really trend-driven on \u2013 very on style at the moment, designer-oriented brands building on the stacking trends that we\u2019ve seen recently in the market. ","So, I think, they are very strong. We are focused on price points in the gifts giving range of $200 to $700. So we\u2019ll have a very strong offering there. And so what we are really aiming to do combining that with a disciplined and smart promotional and marketing spend is to drive traffic into our stores and be very much part of consumers\u2019 holiday gift giving.","Michele Santana","And if I could pile in and add one additional comment as well, when we go through our holiday period this year, we will have that our leased to own program with Progressive Leasing and when you think about that, currently about 45% of customers who applied for credit for today are denied. ","And so that does represent a great opportunity for those customers who can\u2019t seek credit and mentioned on the call, we are able to successfully roll that out ahead of schedule and so now it\u2019s really just a matter of our store associates kind of building their muscle related to that. ","Rick Patel ","Thanks very much. All the best in the back half.","Michele Santana","Thanks.","Gina Drosos","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Krasik with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Scott Krasik ","Hi everyone. Thanks and congrats, Gina. Just wondering, it seems like the underlying sales trends excluding the Mother\u2019s Day shift in the first quarter were maybe down mid single-digits or so, second quarter that\u2019s improved meaningfully. So I am just wondering, how you view sort of your underlying trends ex the shift, maybe how are sales in June and July and how you are thinking about that going forward?","Gina Drosos","So, I\u2019d say a couple of things on that and then Michele, feel free to chime in. So, we had very strong average transaction value growth across our banners and across our key national banners led by Kay, certainly Piercing Pagoda, Zale as well, we also saw transaction increases in the quarter. ","So we are very pleased to see growth on both of those fronts. You are right, that ex the Mother\u2019s Day, we would have been down slightly on a comp basis. But coming out of the momentum that we had behind our bridal promotion in July, we are feeling very good about our guidance for the back half of the year.","Michele Santana","Yes, absolutely, I would say, very much encouraged by our Q2 results. We talked about strong performance going into the quarter and strong performance exiting the quarter with our July promotional event. And I did provide some color on the call on how to think about Q3 and Q4.","Scott Krasik ","Right. And then, so just lastly an update on maybe the synergies where you are there? And I think you alluded to in Ike\u2019s question that there you are finding some new savings. Can you just further expand on that? ","Michele Santana","Sure. We are looking for savings across our company. But just to answer specifically, synergies and related to the Zale acquisition which are the synergies that we talked about the most, Zale \u2013 I\u2019ve having been on the Board for five years, I continue to be very excited about that acquisition. ","Very good strategic decision for us and we are very committed to achieving business success. What has gone well on that integration is our operational focus on synergies. So we are on track to deliver the numbers that we\u2019ve communicated previously. What our bid opportunity is to drive further benefit from that acquisition is on the sales growth side. ","And we haven\u2019t meaningfully improved our sales productivity and still our Kay average store sales are about 50% higher than a Zale\u2019s which gives us a tremendous opportunity as we improve assortment, as we get our inventory right in the stores, as we update the look of those stores, as we bring technology like we\u2019ve talked about a tremendous opportunity to drive sales productivity. ","And so, while we will reach our synergy targets, I think the integration still has tremendous upside and as we fully embrace the ideas and talents of our Zale division team, we will be able to bring those to life. ","Scott Krasik ","Okay. Thanks, good luck.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Gina Drosos","Thank you.","Operator","And that\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. I will turn the call over to Miss. Drosos.","Gina Drosos","Okay. Thank you very much. Our next call will be the release of third quarter earnings on November 21. So that\u2019s it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's call.

Same-store sales increased by 3.3%.  The U.S., which represented 82% of our sales for the year, delivered 4% comp store sales, which was outstanding after an increase of 11.1% last year.  In the U.K., we comped slightly positive at 0.3%.  We delivered record profit for the year.  Our operating income climbed by 10.5% and diluted earnings per share came in at $4.35, up 16.6%.","There were other highlights as well beyond just the income statement.  We repurchased 7.4% of our outstanding shares in fiscal 2013.  Also, we increased our dividend in the first quarter by 20%.  And I'm very happy to say we announced today another dividend increase, this time by 25% or $0.03 per share on a quarterly basis.  Also, during fiscal '13, we had a strong operational performance.  We increased our square footage globally by 8.2%.  In part, through the acquisition of Ultra Stores, to gain a leading position in the outlet channel space, and organically, by opening 46 new Kay and 7 new Jared stores for a total of 53.","Now looking at the annual U.S. performance in a little more detail, in general, for the year, we saw a broad-based strength across many merchandise categories in both Kay and Jared as well as the Ultra acquisition, which occurred in the beginning of Q4. U.S. total sales were approximately $3.3 billion, up $239.8 million or an increase of 7.9%. Kay comp sales grew 6.4%, which was over the 11.8% growth achieved in fiscal 2012. Jared comp store sales were up 1.6% for the year following an increase of 12.1% last year. Fiscal 2013 Jared comps were adversely impacted by 3.5% due to the onetime Rolex clearance event in fiscal 2012 and the discontinuation of that watch line.  The event impact created a decline in average merchandise transaction value for fiscal 2013 as well. But importantly, the number of transactions at Jared increased by 5.7%. Overall, our U.S. same-store sales increased 4% in fiscal 2013, compared to 11.1% last year. Finally, the record Signet operating profit I mentioned moments ago, was driven by the U.S. which delivered nearly 15% growth and a 16.7% operating margin. It was a great year for our U.S. team members.","Now, let's take a look at what drove the performance starting with merchandise. Our merchandise sales growth was broad-based with strong growth across many categories including bridal and fashion jewelry, which includes colored diamonds and watches as well. In fiscal 2013, branded, differentiated and exclusive merchandise gained relative share within our product portfolio. The category grew by 9.7% and ended the year accounting for 27.4% of our merchandise sales mix, up by 110 basis points. This growth was led by Le Vian, Neil Lane Design, Neil Lane Bridal, Tolkowsky, Shades of Wonder and Open Hearts by Jane Seymour.","Other significant drivers were colored diamonds, particularly our artistry and vivid diamond collections, as well as earrings and necklaces. Our watch business excluding the impact of the Rolex discontinuation in fiscal 2012, was up by double digits as we continue to develop this important category.  Our leadership in a marketing and advertising continues to be an important driver of our U.S. sales. Everyone knows that Every Kiss Begins with Kay and He Went to Jared. For the holiday season, we invested in 8 new creative TV ads to continue our industry-leading share voice. In fiscal 2013, our advertising investment was $224 million, driven by Kay and Jared, which had the scale and profitability to invest significantly.","Our branded, differentiated and exclusive merchandise continued to provide compelling stories that we can effectively communicate in our messaging. Now that drives purchase intent. We are also investing aggressively in growing our in-store technology, e-commerce and social media to build upon our multichannel offering. Kay and Jared stores went through their first holiday season in fiscal 2013 that they were armed with computer-assisted selling tablets. These touch screen devices were seen by both our associates and our customers as highly successful selling tools. In social media, we remain pleased with our customers' response to the content we're delivering. Our fan base and followers continue to climb and social media outlets are driving more traffic to our stores and our e-commerce sites. We'll continue providing customers who visit our digital environment with an outstanding shopping experience.","For Kay and Jared, we operated newly relaunched websites as well as new mobile apps.  For the year, e-commerce sales grew by 48% in the U.S. to $101.4 million.","Another very important element of our multichannel offering has been our expansion in the outlet channel with the acquisition of Ultra Stores last year. We launched this initiative with the goal of becoming the #1 jeweler in outlet malls. Our strategy is to leverage the Kay brand with Ultra's outlet expertise. We will convert the majority of the stores to Kay outlets by the end of the second quarter, giving us the ability to leverage advertising, increased productivity and drive sales.  The integration is progressing on track and our teams are doing an excellent job with the integration process. We remain very excited about this business and expect significant growth.","Now, in turning to the U.K. Fiscal 2013 total sales were $709.5 million, down $5.6 million or 0.8%, but the same-store sales increased by 0.3%. E-commerce sales were $28.4 million, which was up $4.6 million or a strong 19.3%.","The U.K. experienced sales growth, primarily in branded fashion and bridal jewelry, as well as a fashion and prestige watches. Sales were unfavorable in a non-branded jewelry and beads. The economic environment remained challenging and customer traffic was lower, particularly in the fourth quarter. In addition, customers continued to gravitate to promotional merchandise which reduced the effectiveness of price increases in gross margins. Store closures and foreign currency fluctuations were also unfavorable for sales.  Operating income was $40 million, down $16.1 million from the last year. Operating margin decreased by 220 basis points to 5.6% compared to 7.8% last year. This was primarily due to lower gross margin. I would like to thank our U.K. team members though, for their strong efforts in what continues to be very challenging marketplace.","In our review of the U.K. business for the fourth quarter and last year, it reaffirmed our commitment to our 3-part, long-term strategy, which is focused on merchandise, real estate channel optimization and cost control. In our review, we realized that there are opportunities to further strengthen our merchandise offerings by testing and implementing improved bead programs, refocusing our merchandised efforts in general on continued innovation with a focus on our opening price plan offerings as well, and by building off strength in prestige and fashion watches to enhance the future business. We will stay focused on the merchandise assortment.","We believe we have the right programs in place to achieve our targeted real estate and cost-saving initiatives as well. Therefore, we'll maintain our commitment in these areas. This market does remain challenging, and while we continue to have an achievement of 10% operating margin as our goal, it may take a little longer to achieve than originally thought.","Our goal continues to be an enhancement of Signet's market-leading position. We intend to achieve that through initiatives around people, by focusing on attracting, retaining and training the best team members in the industry, brands and the overall strength of our merchandise offerings, our channels of distribution, our infrastructure and our strong financial position. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Ron for a little bit more color.","Ronald W. Ristau","Thank you, Mike. I will start by reminding everyone that Signet follows the retail reporting calendar, which included an extra week in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2013. The additional week added $56.4 million in sales and reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.02 for both the quarter and year.  The extra week is not included in same-store sales calculations.","For the quarter, total sales for Signet's increased 11.8% to $1,513,300,000 compared to $1,353,800,000  last year. Total Signet same-store sales increased 3.5%, on top of the 6.9% growth last year.","In the U.S., total sales increased 14.2% to $1,244,900,000, including a same-store sales increase of 4.9%. This was on top of an 8.3% comp increase last year. Non-same-store sales were up 5.3%, which includes new stores at 1.3% and Ultra, which added 4%. The extra week added another 4% or $43.5 million.","I would like to point out in our 10-K, which was filed today, we are introducing reporting on average merchandise transaction value and the number of merchandise transactions as we committed to you last year.","In the U.S., the number of merchandised transactions increased 6.4% and the average merchandised transaction value increased by 2.7%. In the U.K., total sales increased 1.8% to $268.4 million, while comp sales decreased 1.9% as compared to an increase of 1.7% last year.","Let me walk you through this. In the U.K., we experienced negative comparable store sales of 1.9% and a 3.6% decline in non-same-store sales due to store closures. Offsetting this, there was a 4.8%, or $12.9 million increase in sales for the 14th week and a 2.5% increase in sales from currency movements. The average merchandise transaction value was down 2.4% while the number of merchandise transactions was essentially flat as increases in conversion helped to offset customer traffic declines.","Signet e-commerce sales were $63.9 million, up $20.4 million or 47%, continuing the strong trend.  And for the year, e-commerce sales were $129.8 million, up $37.5 million or 40.6%.","Now, let's take a look at the rest of the fourth quarter P&L. Fourth quarter operating income increased $23.8 million to $267.7 million, up 9.8%.  Gross margin was $637.1 million, an increase of $73.9 million. The gross margin rate was 42.1%, up 50 basis points. Gross margin dollars in the U.S. increased by $79 million, reflecting primarily increased sales and a gross margin rate increase of 120 basis points, primarily due to an increase in the gross merchandise margin rate of approximately 140 basis points, primarily caused by the product mix. Gross margin dollars in the U.K. declined $5.1 million, primarily reflecting a decline in the gross margin rate of 260 basis points. This was primarily caused by decline in the gross merchandise margin rate of 60 basis points, caused mainly by customers preferences for promotional merchandise, with unfavorable leverage on cost due to the 14th week and currency movements accounting for the difference.","Selling, general and administrative expenses were $410.9 million, and as a percentage of sales, increased 130 basis points to $27.1 million. This was primarily due to an increase in advertising costs and store expenses due to the 14th week and the Ultra acquisition, which I'll discuss in more detail in a moment. Our other operating income was $41.5 million, up $12 million versus last year due to a permanent adjustment in the credit cycle processing, the mix of finance programs selected by customers and greater interest earned from higher receivable balances. Overall, the operating income increased -- led to a fully diluted share -- earnings per share of $2.12, up 18.4%, a very strong performance.","So a few points on SG&A. Our SG&A increased more than usual in the quarter, both on an absolute level and as a percentage of sales, but there are very logical reasons for it. First, the impact of the 14th week, generated $26.7 million of incremental SG&A expense. This was primarily due to a store payroll and the timing of the key Valentine's Day marketing campaign. The SG&A rate for this week was, of course, distortive. Second, the Ultra impact was $13.4 million. We incur expenses for approximately 110 more retail stores versus prior year in the fourth quarter. And lastly, a variety of items totaling $22 million, which primarily reflected investment in advertising and a number of other initiatives.","We believe our SG&A remains well controlled and point out that the SG&A rate, excluding the 14th week and Ultra, would have been 26.2% of similarly adjusted sales for the fourth quarter.","As I've addressed the quarter, here are few points on the year. Fiscal 2013 was a record year for Signet. I'd like to highlight several key financial accomplishments. Total sales increased 6.2%, driven by the U.S. performance and the acquisition of Ultra to expand our outlet presence. Same-store sales were up 3.3% on top of the 9% comp last year. We improved our gross margin to 38.6% of sales, an increase of 30 basis points driven by the strong performance of the U.S. division.","SG&A remains well controlled and was reported at 28.6% versus 28.2% last year. The increase of 40 basis points was primarily due to the 53rd week and the Ultra acquisition. Excluding these items and the related sales, the rate was 28.3% of sales, virtually consistent with last year. Our operating margin was 14.1% versus 13.5% last year, as we continue to make progress towards our long-term goal of 15%. And finally, adjusted -- I'm sorry, fully diluted earnings per share grew by 16.6% to $4.35.","Taking a quick look at our cash positions, we began fiscal 2013 with $486.8 million in cash. During the course of the year, net cash provided by operating activities was a source of $312.7 million. Our first priority in using cash is to invest back in our own business. To that end, capital spending totaled $134.2 million, driven by new stores, remodeling and information technology investments. We also invested in a long-term growth of Signet by purchasing Ultra for $56.7 million, using our available cash to quickly close. Beyond reinvesting in our operations, we have taken a shareholder friendly view towards the use of cash. In fiscal 2013, we returned value to shareholders in the form of both stock buybacks and dividends paid, which together, totaled $325.6 million. We ended the year with cash of $301 million or 7.6% of sales, consistent with our objectives of targeting cash between 7% to 9% of sales at year end.","Our net inventory ended the year at approximately $1.4 billion, an increase of 7.1% from 1 year ago.  One of the main drivers was the addition of $40 million of Ultra inventory. Excluding Ultra, our inventory increased by 4.1%. The balance of the increase was a result of higher commodity costs and the strategic investments such as our rough diamond sourcing initiative, which added approximately $35 million to inventory. These increases were partially offset by actions to improve inventory terms and we believe our inventory remains the best controlled in the jewelry industry.","Let's review the performance of the credit portfolio for the year. The performance during fiscal year '13 of the credit portfolio has been very strong.  Accounts receivable at year end were $1.2 billion, up 10.8% due to higher credit sales driven principally by an increase in our bridal business.  Credit participation as a percentage of U.S. sales, was up 80 basis points in fiscal 2013 to 56.9% and the average outstanding account balance was up 3.9% to $1,110. The average monthly collection rate was 12.4% as compared to 12.7% last year, reflecting a mixed change in the finance program selected by customers.","As a percentage of the U.S. sales, the net bad debt increased 30 basis points to 3.7%. This was driven primarily by the onetime impact of the credit cycle processing change. Excluding this impact, the rate was virtually flat to last year.  Please note, we did reserve $2 million for the impact of Superstorm Sandy on our customers as we closed the year.","Finally, other operating income increased due to a change in the mix of finance programs selected by customers and interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. This offset the increase in bad debt expense with the net benefit being approximately $15.6 million for the year between the 2.","Lastly, our guidance for the first year of fiscal 2013. These were same-store sales growth of 5% to 7%. We are also forecasting that Q1 fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share will range from $1.07 to $1.12. Our capital spending for fiscal 2014 is anticipated to be $180 million to $195 million, which includes opening 65 to 75 new Kay and Jared stores, remodels, the Ultra integration and investment in information technology, as we to continue to focus on growth and productivity.","At the high level, our financial objectives for the business in fiscal 2014 are to increased sales and gain profitable market share, to manage our gross margin by increasing sales productivity and balancing commodity cost increases with price adjustments and developing unique multichannel advertising programs and supporting new initiatives, while appropriately managing our SG&A ratio. We believe we are well-positioned for another strong year of accomplishment. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Mike.","Michael W. Barnes","Thanks, Ron. In conclusion, I'd like to, once again, thank the Signet team worldwide for their contributions to what has been a very successful year. We would now be pleased to take any questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Simeon Siegel from JPMorgan.","Simeon A. Siegel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So Ron, just given the timing shifts ahead related to the 53rd week, what's the rate implied total sales range for the first quarter within that 5% to 10% comp?","Ronald W. Ristau","I'm sorry, we didn't give a total sales rate so I can't give it since we didn't put it in the press release. It will be 5% to 7%. It will be 5% to 7% comp. I will point out that we do have this calendar shift of Mother's Day coming back into the first quarter. That does not affect comp because of the way that comp calculations shift with the 53rd week, so I just want to make that point. But the comp performance we are expecting is driven by the underlying performance of our business.","Michael W. Barnes","Yes, Simeon, this is Mike. Just to add to that. Really, I think the right way to look at it is that the broad-based core business is really driving the underlying comp performance and the couple of shifts that we've had like with the 53rd week or with the Mother's Day, really aren't what's driving that underlying comp.","Simeon A. Siegel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And then, Mike, could you just talk briefly about the underlying fruit at Ultra. I mean, is it as simple as just converting the signage out front and then letting the Kay brand do the rest?  Could you just -- I guess, you guys are planning to convert by the middle of the year. I mean, should we see accretion maybe earlier than that Q4 date?","Michael W. Barnes","No. It's not quite that simple. I wish that it were that simple, but there's a lot of things. What we're doing is we really are marrying the leverage and the equity that we have with the Kay brand name along with the expertise that Ultra has. They have over 100 outlet stores when we made this acquisition, which basically was triple the number of stores that we had, more or less. And so immediately, it put us in a leading leadership position within the outlet store business. But they also brought a lot of expertise on running outlet stores and good ideas can come from anywhere. We're very pleased with a lot of what we've learned as we've been transitioning the Ultra stores and we believe we're going to be well-positioned. Having said all that, with the equity that Kay brings, as we changed the nameplates on the stores, as we update the merchandise mix, for instance, we were able to get some Jane Seymour product into the Ultra Stores in time for Valentine's Day and it was a great seller in those stores, even without the Kay nameplate. So I think the change in merchandise mix, the equity that Kay name brings and the expertise that Ultra brings in the outlet store channel, that's a strong combination that's really going to help us drive that business higher and higher over time.","Ronald W. Ristau","And just to follow on your point on accretion on Ultra, again, we're not expecting -- it will actually be slightly diluted in the first and second quarter as we said repeatedly. So it's a couple of pennies each quarter and probably, relatively flat maybe a penny on the third and then we're expecting it to start to become accretive in the fourth quarter as we complete the program.","Operator","And our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","As we think about gross margin for this year and next, can you just provide an update on product costs and where those are versus last year?","Ronald W. Ristau","Well, it's a very complex question. As you know, our product costs are really long-term averaging cost. We're running a FIFO inventory system but it averages the cost of inventory over time, so that any movement in the commodity prices, whether up or down, is slowly reflected in the average cost as it moves through the system. And so, it's hard for me to predict exactly where costs will go in the future  You know what's been happening with gold. We actually got a little break on gold this year and -- but diamonds, we expect to start to accelerate again due to the pressures on demand, really. So what I would say to you is that whatever happens in cost as we move forward, our goal is to manage our gross merchandise margins by balancing cost increases with whatever price increases we need to take. And it's hard to be more specific than that because I don't have a predict cost going forward. So we're always looking at it and making adjustments as we need it.  I'm sorry, I can't be more specific about that.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And have you raised prices so far this year?","Ronald W. Ristau","We usually raise prices. Not so far, but we usually do our price increase somewhere between the first and the second quarter of the year. That has been our historical trend, so we intend to do that once again. That is correct.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Stein from North Coast Research.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Couple of questions. First of all, Ron, wondering if you could talk about the impact of the Mother's Day shift in terms of what it's worth to the first quarter.  And in turn, obviously, I guess, it will have a negative impact on Q2?","Ronald W. Ristau","It's an interesting question. Thank you for the question. When Mother's Day shifts into the first quarter this year, it has virtually no impact on the comp calculation because of the way in which you shift the comp calculations resulting from the 53rd week. So it has no impact on comp. It will have an impact on total sales in the range of, let's say, in the range of $30 million, okay. And that will come out of the second quarter and move into the first quarter. What will happen is -- and this is why we indicated in the 8-K that we filed right before we went to the ICR Conference, is that, what that will do is, in the second quarter, it will make it difficult for us to generate significant increases in earnings per share because of the dollar shift back into the first quarter. Therefore, we have made the statement we believe that will be essentially flattish in the second quarter for that reason than with, of course, growth resuming as we move into the third and fourth quarter. So that's really what's going to happen as a result of it. Again, it doesn't affect comp. It just simply affects dollars in the first quarter.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Understand. And regarding your -- kind of your march towards the target of a mid-teens EBIT margin, I'm kind of curious, given the fact that you are investing this year in Ultra, do you believe that you can improve over your 14.1% EBIT margin that you just reported for the fiscal '13 year?","Ronald W. Ristau","We certainly believe that, that's an objective of the company.","Michael W. Barnes","And as we stated, we feel pretty good about achieving the objectives that we've laid out at this point in time.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Okay. And final question, if you could just address kind of your thinking on the U.K. in terms of pushing back your target to achieve that 10% EBIT.  Is it primarily a macro headwind or are there any structural issues such as, perhaps, not being able to close as many of the unprofitable stores as soon as you would like? And maybe you could just talk about the plans for store closings this year in the U.K.","Michael W. Barnes","I'll address that at a high level. Basically, certainly, we've continued to see strong macro headwinds there. I'll just reiterate, it was in the presentation, but just to make sure if I have to, basically, especially in the fourth quarter, we saw a decline in traffic. We had great execution in the stores and our conversion was up, so that kind of offset the traffic and put us back to even. And the downside that we had there was really on the average selling value of the merchandise because the customers just continued to be strongly promotional in their choices. So that's really what drove what happened in the U.K. We still believe very strongly in that 3-part strategy. We are working on merchandise fast and furious right now. We'll continue to do that. We believe that we've done some very good analysis of our real estate portfolio and we do continue to close doors as appropriate based upon the financial analysis that make sense to do so. So we haven't really slowed anything down there.  And we are making the expected gains that we expected on the cost control initiatives as well.  So I believe that our -- operationally, we have been pretty much on target. Fourth quarter was a downward shift in traffic and a downward shift in the average selling prices of the merchandise based on promotions that was just too much to overcome with -- even with our increased conversion process.  So it's going a little bit slower but we still believe in our strategy there. The team is working very hard to implement it and execute it. And we're confident that we will continue to move towards our goals.","Ronald W. Ristau","And just to be specific on your question on store closures, it will be in the -- around about the mid-20s of stores that are closed next year in the U.K.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rick Patel from Stephens.","Rick Patel","Can you give us a little bit more detail on the benefit you had in the U.S. gross margins from merchandising mix? I'm curious if fashion jewelry did better than bridal or if there's something else going on there? And should we expect that benefit from mix shift to continue for the rest of this year?","Ronald W. Ristau","Well, I would say that the bridal business was good, the fashion business was good, the colored diamond business was good, the watch business was pretty good. We saw a growth around -- the shift is kind of subtle in the mix. It's nothing that is -- like there's one thing that I would describe and say, \"Well, that's what cost the shift -- the mix shift.\" We do have a slight mix shift relative to having the bridal business up and some of the Neil Lane products and some of the more expensive products in one. But it's really -- it's kind of an overall mix rather than one specific thing that caused that.","Michael W. Barnes","Yes, I think it's pretty subtle really, Rick. But as we said, our branded, differentiated and exclusive merchandise grew by 9.7% last year. And that certainly, as we have stated, it has a slightly higher margin. But again, it's pretty subtle. It's not an extremely higher margin on a comparative basis, but when you add it all together, that's where it came out in the mix. And I would expect to continue to see brands do well as we move forward.","Rick Patel","And then just a question on e-commerce. In the past, you've talked about consumers preferring to shop in person for jewelry instead of going online so that they can experience the product, and at the same time, your e-commerce has been very strong over the last year. So do you think customers are changing their approach to buying jewelry more towards online channels or do you see your strong growth as a function of taking market share? Just help us think about that.","Michael W. Barnes","It maybe a little bit of both, quite frankly. One of the strongest initiatives that Ron and I have been driving in the last couple of years is e-commerce.  And when you look at the growth, the long-term growth that we've had there, it's pretty astounding.  In the U.S., we grew e-commerce by 48%. And even in the U.K., which as we've just talked about, very, very difficult market, we have strong double-digit growth there as well. So we are behind so many initiatives here and we believe in not only e-commerce, but the entire digital ecosystem. It's everything that we're doing out there with our customer information base, with the social media initiatives that we have tackled and that we continue to move forward on, that people are very pleased with, as well as the e-commerce sales. And we're seeing the benefit online and in-store. And the technology that we have in-store is just making that even stronger. The touch pad that we supplied our associates with during the fourth quarter, first time they had it during the holiday season, it was very well received. And we've got lots of great feedbacks from that. So I believe everything we're doing from a digital standpoint will continue to drive forward and we can expect to see continued gains in that area.","Operator","And our next question comes from Oliver Chen from Citigroup.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Regarding the 5% to 7% comp guidance, is that going to be primarily driven by transactions? How should we think about the key metrics from which you'll likely achieve that? And also, could you speak to the potential for bridal penetration to increase other income and if that, is something that will be a positive to the operating margin this year?","Ronald W. Ristau","I think -- let me answer the last question first.  The major shift we saw last year was as a result of the customers opting out of our interest-free program and into our normal credit terms. That shift has stabilized, if you will. We're not seeing a shift move any further than what it did during last year. So that was a primary driver of the increase in other operating income. So that level of shift, I do not believe this should count on for fiscal 2014 or forward. But as the credit portfolio grows, obviously, the income earned on it will increase, but that's a much -- at a much lower rate than what happened last year with a shift in program, that's number one. And your first question, had -- repeat it again? Transactions. It's hard to predict transactions versus price. We don't actually predict forward that way. I have to defer an answer on that till we get through the first quarter. We have seen very strong business. Our business has been good.  So I would bet that our transactions are running up, as well as our prices too. I would say a little bit of both, just like we got in the fourth quarter, if you really push for an answer on that. I think that probably would be our expectation, but I'll have to say we'll see how it ends up.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And our final follow up is, in relation to the changes with Rolex, have you guys -- do you expect there to be a change in terms of what you're feeling in there? And will this be a potential benefit to the back half as you anniversary with a newer department there?","Michael W. Barnes","Well, we're very pleased with the way that our watch business is building right now. And as I mentioned, in the prepared remarks, ex Rolex, we had strong double-digit gains in most of the brands, quite frankly and we the continue to work with new brands.  We've put more fashion into there, with Michele watches, for instance. We've been testing Gucci. We have some other things up our sleeve. But we feel very good about the growth of our watch business, and while it's a small mix in the United States, it's much more prominent in the U.K. It's been a strong business, stronger part of our business in the U.K. as well. So we think the watch category is extremely important to our future and we are working diligently to continue to build it strongly. So I would just say, stay tuned, Oliver, because there's a lot of good things to come there.","Ronald W. Ristau","And Oliver, just a follow up on there just a little bit.  Again, I would say that as we look across the year, we -- given our guidance for the first quarter, we've suggested that people be very careful about their expectations for the second quarter because of the Mother's Day shift. But as we move into the third and fourth quarter, where were not up against the Rolex and so on, the business should get better. And I think, you'll see more EPS growth in the second half than you will in the first half, barring what happens in the first quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jennifer Davis from Lazard Capital.","Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","A couple of clarifications. So should we assume, based on the 5% to 7% comp guidance, that the Valentine's Day comps were kind of in that or at least, February comps were kind of in that range?","Ronald W. Ristau","Well, we generally don't comment on individual months as you indicate. But our Valenties business was good and we were, as Mike indicated, pleased with the way it all turned out. We had yet experienced a small impact from the snowstorm.  We've lost about maybe $5 million of sales for that snowstorm that happened on a Saturday. Other than that, our balance cycle was good.","Michael W. Barnes","And I think, one way that you could characterize that, Jennifer, is to think of it is as very broad base, both over time and over product categories. I'm pleased to say, again, that our business has not been any type of a one-trick pony, whether it be in a short time period or a narrow category. It's been very broad-based for the quarter-to-date and over the categories.","Ronald W. Ristau","The February was a strong month. It was just a strong month for ourselves.","Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then going back to the second quarter. I missed this, Ron, you said something about flattish. Were you referring to operating margin or to EPS?","Ronald W. Ristau","I was referring to EPS, really. I was trying to take a look at how we think the pattern of the year will develop. And I would point out that even if it doesn't affect comp, there is a dollar shift -- a profit shift associated with that Mother's Day thing.  Therefore, since Mother's Day is such a big part of the second quarter, it will be more difficult for us to show real earnings per share growth that quarter. And then as we move into the third and fourth quarter, things should be back on track.","Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Great, got it. Okay. And then -- so obviously, second quarter consensus estimates need to come down. I know you don't provide full-year guidance but could you comment maybe on your comfort level with full-year consensus estimates? Because it sounds like there's possibly upside to consensus estimates in the back half.","Ronald W. Ristau","I wish I could. I really can't do that, but you have to think about what we've said and make your own inferences.","Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Yes. All right, fair enough. Okay. And then my question is on the merchandise at Ultra versus Kay outlets. I mean, the merchandise is pretty significantly different. I know you've added some brands like Jane Seymour to Ultra now. But I guess, it's still early, but you've got your re-term holiday. How are you thinking about maybe some of the merchandise from Ultra going into Kay outlets, kind of the mix that you've got there?","Michael W. Barnes","That's a great question because really what we're trying to do is take an analysis of, obviously, we know how Kay merchandise performs and we've been analyzing how the Ultra merchandise performs. I think, I've said it earlier, but good ideas can come from anywhere and so if they've got some great merchandise that we think could be a big benefit for our outlets, in general, we'll put them in all the outlet stores. And we have learned a lot during the transition of Ultra and we realized that there are certain specifics in running outlet businesses that are different than running a full-priced mall store or a full-priced off-mall store. And so we need to really tweak our outlet business model anyway. And we think, it's just going to make our business even stronger. I mean, we've had a good strong outlet business even with the limited number of doors we had until the acquisition. We believe that we'll be able to drive a lot of that productivity as we convert the Ultra Stores into Kay. And we believe the learnings within the process will lead us to enhance our outlet merchandise offerings and see even more improvement out of that. So it's really a win-win-win situation the way we view it.","Jennifer M. Davis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Yes. I agree with that. I think, you can take some of that Ultra merchandise or the learnings from Ultra Stores and apply it to the Kay outlets. And then finally, how are you thinking about the shop and shops for the Burlington Coat Factory jewelry locations?","Michael W. Barnes","Well, we're continuing to analyze that business.  And right now, we're still in learning stages of operating those as we finish this transition and we'll talk about that more if we see anything change in the future.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ike Boruchow from Sterne Agee.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I guess 2 questions. The first one, I guess, is for Ron. The bad debts are going up to 3.3% from 3% last year. Ron, is that just a function of the credit portfolio continuing to grow? Can you comment on your average monthly collection rates and just the health of that -- of the portfolio right now?","Ronald W. Ristau","Sure. Well, as I indicated, we think the portfolio is performing very, very strongly. The bad debt expense this year in the first -- fourth quarter, was impacted by 2 things:  Number one is this change we made last fourth quarter that doesn't have any real net impact across either fiscal year, but it affects the bad debt in the quarter. So let me just give you what those numbers would be if I restated apples-to-apples. In fiscal '12, the bad debt expense would have been 3.6% and in fiscal '13, it would have been 3.5%. So there's that shift that's causing the difference from -- on an annual basis moving from 3.4% to 3.7%. But that's just the onetime shift. The net impact of it, when you take the impact of how we move bad debt and how we move the operating income, it moved $2 million only, 1 year was positive $2 million and 1 year was negative $2 million, the net being zero and now it's all restated and we have the right operating structure going forward. So that's what happened. The portfolio is performing great. The change in the collection rate which came down by 30 bps, really had to do with the mix of programs. As the customers -- remember, I said, we're choosing less our interest-free program and more of our regular credit terms. As they choose the regular credit terms, the payment cycles stretch out a little bit further. So therefore, it affected the monthly collection rate by 30 bps, so that what caused the entire change. So other than that, we really love the way the portfolio has been performing. It's been very strongly supporting our business, and as I mentioned, in particular, our bridal business. Consumers are behaving very well other than a small regional issue, of course, called by Superstorm Sandy in New York, where we set up a specific reserves of $2 million. But really the portfolio is performing great and we're very pleased with it and we look forward to another good year this year.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","With the participation rate approaching 57% of U.S. sales, is there a certain ceiling that you guys kind of view that and kind of say to yourself, \"Well, if it hits X, that's kind of a tipping point. We don't want to put too much our sales on credit.\"","Ronald W. Ristau","No, I mean, we really don't. We have a lot of confidence in our credits scoring mechanisms and the way we grant credit. And we've seen no change in the -- for instance, still approximately 50% of the people who applied for credit are granted credit, 50% percent do not get credit. So no, there's no ceiling to it. And as we continue to focus on our bridal business, you could see that number keep going up, because as I've mentioned  a couple times, the penetration in bridal can be 70% or even a little bit higher than 70% sometimes. So that's really what drives it. I don't think it ever gets terribly much higher than 60ish. But I think as it moves up, it doesn't really concern our site, because we're watching all the credit decision metrics and those are very high quality metrics and the performance has been great.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Last and follow-up is, the last couple of years, I think, I believe you guys have provided some kind of free cash flow guidance. Just wondering if there's anything you can kind of share with us there. And also, when we think about your working capital needs this year, should there be a benefit because of the cost of goods flowing through on the lower cost, on diamonds and some of these precious metals?","Ronald W. Ristau","Okay, let me see if I have the question right, I'm sorry. The capital, our capital requirements for next year?","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","No, no. The last 2 years, I believe, you've given your free cash flow guidance for the year.","Ronald W. Ristau","Yes. We try to kind of back away from free cash flow guidance. Not that there's anything wrong with our cash flow, it's just that it's a non-GAAP measure and it was causing us a lot of heartaches, so we decided not to do it. We're still giving the capital guidance which is in the $180 million to $195 million range. We believe our cash flow will continue to be strong. And we will be able to continue to invest in capital and dividends. And the strength of our capital is evidenced by the fact that we increased the dividend by 25% this year. But we kind of try not to give specific numbers on that.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Sure. Well, I guess, to rephrase another balance sheet question. Because of the input cost deflation that should start to work its way to the P&L, could inventory start to come in below sales growth?","Ronald W. Ristau","Oh, that's a good question. Yes, I understand, I'm sorry. I again say that the changes in commodity pricing have to take place over a long, long period of time before they start to really have major impact. We are doing and executing certain programs, one of which I called out, which is our rough diamond purchase program, which does add a layer to our inventories so it moves us back a step in the supply chain. All right. And that will -- we will continue forward with that. So that my overall view is that even though there could be some benefit from commodity pricing, and let's all knock on wood and hope that it comes through the year, yes, the inventory would adjust a little bit. But we will be buying more and more of these rough diamonds, which will have some offsetting impact. And my bet is that you would still see slow low single-digit type growth in the inventory levels.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Armstrong from CL King & Associates.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Could you give us the expected cost of the Ultra integration for first quarter or the first half of the year?","Ronald W. Ristau","What I could do is give you the total capital investment that we're going to make next year, which is for -- it's for all things. It's about -- for changing the signs and reconfiguring some stores and a variety of other work, inputting new POS systems and bringing them up on our POS and credit systems.  That's about $18 million. It's included within the base of our capital spending. Within the first 2 quarters of the year, which include our -- let's call it transitional and start-up costs and overlap cost and things of that nature, we would expect it'd be a couple of pennies each quarter that we actually loose in Ultra. We expect it to start becoming accretive by the fourth quarter of the year. But the main cost is that capital conversion cost and that is about $18 million.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. Does -- are Ultra's gross margins or merchandise margins more or less in line with the rest of the company or is there a significant difference?","Ronald W. Ristau","They're more or less in line. They are a touch lower right now as we change the mix of products and we'll see how that develops over the year. Their margins are a touch lower than ours right now because of the way they discount and the way that they buy. We expect, of course, to drive buying efficiencies and we'll be adjusting the mix. So outlets, in our own outlets, we're on a just a touch lower than our business, nothing significant. But because of the fact that you've got more promotional product in there, there is usually a slight, slight impact in the margin.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And your credit card operations, are they -- is that in the Ultra Stores or is not leaving?","Ronald W. Ristau","No it's not. That's, of course, a big opportunity for us. We will be -- when we convert to our POS system, that will automatically give the Ultra Stores access to our credit systems. So it will be mid-year before they have access to the Signet credit department. And that's when we expect that will be very helpful to sales in the second half of the year, of course, because that's something they cannot offer today.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right. So POS rollout is obviously, is part of the integration. And I guess when we look at the...","Ronald W. Ristau","POS is part of integration and POS includes the credit rollout.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And when we look then at the customer finance participation of 56.9%, I guess, we should exclude the Ultra sales from Q4 in the numerator?","Ronald W. Ristau","That number is coded, I think, that's the sales without Ultra.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, Okay. Last question. In what way did Sandy impact bad debt? Why would a storm have impacted the [indiscernible].","Ronald W. Ristau","Well, we see a certain of our -- well, customers in the New York area were terribly impacted from a personal financial situation, from -- people lost their homes, their lives were disrupted. So that's really what caused it. And -- so that -- we noted it and we tried to work as best we can with our customers and we set up this reserve because we do understand that there are extenuating circumstances.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. And that question is from Jessica Schoen from Barclays Capital.","Jessica Schoen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering if there is any market shared data that you could share with us to help us understand how you're growing in context of the overall market, maybe even just in the U.S.?","Ronald W. Ristau","In terms of overall, we use the government statistics, which have not yet really been issued.  We will -- we can give you more color on that in the future. Obviously, we don't -- it usually comes in that we can probably give you some numbers by the second quarter. We believe we continue to grow market share. We just don't have the official statistics therefore, we couldn't quote it in our 10-K or in our call at this point in time. But when we get those statistics, we'll be happy to share them with you.","Jessica Schoen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then you talked about a few merchandise categories that were very successful for you in the past year. I was wondering, if looking ahead to 2013, if there are any initiatives in particular that you're very excited about?","Michael W. Barnes","Yes. I mean, we always have initiatives that we are excited about.  Just an anecdotal comment, our merchandising team was very excited about some of the new tests that they ran. But tests are tests so we're continuing to analyze the results of that. We think we are going to have great merchandise offerings for the year. We think that current brands that we have and the way that we're extending those and developing new and exciting and innovative products is really going to help us to continue to drive a strong business. But there will be some new stuff coming and there will be continued evolution of current brands and merchandise. And by the way, our merchandise offerings, on the branded side are fantastic. And as you heard on our exclusives and differentiated brands, they grew by 9.7%. But even in our non-branded core merchandise offerings, a lot of people don't realize, a lot of that merchandise is still exclusive to us. And we put just as much effort into how we innovate it and putting fashion into it and following the trend. So we're pretty excited about our merchandise offerings across the breadth of our company right now. So I would say stay tuned, just as last year. I also don't like to get in too much detail for competitive reasons until we have things positioned out in our stores and we can start taking advantage of it.","Operator","And I will now turn the call back to Mr. Barnes for closing remarks.","Michael W. Barnes","I'd like to thank all of you for taking part in the call and to the great questions that you had for us.  Our next scheduled call is on May 23 and we'll review our first quarter results at that time.  Thanks again and goodbye. Have a great day.","Ronald W. Ristau","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Randi Abada, you may begin your conference.","Randi Abada","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. On the call today are Signet\u2019s CEO, Gina Drosos; and CFO, Michele Santana.","During today\u2019s presentation, we will make certain forward-looking statements. Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially.

Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly update forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","During the call, we\u2019ll discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a discussion of the non-GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, investors should review the press release we posted on our website.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Gina.","Gina Drosos","Thank you, Randi. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. To begin, I\u2019d like to thank all of our team members for their support of our customers this quarter and their ongoing efforts to deliver on the important holiday season. In my remarks today, I\u2019ll begin with a brief overview of current trends we are seeing in the marketplace and third quarter results and then move on to an update on our holiday plans and the Path to Brilliance transformation plan. I\u2019ll wrap up my comments with a brief overview of our full year fiscal 2019 guidance.","As Signet has moved through fiscal 2019, our sales trends have continue to stabilize, enabled by transformation initiatives to drive demand with clear strategic priorities, greater accountability, efficiency and operational discipline. Early investments in our e-commerce capabilities are positively impacting our financial results with strong double-digit growth in e-commerce sales across our core banners year-to-date.","Our brick-and-mortar sales performance is also improving, but it is not yet at the levels that we want to be which has impacted the flow through of sales growth to our earnings this year. Thus far in the fourth quarter, we are seeing a more competitive environment as department stores continue to invest in the category and consumers are highly responsive to value. As a result, we are planning for some additional promotional activity in the fourth quarter to support our holiday sales. This issue together with the channel mix, I just discussed, is expected to be a headwind to gross margin in the fourth quarter.","Our revised guidance we issued this morning reflects the trends we are seeing. Our new customer first banner positionings and merchandizing efforts along with real estate optimization and cost reduction actions are key to unlocking the full potential of our stores and achieving greater operating leverage as we move through our transformation journey. The third quarter is a smaller quarter for Signet with no major holidays. Our focus this quarter has been on bringing our fourth quarter plans to life and continuing work on longer-term transformation initiatives to invest in growth under our three strategic pillars of customer first, omni-channel and culture of agility and efficiency.","Before I discuss these in details, I will provide some highlights of our third quarter performance. We delivered same sales growth and EPS above our non-GAAP guidance in the third quarter while reinvesting in advertising as we prepare for the holiday season and the launch of our new banner positioning.","Here are some highlights of our third quarter performance, total company same store sales were up 1.6% with North America up 2.1%, these results included an accounting adjustment which Michele will further discuss in her remarks that shifted the timing of service plan revenue recognition. This adjustment negatively impacted total same store sales by 60 basis points and North American same store sales by 55 basis points.","With respect to our banners, Zales and Piercing Pagoda reflect a continuing sales momentum, Kay returned to same store sales growth and Jared was flat with the prior year quarter. International same store sales were down 3.1% as our UK business continues to be impacted by a challenging macroeconomic environment with weak consumer sentiment. eCommerce was the strong contributor to growth across all of our banners, representing 10.5% of total sales in the quarter up from 7% in the prior year.","Our ongoing efforts to enhance our digital content infrastructure and customer experience resulted in strong double-digit eCommerce growth in the quarter across our core North America and UK banners. James Allen grew 13.6%, a sequential slowdown which we expect to continue over the next few quarters as we work through the implementation of sales tax in additional states.","Overall, we are confident in the long-term outlook for James Allen and are continuing to leverage their digital innovation capabilities across our banner website. We continue to invest in newness in the third quarter through ongoing efforts to refresh core assortment in bridal and fashion, while further differentiating each banner with a larger percentage of unique items.","Incremental clearance sales across banners continued in the quarter as part of our strategic effort to make room for new collections ahead of the key holiday season, but at lower levels than in the second quarter. In North America, both our bridal and fashion categories were up in the quarter on the same store sales basis, driven by increased new product sales and incremental clearance sales.","In bridal, we saw strong performance in Disney Enchanted, Love Destiny and Vera Wang at Zales, Neil Lane at Kay and in Solitaires across banners. In fashion, strong results continued in gold, particularly chains and bracelets with diamond earrings and pendants also performing well. North America watch sales increased while beads declined due to the strategic decision to exit our owned beads brands at Kay and Zales as well as softness in non-owned bead brand sales at Jared. In the UK, higher sales of prestige watches were offset by lower sales in diamond jewelry and fashion watches. Given the backdrop of the challenging consumer environment, we are seeing increases in promotional activity in the UK marketplace.","Now, I will discuss some of the Signet Path to Brilliance transformation plan priorities we began to implement as part of our three year plan. Beginning with Customer First, as I have discussed previously an important aspect of our transformation plan is clearly differentiating our banner positioning for Kay, Zales and Jared to align with their unique target customer and value proposition. We have started to make progress in modernizing and differentiating the brand equities while making all the brands more relevant to their unique target audiences. You will see a reflection of the diversity of our customer base in this work which underpins Signet's mission to celebrate life and express love for all people and occasions.","Kay's new campaign, Long Live Love positions Kay as the champion of modern love and gratitude, encouraging customers to cherish their meaningful relationships. Jared's Dare to be Devoted positioning encourages customers to celebrate life's greatest devotions with premium jewelry as unique as their love. And Zales' positioning focuses on beautiful style and self-expression, with a bold energetic brand personality. These new positionings have recently been launched in the marketplace for holiday with new holistic marketing plans across linear TV, digital and social using data science to make the campaigns more personalized.","Holiday advertisements are 90% new this season with the remainder comprised of key performers from last year that has been updated to highlight our new merchandize. We have a balanced mix of gifting and promotional spots as well as messaging highlighting specific collections for each banner, including Vera Wang, Disney Enchanted, and Neil Lane. Our holiday plans also include new and enhanced media integration events for each banner. In addition to Creative, we have continued to work on optimizing the quality and targeting of our advertising spend, including improved message timing and banner differentiation.","Turning to product, we have also made progress on refocusing our product assortments, increasing newness and product differentiation by banner through refreshing the core, adding new collections that are exclusive to each banner and continuously enhancing collections with our partners such as Vera Wang. Trends in Jewelry this season include yellow and rose gold, color, diamond encrusted Cuban links and fancy stones. Key items at Kay for holiday include the new Love and Be Loved collection, and new Neil Lane designs including fancy stones.","Zales features an updated Vera Wang Kindred Heart collection, new designs in Vera Wang bridal and an expansion of Disney Enchanted. Jared is featuring higher carat weight and fancy cut diamonds, new Le Vian collection, the diamond fashion Eternity collection and scattered fashion product designs. All banners will have new in-house developed designs focused on the jewelry trends we have identified. In summary, we\u2019ve launched the beginning stages of our Customer First new banner positioning work and differentiated product assortment in the marketplace this holiday. This work will continue to come to life through more initiative in fiscal 2020 and beyond.","Turning to omni-channel, we aim to build the best-in-class mobile experience and drive digital innovation as we progress on our Path of Brilliance. We continue to see encouraging results across our banners driven by higher quality imagery and improve content and faster speeds. Here are few highlights of our omni-channel initiatives. We have launched R2Net Sagoma 360 visualization of 1,000 top selling designs at Kay and jared.com with further expansion to come during the fourth quarter. We are seeing positive results from the enhanced Design Your Ring configurators launched at Kay earlier in the year and most recently at Zales in the third quarter.","Relevant and navigation continue to be a key focus of our content efforts supported by increasing the number of test and faster rollout in mobile. In the third quarter, we fully deployed and successfully tested initiative to enhance customer onsite search results at Kay and Jared, resulting in significant increases in add-to-cart as well as improved conversion rates. This enhancement is now in piloted Zales. We also conducted mobile navigation test across banner sites during the quarter, returning positive results as we transitioned to a more curated easier to shop category selection.","Ahead of the critical high traffic holiday season, we have improved mobile page load speeds and continue to make improvements to our digital infrastructure to enhance the user experience. We have also improved user experience with more customers being served at personalized page on arrival at our website. Speed of checkout enhancement including social sign-on and the ability to save credit cards are significantly reducing the number of steps customers must take to complete the checkout process. Both of these improvements drive higher conversion.","Moving on to culture of agility and efficiency. A key component of our three year transformation plan is to drive out costs customers do not fear or care about in order to lower our cost base and provide funds for reinvestment in growth drivers and enhanced profitability. We are on track to achieve our net cost savings goal with approximately two-thirds of our fiscal 2019 target achieved year-to-date. Our plan to close more than 200 stores in fiscal 2019 is on track and we are also on track with our goal of achieving at least 30% sales transference. New store openings remained disciplined focusing on off mall locations in desirable markets.","Our first James Allen concept store and showroom recently launched in Washington D.C. featuring advances and digital technology and the millennial inspired shopping experience. This store is an opportunity to test new concepts and incorporate innovation in new store design plans for all of our banners. We continue to enhance training for team members across the Company, including new leadership training for managers as well as enhanced training for all store staff to prepare for holiday.","Our training teams developed a four hour interactive payment program training for all Kay and Jared store employees to increase understanding of all of our payment plan options. We expect this investment in training to improve both employee engagement and the consumer experience with our payment programs over time.","Turning to our guidance. For fiscal 2019, we now expect same store sales of flat to up 1%, and non-GAAP EPS of $4.15 to $4.40. Our revised full year sales and earnings guidance reflects incremental promotional efforts planned in the fourth quarter as well as incremental headwinds for the timing adjustment related to our service planned revenue, a more challenging outlook for our UK business, lowered near-term growth at James Allen and continuing unfavorable banner and channel mix effects. Michele will discuss the guidance in detail in her remarks.","To wrap up my comments, we are highly focused on delivering on our plans for the fourth quarter, with the key weeks of the holiday season still ahead of us. The initiatives we are implementing in the fourth quarter will serve as a foundation for our future efforts as we move along our transformation journey. As we move forward with our three year plan, our priority is to improve our financial performance through higher sales growth, real estate optimization, and cost efficiencies while continuing to make investments to achieve higher growth and profitability.","With that, I'll pass the call to Michele for more details on our financial results.","Michele Santana","Thanks, Gina, and good morning everyone. I'll begin with a review of our third quarter results and then move on to our updated fiscal 2019 guidance and our outlook for the fourth quarter. For the third quarter, total sales were $1.2 billion, up 3% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 3.3% on a constant currency basis. Same store sales growth was 1.6% in the quarter, which includes an unfavorable impact on total same store sales of 50 basis points or $6 million related to an accounting adjustment due to the timing of revenue recognized under our service plans. The impact of this adjustment in North America same store sales was 55 basis points.","Revenue from the sale of lifetime extended service plan is recognized based on the underlying customer behavior regarding use of the plans. Our actual claims experience reflects trends in which customers who have purchased the plan are having their jewelry serviced later in the coverage period. As part of our typical quarterly processes, we reviewed our claims experience and determined that we were seeing sufficient movement in trend, to merit a revision to the timing of revenue recognition. As a result, we are now recognizing 55% of the revenue from service plans in the first two years of the coverage period versus 58% previously.","However, by year five, we are still recognizing more than 75% of revenue, which is consistent with the revenue recognition pattern we previously applied. The total recognition period, which is a maximum of 17 years, has not changed. While this revision was identified as part of our normally quarterly processes, it is an infrequent adjustment. We anticipate the change in revenue recognition rate will continue to have an unfavorable year-over-year impact on our revenues, same-store sales, and operating profit until we lap this adjustment at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2020.","Inclusive of the impact of the service plan revenue timing adjustment, our third quarter same-store sales were sequentially in line with second quarter results against an easier prior year comparison. A key driver of the sequential trend is a 115 basis point swing in the impact of the changes in timing of promotions with an unfavorable 75 basis point impact in the third quarter versus a 40 basis point favorable impact in the second quarter.","Incremental clearance sales were a smaller contributor to sales in the third quarter at a 165 basis points versus 240 basis points in the second quarter. Additionally, James Allen and UK performance slowed sequentially for reasons Gina discussed in her remarks. The third quarter is also our smallest dollar quarter of the year, and as a result, revenue drivers can have a larger impact on growth rates in this quarter versus other quarters.","Items which did not impact same-store sales but impacted total revenue dollars included the following four items; first, the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard which contributed $27 million in sales; second, a calendar shift of weeks in the quarter following our 53rd week fiscal year, which was an unfavorable impact of $9.5 million; third, an unfavorable impact of store closures of $26.5 million partially offset by new store openings; and fourth, foreign exchange unfavorability of $3.5 million.","Moving on to margins; the gross margin rate was 31.1% in the quarter, up 330 basis points year-over-year. Transformation cost savings and lower store occupancy costs due to closed stores offset unfavorable mix, including higher clearance sales. Additional factors that impacted the gross margin rate includes the following five items; first, gross margin benefited by 350 basis points as we no longer recognize bad debt expense or late charge income due to the completion of our credit outsourcing.","Second, the decision to cease offering credit insurance mid-year in fiscal 2018 unfavorably impacted the third quarter margin rate by 40 basis points. Third, the impact of the addition of James Allen, which carries a lower gross margin rate unfavorably impacted the rate by 30 basis points. Fourth, an unfavorable 30 basis points impact related to the timing shift of revenue on service plans. And lastly, a positive impact of 20 basis points related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard including higher revenue sharing payments associated with the prime credit outsourcing arrangements.","SG&A expense was 34.4% of sales in the quarter compared to 32.5% in the prior year quarter. Total SG&A dollars were up by $34 million over the prior year quarter. The primary drivers of increased SG&A were the following three factors which were somewhat offset by transformation cost savings; first, $36 million in credit outsourcing cost partially offset by $10 million in savings related to in-house credit operations for a net increase of $26 million; second, $16 million in higher advertising; and third, $5 million in higher incentive compensation.","Other operating income declined by $72 million, as expected, compared to prior year, due primarily to a loss of interest income as a result of the outsourcing of credit. Our GAAP operating loss of $49 million included the impacts of $9.5 million in restructuring charges related to store closure cost, severance and professional fees associated with our transformation plan, and $0.4 million in transaction costs related to credit outsourcing.","On a non-GAAP basis, excluding charges, the operating loss was $38.9 million. As we mentioned in our press release, the primary year-over-year drivers of the decline in operating income were a $46 million unfavorable impact from the outsourcing of credit as well as unfavorable banner mix; unfavorable impact of the timing shift on revenue recognized on service plans; planned investments in advertising and higher incentive compensation, partially offset by transformation cost savings.","GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.74 and a non-GAAP EPS was a loss of $1.06. Non-GAAP EPS reflected a tax rate benefit of 5.7% versus our guidance of 8% to 10%, which was a negative $0.03 impact versus the midpoint of the tax rate guidance. The lower tax rate is primarily driven by pre-tax earnings jurisdictional mix.","And now I'd like to briefly touch on our payment plan performance. As you are aware, we experienced some operational issues with respect to our transition to an outsourced model, which began in late October of 2018. We have largely mitigated the operational issues associated with this transition with many metrics performing in line with pre-outsourcing trends in the third quarter.","Prior to the outsourcing, we were experiencing declines in application volumes. Current application volume trends are now back in line with pre-outsourcing trends with declines in applications driven by traffic trends, real estate portfolio mix and e-commerce sales mix. In the third quarter, the North America payment plan participation rate was 53.3% versus the prior year quarter of 55.2%, a decline of 190 basis points. The participation rate decline was primarily driven by lower application volumes.","We remain focused on driving traffic to our stores and optimizing performance within the payment structure, including both credit and leasing options. However, we do expect application volumes to remain a headwind in the upcoming quarters. Also, as a reminder, our payment plan participation rate is typically lower on an absolute basis in the fourth quarter versus earlier quarters in the fiscal year as the fourth quarter is a larger dollar sales quarter with a higher mix of gifting transactions.","So, moving on to cash flow; year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow excluding the proceeds from the credit transaction was negative $225 million, reflecting lower operating income and investment in inventory. The third quarter is typically our highest inventory level seasonally and also reflects our strategy to exit low price owned bead brands and increase investments in bridal and certain fashion collection.","We do expect to reduce inventory levels in the fourth quarter, although not below prior year-end levels. Inventory was somewhat offset by higher payables in the quarter. Capital expenditures declined by $73 million year-to-date as we lowered our store count.","Moving on to guidance; we are raising our fiscal 2019 same-store sales guidance to reflect the performance in the third quarter and our latest view of the fourth quarter. Our fiscal 2019 total revenue guidance is $6.26 billion to $6.31 billion and we now expect same-store sales to be flat to up 1% for the year.","Now, embedded in our fiscal 2019 same-store sales guidance is a negative 20 basis points related to the timing shift of the service plan revenue that I had discussed earlier. Our net cost savings guidance remains unchanged at $85 million to $100 million in fiscal 2019 and $200 million to $225 million over three years.","With respect to credit outsourcing, our guidance assumes an unfavorable year-over-year operating profit impact related to credit outsourcing of $152 million to $156 million for fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2020, we continue to expect year-over-year impact on operating income ranging from zero to a benefit of $5 million.","Our narrowed fiscal 2019 non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $4.15 to $4.40 is inclusive of an updated normalized tax rate assumption of 3% to 4%. Our guidance also embeds $485 million in share repurchases, which was completed in the second quarter as well as an updated view of year-over-year increases in incentive compensation of approximately $41 million versus $50 million previously.","Our GAAP EPS guidance of a loss of $7.40 to $7.07 includes impairment and restructuring charges as well as a loss on the sale of the non-prime receivables. For the fourth quarter, we expect total sales of $2.17 billion to $2.22 billion, same store sales of down 1.5% to up 1%, and a non-GAAP EPS of $4.35 to $4.59. Fourth quarter revenue dollars, operating income and EPS will be impacted by the lack of an additional week in the current quarter versus fiscal year 2018, which had a 53rd week.","Our fourth quarter same-store sales outlook incorporates a negative 30 basis points related to the timing shift of service plan revenue. Additional factors impacting our fourth quarter same-store sales outlook are; a 40 basis point estimated positive impact of a Zales and Peoples' promotion event that ran in the third quarter of last year moving to the fourth quarter this year, promotional environment headwinds in the US and UK, and some continued impacts of sales tax implementation at James Allen.","Additionally, we are modeling that the current trends in lower credit application volumes continue in the fourth quarter. Importantly, as Gina discussed earlier, we continue to expect unfavorable channel and banner mix effect on operating profit performance in the fourth quarter.","With respect to gross margin, we expect our gross margin rate to improve on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter. Gross margin rate in the fourth quarter will continue to be positively impacted as we no longer recognize bad debt expense and will also reflects promotional environment and mix headwinds.","SG&A in the fourth quarter is expected to be higher year-over-year, reflecting higher advertising and incentive compensation, as well as higher credit costs due to the transition to a fully outsourced model. Also note that the year-over-year increases in incentive compensation are more heavily weighted in the fourth quarter given the level of revenue and profit generation.","We estimate the total year-over-year credit outsourcing impact on operating income to be modest in the fourth quarter with benefit of no longer recognizing bad debt expense and higher revenue share, offset by higher SG&A and a lower finance income. As a reminder, we lapped the prime credit outsourcing at the end of the third quarter. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance of $4.35 to $4.59 excludes expected restructuring charges of $30 million to $35 million related to our Path to Brilliance plan and embeds a normalized tax rate of 3% to 4%. GAAP EPS guidance inclusive of these charges is $3.02 to $3.33.","Moving on to leverage, we continue to expect to exceed the high-end of our 3.0 to 3.5 times target leverage ratio in fiscal 2019 as we begin our transformation, but expect to be back within that range before the end of the three-year transformation plan. As a reminder, approximately $400 million of our debt is unsecured notes with a fixed rate through 2024, which will not be subject to rising interest rates.","To close out my comments, as Gina mentioned earlier, we are very focused on delivering our fourth quarter results with December being the largest month of the quarter and our fiscal year and we'll continue to build on the progress we have made to date under our Signet Path to Brilliance transformation.","Also, as a reminder, we will be issuing our holiday sales results in a press release on January 17th and will not be hosting a conference call. We plan to provide our outlook for fiscal 2020 when we report our full year results in March.","And with that, we are now ready to start our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rick Patel with Needham & Company. Your line is open.","Steve Lengel","Hi, this is Steve Lengel on for Rick Patel. Can you talk about gross margins for the underlying jewelry business? When you exclude the impact of credit and James Allen, how did margins perform and what is the outlook?","Michele Santana","Yes. So I think what we talked in terms of the prepared remarks, what the drivers were in terms of the gross margin rate for the third quarter and then also in the prepared remarks, we gave you some commentary on how to think about the gross margin rate for the fourth quarter. Part of those comments we did call out that James Allen, which does have a lower gross margin rate does have an unfavorable impact in terms of our gross margin. Outside of that, we don't get into talking in terms of jewelry or category gross margin rates.","Steve Lengel","Can you also talk about the tax rate beyond this year? We understand it was supposed to be reset a little bit higher than this year's rate, but given credit outsourcing and other things going on, is there any way to provide a rough ballpark of how we could -- how we can model that next year?","Michele Santana","Yes, so what I'd tell you and as I said, when we do deliver our full year results in March, that's when we'll really provide you the guidance and the outlook for 2020. But going back to previous comments that we have made as it relates to our tax rate post our fiscal '19, we said that we expect that tax rate to move closer to the US corporate tax rate of 21%.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Oliver Chen","Regarding promotions and balancing promotions versus traffic, what would you say is the biggest opportunity in terms of the banners and the promotional levels over time and how do you expect this environment to evolve into next year. Kay was also impressive in terms of the sequential improvement. Would love your thoughts on what you're most encouraged about Kay as well?","Gina Drosos","So, I'll take your questions in order. As you know, we've been trying to moderate discounting while we've been improving our product offering, our marketing and our value equation across all of our banners. But the Q4 is always a competitive quarter and we're seeing our competition, especially department stores with increased discounting and layering of discounts. And so it's our desire to make sure that we stay competitive in the quarter and drive top line sales.","What I think is really moving in our favor is the repositioning of our brand banners to create more differentiation and help customers understand what we stand for, to build that trust relationship. Secondly, really increasing the new products that we're bringing and building the brands that we have within our banners, a strong Neil Lane focus in Kay, for example; strong Vera Wang and Disney focus within Zales is important in that mix. And then I think over time, just making sure that we're getting the right targeting of our advertising and our media for gifting and for bridal within the mix.","Oliver Chen","And on the Kay side, what are some of the key factors that you're excited about and would also love your thoughts on mobile, given the tremendous traffic trends we're seeing in mobile at large and what do you think your organization needs? James Alan is really ahead of the curve and you've done a really good job synergizing with those capabilities.","Gina Drosos","So, we are encouraged by the stabilization in Kay. We'd attribute that to several things. One is of course coming out of the operational issues that we experienced with credit last year. We've done a lot of work over the course of this year to really improve those processes and get the right kind of training in place for our store associates. Beyond that, we are encouraged by early signs on some of the new items that we put into Kay; some beautiful designs on the Love and Be Loved collections.","I mentioned some of the exciting things that we're bringing also on Neil Lane. So I think product is definitely playing a role in that. And then we have some of the highest-scoring advertising that we've had for any of our brands on Kay this holiday season and so we're feeling good about the messaging and how we focus that messaging. Even tonight, you'll see some good NFL integrations coming on Kay. We've really done some great work on leveraging our media spend in a more targeted and more differentiated way across our banners.","But it will take some time. I think this is a major transition, transformation that we're making and so it's going to take some time to get all of the different levers right, but we've at least gotten some of those foundational ones in place for the fourth quarter and we'll continue to be agile about how we learn about that going forward.","In terms of mobile, that's been a key driver of our e-commerce trends. We saw some very strong results on e-commerce, again in the third quarter, which we're pleased about. We've been focused all year along on mobile, as the key effort there are faster load times, more curated shopping experience, more personalized pages and we always are clear that we think that the combination of a strong e-commerce experience with our store footprint creates a competitive advantage of omni-channel because we know that customers have an integrated shopping journey. They're back and forth between mobile and an in-store experience before they make their purchases, especially in the bridal category.","The James Allen is exciting. I'll be attending our grand opening of our first store there tomorrow. It really is an incubator for us where we'll be testing a number of different digital innovation initiatives and will continue the focus that we've had on being able to roll out our James Allen technologies across our other banners because that's been a big positive for us in this fiscal year.","Operator","And your next question comes from Brian Tunick with RBC. Your line is open.","Brian Tunick","Was curious about the credit participation rate and the lower credit application trends and how much of an impact that had on your year-to-date or this quarter's comp trends? And just wondering, what are some proactive initiatives you can take to try to positively impact those metrics? And then my second question would be on the all the exciting omni-channel initiatives you've been talking about. Is there any view or updated view, I guess, of the portfolio regarding the different banners and maybe some idea of what you think the ideal store base should look like and\/or if you want to talk about maybe how store closings or lease obligations look for the next year or two.","Michele Santana","Yes. So maybe I'll start with the first part of the question on the credit and then Gina you can take the second part of the question. So, in relation to the participation rate, as we said on our call that we did see a decline of a 190 basis points, what I'd say Brian is, we are very pleased in the fact that; one, we are able to offer the full spectrum of the payment plans that we've talking about that really do meet the variety of our customer needs. We also spend a lot of time in the quarter that we noted on the call related to doing training with our store associates that I think was hugely received and we just need to continue to build the muscle as it relates to the payment plans that we offer.","When we think about the decline that we saw in the participation rate, I had also mentioned that the primary driver behind that was really the lower in-store application volumes, pretty consistent with the decline that we had saw pre-conversion, and we also had called out we do expect some continuing headwinds as it relates to the application volumes associated with declining traffic trends in the store as well as shift between e-commerce and off-mall channels. Do you want to take the second part?","Gina Drosos","Yes, and I think I think on real estate, we continue to look at this as an omni-channel customer experience, so optimizing our real estate store footprint. At the same time, we're really building up our mobile experience digitally. We have already announced that we are on track to close more than 200 stores in fiscal 2019 that comes on top of over 200 stores last year. So this has been a significant optimization effort. The closures that we have coming will be primarily mall-based skewed to lower traffic C&D malls and continuing to focus on exiting our regional banners and the majority of those store closings will occur late in this fiscal year, post-holiday.","Brian Tunick","And how about a perspective over the next few years, from a store banner perspective or even for next year, could we expect a similar amount of store closings?","Gina Drosos","We haven't guided to the store closings in fiscal 2020 yet, but definitely as part of Path to Brilliance, we remain very agile and focused on optimizing our omni-channel experience, which means always taking a look at our real estate portfolio, making sure we think we've got the right number of stores in the right places and testing new store footprints and experiences as well.","That's one of the benefits that I mentioned of the James Allen, is our ability to think about the future store experience that we think is right for our jewelry customers. We did say when we guided Path to Brilliance originally that we expect for our store count to be lower by the end of our three-year transformation than we will be in fiscal 2019.","Operator","Your next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Simeon Siegel","Gina, just given the comments around the promotional environment, can you contextualize your view on AUR for 4Q and into next year? I guess just maybe touching on, so you had the past two quarters of clearance, you talked about 4Q promotions, but then maybe any thoughts on De Beers pricing. And then you, on the flip side, mentioned bring in Premium Diamonds, so maybe just reflecting on that and maybe the path to stabilizing AUR. And then Michelle, just recognizing the moving pieces within credit and then the savings from Path to Brilliance. So just, can you help us thinks through what SG&A dollars should grow in 4Q, and then any color you want to share into next year?","Gina Drosos","So, let me start with why transaction value is up in the third quarter despite clearance. So, number one, our average transaction value in North America was up about 4.5% and this reflects the impacts of both our banner and our product mix. Beads were a large number of low priced transactions in the prior year and our strategic decision to exit our own brands.","This provides a lift to our average transaction value when these become a small percentage of that mix. I also mentioned that we're seeing trends and strong sales in gold across our lines. So as we're replacing beads with gold as the key fashion category and up-weighting our diamond offerings in our stores, larger carat weights, more fancy stones, that has an impact and bridal sales were up in the quarter. So the combination of those two things, gave us a higher ATV in the quarter.","I'd also comment that as we talked about the unfavorable impacts that we see in the fourth quarter, one of those is revenue recognition on our ESP. Another is our UK performance, that's a bit weaker driven by a tough macro consumer environment there, slower growth on James Allen, and the North America competitive environment is meaningful, but is less than half of the revision that we're talking about. So hopefully that gives you some context.","Michele Santana","The only thing I'll add on to that Simeon and then I'll answer your SG&A question, I think as part of your question, you had asked about the De Beers action and it really the very low quality of diamonds that are subject to that -- to those pricing actions. It's just not material to our part of the assortment. And then in terms of -- I think what you were looking for was maybe some additional direction on SG&A in Q4, if I understood the question.","Simeon Siegel","Yes, Please.","Michele Santana","So, we expect SG&A to be higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We expect to see higher year-over-year advertising, consistent with what we've been discussing this past year, we do expect to see higher year-over-year incentive compensation expense with more of that annual increase in incentive comp that is booked in Q4. Just given the level of revenue and profit generation that occurs in the fourth quarter, it's more heavily weighted there. That also does incorporate the impact of cost related to our-- to the non-prime credit outsourcing.","And I think if you go back in the release, you can also see how we've guided that impact in total for Q4. And then, the last thing I would call out as you think about SG&A is, again some of those higher cost that we're talking about will be partly offset by transformation cost savings as well as a lack of a 53rd week this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Could you just provide some more contexts around the James Allen sales slowdown? What you saw in the states that have implemented the sales tax and then any initiatives that you have in place to try to bring that business back up to the growth rate that you had initially expected?","Gina Drosos","Sure, I'll start on that and Michele, you can fill in any details. So, during the third quarter, we began to implement sales tax in a number of markets. This of course comes out of the Wayfair their decision and so we're pursuing that on James Allen as we should and we're testing a variety of customer initiatives and sales growth actions at James Allen as we implement the sales tax collection.","We've also been very clearly keeping track of the impact that we think that's having on sales in markets where our competition has also implemented sales tax already and where they haven't as well as how consumers are thinking about online sales on James Allen or other online retailers relative to brick and mortar, so we're taking a very holistic view of it.","And, in the third quarter, we started collecting sales tax in an additional 24 states such that by the end of the third quarter, sales tax was being collected in states representing about 50% of our revenues. We'll continue to roll out that sales tax collection over the next couple of quarters and make sure that we are understanding, which of the initiatives that we're putting in place are having the best customer impact.","So we remain positive about the future outlook for James Allen and we are continuing to leverage all of the digital innovation coming out of James Allen across the rest of our banners as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Ike Boruchow","Two questions, first one on the gross margins for holiday, appreciate Gina the information you gave about the competitiveness of department stores and what not. Just kind of curious maybe, Michele, is there any color you can give us on the gross margin line explicitly for Q4? You were really helpful for Q3 bucketing all the impacts, just some help on how to think about how those promotions maybe impact the gross margin line? And any of the other buckets we should be modeling for Q4?","Michele Santana","Yes. So I guess some color in terms of how to think about the gross margin in the fourth quarter. All in, we do expect the gross margin rate to improve on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter. Consideration that will be impacting that rate on a positive basis, we'll no longer be recognizing the bad debt expense. That also, when we think about our gross margin rate for the fourth quarter with it being up year-over-year, does take into consideration the promotional environment that Gina was talking about, as well as the banner and channel mix that we do see as being headwinds.","The discontinuation of credit insurance, we've been talking about that for a few quarters. That is fully lapped in Q4, so we don't see any impact year-over-year on the gross margin rate associated with that. The other thing that we've been discussing impacting the gross margin rate is James Allen. So we do expect that to -- we'll continue to have a lower gross margin rate versus our other core banners. But as you would expect, the impact on the total gross margin will be smaller in the fourth quarter versus previous quarters as we'll now have fully lapped the acquisition date.","Clearly, what I would also add is, I wouldn't be looking at the Q4 gross margin rate increase year-over-year to be as high as what we just went through in terms of our Q3 results. Keep in mind, bad debt will not be as big of a driver in that rate in Q4 as what we saw in Q3. So hopefully that gives you some additional color.","Ike Boruchow","Yes that helps, and then just two quick follow-ups to that question. Shouldn't there be clearance sales benefits to comp in Q4 that we should think about? And then, is the promotional commentary, is that broad-based or since you're mentioning department stores, is that more of a Kay and a Zale consideration relative to Jared?","Michele Santana","Yes. So, in terms of clearance, we're not going to provide the levels, but what I would tell you is that there's always some level of clearance that in our business -- including the fourth quarter, we do expect clearance to be higher than last year's fourth quarter and that's just embedded in the estimate of the sales guidance and the EPS guidance that we provided as well as that the gross margin commentary that we've just talked about. And promotional environment, I would just think that as broad across the banners.","Operator","Next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Omar Saad","I wanted to follow up on some of your comments about faster design, more newness, product introduction across the different banners. Maybe elaborate on how fast you can get products and designs to market, how often you can reintroduce new product collections and maybe how you're approaching the different banners differently as you build out these capabilities and skillsets around it and any anecdotal signs that these efforts are resonating with the consumer would be really helpful too, if there is a greater response to newness?","Gina Drosos","Sure. So, one of the things that we've really put in place over the last year is an enhancement in our in-house design team. I mentioned, I think maybe in our second quarter call that we brought on a New Chief Merchant to help lead our efforts both in working externally with vendors, but also in creating our own designs, and we also have created a system where we're very consumer-led on looking first at trends, interpreting those trends, and then developing designs that we think will really capture customers' hearts and minds regarding that trends.","So a good example on the trends would be the Love and Be Loved collection. It's really well-targeted to Kay's banner positioning, which is all about celebrating meaningful relationships. It's a design that represents two lives kind of intertwined together. Very sleek, modern looking design developed by our in-house design team and developed in about -- let's say five months from the initial testing and qualification of that concept through to execution in the marketplace. So, this consumer-led approach is allowing us to go a bit faster.","We've also really stepped up our work with our partners. That's why we have such good new product on Vera Wang both in fashion and bridal this holiday season as well as Disney, which has really been a success driver for Zales. So there's product on both bridal and fashion in both of those. And then I think in Jared and those make, by the way, a lot of sense for Zales given the positioning to a more style-oriented customer.","And then in Jared we've done a lot of work on our diamond value proposition and really making sure that we have premium high quality designs, unique designs, certainly capturing the customer trend toward more customization and uniqueness. So Jared is really playing in a distinctive place there, with a lot of the new products that we've put in. But, in general, that new product has been higher, more driven by trends, higher level of qualification with customers and faster speed to market from the initial idea through to actually seeing it in stores.","Omar Saad","That's really helpful. Can you give us a sense maybe of how the mix has shifted, you know for a few -- a few years ago to today, how much more you would count in that kind of newness category, is that quantifiable?","Gina Drosos","Yes. So it's up from, call it in the 20s as a percentage of our sales to now over 30% of our sales, given the newness that we've been able to put in and that is as expected, based on our customer testing results, we've got some exciting product in our stores now.","Operator","Your last question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Paul Lejuez","For a couple of quarters now, you mentioned the benefit to comps from incremental clearance sales. I'm just trying to understand how do you use that term incremental? Is that relative to last year? Is it relative to your plan? Or is it a certain type of promotion that when you use that promotion, it falls into that category of incremental. And also curious, if you could talk about what percent of your fourth quarter is already behind us versus what lies ahead?","Michele Santana","So, Paul maybe I'll start. In terms of your clearance question, it is -- when we speak to incremental, it's incremental over last year period. We talked about this, I think in the Q3 call both as we think about those amplified clearance levels, which we did say in Q3 was lower than what it was in the second quarter, it really is -- it goes back to part of our merchandising strategy that we're working to increase the newness to refocus our product portfolio.","It's all of the bridal fashion things that Gina has been talking about that we're trying to do with our product assortment. We will always have a certain level of clearance on our business, but we did make the decision to add incremental clearance to accelerate our strategy on the newness side and free up store space. You're a second question was on?","Paul Lejuez","November, as a percent of the fourth quarter versus\u2026","Michele Santana","Yes what I said, we don't break it out in terms of a percentage. I believe in my prepared remarks, I made the comment that December is the largest month of the quarter in the fiscal year, but we don't provide the percent of the month.","Paul Lejuez","Got you and on that, you said the third quarter impacts from clearance sales was less than 2Q, what's the plan for 4Q relative to the 3Q? Should we expect a lower benefit from clearance sales?","Michele Santana","Yes, so as you would expect we're not quantifying it, because it's all factored into our guidance. It goes back to, there's always some level of clearance that we do have in our business. I did mention earlier, I think there was a question on this that we do expect clearance to be higher than last year's fourth quarter. But as we said, Paul, it's all reflected in our guidance that we provided.","Gina Drosos","I think it's also dependent on how customer shopping trends evolve throughout the quarter. We have a great mix of full priced product as well as clearance product in our stores and we'll see how customers gravitate.","Paul Lejuez","Are there any particular categories that have been the driver of those clearance sales?","Michele Santana","No, I wouldn't call out any particular category.","Michele Santana","Thank you.","Gina Drosos","Thank you.","Operator","And this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
