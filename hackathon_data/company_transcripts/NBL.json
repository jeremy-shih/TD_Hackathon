Following today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Whitmarsh. Please go ahead.","Brad Whitmarsh","Thanks, Gary, and thank you all for joining us for our first quarter conference call. I hope you've had a chance to review the news release and presentation deck that we published this morning. These materials are available on the Investors page of our website and they highlight strong first quarter performance versus expectations. Later today, we plan to file our 10-Q with the SEC.","I want to remind everyone that today's discussion contains projections and forward-looking statements, as well as, certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures in our latest news releases and SEC filings for a discussion of those items. Following our prepared remarks, we will hold the question-and-answer session. I would ask that analysts limit themselves to one primary and one follow-up and we plan to wrap up in under an hour.","Our planned comments this morning will come from Dave Stover, Chairman and CEO; as well as Brent Smolik, President and COO; Ken Fisher, EVP and CFO; Hodge Walker, SVP of Onshore; and Keith Elliott, SVP of Offshore are here to participate in the Q&A session.","With that, I'll turn the call to Dave.","Dave Stover","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us.","I'm excited to share with you a number of accomplishments already realized during the first quarter, including driving sustainable capital and cost savings and quarterly production ahead of expectations. In fact, our first quarter net organic cash flow was significantly better than the plan we outlined last quarter.","In the earnings release and slides, we have provided detailed information to illustrate our strong level of execution from the beginning of the year. For the third quarter in a row, our total capital came in below expectations with first quarter capital below the low end of the range, due to lower well and facility costs and lower Leviathan spend.","Despite the reduction in capital, we delivered sales volumes above the upper end, upper range of guidance. Operating costs also came in below expectations and these per barrel efficiencies will drive further improvements in profitability.","Going into this year, we set out to drive sustainable cash flow growth by challenging the organization to reduce the capital intensity of our business and deliver more for the same or less capital. As we continue to progress through the year, we expect to build upon these capital efficiency gain. I can say that we're off to a great start with better operational efficiencies across all three onshore basins. Brent will discuss this in more detail, but I'm pleased with the execution of our onshore teams and the efficiency results.","The leadership focus on innovation and continuous improvement, creates the opportunity to decrease the long-term capital needs for the company. Despite the acceleration in oil prices through the first quarter, we remain disciplined.","Our plan was set at a $50 WTI oil price for 2019. We are committed to operate within our budget of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. And as I stated on the year-end call, as commodity prices move higher, we expect to have the ability to further strengthen the balance sheet and return additional cash flow to investors.","In the DJ Basin, our business continues to outperform our expectations. Last month, Colorado passed Senate Bill 181, which provides additional oversight for oil and gas activity at the local level. Through the strategic repositioning of our acreage and state approval of our comprehensive drilling plan, we're well positioned to work with both state and local authorities. We have line of sight to years of activity and are set to execute on our multi-year plan and to build upon our industry-leading returns in the basin.","In Texas, the Delaware Basin has maintained production and growing cash flow, despite a lower activity level and capital outlay for the last three quarters. Our Eagle Ford operations continue to benefit from better base production performance as well as the initial tranche of ducts coming online.","As our U.S. onshore completion activity picks up in the second quarter, we are positioned for a pronounced second half volume ramp, while capital spending trends lower throughout the year.","Before we move to the international assets, I'd like to take a minute to discuss Noble Midstream. Operationally NBLX had another strong quarter. Their service and support of Noble's activities in the DJ and Delaware Basins has been a key to our success.","The NBLX team has built a strong asset base and third-party businesses in both basins. They recently announced the addition of three very attractive assets the EPIC Y-grade and crude interests and the Delaware Crossing pipeline to Wink Texas, which support Permian growth, while assisting our upstream development.","You may have seen that we filed an 8-K last week to disclose an ongoing strategic review of our midstream assets. This is consistent with our earlier disclosures and our practice of continually evaluating all options to create an increase value.","Our midstream assets within Noble and NBLX are very valuable. And we do not believe this is sufficiently reflected by the markets for either entity. As we evaluate potential scenarios, we will keep in mind the investor sentiment around MLP structure and IDRs. I won't speculate on the potential outcomes. However, Noble as the largest unit holder in NBLX has a vested interest in the success of both entities.","Turning to our international business. We outlined goals this year to maximize cash flows of our existing businesses, while progressing our major project developments that Leviathan and Alen. Operationally, it was a strong quarter for both our Equatorial Guinea and Israel operations.","In the Eastern Med, volumes continue to outperform through higher domestic demand. With Leviathan now 81% complete, the project remains on time and on budget. With the platform, getting ready to set sail in the summer.","Bringing Leviathan online, will provide another source of gas in the growing domestic and regional demand centers. In West Africa, the team delivered volumes above expectations. We sanction the Alen gas monetization project, which we see as the first step in creating an offshore natural gas hub in the area.","I'm excited about the potential for decades of incremental sustainable cash flow through the backlog of discovered resources in this area. With Leviathan and Alen, Noble Energy has a unique opportunity to access global natural gas markets and drive further high margin, cash flow growth internationally.","Over the last few years, we've also been focused on building an exploration portfolio of high quality drilling opportunities. Our teams have targeted matured low cost material opportunities both on and offshore. I'm excited to be able to talk about our recent entry in Colombia, where we are operator with 40% working interest on two offshore blocks with Shell. We will likely test a prospect in 2020.","Additionally, our onshore exploration team has captured over 140,000 acres of low cost material exploration inventory in two Wyoming basins. In 2020 consistent with our multi-year plan, our offshore and onshore exploration programs will begin to test up to 1 billion barrels of net risked exploration inventory.","Overall, I'm extremely pleased with how the company has started 2019. We are well on our way to accomplishing the goal set out earlier this year. We're focused on three key drivers of shareholder value to position Noble as an attractive investment across all sectors.","These are; number one, generating a competitive free cash flow yield with significant return to investors; two, maintaining a strong balance sheet; and three, delivering a 5% to 10% long-term annual production growth rate supplemented by periodic additions of the major projects.","In addition, our high return, high quality opportunities I'm sure our investments drive increasing corporate returns. We are uniquely positioned to our low decline production base and high return opportunity set to deliver these outcomes and create sustainable value growth and return to investors.","Over time, we plan to grow the dividend with cash flows and provide additional opportunistic shareholder returns. To that end, we recently announced an increase to the quarterly dividend of 9%, reflecting the confidence in our cash flow outlook.","Now I'll turn the call over to Brent Smolik, our President and COO, to talk about the operations and the efficiencies gained already in 2019.","Brent Smolik","Thanks Dave, and good morning, everyone.","As Dave mentioned, the first quarter was a strong start to 2019, with good execution globally, across our operations. Our U.S. Onshore business improved capital efficiency coming in under budget on capital and above on first quarter production volumes.","On the international side, the quarter was equally rewarding, where we continue to produce above expectations, progressed Leviathan 81% completion and sanction the Alen gas monetization project.","So I'll begin - little deeper dive this morning with the U.S. Onshore on Slide 5. Our key operational focus in this part of our business has been to improve execution and capital efficiencies. While still early in the year, I'm happy to report that we've made significant strides to streamline cost, create more efficient well designs and increase our pace of execution.","We've accelerated our completion tempo across all three basins with meaningful gains in completion stages per day and total pumping hours per day, while decreasing the transition time between frac stages. The frac hours pump per day increased 5% to 10% in the DJ, Permian and Eagle Ford versus Q4 '18 and that's a meaningful improvement in the quarter.","Our teams also continued to improve drilling efficiencies and delivered a best-in-class pacesetter Permian well in 16 days from spud to rig release for nearly 10,000 foot lateral. In the DJ Basin Row 2 wells at Mustang were drilled 10% faster than Row 1 wells, as we leverage learnings from the 2018 drilling campaign.","There is a cost benefit to those efficiency gains and there is a production benefit because new wells are brought online ahead of schedule. And I expect that momentum to continue in the second quarter. While these results were a good start and we're continuing to look for ways to capture further savings and improved returns.","For example, in the DJ Basin, we continue to test and evaluate frac designs, employing lower fluid volumes, which reduces the pumping time per stage. Successful application of this design can sustainably reduce capital costs and improve well returns. We also plan to test this concept in other basins.","These capital improvements and reduce cycle times puts Noble in a great position to either complete our planned activities quicker for less capital or accomplish more activity within the approved 2019 capital budget. Either option is a positive outcome. We also continue to closely monitor service cost and year-to-date, we've not experienced inflationary pressure in any category in the U.S. Onshore.","Turning specifically to the DJ Basin. Over the past several years, Noble has strategically positioned itself within the basin, we built a high quality contiguous acreage position, which allows for optimal development and we're seeing the results of those efforts.","In the first quarter, the DJ generated record production of 144,000 barrel equivalents per day, up 21% versus the first quarter of 2018. The efforts of our teams to create offtake optionality are paying off by improving the reliability and predictability of gas in NGL sales volumes. This exceptional performance has allowed the DJ to generate cash flow in excess of capital spend and we expect this trend to continue as we efficiently develop the asset.","During the quarter, we brought online our initial wells from the second row of Mustang, which brings Row 1 and Row 2 to nearly 50,000 barrel equivalents per day of gross production and just nine months from the startup of Row 1. These 21 wells were drilled and completed faster than Row 1, an early production trends are in line with Row 1.","With more than half the 29 activity focus in Mustang, we're encouraged that our program will continue to deliver on expectations. As we expected and guided the wells in the western portion of Row 2 produce with higher gas oil ratios. Going forward, we expect the GORs to decrease as we move east and north in the DJ development.","In the second quarter, we'll will have the highest number of TILs planned in the DJ Basin supporting second half 2019 production growth. The company still plans to operate one to two rigs and two frac crews and bring 95 to 100 wells online in the DJ this year.","In the Delaware Basin, production was essentially flat with Q4, despite the announced divestiture and a low TIL count in the first quarter. Well performance remained strong bringing online nine wells with an average 30-day rate of over 1,500 barrel oil equivalents per day. Two of the nine wells were in the Southwest portion of our position adjacent to the recently divested acreage. Excluding those two wells, the average new well production was over 200 barrel equivalents per day for per 1,000 foot of lateral.","As we move forward this year, our near-term plans are primarily focused on executing row style development in our core Reeves County acreage position near our central gathering facilities. We anticipate further improvements as we bring 15 to 20 wells online in Q2. The timing of the second quarter TILs will contribute significantly to third quarter production growth, which aligns well with our EPIC early crude service.","The Permian basins received some recent attention regarding gas transportation and WAHA spot pricing and that issue, does not have a meaningful impact on Noble for several reasons; Permian gas only makes up approximately 1% of our company revenues; we have a firm gas sales agreement in place to move 100% of our gas and NGL volumes out of the basin; and we've had 75% of our 2019 and 2020 WAHA basis.","In the Eagle Ford, we generated significant asset level free cash flow last year and we plan to continue harvesting cash this year. Late in the first quarter, we brought online seven DUCs and thanks to our improved cadence of operations, we've accelerated additional TILs into the second quarter.","We anticipate a slight increase in production volumes in the second quarter before stepping up in the third quarter as a remainder of our DUC inventory comes online. Overall, we're pleased with Q1 performance in the U.S. Onshore business.","Now shifting to offshore. We continue to see strong performance from our producing assets with a great quarter from both Eastern Med and West Africa. In Israel, Tamar continue to exhibit why it's a world-class natural gas asset, again produced a record volumes of over a Bcf per day gross production in Q1.","And the second quarter, we expect slightly lower volumes due to some holiday seasonality, and then we expect third quarter production to be similar to Q1. We expect Tamar production to be essentially flat to 2018 or said another way, no base decline year-over-year.","As Dave mentioned, the Leviathan project is now 81% complete and we achieved a few key milestones in the quarter. We completed the jacket installation, the subsea manifold installation and the subsea pipeline installations as we continue to derisk the project.","The next major operational milestone will be the delivery of the production deck, which is scheduled for mid-year. From a marketing standpoint, the key near-term focus is the EMG pipeline, which will facilitate natural gas sales into Egypt. We're diligently progressing this project and we plan to flow test with gas and complete inspection this month.","Following the flow test, we expect to close on the pipeline purchased by mid-year. What's operational, the pipeline will primarily allow for gas sales from Leviathan and will provide flexibility for gas sales from Tamar.","As we've communicated previously, we expect to sell an average of 800 million cubic feet a day from Leviathan in 2020. We anticipate significant regional demand growth and we're excited that the Noble EMEA gas can satisfy a portion of that growing demand. In West Africa, the sanction of the Alen gas monetization project was the major highlight for the quarter.","The declining production from the Alba field creates capacity at the existing putting Europe plant infrastructure and that capacity creates an unique opportunity to extend the life of the Alba field and to monetize the Alen gas, it's currently re-injected for pressure maintenance. The project capital is estimated to be $165 million net to Noble and we expect the initial sales of LNG and incremental liquids in the first half of 2021.","The economics benefit from global LNG pricing and the project is a significant step forwards towards monetization of over three Tcf of discovered gas in the area. It's also important to note that the governments of E.G. and Cameroon recently completed a pre-unitization agreement, which will further support development of discovered resources.","In the second quarter, we plan to spud the Aseng 6P well, which will further mitigate production declines and assist in reservoir management. This well is expected to begin drilling in June and be online in the third quarter.","Now let me provide some guidance for the second quarter, which is still in line with our previous plans. Capital for the quarter is estimated to be in a range of $675 million to $750 million, with most of the capital spend in the U.S. Onshore and the Eastern Med regions.","Total company sales volumes in the second quarter expected to be between 332,000 and 347,000 barrels oil equivalent, reflecting increasing U.S. Onshore volumes and essentially flat international production. Internationally, we expect our Israel volumes to be down slightly in the second quarter due to Israeli holidays and West Africa volume should increase slightly due to plant Alba maintenance, which was completed in the first quarter, right at the end of March. Full-year production and capital guidance remain unchanged.","Before I wrap up my commentary, I want to just reiterate how pleased I'm with our operational performance and execution. Across our U.S. Onshore and international assets, we saw higher production and a path to lower sustainable cost and we expect to drive efficiencies further across our organization. I expect this operational momentum to continue into the second quarter and throughout the year, as we bring online our highest TIL count in 2019 and the onshore ramp up in the back half of the year.","In West Africa, the Alen gas monetization project will add to the low decline production base and free cash flow profile of our company. And in Colombia, we finalize the exploration opportunity as we seek to build out our inventory of discovered offshore resources.","Slide 15, summarizes some of our Q1 accomplishments and other key 2019 deliverables, which are leading us to year-end and to the defining moment of Leviathan first production.","We'll now open the line for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer","You highlighted a number of the cycle time in capital efficiency improvements in your comments. Do these represent the entirety of the below guidance capital spending for the first quarter or the timing of activity play a role as well? And you mentioned in your comments, Brent, I believe, that you may have a choice to make on more activity for the same budget or same activity for lower CapEx. How would you frame which route to take given the goal of free cash flow?","Brent Smolik","Yes, let me tackle in the order you asked them. So there was a number of things that we benefited from in the first quarter from capital, we definitely have improved efficiencies or shorten cycle times and our drilling and completion and our facility activities. I might get Hodge to comment on that in a moment. But we also had different \u2013 lower discounts that we negotiated with our suppliers. And then there was primarily in the case of the Eastern Med some timing where we delayed some of the \u2013 or the spend will come in the second, third quarters as we move toward first production in Leviathan.","But also remember to offset that, we've accelerated effectively about four, four wells. They're not \u2013 parts of wells, but about four, four wells into the first quarter. So our savings have overcome incremental activity in the U.S. because of the efficiencies and lower cost. So and in terms of how we think about \u2013 at the asset level how we think about the incremental capital is that, if we decide to deploy it, it's going to be based on the merits of the projects that we have in front of us. So based on the safety performance, the well performance, the cost performance, the returns at the well level, we'll debate that how we allocate that capital at the well level between the assets.","Dave Stover","And I think, Brian, just back up and take a higher level view of the cash flow portion, don't forget the way I've laid it out, what we're looking at on incremental cash flows continuing to strengthen the balance sheet or accelerate strengthening the balance sheet shareholder returns. We highlighted that with the dividend increase here just recently. And then we look at the activity and how that plays out.","Brian Singer","And then my follow-up is on industry consolidation and applicability to Noble as you see more of these moves here and the push for scale. Do you think Noble's Permian assets are sufficiently positioned to be industry-competitive with scale? Or do you see the opportunity and\/or need to participate in consolidation in some way in the basin?","Brent Smolik","Well, I think what you've seen us do on the Permian was around getting the scale and consolidated position that's important. I mean, scale and especially a consolidated contiguous position in any basin is important. And I think that was a big driver that helps us to generate very competitive and our expectation drive industry-leading returns over time in the basin based on where the assets are located and how we position that.","So I'd say, we're very comfortable with what we have and the thought process that went into building that, and the quality of what we have, and the results we're seeing there. So I think we're in a good position there and our focus is on continuing to prove the folks that we can get more out of these assets than anybody else.","Operator","The next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram","I wanted to start in the Eastern Med there has been news in the press recently around Jordan and the gas price that underpins the Leviathan export contract. What are your thoughts there? And any potential risk here in terms of the Jordan contract?","Brent Smolik","I think you go back to the Jordan contract that's been a fully executed and binding contract. I think everything that everybody is focused on their and everybody we\u2019re engaged with has been towards moving to first production. So that's been the continued focus from our standpoint. I think there is a lot of anticipation and desire to get this thing on production, Leviathan on production and that's where we're maintaining the focus.","Arun Jayaram","And then my second question is just, I was wondering, Dave if you could help us maybe frame the cash flow potential for Noble for the Alen project. And I did note that the pipe that you're building will be a pretty large pipe and what are some additional opportunities to monetize gas resources that you have in that part of the world?","Dave Stover","Yes, let me, start with that and Brent, can add anything that he wants to. But the Alen project and we rolled out with the sanction some of the parameters around that. One thing, not to forget, there's a number of thing that's important with that project. One, it's the backfill in Punta Europa on the LNG facility and the ability to move gas into a contractual arrangement that provides us access to the global LNG market and a significant portion of that value that our partnership will share in.","The other couple of things to it, there is also not insignificant condensed liquids volume, I'd call it condensate NGLs that will be part of this. And then the third nice value component of this, before we get into the longer-term portion, is that it extends the life of Alba and there is a nice value proposition for the Alba field itself which we get to share in obviously. The second part of that is the longer-term picture of this and we have about three Tcf of discovered gross resources in the region.","And as, Alba field declines over time and more room becomes available in the plant, we'll have the ability now as you said with some of this pre-investment at very little extra cost, to size the pipe to be able to tie in these very close proximity, projects. And Brent may be able \u2013 want to talk a little bit more about how that fits going forward.","Brent Smolik","I think it\u2019s great summary, Dave. The only thing I might add is, if you think about we're backfilling the capacity this opening up from field decline. So to our project early on, it's going to look like a growing wedge of production and cash flows over the first few years. And then it will look like a very long-term stable set of cash flows with relatively low investment rates to bring on the discovery gas. So it's got a very appealing cash flow profile to us.","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold","Couple things, one in the Permian Basin and appreciate giving some capital spend detail by area. It looks like Permian Basin costs have come down to maybe below $10 million, is that right? And is that something you all think could be fairly sustainable or improve going forward?","Brent Smolik","We do Scott, I think your math's right. We talked about targeting $1 million to $1.5 million a well. And we're well on our way to realizing that from the combination of a faster, shorter cycle times, faster operations and lower cost. And so I think, if you think about the type well as a 7,500 foot type well you can use $9.5 million or so per well. And remember some of these will be longer laterals, quite a few will be longer laterals. So we may average above that, but we're \u2013 the message is, we're realizing the cost savings that we targeted.","Scott Hanold","And then you all did identify that you've picked up some acreage in Wyoming now. And it sounds like in a couple different basins is, is there any more specifics you can get on what area you're targeting is that Powder River Basin. Is that Green River Basin, what are you all looking at up there?","Brent Smolik","Yes, I mean we're still doing some leasing. But I can say probably little less than 50% of it in the Powder just to give you some feel. And it's probably about as far as we want to go at this point. What I'd say is we'll probably be ready. I expect we'll be ready to drill a couple wells in both basins next year, so that will give us some good insight.","Scott Hanold","And I would assume you all are targeting in oil, oil play right?","Brent Smolik","Liquids rich plays for sure.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","Michael Hall","Just wanted to I guess maybe get a little bit - just kind of timing of TILs. I think you alluded to 15 to 20 I think in the Delaware, in the second quarter. You also had accelerated TIL schedule in the DJ relative to what we are expecting in the first quarter. And I'm just trying to think through kind of the timing of how those TILs plays out over the rest of the year and how to Q2 and compares to the second half?","Brent Smolik","Yes, I think the best way to summarize it would be the second quarter will be our highest TIL activity for the year that's partly by design. It's also partly because of the increased pace of development this bring, some of those into the quarter.","And then, remember that that there's about a quarter lag generally from when the, you know the production versus the TIL the highest TIL counts. And you can see that even in the charts that we included in the materials, you can see as our TIL count start to increase. The production picks up about a quarter or two later that we get the benefit of it. So first three quarters loaded on completion activity, back half loaded on production profile.","Michael Hall","And just to follow up on that. On the DJ, how many would you expect to see in the second quarter?","Dave Stover","30, we're bringing on about 30 wells in the second quarter in the DJ.","Michael Hall","And that's largely and they are staying still?","Dave Stover","The mix of Mustang, I think we've got some East Pony wells in there also.","Michael Hall","And then I guess, I just wanted to kind of follow up a little bit on Brian's question around scale, just to make sure, I heard you right, I suppose. So like relative to the acreage position you guys - you're going to had assembled post the Clayton Williams deal, obviously with the acreage sale you highlighted this quarter and alluded to last quarter that total acreage position is down somewhat. Are you at all open to continuing to expand that position or at this point is the position as it stands today sufficient from your thinking?","Brent Smolik","So, Michael, a couple of things. Just as a reminder, our current full year pace of development is 50 to 60 wells in the Permian. So we've got plenty of running room. So we don't feel compelled that we have to do something right away.","And as Dave mentioned, our view on it is if we can demonstrate to ourselves into the market that we are the low cost, most efficient, highest productivity, highest per well return operator, then I think that would make sense to everybody that we would be the larger consolidator of it. And so we're not opposed to that, but if we do it, I think you - we'll make the case that we did some day would make the case to you that we're logical operator to do. But we're not compelled to do it, because we're in good shape right now.","Dave Stover","And as Brent said, if we've got over a decade easily of opportunity, high quality opportunity here. And so the focus near term is on the blocking and tackling, the coring up with trades and so forth, like we've done in the DJ in and around our position. So we can have more efficient row development and longer laterals.","Michael Hall","Okay, clear enough. So not in a hurry today but opportunistic, if the environment presented itself.","Dave Stover","I like it, as Brent said, you've got to earn it.","Operator","The next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","I've got a couple. Couple of quick ones hopefully. Dave, you walk through your thoughts on NBLX and I understand you probably don't want to elaborate too much, but assuming you did generate a reasonable amount of cash out of that in some form or another. How would you describe your priority for use of cash in terms of whether it be buyback or other users if you could consider?","Dave Stover","Well, yes, I'm not going to speculate obviously on anything with NBLX because all kinds of ways that can play out has a tremendous value there. But I think in general, when we look at incremental cash flow, I tie it back to what I said previously where it's accelerating strengthening of the balance sheet, returning additional value to shareholders, whether it's through dividend increase, the sustainable cash flow increases or opportunistic buybacks, things like that. And then, those are really the two at the top of the list for us.","Doug Leggate","I thought, I'd give a go Dave. I wonder if could just dig a little bit on the midstream, - sorry, on the cost guidance, the midstream element of this marketing. I think it's like kind of legacy liability. I wonder if I can ask, Ken, maybe just to walk us through what the mitigating options are for you to maybe eliminate that cost over trend. My guess is, it's related to some legacy Marcellus issues, but obviously there is other ways for you to offload that at some point. I just want to get a handle as to what will happen to those costs going forward?","Ken Fisher","Yes, Doug. This is Ken. In the quarter we offloaded about $350 million of transport commitment to Southwestern at about 100,000 MMBTU a day from 2021 to 2032 we recorded a liability for that of $92 million. And so that commitment and transport cost that transfers to the counterparty. So going forward, we'll continue to work that balance and probably the cost is in the range of $30 million a quarter this year of transport commitment that we'll continue to work to mitigate.","Dave Stover","The good news is, Doug, that a lot of that transports located in parts of the world where from time-to-time it's going to be valuable. So that's going to give us options like we had in the first quarter.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate that. I wonder if I could squeeze just one really last quick one. And it's just when you get the East Med gas pipeline up and running. I'm just wondering if - can you maybe give was the prognosis as to what that does to the line of sight on further expansions in Israel going forward? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Keith Elliott","Yes, Doug. I think the way to think about the further expansions in Israel is really focused on selling out the full capacity of Leviathan. So if you think about it right now, we've kind of got the 900 million a day contracted there and that's against the 1.2 Bcf a day capacity.","So think about 300 million a day of essentially free capacity to be expanded by accessing additional contracts, expect those contracts are most likely you need, but certainly we're seeing demand across all three of the major markets that we're in there Israel, Jordan, as well as Egypt. So watch this space.","Dave Stover","Yes, I think, I'll just add on little. I think, as we've talked in the past. Our objective here is probably to contract maybe around 1 Bcf a day and not the full 1.2 Bcf a day. I think when Leviathan comes online, we're going to be very pleased with the fact that we've got a little more capacity there, because it will be interesting to see how quickly some of this demand ramps up pretty fast as Keith said, when you talk to the customers and you look at what's going on in the area. My expectation will see that capacity demand fill up pretty quickly after we start getting things online and get a year or so into this.","Doug Leggate","Seems you've got a lot of low cost options Dave, going forward to that. Thanks a lot.","Dave Stover","The other thing, I'd add it's very similar to the discussion we had in Alen is that we start off at an average of 800 million a day next year as that market demand grows, that's going to look like an inclining production profile and set of cash flows. So I think that's the long-term huge competitive advantage for us.","Operator","The next question comes from Irene Haas with Imperial. Please go ahead.","Irene Haas","I'm happy to see you guys going back offshore again. So I have one question on your offshore Colombia project, which is on the Caribbean coast and it comes in five parts, any existing discovery on trend? Number one, number two is this production sharing contract and what's your minimal ore commitment. How much it cost to drill the first well? And then also how many years of delineation and ultimately with the infrastructure build - would it be a FPSO type situation when it comes to development?","Dave Stover","Yes, I'm not sure, I got all of those, Irene, I'll try with some of this. But it's a - what we're excited about here is, it's a opportunity that we've been working on for a period of time here. And to get in, with a high quality partner or joint venture, co-venture as Shell, I think will work well for us. We've matured this thing enough to whether it will be ready to drill next year, probably half of the total depth is in water. So I don't remember the actual cost per se. But it's a reasonable cost for a prospect with a high geologic chance factor. I think the geologic chance factor is probably 40% or more.","And so I think the big thing that we'll be looking at here is, liquid versus gas type of a thing, I think, we think there is a very good case to be made based on our regional view, our seismic understanding and some of the analysis of other items in the area that this could be a very high likelihood of an liquid project. And it creates the opportunity with success to derisk other opportunities, just like we've done in the Eastern Med and West Africa.","So it ties in very well with the types of things we've been successful in the past, and it gives us an opportunity for something that's relatively low risk, fairly decent chance of hydrocarbons and something that could be very material with some success here. I don't know if I answered all of those or even a part of those type of things, but that kind of explains why we're there and what we're looking for, and I'm excited to get chance to drill it next year.","Irene Haas","I have a follow-up. Are there any discovery of fields on trend offshore there?","Dave Stover","Not specifically tied into this what we call this depositional environment, I think if you go further South, if I remember right. There is some gas down there. So there's hydrocarbon indicators, if you will, but based on our analysis and our thermogenic review of this and so forth. We think there is still a pretty decent likelihood that this is going to be more of a liquid play. That's our target objective.","Operator","The next question comes from Welles Fitzpatrick with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Welles Fitzpatrick","But I'm not going to ask on any predictions on NBLX obviously, but is there any way we could get an update on an approximate cost basis of the assets NBL given the distribution stream?","Dave Stover","No, I don't think here.","Welles Fitzpatrick","Fair enough. Thought I would give it a shot.","Dave Stover","Good try.","Welles Fitzpatrick","Then so Weld County on Monday they obviously move towards designating unincorporated wells as a local control County area. Does that you are you guys still looking at additional CDPs you don't already have in progress or does that basically derisk the regulatory environment enough yours acreage?","Dave Stover","Well, I think you saw the impact of our first CDP and so we're continuing to look at, if there are some areas that makes sense to pull another CDP together. Again that really only works when you've got the highly contiguous large positions like we've pulled together over time. So I think all that work to consolidate our acreage position stay in rural areas is going to payoff significantly. As we move forward and that may provide the opportunity to have another CDP or so over time here.","Brent Smolik","Yes this is Brent. As Dave mentioned in his in his comments, I think that our objective is to be able to extend our planning horizon, as long as we can and get ahead of any of the regulatory changes that are going on and be prepared to be able to work effectively at all levels of government and regulatory bodies.","Operator","The next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles Meade","I just have one question, can you give us a little bit more detail on the quarterly CapEx specially for the Leviathan specifically I imagine that lot of the CapEx is up the 2019 CapEx is behind us with all the subsea work that's been done. But I wanted to just check, that assumption to get an idea of how it's going to progress 1Q, 2Q, 3Q, 4Q?","Dave Stover","We have an updated Charles on the full year yet. We guided to 500 \u2013 we commented 500 million to 550 million for the year.","Charles Meade","Right.","Dave Stover","The next big update the logical next update time would be when we install the production index. That's a big events, it\u2019s a big lift and once we get those in place. We'll have a better estimate and that'll be third quarter time we'll be able to tidy up everything for the year. But hopefully picked up on all of our comments and all phases, we're on track on the project.","Brent Smolik","I think, behind the scenes, some of the things are doing on the function testing, getting things ready to tie in. If you go back and remember why did tomorrow come on so well and so reliable was all the function testing that was done before you even hooked everything up on the platform. So I think we found, that's been a key in all our major projects has given that exemplary track record that Keith and his folks have been able to exhibit.","Operator","The next question comes from Gail Nicholson with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Gail Nicholson","Your LOE we improved quarter-over-quarter. But I was curious just diving into the U.S. portion LOE what is the delta on a per BOE basis and LOE and the DJ versus the Permian. And do you think that there is more improved for LOE reduction in the Permian, as you progress in this full growth development process?","Brent Smolik","Yes, we do - you got to keep in mind the DJ, is an older more mature development. And so we've been able to drive more efficiencies into all aspects of including the production operations. Delaware is less mature and was growing very aggressively last year and we were putting a lot of the infrastructure in place and building out the production capability last year. This year we're focused on being able to drive efficiencies through that program. So there is that difference that makes Delaware higher. And then the other differences we handle more water in the Delaware. And so, those two issues are the differentiators and the two basins cost structures.","Gail Nicholson","And then my follow-up in the DJ you guys are doing in East Pony activity PILs in the second quarter. Are you guys doing anything different in the completion style design up there that previously you just kind of discuss that the East Pony?","Dave Stover","Not really. The thing that we're looking at across the basin is the application of some lower fluid volumes per stage and some different classifiers that may have an application up there. But otherwise it's business as usual.","Operator","The next question comes from Nitin Kumar with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Nitin Kumar","I just wanted to touch on the well results in the Delaware Basin this quarter, obviously a nice tick up in average productivity from the Southwest Reeves wells, you did highlight that two wells were drilled. I'm sorry the northern wells, but two wells were drilled in Southwest these were HBP they seem to be quite a bit weaker. Anything going on with the geology or the completions in that area?","Dave Stover","Yes, they weren't drilled. They were tilled there were completed and tilled so they are older wells that we've drilled that we completed in the first quarter. But yes, it's different geology, when we've talked about a fair amount when you move to the far Southwest and that's consistent with that area that we divested in the first quarter. And so it's a different performance, you can see it across all operators in the region.","Nitin Kumar","And then just maybe following up on some of the other questions around Noble X. Leading aside, you mentioned the two uses of free cash flow in terms of returns to shareholders. Where does the exploration fit into that prioritization, last quarter you had mentioned about I think about $100 million to $200 million, but you'd also disclose a new play in the PRB and Wyoming. Could you help us just think about the cost involved that exploration effort?","Dave Stover","I think it's a good question, because I don't want to leave any confusion but the exploration capital and our plans for exploration is consistent with what we laid out in our plan last often change there. We outlined our sight to these opportunities and activities and had planned for that. So that's all contained within that wedge of bucket or I call it bucket of capital that we allocate the major projects and exploration. So no change to that. And the big difference is, as we move our exploration dollars into 2020, a large much larger portions now moving into drilling in 2020. So looking forward to that.","Nitin Kumar","And if you\u2019re going to sneak just one last one in. Nice tick down in well costs, particularly in the Permian, as you mentioned earlier. Was any of this coming from discounts from vendors or is this all operational?","Dave Stover","It's a combination as you would expect, if you look at the completion services in the Permian, there is a quite a lot of excess capacity still and so therefore, we're getting better pricing. And then remember last year, if you look across the full year, 2018 it was pretty, pretty busy out there and the cost had inflated. So we're definitely lower cost on the completion side, but it's also a function of us operating faster. So if we can increase stages per day and we can minimize the dead time and the waste in the completion activities. Then we get the dual benefit of lower cost and accelerated schedule, accelerated production coming online. So it's always a combination of both.","Operator","The next question comes from Vin Lovaglio with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Vin your line is open. Is it muted on your end?","And the next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jeanine Wai","I just wanted to follow up on Tim\u2019s question real quick on the Permian. Can you talk about the differences in oil, well productivity between your northern and southern positions in the Delaware. I know you mentioned you had some attention wells, you let go some acreage in the Southwest portion. So just kind of wondering the difference between the two and whether when you look at the lateral lengths, whether they are longer in the north or longer in the South and where your inventory kind of lie to go sometimes I guess the acreage maths can be a little deceiving on that.","Dave Stover","Yes, on in terms of lateral lengths, we are going to drill on anytime we could drill two section links or 10,000 foot laterals. It's going to be our preference to drill them longer. If you look at the average well performance for the first quarter, including the four wells, on average we're happy with the outcome, but if you look at the difference between the northern and southern wells, we were well over 200 barrels, barrel equivalents per 1000 foot of lateral and as for a 10,000 foot lateral that'd be close to 2000 barrels a day. And so those are clearly the core of overcoming, the core of Reeves County is clearly the best that we have in our position and I think competes really well with the rest of industry there.","Jeanine Wai","And then I guess along those lines, 95% of your activity is focused in this northern core acreage CGF this year and as you look over the next year or two, kind of, how does the geographic spread of where you think activity is going to be, how does that change. And is it more related to the CGF or is it something about maybe getting the well cost down or tweaking the completion design to have the southern acreage being a little more competitive with the north?","Dave Stover","But the southern acreage is already competitive with the north, it's the far southwest in the far maybe the South acreage that's different. So everything that we have remaining, we consider core and we'll always look to optimize Jeanine anytime, we can find a way to do either improve the completion design or change the frac design, change perforation designs, we are always looking for ways to do that. But we're happy with the bulk of the rest of the acreage position.","Ken Fisher","And I think it's fair to add as Brent alluded to earlier that, a lot of the activities tied to taking advantage of the CGFS that we have in place because we get a real economies of scale as we continue to take advantage of that. So the activity will be focused around there.","Brent Smolik","Maybe we ask Hodge to just give you a few examples of how he is doing it. I'm really proud of the accomplishments of the team in just a quarter to be able to drive these efficiencies. So Hodge give them a few examples of how you are doing it.","Hodge Walker","Yes, thanks, Brent. Our teams are really been focused on driving out waste and identifying efficiencies, strong alignment between our service providers, our field team our office teams on continuously improving and we're not done.","As Brent mentioned earlier, we drilled a well in the Permian in 16 days. This is below our average, if we've done it once we can do it again. So areas that we're focusing. We talked about pumping hours that improved between 5% and 10% and we've seen examples on a given day where we've been pumping over 20 hours in a day. So these are examples of things that we've seen and examples on where we're going to keep striving for continuous improvement.","Operator","The next question comes from David Deckelbaum with Cowen. Please go ahead.","David Deckelbaum","Just wanted to ask when you write off your original plans here divesting $500 million to a $1 billion were you specifically thinking about NBLX just opportunistically at that time. Or will you more thinking high level of just in absolute dollar amount that you wanted to arrive at and with NBLX achieve that for you. Are you still looking at another source of monetizations throughout the year?","Dave Stover","I think what we reflected was we're always looking at the portfolio and it wasn't specific to NBLX but it was tied to the number of things we continue to look at whether it's some of the things on - in the onshore space that we can accelerate value on.","Sell down of midstream assets, we talked about Leviathan potentially monetizing a small portion of that when it comes online or sometime after. So it's just the whole mix of continuing to look at the portfolio and with that, what we saw is a reasonable expectation on what we should be thinking about this year? So nothing specific. And don't forget, we've already completed 15% to 20% of that target in the first quarter. So we've already progressed that.","David Deckelbaum","And then shipping in the DJ, as you progress through road to a new move I suppose further east, how does the GOR shifts as we get into 2Q and 3Q here. Should we be expecting a greater gas cut on moving into the sort of a higher GOR area or should we think of sort of your 1Q being the highest GOR in that row?","Dave Stover","Yes. So a couple of things in there. So at the well level and there is a chart on Page 6 in the materials we put out that might be useful reference for everyone, where we actually show the gas oil ratio trends across the greater part of the DJ there where our acreage is located.","At the well level what we'd expect, as we move east and north. If you think about where East Pony is up in the north, that we move east and north, we should see higher oil cuts or lower GORs at the well level.","And then we're going to be averaging added to the total field production. So the trend should modestly trend up as we continue to develop this year. We guided originally, I think to 48% to 50% will be trending toward probably the lower end of that range through the rest of the year. The other thing noticed, I hate to talk about things out of period, but we did have two things that affected the oil percentage in the quarter.","One of them is that we had a fairly sizable gas PPA that came in that was positive. So that has the effect of lowering our oil percentage. The other is, we've done a good job of improving the recoveries of NGLs. So we had higher actual NGL recoveries, so when you look at those things together, they reported 46% oil would be a little by 47%. So I think it's, think of it as 47% trending up to 48 plus.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brad Whitmarsh for any closing remarks.","Brad Whitmarsh","Yes, just want to thank everybody for joining us today. As I wrap up, I want to mention that Noble has recently issued its 8th Annual Sustainability Report covering a variety of social environmental and governance topics. That report is available on our website on the sustainability tab, and I hope you have a chance to look at the continued advancements that Noble is making in these areas.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your moderator, Mr. Brad Whitmarsh. Please go ahead.","Brad Whitmarsh","Thanks Anthony and thank you all for joining us today. I hope you had a great holiday weekend. This morning, we provided a number of positive updates in association with today's event. These include our 2017 reserve report, our fourth quarter earnings release and supplemental deck, along with an updated outlook release and associated slides.","In addition, yesterday, we announced significant new gas sales contracts for Leviathan and Tamar in Israel. Each of these items are available on our website in case you want to access as we progress through this morning's conference call. Later today, we plan to file our 10-K with the SEC.","I want to remind everyone that today's call contains projections and forward-looking statements as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures and our latest news releases and SEC filings for a discussion of those items.","This morning, I plan to provide a brief overview of fourth quarter results before handing over to Dave Stover, Chairman and CEO; and Gary Willingham, EVP of Operations, who will comment on our updated multi-year outlook.","Our prepared comments may go slightly longer than usual as we have quite a bit of content to cover. Following our prepared comments, we'll hold a question-and-answer session. I would ask that analysts limit themselves to one primary question and one follow-up. Joining us for the Q&A session is Ken Fisher, EVP and CFO; Keith Elliott, Senior VP for The Eastern Med; and other members of management.","As we did throughout 2017, we finished the year delivering another strong quarter of financial and operational results. Total company volumes were within our anticipated sales volume range despite winter storms and facility impacts to our production in Texas.","For the quarter, U.S. onshore liquids grew to comprise two-thirds of total U.S. onshore volumes. This represented a 20,000 barrel per day increase from the third quarter with more than half the growth coming from oil.","Combined, our Texas assets grew to approximately 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter with both the Delaware and the Eagle Ford setting quarterly volume records for our business.","Our second Delaware central gathering facility began operation in December with nine wells tied into the facility by the end of the year. In addition, the DJ Basin had another strong quarter with a record oil mix of 55% that marks the sixth consecutive quarterly increase. Well results in all of our onshore basins continued to show the strength of our onshore capabilities.","We also continue to see great performance offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa, which delivered more than 37,000 barrels per day of premium-priced oil in the fourth quarter.","In Israel, volumes were right down the fairway as expected and we exited the year averaging more than 1 billion cubic feet per day in December on a gross basis.","Commodity price realizations and good cost performance added to the substantial beat on earnings, cash flows, and EBITDA versus Street expectations. Of particular note on the cost side, lower DD&A reflected the substantial increase in U.S. onshore proved reserves at the end of the year.","Cash operating cost, including LOE, production tax, gathering and transport, and marketing were about $8 per BOE for the quarter. Capital spending was well within our range of expectations, and operating cash flow before working cap changes showed a significant increase over the third quarter of the year. These all represent good trends as we move into 2018.","With that, I'll turn the call to Dave.","David Stover","Thanks Brad and I appreciate everyone joining us today. We have communicated a number of strategic milestones between last week and this morning. A significant announcement was the Board-authorized share repurchase program, which reflects great confidence in our ability to deliver the strong cash flow growth profile we will outline today and we believe that purchasing our shares is a great investment in our future.","Thinking about the future, there's no doubt that oil and gas will continue to be a dominant energy source, playing a vital role in the global quality of life for decades to come. Noble's demonstrated excellence in onshore and offshore operations, along with our exploration and major project capabilities, position us to be a long-term winner. The outlook we provide today is centered around a $50 oil price, utilizing our current hedge book with a sensitivity to a higher price scenario.","To be successful long-term in the E&P space, we believe a company needs to be able to thrive in a $50 world while remaining flexible to take advantage of fluctuations in commodity price. Our outlook provides that.","We also believe a sustainable company needs to be able to successfully manage geographic and commodity risk. Our portfolio is designed with multiple high return investment options in low cost, high margin areas, minimizing the potential impact from those risks and providing a clear line of sight into the next decade.","Noble Energy has taken some significant steps to transform its portfolio over the last couple of years. The sale of our Gulf of Mexico assets is the last major step in focusing our portfolio to deliver our plan.","It also enables us to ensure our exploration teams are focused on the areas that can be very material to Noble with running room based on success. I look forward to being able to announce another material exploration focus area this year.","In addition, the announcement of new sales contracts for our Eastern Med gas into Egypt provides clear visibility into the significant new cash flow that will soon be generated by that region.","Our 2017 reserve growth was extraordinary as we exited the year with just under 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserves. Organic reserves were added at an extremely favorable cost, under $3 per barrel of oil equivalent, which will benefit our income generation for many years to come. As shown in the earnings release, one of the highlights for fourth quarter was the generation of income both on a GAAP and adjusted basis.","Reflecting on 2017, it was truly a turning point for Noble Energy when you consider all that was accomplished. Our portfolio was strengthened through the acquisition of Clayton Williams Energy and the divestment of our Marcellus and other non-core assets. The cash from the asset sales allowed us to pay down more than $1 billion in debt last year while focusing the organization on our high margin, high return assets.","Operationally, we delivered record safety performance with a recordable incident rate almost 50% lower than our previous record. Our Delaware, DJ, and Eagle Ford teams drove program returns 15 percentage point higher than originally expected through enhanced well performance and strict cost management.","This contributed to our ability to deliver volumes and operational cash flow exceeding our original expectations. The combination of our asset performance and our proceeds provided a significant all-in upstream cash flow surplus and we ended the year with liquidity of $4.5 billion.","Our NBLX Midstream business continued to enhance its value through the delivery of multiple gathering facilities while expanding third-party opportunities. Its focus in the DJ and Delaware Basins supports our developments and rapidly grows our retained EBITDA, providing substantial feature midstream monetization opportunities.","The sanctioning of Leviathan early last year was a major milestone and the project teams are continuing to demonstrate their exceptional ability to deliver major projects on schedule and within cost.","The project is currently around 40% complete with essentially the same team that delivered the Tamar project. Our announcement of the 7.5% working interest sell-down earlier this year provides certainty around our Eastern Med ring-fencing strategy.","Yesterday's announcement of contracts potentially totaling 700 million cubic feet of day, gross, for delivery into Egypt is a significant milestone in expanding the regional market. With these latest announcements, we have now contracted almost 900 million cubic feet per day for Leviathan Phase 1.","The accomplishments from 2017 and what we have announced already this year have continued to improve the multiyear plan we outlined for you in November 2016 and updated in January 2017 after the Clayton Williams acquisition. We have provided for your reference a slide pack that discusses this outlook for 2018 through 2020 and even beyond.","One of the key highlights from this plan is substantial excess cash flow generated, totaling $1.5 billion cumulative over the three-year period on our base $50 scenario. We're taking a balanced approach to the use of this surplus cash. Half of this amount will be utilized for the recently announced share repurchase program and $600 million will be used to reduce debt. Anticipated dividend growth should account for the rest.","At strip prices, our plan delivers an additional $1.5 billion excess cash flow. Given the current backwardation of the strip, we've not assumed any incremental onshore activity in this scenario.","We would anticipate utilizing the majority of the incremental cash to accelerate our buyback and consider expanding the program, along with additional dividend increases from cash flow expansion. Beyond this, we may consider funding specific projects that can generate incremental cash flow per debt-adjusted share growth.","Now, let's look at the slides that cover our plans through 2020. I will begin by spending some time on the overall strategy and focus of the company before laying out what our plan will deliver. Gary will then review the major drivers of the plan.","We believe that formula to deliver top-tier shareholder returns across a longer term horizon and a variety of commodity price environments contains five important factors, which are shown on slide two of the multiyear outlook pack.","First and foremost, we believe sustained cash flow growth on a debt adjusted per share basis is critical to being an attractive investment option across all industries. Accordingly, driving this cash flow growth is a top priority at Noble Energy.","Second, an organization must have a relentless focus on capital efficiency and returns, which along with the previous point, will ultimately drive increasing net asset value. We're committed to delivering double-digit corporate returns while substantially growing net asset value.","Third is the alignment of incentive plans with shareholder interest. We believe management compensation needs to be in sync with shareholder interest and our incentive plans are designed accordingly.","Fourth, strong financial capacity and flexibility must be maintained throughout commodity price cycles. This is why we have prioritized debt reduction over the last couple of years. Maintaining robust liquidity, strong balance sheet, and ample financial flexibility will remain a top priority for Noble.","Finally, we believe a successful company has to be fully committed to all its stakeholders. For us, it's living our purpose, energizing the world, and bettering people's lives. Our commitment to our shareholders, our communities, our employees, and the environment is key to Noble Energy's culture and it is a core component of the company's value proposition.","Noble Energy's strategy to deliver leading shareholder return is provided on slide three, starting with the five focus areas to enhance shareholder value on the left. As shown, we're concentrating on both long-term value generation as well as near-term direct value return to shareholders. We have talked many times about our belief in having top quality assets combined with leading execution and the balance sheet strength to deliver top tier results.","On the right side of this slide, we show the four strategic cornerstones around portfolio quality, differential onshore performance, unique Eastern Mediterranean value, and cash flows and financial capacity.","Before jumping into the key outcomes of our plan, I want to highlight on slide four the transformation and strategic portfolio actions that have been delivered over the last couple of years to position Noble Energy with a top tier asset portfolio and a clear future. We've accomplished an impressive portfolio transformation while executing on our strategy to allocate capital to the highest return, highest margin assets.","Early in 2017, we solidified the largest Southern Delaware Basin acreage position with the acquisition of Clayton Williams Energy. This consolidated a nearly 120,000 acre, 2 billion barrel resource, which has huge value for our company.","Our Delaware asset base will grow to more than 140,000 barrels per day within this plan period. As a result, we do not envision our need for any additional large scale M&A in this Basin.","Given our long-term view of U.S. gas price and the resulting inability of the Marcellus to compete for capital in our portfolio, we also divested our Marcellus upstream and midstream position in 2017.","You can see a number of the other actions taken over the last couple of years as we have positioned the company with a clear focus on high margin, high return growth opportunities.","On the right-hand side of slide four, you can see the significant increased contribution of our U.S. onshore liquids over time from around 30% to more than 50%. The portfolio actions have also enabled us to pay down around $2 billion in debt over the last few years.","Turning to slide five, we highlight key takeaways from our updated outlook through 2020. I am particularly excited by our expected cash flow CAGR of 35%, which represents our pro forma capabilities after all the transformation work that has been accomplished. With our planned share buyback and debt reduction, our cash flow per debt adjusted share growth would be even higher.","Return on average capital employed is increased to 10% in 2020 at the flat $50 case. We've also outlined the improvements from a higher price scenario. Growing to 525,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2020 with leverage returning to historic levels are great outcomes in either case.","I mentioned earlier the improvement from the previous plan, and on slide six and seven, we have highlighted some of these changes. I will comment on three specific items. First, on slide six. Increased confidence in Leviathan volumes at start up following our recent marketing progress has moved our base case up to 800 million cubic feet per day, year one.","Second, moving to slide seven. The graph on the bottom right shows a substantial improvement in onshore capital efficiency despite 2017 inflationary pressures. This is primarily driven by improved type curves in both the DJ and Delaware Basins with similar volumes on lower capital and even fewer wells from the prior plan.","Third, on the top left of the slide is highlighted our improved total company margins, up 30% versus our plan one year ago, driven by the increased focus on liquids and Eastern Med gas along with the reduced operating cost outlook as well.","All of this leads to attractive pro forma volume growth and even more attractive cash flow growth as we have shown on slide eight. Steady volume and cash flow growth is expected over the next two years, driven by the strength of our U.S. onshore business and then with 2020 comes another step change as Leviathan starts production. Company volumes are anticipated to grow at a 20% compound annual growth rate with operating cash flow growing almost twice as fast as volumes.","In 2020, at the base scenario, we're selling 525,000 barrels equivalent per day, 70% of which is U.S. onshore liquids and Israel gas and generating more than $750 million organic free cash flow. These outcomes are result of the focused portfolio and capital allocation priorities we have described.","On slide nine, we show that more than 95% of our capital will continue to go to the U.S. onshore business and Eastern Mediterranean. The Leviathan project remains on schedule and on budget, and you can see this capital falls off in 2019 and then completely in 2020 as the project starts up.","I've mentioned the free cash flow generation, and on slide 10, we show the sum total of sources and uses of cash. The current dividend is already included in the uses and in combination with the share repurchase, would provide at least $1.35 billion in return to shareholders over this period.","With anticipated dividend growth as cash flow increases, the incremental shareholder return could be closer to 60% of the free cash flow in the $50 case. The targeted debt reduction of $600 million would account for the remaining 40%, one-third of which was already accomplished in January. We will continue to take advantage of upward commodity price movements to layer in some higher price hedges.","I mentioned this earlier, but I want to be clear on our priorities. Given the current backwardation of the strip, we are not assuming any incremental onshore activity over what is included in the base plan.","We would anticipate utilizing incremental cash to accelerate our buyback and consider expanding this program, while also anticipating additional dividend increases. A portion of the incremental cash may be considered for specific projects that can generate additional shareholder value.","Turning to slide 11. We're focused on making sure our company incentive plans are aligned with shareholder interest. We've been proactive in increasing our emphasis on returns and cash flow on our plans over the last several years. Short-term incentive plan metrics that have been de-emphasized are shown in red, and those with increased weighting are depicted in green.","This year, we are adding consideration of multiple corporate return metrics and cash flow per debt adjusted share to our short-term incentive plan, while increasing the emphasis on performance units in our long-term incentive plan.","Before handing over to Gary, I want to comment on the capability of our business beyond the three-year plan that we have provided today. On slide 12, taking a look at the next three years post 2020, we expect to generate between $1.5 billion and $2 billion per year in organic free cash flow, continue improvement in corporate returns, and a production outlook that is growing consistently.","These outcomes beyond 2020 are driven by the depth and quality of our onshore portfolio with multiple decades of drilling inventory combined with our Eastern Mediterranean business, which provides repeatable, steady cash flow annually, along with significant expansion potential. We've certainly envisioned investing in additional projects while still generating substantial free cash flow.","That's a high level review of our portfolio plan and our company focus. The strategy hasn't changed, our value proposition is clear.","With that, I'll hand it over to Gary for an update on the operations.","Gary Willingham","Thanks Dave. As Dave just noted, our strategy remains the same. We will continue to allocate 95% of our capital to our highest margin, highest returning assets in the U.S. onshore and Eastern Mediterranean. Growth of these assets will drive the material cash flow growth that positions Noble for peer-leading total shareholder returns.","At each of these areas, we've made meaningful changes to set the stage for our enhanced cash flow generation and corporate returns outlook that Dave shared. This morning, I'll walk through the key updates from our prior plan from January 2017, beginning with the U.S. onshore.","In 2017, we enhanced our U.S. onshore portfolio by adding to our Delaware Basin position with the Clayton Williams Energy assets and also by divesting our Marcellus operations. And with this transition, we're focused in top liquids rich, low cost basins with multiple decades of high return inventory as we show on slide 14.","Our multi-basin portfolio provides optionality and flexibility for changing market demands. And I stack the quality of our assets and the strength of our execution up against any other onshore operator.","The combination of our portfolio totals 6,500 potential drilling locations with very strong rates of return, resulting in a business that can generate $900 million of asset level free cash flows over the next three years at our $50 price scenario as shown on slide 15. In 2020, our onshore business grows to a total of 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Also on slide 15, we've outlined the role each of our assets plays within our U.S. onshore portfolio to achieve this plan. The growth engine is the Delaware Basin. With its exceptional economics and large inventory, the Delaware will deliver substantial growth every year over the plan and is the leading contributor to Noble's oil growth.","In the DJ Basin, we've delivered significant performance improvements over the past few years. The increased productivity from enhanced completions is driving greater capital efficiency.","And over the next three years, the DJ Basin will deliver meaningful growth while generating significant free cash flow. Growth in the DJ will accelerate beginning in 2019, reflecting the timing of our 2018 activity, the higher productivity of the Mustang area, and the increasing infrastructure capacity.","In the Eagle Ford, following rapid growth in 2017, we expect to maintain flat production year-over-year through 2020, while generating substantial free cash flow.","Combined this plan delivers very competitive growth for our onshore business with volumes growing at a compound annual rate of 25% over the next three years and oil growing even faster at 31%. The volume growth over the next three years is right in line with our prior plan.","However, shown on 16, we expect to achieve those same volumes with $500 million of less capital, which speaks to the exceptional jobs the teams continue to do to deliver greater capital efficiency.","The DJ Basin is a significant contributor to this improvement. Given the strong well performance we realized from enhanced completions in 2017, we've increased our type curves by 25% on average in our near-term focus areas. The productivity increase per well delivers the same volume with significantly fewer wells online over the plan period.","In the Delaware, we've increased our type curves 20% to 25% for the Third Bone Spring and Wolfcamp A upper based on the strong results we've delivered to-date. At the same time, we're releasing significant operating efficiencies as we've transitioned our program to long laterals and multi-well pad development. These include a 35% reduction in drilling cost per lateral foot from 2016 to 2017 across our entire Delaware position and significant improvements in cycle-time.","Importantly, our Wolfcamp A well cost have remained flat to our prior plan. The efficiencies we've gained, along with modifications in our completion design, have offset the impacts of higher intensity completions while also absorbing service cost inflation experienced in 2017. This is remarkable considering our proppant loadings have increased significantly above what was originally planned.","2017 was marked with a number of significant accomplishments in the Delaware. These include integrating the Clayton Williams assets, progressing our multi-horizon development program and executing significant infrastructure build outs, including the start-up of two central gathering facilities operated by Noble Midstream.","On top of this, we had outstanding well performance. On slide 17, we've highlighted this performance through third-party analysis of available state data. In just a few years of developing this asset, we've already demonstrated superior well performance with Noble's oil production per 1,000 lateral foot the highest in Reeves County and it's 58% above the average of other operators.","We've progressed our activity from delineation to full field development mode, concentrating on multi-well pods and long laterals. And one area I'd like to point out is the encouraging results we've seen from the Calamity Jane 7 well pad, which is covered in more detail in our fourth quarter supplemental slides.","This was our initial test with multiple Third Bone Spring, Wolfcamp A Upper and Wolfcamp A Lower wells, which target a half section development using our planned lateral and vertical spacing assumptions.","In early days, the wells are exhibiting very encouraging results with a lower GOR than originally expected, resulting in about 70% oil. In particular, the two Third Bone Spring wells averaged an IP-30 of 2,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day or approximately 350 BOED per 1,000 lateral feet, exceeding our prior Third Bone Spring Monroe well. Wolfcamp A Uppers have also outperformed expectation with an IP-30 of 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or approximately 315 BOED per 1,000 feet.","We're seeing highly effective containment and no evidence of communication between the wells across the Third Bone Spring and Wolfcamp A, which provides us further confidence in our well spacing assumptions and go-forward development plans.","Slide 18 shows our increased type curve expectations for each zone in the Delaware. The Wolfcamp A type curves are now split between the Upper and Lower zones, and they are shown compared to the prior blended average.","Through our acquisitions of Rosetta Resources in 2015 and Clayton Williams Energy in 2017, we've established a highly contiguous position, the largest in Southern -- in the Southern Delaware Basin.","Prior to Noble's ownership of these assets, neither was set up for impactful growth. With the implementation of our integrated development plan philosophy, these assets are now positioned to realize their full potential. With great execution in 2017, we're currently well on our way to deliver value above our assumptions at the time of the acquisition as we've outlined on slide 19.","We've transitioned to pad development drilling with nearly all of our activity focused on two-section lateral wells, increasing the average lateral length by 60% from Clayton Williams.","At the same time, we've continued to reduce drilling time from 26 days for a 5,800 foot lateral well drilled prior to the acquisition to 23 days for a 10,000-foot lateral. We focused on multi-horizon co-development, which not only drives efficiencies, but optimizes full reservoir potential and value creation.","We've gained further sub-surface knowledge with 3D seismic data across the acreage position integrated into our geo-steering workflows. With optimized well landings, our drilling precision is within a 15-foot target interval across a two-mile long lateral. This rigorous precision is critical for stacked pay development.","With our integrated midstream approach, we're building the infrastructure that supports our long-term plans while significantly reducing capital investment and returning more value.","Approximately a year after the close of Clayton Williams, we'll have two central gathering facilities operated by Noble Midstream servicing the legacy Clayton acreage and connected to our water network. Across the entirety of our Delaware acreage, we'll have five CGFs online by midyear, creating the foundation for the substantial growth with this asset over the next few years.","Fair to the assumptions at the time of the acquisitions, our raised type curves represent a 25% increase to the blended Wolfcamp A type curve from Clayton Williams and over a 50% increase to the Rosetta type curve. This combination of increased productivity while maintaining flat well costs is delivering significantly more value.","In fact, less than a year from closing the Clayton Williams acquisition, we now estimate we've increased the per well value of those assets by 20% versus our expectations at the time of the transaction.","We've also been very encouraged by the results we've seen from tests in the Wolfcamp B and C zones across the acreage position. We highlighted the continued performance of the Cole Younger Wolfcamp B well in our fourth quarter supplemental materials. The well is averaging nearly 350 barrels of oil equivalent per day per 1,000 lateral foot over the first 90 days on production.","There's certainly sizable value upside from these additional zones, considering we attributed nearly all the value from acquisitions, the Wolfcamp A zone. While the majority of our activity will remain focused on the Wolfcamp A and Third Bone Spring, we'll continue to test the Wolfcamp B and C until they're fully integrated into our development plans.","Moving to the DJ, we've shown our acreage map on slide 20. Over the past few years, we strategically focused our operations in rural areas away from urban development and in liquids rich, large, contiguous positions ideal for capital efficient long lateral, multi-well development plans. We've accomplished this through several strategic acreage exchanges which blocked up our acreage position in our core IDP areas.","In addition, we generated over $1 billion by monetizing areas that we were not going to get to for quite some time, given the extensive high return inventory in our key IDP areas. Importantly, given that the divested acreage remains dedicated to Noble Midstream, we further benefited from the accelerated development of those assets.","Overall, these transformations created a contiguous acreage position of significant scale in the liquids rich, highly productive part of the Basin. It's prime for our IDP philosophy and long lateral development and it's far away from surface development challenges experienced by other operators.","Focused in this high quality acreage position, we delivered fantastic results in 2017 from the Wells Ranch and East Pony development areas. With the lessons we've learned over time, we've tailored our completion designs to maximize the value of our program.","We've progressed our basin leading enhanced completion designs to use a standard of 1,800 pounds per lateral foot, up from 1,400 pounds per foot previously. We also continue to evaluate the optimal stage and cluster spacing.","I'd like to draw your attention to the graph on slide 20, where we've shown the same third-party analysis and of data from 2017 wells. Noble stands out from the pack, delivering two and a half times the basin average for oil productivity per foot. This is another clear example of where Noble delivers more from a well than others.","I expect this focus on oil-rich areas to continue over the next few years. We saw great results in East Pony from enhanced completions in 2017 and this has expanded our view of the potential for the remaining inventory in this area. We'll bring on a handful of wells in East Pony over the next few years while we work our larger developments through the federal permitting process. These developments will be permitted for our optimal higher intensity completion design.","Over the next three years, our development will be focused primarily in the lower-GOR areas of Wells Ranch and Mustang, where we have extensive high return inventory. Our updated type curves for these areas are shown on slide 21.","And interestingly, the oil production per lateral foot that we've shown in the new Mustang and Wells Ranch type curves is very similar to the results we saw in East Pony in 2017, given the higher EURs even with a slightly lower oil cut.","We've [technical difficulty] sometime about the next leg of growth in the DJ coming from the Mustang IDP. With similar rock quality and GOR to Wells Ranch, we view Mustang as an opportunity to replicate the successes of Wells Ranch and apply the lessons learned from across our U.S. onshore operations.","We're optimizing the development across the Mustang IDP, leveraging the row concept we utilized in the Eagle Ford. This will maximize capital efficiency by improving cycle times and the sharing of EcoNode facilities.","We originally saw the uplift from enhanced completions in the Marcellus and have replicated this in Texas and across the DJ Basin. Based on what we've seen with similar reservoir characteristics in Wells Ranch along with the strong well results from bolder completion designs on the Mosher pad, we're confident we will see strong well performance in Mustang.","Finally, in conjunction with our midstream partners, we're utilizing best practices learned from Wells Ranch infrastructure to protect our volumes from potential downstream processing constraints.","With the initial wells coming online midyear in Mustang and continued development of Wells Ranch, I'm confident we will continue to see the strong industry-leading productivity that we have shown over the past few years from our other developments.","Moving to our Eastern Mediterranean assets, I think this is an area that truly differentiates Noble. The sustained cash flow profile from these world-class reservoirs, coupled with stable pricing and minimal maintenance capital, will continue to benefit Noble Energy for years to come as shown on slide 24.","As Dave mentioned earlier, we've increased our base case assumptions for Leviathan volumes in 2020 to 800 million cubic feet a day gross. In fact, this is conservative estimate, given the agreements we've already announced.","Beyond what we have contracted, there are substantial remaining opportunity in both the regional export market and within Israel. The graph on slide 25 shows that in 2013, coal fueled over 50% of Israel's electric power generation.","Since then, supported by the exceptionally reliable production from Tamar, coal power dispatch has been reduced to under 35% of power generation in 2017. This trend will continue into 2018 and beyond as the government mandates further switching from coal. We expect there to be another 450 million to 700 million cubic feet of demand in Israel alone from power, transportation and industrial growth.","As you saw in our announcement yesterday, we have executed two exciting new export contracts to Egypt, a firm contract of 350 million a day for Leviathan and an interruptible contract for up to 350 million a day for Tamar highlighted on slide 26. This natural gas was anticipated to help supply Egypt's industrial, petrochemical and power generation demand.","These agreements continue to demonstrate the strength of the regional demand for our natural gas and provide further clarity and confidence in our cash flow profile. And we continue to see Egypt demand grow. In fact, as we've spent more time in the country, we see even stronger evidence of more latent domestic demand than we have assumed in this plan.","Our team remains on track to deliver Leviathan first gas by late next year within budget. The project is approximately 40% complete and the drilling rig will be arriving on site within the next month. 2018 will be a busy year for our team with the completion of four wells, ongoing facility construction and start of field installation.","With the significant portfolio changes, including the Gulf of Mexico sale announced last week and the Tamar working interest sale, as well as 2017 portfolio actions, important to understand the pro forma impacts of each of these transactions. Affecting all of these items back to January 1, 2017, our pro forma sales volume for 2017 equated to 303,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Considering these changes, 2018 volumes are right where we expected in our prior plan and up, pro forma, 12% from 2017.","On slide 28, we've provided a graph showing the pro forma adjustments along with the 2018 guidance range and additional details on these adjustments were also included in the appendix.","Before handing the call back over to Dave, I want to take some time to cover our key objectives for 2018, which sets the stage for our three-year outlook. We expect to grow U.S. onshore cash flows while continuing our focus on capital efficiency. U.S. onshore volumes are expected to be up over 20% from 2017 pro forma on flat capital.","We will continue to see a quarter-over-quarter increase in U.S. onshore oil in 2018, both on absolute and as a percentage of total volumes, driven primarily by the Delaware Basin. Midstream build-out will progress in the Delaware and DJ Basins in support of the upstream growth, which ultimately grows the midstream value of Noble.","We'll progress our world-class Leviathan project for start-up late next year. As we've said before, the $750 million of capital expenditures are more than covered by the previously announced 7.5% working interest sale and the Tamar cash flows.","The momentum that we are generating in the Delaware, along with the return to growth in the DJ, position our onshore business to deliver approximately 25% growth in 2019 over 2018.","Continued onshore growth, along with a full year of Leviathan volumes, provide over 30% growth for the total company from 2019 into 2020. This growth, focused on our higher-margin areas, drives our total company cash flow growth even higher.","With that, let me hand the call back over to Dave.","David Stover","Thanks Gary. I'll conclude with slide 29, which highlights three key points: Our commitment to returning value to our shareholders, our proven execution excellence, and our high quality asset base and inventory that provide visibility to sustainable differential value creation through 2020 and beyond. It is the combination of our strategy and our highly capable workforce that will deliver long-term value for our shareholders.","This time, Anthony, we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","Good morning Dave to you and your team there.","David Stover","Hey Charles.","Charles Meade","Dave, you hit this point at least twice and maybe more, this issue of returning cash to shareholders. But I'm wondering if you could elaborate a bit more on how your decision process in balancing investing in the portfolio versus some different avenues of returning cash to shareholders.","Is there a percentage of your cash flow that you're targeting for dividend payout? Or alternatively, is there a metric that you're looking at on your share price or your valuation that would tip you more towards buying back shares versus increasing the dividend?","David Stover","I think, Charles, you're right. We did touch on this a couple of times in the discussion. I'll tell you how I think about it. We're now at the place and when you look at the valuation of the company relative to recognizing the significant cash flow growth that's come up in front of us, it's a great time to start our share reduction, our share buyback provision now, which we announced last week. I think so the priority is getting that implemented now and we're doing that because we've got a clear line of sight, as we've laid out on cash flow that can support that.","I think as I mentioned in the call from the dividend perspective, we would anticipate that our dividend will continue to grow as the cash flow grows and we'll manage that in sync with the cash flow growth and just as we've done in the past.","So, I think specifically from a priority standpoint and timing, it's a great time to implement the share repurchase with the actions that have been taken to create the cash flow visibility. I think the dividend will grow as cash flow continues to grow. And I think that sets us up well to provide significant shareholder return over the plan period.","In fact, I think what I mentioned in there was the anticipation of the cash flow growth, we could return probably 60% of that $1.5 billion even at a $50 case directly to shareholders.","Charles Meade","Right, right. I heard that. That's a big, big slice there. And Dave going back one other thing and this perhaps works in with the longer-term outlook. I think in your prepared comments, you talked about looking forward to announcing a new exploration area this year. And I'm wondering if I got that right. And even if I didn't, can you talk about how exploration fits in your portfolio through 2020 and beyond?","David Stover","Yes, Charles, it's a great question. It's very observant because I do expect that, given our focus on continuing to have three to four team material aspiration areas, and actually the opportunity in the market right now for folks like us that have maintained that capability and are very proficient in that part of the business has been an excellent time to look at new opportunities that can be extremely material going forward. And I think we'll have the opportunity to highlight at least one of those as we move through the year, one additional one.","Charles Meade","Dave, thanks for the color. Appreciate it.","David Stover","Thanks Charles.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram","Yes, good morning. Dave, I wondered if you could comment on what type of impact the gas sales agreement to Egypt is having in terms of domestic customers in Israel. And could this positively impact your ability to get up to 1.2 Bcf a day contracted for Phase 1 of Leviathan?","David Stover","Well, let me to start, the last part of it. Absolutely, it positively impacts our ability to get Leviathan filled up for Phase 1. I mean, this is a huge impact, Arun. I think one of the questions that have been out there was, is there still a desire from Egypt to bring in our gas? And I think when this answers and should highlight is they want as much of our gas as quick as we can deliver it.","I think on the domestic front in Israel, I think it also highlights that -- and we're in a number of discussions there that it's an opportunity to jump in and fill up the remaining volume capacity that we have in Phase 1, and then as we do that, be able to look at was the progression beyond Phase 1.","But I think the main answer to your question, absolutely it gives us a lot of confidence in being able to fill up Phase 1. Between the combination of Jordan, Israel and Egypt, I have no doubt that that will happen.","Arun Jayaram","And then just quickly, for your 800 million a day gross volume expectation for 2020, does that reflect your expectation that you'd be fully contracted. And perhaps just the ramp in volumes throughout the year, give us a little bit of color on what that assumes in terms of 2020.","David Stover","Yes, essentially, it assumes just the contracts that we've announced to-date, including the Egyptian portion and then taking into account how they ramp up in that first year. ","Arun Jayaram","Okay, great. And then my follow--","David Stover","Incremental contracts may adjust that as we move forward.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And my follow-up is I just needed a little bit of help in recognizing -- in reconciling the $1.5 billion of free cash flow generation over the plan period. Can you just help us understand what type of monetization proceeds does that incorporate?","David Stover","Well, I think beyond what we've announced so far, what you're really looking at is the additional midstream contribution. We've always talked about a drop per year type of thing, so there's a lot of value that will be recognized from our mainstream business over that period of time. And then we have the units, both in Tamar petroleum and in CONE that will monetize over that period of time.","Arun Jayaram","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","David Stover","Hey Brian.","Brian Singer","You highlighted the substantial increases in type curves in the DJ Basin, about 25%. And I know you spent some time in the presentation talking about Mustang and the improvement there. But can you just talk about how your productivity and capital efficiency changes in 2018 and 2019 relative to, say, the last year as you shift a little bit more away from East Pony and a little bit more towards Mustang?","And as part of that, I think you mentioned in your prepared comments with regards to East Pony, that there may be some greater inventory that emerged from some of the drilling and productivity work from 2017. If you could talk more about that.","Gary Willingham","Yes, Brian, this is Gary. Yes, I mean, in the last couple of years, we've had most of the activity focused in Wells Ranch and East Pony, as you're aware. The focus on East Pony has been driven by a couple of things. It's the highest oil content area that we've got and we certainly saw the benefits of focusing on oil versus gas over the last couple of years.","And then it's also been off of our primary third-party midstream provider up there, which got us gas into our own plants and not subject to the constraints that have been in the basin.","So, we've delivered some really great results up there. I think those results, taking your -- the second part of your question, those results have caused us to go back and look at the IDP more broadly. And I think we've got probably more potential there over the coming years than maybe we thought a year ago and we'll continue to work that.","And as I mentioned in the prepared comments, work the permitting issues associated with that, since a lot of that is on federal acreage and we'll go back to that area here in the next couple of years and start drilling some more.","In the meantime, we are shifting to Mustang from a capital efficiency standpoint. When you think about capital efficiency as resources delivered, production delivered per dollar spent, Mustang is certainly higher capital efficiency than East Pony is. You saw the type curve that we laid out is 1.3 million barrels for the Mustang area. And so that's a much higher efficiency than what we've been seeing in East Pony. It is a bit gassier.","And the interesting thing, as I noted in the prepared comments, is given that higher EUR, even with a little bit lower oil cut per lateral foot basis, it actually delivers just as much oil per lateral foot as East Pony does.","So, still very phenomenal wells. We're excited to move the Mustang. We've been talking about it for a couple of years now as our next IDP for growth. And we've spent the latter part of 2017 and the first part of 2018 getting ready for that growth, laying out our pads, getting the infrastructure in place and timing that development so that it comes on kind of midyear as the infrastructure capacity on the gas side in the primary part of the Basin increases. So, looking forward to that, expecting some phenomenal wells in that area.","Brian Singer","Great. Thank you. And my follow-up is with regards to Israel gas. What would you need to see to convert this new Tamar contract that you've signed to export to Egypt from interruptible to firm? Is it just simply proceeding with an expansion? Is it have to do with the domestic market? Or do you need to have more confidence in the overall resource?","David Stover","Well, I don't think it's any lack of confidence in the overall resource. The resource is pretty well established. And in fact, I think we saw that the resource actually grew over this past year with some additional work. So, I think that's pretty well defined and extremely high quality and large.","I think really, Brian, it's just going to be a little bit of time. I think it's going to be some time to move forward, see some of this gas moving and then be working with the partners on the right time to make the next decision there. But as you highlighted, it's a great opportunity for us.","Brian Singer","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning everybody. Dave thanks for all the details this morning. Two questions, if I may. I guess the first one is on Israel. The Tamar contract, is that -- the interruptible nature of that, does that some way smooth out the seasonality of sales?","And I guess my follow-up on the 2023 guidance that you gave. I know that's very long-term, but what are you assuming in there for further expansions on Tamar -- I'm sorry, on Leviathan? And what would the implications be for capital if you did? And I've got a follow-up, please.","David Stover","Yes, I think on the first part, definitely implementing the interruptible contract would smooth out any seasonality and it would kind of level out the whole system. I think when you look at the longer term, I think the question was in 2023, what have we assumed in there?","We haven't input the assumption of the expansion or the next phase of Leviathan. I'll tell you when you look at it though and looking at the numbers, where you're generating $1.5 billion to $2 billion per year of cash flow, you can easily absorb those projects and still have a significant amount of cash flow.","Doug Leggate","Maybe ask the question differently, Dave. You've obviously moved quite quickly in getting the proportion of Phase 1 secured. So, where are you in the negotiations for moving to a larger development over time? Are those discussions started? Or are they ongoing? When do you expect to be able to talk about that?","David Stover","I don't know. Let me let Keith kind of talk to you how he thinks about it.","Keith Elliott","Yes, Doug. I mean, certainly, we have, in our longer range plans, we've thought about the Phase 2 expansion. But our focus right now is filling Phase 1 at start-up and moving that to -- moving that project forward.","We're really, really pleased that we've been able to demonstrate the confidence in the Egyptian market there as the demand in Egyptian market. And we just see that there's further opportunity as that matures as well as continued growth in the Israel domestic market.","David Stover","Doug, to your point, I think -- and what I've talked about many times, is that the demand that we see on the contracts and the progress that we see as we fill up Phase 1 and the demand beyond Phase 1 will drive the timing of the next phase. I think part of what you're getting at, though, is also that the next phase of development for Leviathan will probably be even more cost-efficient than the first phase, given how we set up that up initially.","Doug Leggate","Okay. Dave, my follow-up, hopefully a quick one. Given the guidance on the DJ Delaware, split, and Eagle Ford flat, I guess, should we assume that all the line pressures issues in the DJ are kind of now a thing of the past? And what have you assumed your guidance? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Gary Willingham","Yes, Doug. I mean, they're not yet, right? I mean, that's why we've talked about how we've tailored our program over the last year with that in mind in the DJ. But the next DCP plant starts up in the third quarter this year. That's adds another 200 million a day. They've got another plant after that starting up in the first half of next year. And then there's [Indiscernible], which is another 200 million a day.","Those two plants by themselves increased their handling capacity in the basin by 50%. And then they're already, I think, having discussions about a third plant, new plant beyond that.","So, that all certainly increases the capacity. I think the interesting thing about Mustang is we've got a mix of acreage dedications there. A large part of it's dedicated to DCP. We've got some that's dedicated to a third-party and then we've got some that's actually undedicated at this point.","So, I think given all that, we feel very comfortable with where our activity is going to be focused here over the next few years, given the productivity of the wells we expect and the ability to handle that gas into the system.","Doug Leggate","Great. Thanks again fellas.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy.","Michael Hall","Thanks. I guess I wanted to come back to the outlook around free cash flow and just kind of get a high level picture from you as to what you think is like an optimal level of payout in the context of the next several years. And longer term, in the context of portfolio reinvestment and maintaining your inventory.","David Stover","I think, Michael, what we've laid out is pretty clear on how we see the use of free cash flow, both in a $50 case and a strip case over the next three years. I mean, the majority of that, as we've talked about, will go to direct return to shareholders.","I think as you go beyond 2020 and look at the amount of free cash flow in those years and the opportunity that we'll have some for some very accretive projects, they'll be a mix. But I think even in that case, probably at least half of it is still available for free cash flow for return to shareholders. And we'll see how that plays out. That's still a ways down the road.","Michael Hall","All right. Okay. That longer dated profile, I was curious about it also in the context of the commentary on exploration. Should I take that to imply that there's less than appetite for corporate and\/or asset level M&A in the next several years relative to what we've seen in the last few years?","David Stover","Well, I think one of the reasons we clearly laid out our plan for next three years is to show you how we're moving forward. We've delivered what we said we would do. There was some M&A that played a role in that to getting the portfolio to where we wanted it to be, but it's where we want it to be now and that's what we're focused in on executing going forward. So, that's our emphasis.","Michael Hall","Understood. And I guess as a follow-up, just curious on the U.S. onshore growth profile in the outlook provided, what sort of additional efficiencies are being assumed, if any, through 2020? And what are the exit rig counts look like for each of the key areas?","Gary Willingham","Yes, we haven't really talked about rig counts. And given the ongoing efficiencies we continue to see on drilling wells faster, rig count means less and less I think actually. I think as far as efficiencies going forward, obviously, we've delivered tremendous efficiencies already, especially on the drilling side when you look at the progress that we've made in the Delaware Basin now drilling wells in the same or less time that are a lot longer laterals than drilled before.","So, I think there will still be efficiencies beyond that. Completion side, we'll obviously still drive things from productivity standpoint as well as just an overall capital efficiency standpoint.","So, we'll see some of that. I'd say some of that's baked in as far as our ability to deliver greater efficiencies offsetting the potential for further cost inflation in the industry, especially in more of a strip price scenario. Some of that's baked in, but I'm certainly hopeful that we'll continue to deliver more than we have baked in, like we have in the past.","Michael Hall","All right, great. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Jeoffrey Lambujon","Thanks. Good morning. Just one quick question on the Eagle Ford. Any updated thoughts on just the assets within the portfolio as you look forward? I know you've talked about being largely done following the monetization. And I realize the asset's pretty cash flow generative today. But just wondering if there's flexibility kind of in the way you look at that, in case you can bring forth some of that value. And then also if there's any more detail you can give on plans for more Upper Eagle Ford testing.","David Stover","Well, I think Gary highlighted a little bit about it, but I think we see there's still tremendous value to the Upper Eagle Ford opportunity in the combination of the Upper Eagle Ford, Lower Eagle Ford development as we've laid it out. So, I think we still have ways to go there.","Jeoffrey Lambujon","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Scialla with Stifel.","Michael Scialla","Yes, good morning. Just wanted to see on the Delaware for your plans for 2018. Obviously, you had a lot of success, especially with the Wolfcamp B here recently. Any other zones you plan to test this year? Any news on the Wolfcamp C? You'd said that, I think, you've seen some positive results there, anything more specific on that?","Gary Willingham","Yes, Michael, we brought on one Wolfcamp C well very late in the fourth quarter, so we don't really have enough data to talk about it yet, I don't think. As far as the plans for 2018, I think as I mentioned, most of the activity is going to continue to be focused on the Third Bone Spring and the Wolfcamp A. Given the results, we could continue to deliver from both of those, especially the Third Bone Spring. That will continue to be the focus going forward.","We do have plans to test some of the other zones. We're continuing to test some of the other zones in 2018. I think most of the other zones in 2018 is really focused on the Wolfcamp C more than the B. Part of that is to continue to hold the acreage position together as well, but it's less than probably 10% of the total wells that we're going to bring on this year, probably closer to 5% in 2018.","Over the plan life, kind of the three years that we've laid out here, I would expect the Wolfcamp B and C to probably be 10% to 15% of the total locations that we drill.","Michael Scialla","Bone Spring Shale be part of that -- in that plan?","Gary Willingham","Not really any plans yet. I mean, we're continuing to focus on the intervals that we've had success with on our first three wells, right? So, as we get more testing done, our view of that could change. But given the results we've had on these first three, I'm pretty interested to continue to pursue it and see how much incremental value we can deliver from it beyond what we assumed at the time of acquisition, which was essentially very little.","I think as we continue to test it across the acreage position, our expectation is that Third Bone Spring is probably going to be productive over at least half, maybe a little more, of our acreage position. So, we've got a huge prize here I think.","Michael Scialla","Okay. Thanks. And then hate to bring it up, but it seems like it crops up every two years. Any comments on Colorado -- excuse me, the Colorado political scene at this point?","David Stover","Well, I think we're in a good place with that. I think the history over the last four years has helped put us in a good place. Probably one of the best things we've done over the last five years was get out in front of this and be more engaged, along with Anadarko in the community. And with the public up there, I think there's still a tremendous amount of support for the industry. And I expect us to be able to carry out our programs.","Michael Scialla","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Herrlin from Societe Generale.","John Herrlin","Yes. Hi. Two quick ones for me. In terms of the new exploration area you mentioned, fair to that would be onshore and not off?","David Stover","We're looking at both areas, John. Probably too early to say what will come up first.","John Herrlin","Okay. Thanks Dave. And then the second one for me is West Africa. You're kind of blowing it down. Is it really strategic, long term? Or is that going to be part of keeping a deepwater team intact?","David Stover","Well, I think the main thing there is the gas monetization opportunity that we have over there. I think Gary's team's made tremendous progress there. I expect that we'll be able to create and highlight some real value there, especially when you think about the gas resource that we have in place already discovered in that area. So, I think that's the next step for that, is to clearly be able to show and bring in to the plans what that can look like. It's very low investment cost.","John Herrlin","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Kistler from Simmons, Piper Jaffray.","David Kistler","Good morning guys.","David Stover","Hey Dave.","David Kistler","Following-up just a little bit on the new exploration area. Can you talk a little bit about what you think the appropriate spend for exploration is going forward? Or what the necessary spend is to keep that core competency that you guys have always had in-house?","David Stover","Yes, I think all together, when you include organizational cost, overhead and capital, what we have in place right now is a program that we're spending probably $100 million a year or less all together on that. And what that's enabled us to do is to keep that core competency and also focus on some things that we feel we can mature over the next three years to have ready, post-Leviathan, that will fit very well with that timeframe and as high cash flows that we're generating per year.","That -- then at that point in time, with appraisal and so forth, we can step that program up a little bit but also keep a pretty tight discipline on it. And I think that tight discipline, along with the market and environment we're in now, has enabled us to -- I think what you'll see over time is a significant replenishment of that portfolio with some very material opportunities.","David Kistler","Okay, I appreciate that color. And maybe traversing from that a little bit to the kind of 2021 through 2023 annual free cash flow that you guys are highlighting for us. Obviously, a portion of that might be used for harvesting whatever exploration success you have.","But can you talk a little bit about should we be looking at that number and thinking about Noble as more of a free cash flow yield story and sort of very differentiated from the strategy that took place during your transitional process to more U.S. onshore leverage and Eastern Med leverage?","David Stover","Well, I think to that point, Dave, what the transition's enabled us to do is now set out a program and a plan that gives the visibility that even with new projects like we've talked about, even with exploration success, even with Eastern Med expansion and some of these things, we're still going to be in a position to be a significant free cash flow generator out in that period of time.","David Kistler","Great. I appreciate the added color guys. And great job on the transitional process.","David Stover","Thanks Dave.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Grigel with Macquarie.","Paul Grigel","Hi good morning. Hitting back on the free cash flow. Where does further debt reduction or acceleration of the one and a half times leverage goal fall within the priority of dividends and share repurchases, assuming above $50 pricing moving forward?","David Stover","Well, I think what we've laid out and what we've talked about is there's not that much more debt reduction that we really need to implement. And In fact, I think what we talked about is our focus is on probably another $600 million, a third of which has already been done this year and the rest of that is all based on some favorable early calls on some debt that really will cover everything that probably even makes sense to do on the debt side over the plan period.","The nice part about it is, with all the work that's been done over the last couple of years, it's positioned us now with combination with the growing cash flow and the visibility of the cash flow over the next couple of years, that the work we've done and that visibility of increased cash flow puts us back in that one and a half or below range very, very quickly here, whether it's in the $50 case or whether it's in the strip case.","Paul Grigel","Okay. And then maybe a follow-up here for Gary. Could you guys discuss -- as touched on for the DJ with line pressure, could you discuss maybe on the Delaware side, any thoughts regarding infrastructure market outlets, both for crude and perhaps more specifically on natural gas that was put into the multi-year plan and operational execution risk there?","Gary Willingham","Yes, Paul, not a lot of concern, actually. I think our partnership, obviously, working with Noble midstream on first building out facilities within the field and then helping us deliver our product to where it ultimately needs to get to is certainly an advantage that we have on the crude side with the Advantage Pipeline and certainly with the announcement that we made on dedicating our acreage to the EPIC pipeline and having an equity investment option in that, getting that crude down to Corpus. We feel very good about our oil export from the basin.","On the gas side, a lot of noise around that right now. I think, again, with the existing agreements that we've already got in place with our partners on the gas side, no real concern in my mind on this issue.","I think given the high oil cut area that we've got certainly helps. It's nice to be 70% oil and it's nice to be partnering with folks that we feel like can take care of our gas volumes that we do have.","So, I think the basin could certainly get a little tight here in the next couple of years until some of the announced projects come online. But I feel very good about where we're at.","Paul Grigel","And then just of quick follow-up there. Do your relationships with your partners have the ability to take it beyond the hubs? Or do you sell it at the end of the process and center its FOB shipping point for them at that point in time?","Gary Willingham","Yes, I'm not going to get in, for commercial reasons, to where we actually sell that. But I will say I feel very confident with their ability to get it beyond the hub.","Paul Grigel","Okay. Appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with NatAlliance Securities.","Leo Mariani","Hey guys, I was hoping you could just maybe talk a little bit to your CapEx plans over the next three years. I guess you guys are guiding to roughly flat. Certainly understand that there is some outsized Leviathan CapEx here in 2018. But maybe you could just kind of give a little bit of color in terms of are you baking in some service cost increases in those out years? Or maybe, just kind of high level, how that CapEx moves around over the next few years.","David Stover","Yes, I think, Leo and we've provided a plot. I can't remember what page it was, page nine, I think it was, which highlights the capital, how it moves between the main components or the main areas of our business over the next three years.","But as we talked about, now Leviathan ramps down fairly fast next year. I mean, 2019's capital is substantially less than 2018's some. By 2020, it's kind of rolled off altogether. And what you see is some increasing capital going to the onshore business over those couple of years.","I think, as Gary mentioned, we've accounted for some inflation in our capital efficiency ability to offset and we'll just see how it plays out and whether we can continue to show efficiency improvements like we've have shown over the last couple of years and reflect in the plan. So, we'll just have to see how that plays out.","Leo Mariani","All right. Just the follow-up on the Eagle Ford and I know that's an area where maybe you don't have quite as much inventory as the DJ and the Delaware. I think you guys had said that it will show some declines from its peak in 2018.","Could you talk a little bit about how the Eagle Ford production fits into the -- as you get out into 2019 and 2020, is that expected to be held flat or it will get back in the growth mode? Just any thoughts around that.","Gary Willingham","Yes, Leo, I mean, we've talked about it on one of the slides where we kind of show the role of each part of the portfolio plays, that's on slide 15. We show Eagle Ford production being pretty flat through the plan period. There will be some ups and downs within the years.","As you know, we delivered some really phenomenal wells late last year in the South part of Gates Ranch and so we exited 2017 at a very high rate and we'll see some decline in the first part of -- actually, through 2018 until some of the 2018 drilling starts coming on. So, there will be some end-year kind of fluctuations, but overall kind of year-to-year comparison, we expect it to be pretty flat for the next few years.","Leo Mariani","All right. That's helpful there. And I guess just on Eastern Med, obviously, it's always difficult to see how things play out. But do you think it's reasonable that we'll see some incremental gas contracts in 2018, just based on where you guys are in some of these negotiations?","David Stover","Yes, definitely, Leo. I think we're in discussions. Domestic -- additional domestic contracts in Israel that, I expect, will come together this year. I have no doubt about that.","Leo Mariani","All right. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gail Nicholson with KLR Group.","Gail Nicholson","Good morning gentlemen. Just looking at the operational efficiency that you guys have gained in the Delaware as well as the DJ across the U.S. portfolio. When you look at pad sizes, how do you maximize the value of things operational efficiency gain versus limiting stranded capital with the optimal pad size? Just your thoughts there.","Gary Willingham","Yes, I mean, there's no easy answer to that. It depends on where we're at, what size fracs we're pumping, how long laterals we've drilled. I mean, it all goes to your point of cycle-time I think. So, it's something that we evaluate on kind of a case-by-case basis. Overall, I think we've transitioned to probably an average of about four wells per pad.","Gail Nicholson","Okay, great. And then just looking, you're actively adding crude hedges in 2018 and 2019. Can you talk about that strategy of your hedges? And how has that potentially changed and evolved kind as we look back to the last three to five years? And how we look forward to the next maybe three to five years?","David Stover","I'd say if you look back over time, we've kind of had the philosophy of protecting a certain amount of our cash flow with up to 50% hedging in both global liquids and domestic gas. I think as we've seen opportunities in the market over the last few months, we've taken opportunities, especially on the oil side to layer in some hedges and we'll contain to look at that.","In fact, we actually increased our authority from 50% to 75% on the global oil this year just in case we see some great opportunity to layer in some more and protect some of this cash flow, which also provides the opportunity to accelerate some of the share repurchase and provide more value -- and accelerated value for our shareholders. So, we'll look at all that.","Gail Nicholson","Great. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Brad Whitmarsh for any closing remarks.","Brad Whitmarsh","I just wanted to say thanks. Appreciate everybody joining us on the call today. We provided a lot of information for you. So, Megan, Lauren, and I are around for conversations all day today. Thank you very much.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Operator","Good day, and welcome to Noble Energy's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. I'd now like to turn the call over to David Larson, Vice President of Investor Relations.","David R. Larson","Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Noble Energy's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call and Webcast. On the call today, we have Chuck Davidson, Chairman and CEO; Dave Stover, President, COO; and Ken Fisher, CFO.","Earlier this morning, we issued our earnings release for the third quarter, and hopefully you all have had a chance to review our results. A few supplemental slides were also posted on our website. You'll want to download the slides if you have not already done so, as we'll be referencing them in the call today.","Later today, we expect to be filing our 10-Q with the SEC and it will be available on our website at that time.","The agenda for today will begin with Chuck providing a quick overview of where Noble Energy stands now, then discussing the quarter and finishing up with some comments on our exploration activities. Dave will then give a more detailed overview of our operations and plans for the remainder of the year. We'll leave time for Q&A at the end and plan to wrap up the call in less than an hour. [Operator Instructions]","I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains projections and forward-looking statements based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. We provide no assurances on these statements, as a number of factors and uncertainties could cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from what we talk about today. You should read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that influence our business. We'll reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted net income or discretionary cash flow on the call today. When we refer to these items, it's because we believe they are good metrics to use in evaluating the company's performance. Be sure to see the reconciliations in our earnings release tables.","One other item before I hand the call to Chuck. Hopefully, you all are aware that we are hosting an analyst conference on December 6 in Houston. Please make sure to put that on your calendar. We'd love to -- we look forward to providing a significant update on our global asset portfolio and highlighting the significant growth that we believe sets us apart within the industry. Should you not be able to attend in person, the entire event will be webcast.","With that, let me turn the call over to Chuck.","Charles D. Davidson","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. I thought I'd depart from our normal format and start out by sharing my thoughts on where I believe Noble Energy is today and where we're headed. It's so easy to get entangled in the quarterly results that sometimes we lose the bigger picture. And it's that bigger picture regarding Noble Energy that I'm so excited about and I don't want us to lose track of.","Many of you have seen our annual report. It has the word \"Now\" across the cover. It's a word I've been using a lot lately in talking about our company. The periods of transforming, transitioning and preparing are over. For now, we're in the midst of a multiyear period of very substantial and very transparent growth, growth that is truly adding value. This growth is being supported by major accomplishment after major accomplishment. Our organization is truly shining as it demonstrates it's ability to execute really big projects extremely well.","Some that come to mind include the Aseng field in West Africa. It continues to perform extremely well after coming onstream 7 months early and under budget. Galapagos in the Deepwater Gulf, which came on earlier this year, producing at rates well above expectations. Tamar in Israel, perhaps one of the most impactful projects ever taken on by our company, which just sailed from its U.S. construction site. Even with its scale and complexity, Tamar is right on schedule for first production in less than 6 months. Tamar is followed next year by Alen in West Africa, which will be installed by some of the same equipment as is installing Tamar. And as Dave will mention, with Tamar moving so quickly, it makes it more likely that Alen can move up a bit.","Four major complicated offshore projects with projected gross costs totaling over $7.5 billion, all being executed with precision. In my mind, Noble's ability to execute major projects has developed quickly into a competitive advantage.","Jumping to the domestic onshore, the results in the DJ Basin continue to far exceed our expectations and set record after record. Our net horizontal production there was up 29% in the past quarter and more than double from a year ago. In March, we set a year-end target for horizontal production and we blew through it in August. Drilling times continue to come down, results continue to improve and the play area continues to expand. It's hard to see where the limits are right now. Also domestically, the Marcellus is delivering strong performance, with production up 38% from last quarter alone. But I also believe that Marcellus highlights another Noble competency, which is the ability to pull together, quickly integrate and deliver superior performance from major acquisitions.","And by no means are we letting our portfolio go stale. We've successfully divested non-core assets this year and have received over $1.1 billion in proceeds. On the flip side, we've added new major positions in Sierra Leone and the Falklands, where our first well is now drilling a very significant prospect.","Financially, we remain very strong, driven by our outstanding performance and growing all production, discretionary cash flow from continuing operations was a record $714 million this quarter, up 27% from the comparable period last year. Liquidity at quarter's end was $5.6 billion with $1.6 billion in cash, coupled with an expanded and undrawn revolver.","Finally, as a result of where we find ourselves now, and with a high degree of confidence as to where we're going, our board just announced the 14% increase in our dividend, to $0.25 a share. It's all of this that really, in my mind, comprises the big -- bigger picture of Noble Energy and it's what certainly excites me so much. I've had the privilege of working in some very high performing organizations in the past, but I've never been previously involved with one that was delivering as much, with such quality, and with such future potential as Noble is today.","So let's get to the numbers. As a reminder, we reclassified our North Sea properties as discontinued operations last quarter, and our guidance ranges now are based only on our continuing operations. Previous quarters have also been reclassified to reflect the impacts of this change.","Adjusted net income from continuing operations for the third quarter was $167 million or $0.93 per share diluted. Excluded from adjusted net income were unrealized losses from commodity hedges and gains on divestitures of the non-core domestic properties.","As previously announced, we recorded $40 million pretax in exploration expense related to our exit from Senegal and approximately $20 million pretax associated with the Trema dry hole.","Revenues were $1,006,000,000 for the quarter. That's up 14% from the third quarter last year, with revenue from crude and condensate increasing 46%.","Our sales volume for the quarter were 242,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This number does not include the 5,000 barrels oil equivalent associated with discontinued operations. Sales of crude and condensate represent about 84,000 barrels per day or 35% of total sales. As expected, total sales were up from the second quarter due to the full quarter of production from Galapagos and the return of the Alba plant from planned maintenance, which occurred early in the second quarter.","Net gas sales in Israel averaged approximately 116 million cubic feet per day, up from the second quarter as Noa and Pinnacles contributed production to Mari-B.","But these good numbers could have been a lot better in that we experienced approximately 12,000 barrels oil equivalent of one-time impacts in the quarter, the largest being around 7,000 barrels a day of oil impact -- equivalent per day loss due to shut-ins for Hurricane Isaac. There was another 5,000 in the DJ Basin due to unusually hot weather and some third-party plant downtime. Even with these impacts, average crude oil volumes for the third quarter were 84,000 barrels per day, up 44% year-over-year.","During the quarter, we completed the first phase of our non-core divestment program by closing sales on domestic assets in the mid-continent, in the Permian and Kansas, and by closing the sale of the majority of our North Sea production. The proceeds of over $1.1 billion have contributed to our strong balance sheet, as we continued to invest in our major projects and horizontal development programs. The next phase of our non-core divestments involves smaller package -- packages, which we expect to execute through the end of the year and into 2013.","Shifting to exploration, we recently hosted a conference call, during which we provided an in-depth view of our new ventures exploration program. This is a program that's very important to us, but with all the activities we have under way in our core areas, we usually have limited time to talk about new ventures. I encourage you to listen to the call, if you've not already done so.","With regards to conventional exploration, we currently have a well being drilled in our Big Bend prospect in the Gulf of Mexico. We expect to have results there by the end of the quarter. Following that, we intend to move to our next and hopefully final appraisal well at Gunflint.","With respect to new ventures, we have 4 significant opportunities we're pursuing in our portfolio. The first of our new venture plays is offshore Falkland Islands, where we have a 35% working interest. It's an area with significant oil potential that we believe could open up a new basin play. Our 10 million gross acre position has over 30 identifiable leads on 2D seismic, with the top 10 leads alone accounting for gross unrisked potential of some 7 billion barrels of oil. An exploration well is in progress at the Scotia prospect, a cretaceous target with a P75-P25 gross unrisked resource range of 145 to 960 million barrels. We expect to have results at Scotia later this quarter.","Our second new venture is a domestic unconventional oil play in Northeast Nevada, where we have a lease position of approximately 350,000 net acres. We're presently acquiring 3D seismic, which will be used to guide a pilot test program next year in which we intend to drill a handful of wells. The play concept has a geologic chance of success of over 50% with P75-P25 gross unrisked resource range of about 200 million to 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent.","Our other new play frontiers include Nicaragua, where we plan to drill next year, and Sierra Leone, where we were awarded a working interest of 30% in 2 blocks with Chevron.","Finally, while not necessarily new ventures, we have our deep oil concept underneath Leviathan in the Eastern Mediterranean. And we recently announced that we've contracted a rig that's capable of drilling this prospect, which has gross unrisked resource potential of some 200 million to 1.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent. There are several deep oil prospects besides Leviathan, so we see a lot of running room there.","Before I turn this call over to Dave, let me make a few comments on our work in the Eastern Mediterranean. The countdown to Tamar is progressing rapidly and production is now 6 months away. We have plans to expand the peak capacity of Tamar. We believe there is need for onshore delivery from Leviathan, which would provide diversity of supply and possibly an onshore delivery point to the North.","And finally, we're evaluating the proposals that we've received for bringing in an additional partner at Leviathan. I know that many of you are anxious to hear the details and there's been much media speculation, but sensitive discussions are ongoing and as a result, we will not be commenting further at this time. We are encouraged and our target remains to have secured an additional partner in the project by year end.","Now I'll turn the call over to Dave who'll give you more details on our ongoing operations.","David L. Stover","Thank you, Chuck. Our growth this quarter is indicative of the culture we have been building that makes this possible and sustainable over the next decade. Let's start by discussing our activity in the DJ Basin.","Here, our team has been focused on transforming from a gas to an oil operation, leading to the significant ramp-up of our horizontal Niobrara activity and constant performance enhancements. Since we launched our horizontal program in the DJ Basin in 2010, we recognized the need to accelerate our plans to bring the resource value forward, and that is exactly what we have done. As in the development of any large field, we plan for our needs in water, services, rigs and takeaway capacity. We're in good shape in all these areas, and we continue to expand the services necessary to support our growth.","For the third quarter, we averaged production of 75,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the DJ Basin. Our production this quarter was impacted by some one-off issues, primarily tied to the midstream sector, that reduced our production by 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. These issues have been resolved and DCP is currently setting new throughput records for gas on their system. We remain on track to meet or exceed the 5-year growth projections we announced last year. In fact, we're currently producing about 83,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from this basin with 59% liquids, as shown on Slide 9. And that growth is dominated by our increasing crude oil production.","As we show on Slide 10, every quarter over the last 2 years, we have seen a decrease in our horizontal drilling times, and we're drilling substantially more lateral feet per rig than we would have anticipated even 3 months ago. By the end of the year, we will add 2 newbuild rigs and release 2 older rigs. We will exit the year with an 8-rig program and we will now drill over 200 horizontal wells by year end.","In the third quarter, we spud 64 horizontal wells and completed 57. The bulk of our activity has been in the core and extension areas of Wattenberg, where our liquids are approximately 60% and 75%, respectively. With our focus on the horizontal program, we have halted our legacy vertical drilling program.","In Northern Colorado, we have applied our exploration processes to an area we call East Pony. This area, shown on Slide 11, includes roughly 45,000 net acres, a good portion of which we acquired at the beginning of the year. We have 11 wells online with a 30-day production rate, averaging over 600 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well, with more than 80% oil content. Three of the wells are part of an 80-acre pilot test, and they are actually outperforming the 11-well average. As you can see, the 30-day average production for the 3 wells is over 700 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As a result of this performance, we're now close to full development, when we will transition to pad drilling to realize the efficiencies we have previously achieved in our extension area.","We're also expanding our Lilli Plant, which came as part of the Petro-Canada acquisition, to 15 million cubic feet per day by year end, and we will be installing a second plant in 2014, capable of increasing capacity in this area by an additional 30 million cubic feet per day.","Matching our overall drilling activities, we have continued to significantly increase our pace of completions. Completions in 2012 will more than double those in 2011, and we expect to complete over 70 wells in the fourth quarter. This accelerated horizontal drilling and completion activity is resulting in increased production, especially with respect to crude oil. Early this year, we set a goal for our horizontal program to exit the year at 32,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net. We met that goal in August, and we are currently producing about 36,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net, more than doubling our horizontal production since the beginning of the year.","We continue to focus on improving recoveries by increasing densities and testing multiple targets. Our initial 40- and 80-acre pilot project continues to perform well with all 9 wells producing above the 310,000 barrel oil equivalent-type curve after 8 months of production. On our full section 40-acre pilot, testing multiple targets and patterns, we have drilled 10 of the 15 wells, and we plan to have all online this year.","By year end, we will have drilled over 300 horizontal Niobrara and Codell wells, since we started our horizontal program in 2010. Our knowledge of the play grows every quarter, while we continue testing economic enhancements such as EcoNodes and extended reach laterals.","Slide 12 shows the performance of our 3 recent extended reach lateral wells plotted against the 750,000-barrel oil equivalent-type curve. In particular, the 2 recent wells with 90 days production history have been eye-opening. At returns over 100%, this performance is outstanding and we plan to expand this program. We are on pace to drill another half dozen or so this year, and we anticipate escalating the program in 2013 to approximately 60 extended reach lateral wells.","Slides 13 and 14 show how gas-handling capacity is expected to keep pace with our growth over the next year. DCP has announced significant infrastructure expansions to handle future production increases. They increased the capacity of their Mewbourn Plant to 160 million cubic feet per day, and they have announced 560 million cubic feet per day of new capacity, scheduled to begin coming online in the middle of 2013. In short, processing capacity in Wattenberg is growing at a pace that will support our growth projections.","In addition to pure infrastructure development, remember that our production focus has shifted from Central Wattenberg to the Northeast, where crude content is higher and where our Lilli gas plant can contribute to our gas processing needs.","On Slide 15, we show how our production in this basin will continue to shift more heavily to the extension and North Colorado portions of the play, which drives a significant increase in oil and liquids volumes relative to gas production.","Concerning both crude oil and NGLs, we are working with the purchasers and transporters in the region to ensure that capacity is available to support our expected growth profile.","Shifting over to the Marcellus. We're currently producing 115 million cubic feet equivalent per day net. We initiated production from the Majorsville wet gas region in July and now believe that this production is in a very rich area of the Marcellus. We brought 2 pads online with a total of 13 wells. The pads each experienced some production downtime from late September through early October due to a processing plant downtime. However, the plant has been returned to service and our production is ramping back up.","Our condensate yields have fluctuated between 15 and 30 barrels per million cubic feet, and NGL yields are over 50 barrels per million cubic feet. These results have exceeded our expectations, and we are pursuing options with our partner, CONSOL, to accelerate wet gas drilling in 2013. Our wet gas operation in the Marcellus is an area we can continue to apply our learnings from our DJ Basin operation to accelerate performance improvements.","Presently, we have 3 horizontal rigs running in the wet gas area, and CONSOL operates 2 dry gas horizontal rigs in Southwest Pennsylvania. They brought on 22 wells in the third quarter, adding approximately 35 million cubic feet per day net to Noble Energy.","Moving to the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Production is currently 27,000 barrels per day. Average production for the third quarter was impacted by Hurricane Isaac, which reduced quarterly production by close to 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. At Galapagos, current production is 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and still outperforming original expectations.","Our exploration well at Big Bend was spud in early October and we expect results by the end of the year. As a reminder, Big Bend is an oil prospect, with the probability of success just over 50%. If successful, it would likely be a prolific Miocene subsea tieback development like Galapagos.","Earlier in the quarter, we finished the drilling and evaluation of the Gunflint appraisal well. Gunflint was confirmed as a commercial discovery and a second appraisal well is planned to the southwest part of the field. The rig will move from Big Bend to the next Gunflint appraisal in early 2013. The information obtained from this well will determine whether development is a standalone facility or a subsea tieback.","Moving to our international programs, I'll begin in the Eastern Mediterranean. Here, our team did a fantastic job bringing Noa and Pinnacles online in record time to support Israel's power needs. This contributed to net Israel production, averaging 116 million cubic feet per day for the third quarter.","Tamar remains on schedule for sales to begin in April of 2013, less than 6 months away. As we saw at Aseng, the tremendous coordination between our folks and our contractors resulted in the Tamar jacket and deck beginning their transit to Israel for installation on schedule and within cost expectations. Slide 17 shows these massive structures as they left the shipyard.","Following the initial startup period, we expect to average approximately 700 million cubic feet per day through the remainder of 2013. The peak demand from Israel may exceed the first phase of Tamar capacity next summer, and we continue to work on solutions, such as the expansion of Tamar and the delivery of Leviathan gas onshore.","Earlier this month, we hosted an exploration conference call in which we discussed the deep oil potential of the Levant Basin. To drill the deep oil targets and to support our global drilling program, we secured a service contract for the newbuild drillship, Atwood Advantage, that is scheduled to arrive in the Eastern Mediterranean in the fourth quarter of 2013. The drillship's capabilities are sufficient to reach the deep oil targets, and the Leviathan deep oil prospect is the first exploration well expected to be spud. The dual derricks and dual BOP stacks along with the faster transit speeds of the drillship are time-saving and cost-saving features that will benefit our global drilling program.","Shifting over to our fifth [ph] quarter area in West Africa, we had another strong quarter with production from our Aseng field, averaging 64,000 barrels of oil per day gross. Sales volumes reflected 59,000 barrels of oil per day due to lifting schedules. Earlier this month, we surpassed 20 million barrels cumulative sales from Aseng.","Our Alen project construction is making excellent progress. Construction is over 85% complete at the yard in Morgan City. The vessel that will install the Alen platform is being utilized to set the Tamar jacket and platform. Once the Tamar installations are complete, this vessel will transit to West Africa. And since Tamar is making excellent progress, we could install the Alen platform earlier than previously expected. This could result in an earlier startup for Alen. The Atwood Hunter rig will be moving to our Carla oil discovery, located below the Alen field, offshore Equatorial Guinea. The rig will drill an appraisal well at Carla with results expected early next year.","Before wrapping up, I want to touch on our fourth quarter volume guidance. We estimate volumes to be 248,000 to 252,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. On Slide 18, adjusting for the third quarter volumes associated with our onshore divestitures, the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance range reflects a quarterly growth of 8%.","Throughout our portfolio, I am excited about the results each of our core area teams are achieving, and in particular, our consistent major project execution from Aseng, Galapagos, Tamar, Alen and carrying over to our onshore operations in the DJ Basin and the Marcellus. This attention to execution sets up our future, and will deliver the short, medium and long-term growth we expect. In addition, we now have a portfolio of frontier exploration prospects, any one of which would significantly add to our long-term growth.","With that, Tim, it's probably now time to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Arun Jayaram with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, Chuck or Dave, just one of the -- elaborate a little bit on the DJ Basin. Dave, you mentioned that you believe that the company could be well-positioned to meet or beat your 15% growth target that you highlighted at last year's analyst meeting. Obviously, the slide suggests that you're probably okay, but I just wanted to see if you could elaborate. Do see any pitch points in terms of growth in 2013, until the LaSalle Plant comes online later in the year?","David L. Stover","Yes, I think we're going to see pretty consistent growth here, starting in the fourth quarter and going into next year. I mean, you do have some expansion DCPs, planned expansion coming on in about midyear next year, which will help in the second half of the year some more. But again, we're focused in that high oil content area, where you're up in 70% to 80% oil. So you're actually growing oil at 4:1 to 5:1 ratio versus our gas volumes out there, especially on the areas we're concentrating on. And then we have -- the other part of it is the Lilli Plant still has additional capacity right now in Northern Colorado. So we'll be working to continue to fill that up while we're continuing to expand that area. So I think, if you look at those 2 slides we showed you on the gas comparisons, both in Wattenberg and in Northern Colorado, I think we're in good shape to stay on track and do maybe even hopefully, even a little better on our growth profile next year.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Dave, this is just by managing where you put the rigs, right?","David L. Stover","It is. It's also what you're seeing in performance out there on the oil content on some of this, which goes along with managing where we're keeping our activity, and a lot of it's continuing to work with the processors on plans and staying in front of this. And we've had great cooperation on that side.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. Chuck, I did want to ask you a little bit about Cyprus. Now that you've gotten a favorable export ruling from Israel and you continue to move with your partners to monetize Leviathan, what is the strategic endgame for Noble regarding Cyprus? And I know [ph] you're going to appraise that discovery. But does it make sense for you guys to participate in another LNG scheme in that area? Or just thoughts around Cyprus.","Charles D. Davidson","Well, obviously the desirable outcome there would be some integrated solution that looks at how we monetize and export the gas from the basin. And so that's one of the things. As we go forward, obviously, Leviathan is the big discovery and is the one that's getting a lot of attention now, both from a domestic side because some of Leviathan will go into a domestic market, but then certainly from the export side. Still a few more pieces to work together. We're exploring a number of sites in the region. Some of those sites could accommodate gas from both Israel and Cyprus. And so that is still one of the possible solutions. But quite a bit of work needs to be done, both engineering work as well as working with our partners and the governments involved. So a lot of things, a lot of moving pieces, but nothing has fallen off the radar screen. But it just takes a lot of work. And of course, we're very focused right now, as you could expect, on getting Tamar onstream and meeting the near-term gas demand in Israel, which is really surprising us to the upside.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dave Kistler with Simmons Inc.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly, looking at the extended laterals in the DJ, continuing to produce probably 2x the average EURs. Is that potentially location-specific, or is it just length-specific? And probably most importantly, how much of your portfolio do you think that could apply to?","David L. Stover","Yes, I think we're still working through some of that as far as -- we haven't tested it. Right now, Dave, I'd say we've been focusing in that, kind of Wells Ranch area, that extension area up there. And I would anticipate that's where still a majority of them will be next year. One of the things that area has going for it, you're dealing with large ranches, so the complexity of going to cross sections is a lot easier to deal with and you can handle that quicker up in that area. So that's been part of the reason for focusing there. Also, we're focusing in the higher oil content area with that part of the program. So the full extent of where you can go with that probably remains to be seen, but I'd say for now, we'll continue to focus up there in that extension area and then possibly even some into Northern Colorado. But we're talking about going from 10 to 12 of those this year to 60 next year.","Charles D. Davidson","And Dave, it is an area where we also have the normal length lateral wells also. So we're clearly seeing -- it's not just because of where they were drilled, this is truly -- these longer laterals are having a big impact on the recoveries and the performance. So as Dave said, it's really finding the right locations, and the ranches certainly are the place to start.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful, I appreciate that clarification, and then maybe one more in the DJ. When you look at your pilot test, both on the 80-acre and the 40-acre side of things, they are yielding 30-day rates that are in line or higher. And I want to focus a little bit more on the 80-acre that are showing a little bit higher. Can you talk about -- is there any interference that might be causing those rates to be higher out of the gates that could impact the ultimate recovery of those wells? Obviously, that would be a present value decision as well, but just trying to understand what that looks like at this point.","David L. Stover","Yes, David, if you're talking about the 80-acre we mentioned today, that's that portion up in East Pony. And I'd say that's kind of the natural evolution, like we did down in that Wells Ranch area, where we started with the 160s or so and moved down to 80 and are actually now starting to do 40-acre tests. So this is kind of just a the step behind that up here in the East Pony area. And this has just been our first opportunity to go down to a tighter spacing. I think what you're seeing in all of it is, with this brittle rock, or where you can find this brittle rock, and the more you can bust it open and connect it, the better off you are. So I mean, we're not seeing interference from the standpoint of affecting offset wells performance at all. In fact, you're seeing as it's showing on those 80s and what we've actually seen so far on the 40s down the Wells Ranch area, that performance actually seems to be enhanced in these wells.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great, well, I appreciate the clarification and nice to know there's no interference with the wells, it probably keeps the EURs consistent, if I'm not mistaken.","David L. Stover","Right.","Charles D. Davidson","You bet.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just overall question on liquidity. Obviously, you've done a number of asset sales this year. Sounds like you've got some other minor ones planned late this year, early next year. You took -- made the decision to increase the revolver, even though it's undrawn, from $3 billion to $4 billion. It definitely sounds like you guys are kind of building a war chest of liquidity here. I mean, should we expect a potential big increase in CapEx for next year? Can you just kind of help us on sort of the thinking there?","Charles D. Davidson","No, this isn't -- we don't build war chests here. We want to make sure that we are covered for any eventual outcome, as commodities are volatile. And we have some major projects that we've made commitments to. And so we need to make sure that we can fund those through virtually any environment. And I think quite honestly, we probably originally thought that maybe we could wait until next year to expand the revolver, but the market was very, very open. We had some banks who really wanted to become part of our line. And so, Ken and the financial team decided to go ahead and do that this year and take advantage of the situation.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, thanks for clarifying that. Just kind of jumping over to Israel, you guys talked about being able to run at 700 million gross at Tamar once that comes online here. And I guess you mentioned the possibility to sort of getting it higher. Could you talk a little bit about sort of how you'd kind of go about doing that? I mean, do you see it as, if there's Israeli demand that's well above that, is that something you could get higher in the second half of '13? And also with respect to Israel, when was it that [ph] the gas price was down about 18% in the third quarter versus the prior quarter. Just any comments around the pricing dynamics and what we should expect kind of in the fourth quarter on the gas price?","David L. Stover","Well, when you look at the volume for next year, there -- it -- we have the capability to produce close to a BCF a day through the system. Now we don't expect to average that over any extended period of time because of needing to preserve some flexibility for peaking, whether it's hourly or daily peaking. But we would expect after this thing's up and running and then you get into the summer season, that we could see volumes up in that 900 or so range during some of that period of time. But I'd say a safe estimate is the average over an extended period is closer to that 700. Now we did mention, as a result of the demand, and as Chuck mentioned, the demand has been to the upside from our original expectations over there. We're looking at 2 additional projects. One is an expansion at our onshore facility, and which could add a couple hundred million a day over the next couple of years, so we're looking real hard at that. And then we're looking at this first phase of Leviathan, to have that ready to bring on to supplement supply in that kind of 2016-type time frame. So we're continuing to look to how we can continue to meet the growing demand needs in country.","Charles D. Davidson","On the gas price question that you had on that, our average gas price is a blend of contracts and terms. And so, especially as we're getting at this point, where the Mari-B volumes are coming down and we're -- we've got contributions from Noa and Pinnacles, that blend is moving around quite a bit. And so that's what we experienced as we went from the second to the third quarter. It was a mix. As you know, the contracts for Tamar are new contracts, and so that will really reset and we previously guided on what we thought the range would be on that. So starting in, hopefully, that April time frame, when Tamar starts up, then we'll have a whole new set and a whole new blend of contracts feeding the market. Just as a follow up, I just want to make sure I was clear on your question on our liquidity is, is we're not -- we're also not planning any huge changes in our capital program as we've outlined before. We see our program as very steady and very predictable as we've guided before. So I just want to make sure I was clear that we're not planning some massive capital jump or surprise from what we've been telling you before.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","A question on those extended laterals. You got them coming in at 8.3 million. What would be the cost of just a kind of a conventional 4,000 or 5,000 sort of lateral?","David L. Stover","Those have been running in that 4.5 to 4.7 range.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So the savings I can sort of think of is kind of an 8.3 million instead of kind of a 9.2 million?","David L. Stover","Yes, and I think, remember, this is just the first few of these extended laterals. I think our team still feels they can get those just a little under 8 at the end of the day.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Got you. And remind me, what did you guys pay for the acreage up in East Pony? And what sort of royalty do you have up there?","David L. Stover","Now we really -- we've got a blend of acreage at different prices, so we really haven't given out the acreage price. But it was a very, very reasonable price because we got in pretty early on some of this stuff. And then we added to it as we went. So it's a blend from a couple of different places.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Back to the DJ. Can you talk more about aerial extent and multi-event [ph] potential? On aerial extent, can you put the East Pony area into context size-wise and talk to how much additional acreage is unevaluated with some potential in Northern Colorado? And then perhaps, could you also talk to the horizontals drilled in Codell versus the Niobrara and how you're thinking about that development?","David L. Stover","Well, that's a good bit there, Brian. But let me start with Northern Colorado. In Northern Colorado, remember, we have about 220,000 acres or so that goes along with the 400,000 in Wattenberg. I'd say the East Pony area is around 44,000, 45,000 acres. We've got another of what we'd call West Pony area, of another 50,000 just west of that, where we're starting to drill some wells also. But I'd say when you think about the couple hundred thousand acres in Northern Colorado, we've probably drilled a well, at least in maybe 70% of that area. I'd say we've probably got about 6 more wells in the East Pony to complete yet this year. So out of the 30, 35 wells we've talked about drilling in Northern Colorado, it looks like about half of them will be in the East Pony area, be some more in that West Pony area and some more scattered around up there as we continue to test it. So I'd say we focused on the East Pony here originally as an area to test and move forward with a development pattern, which we've been extremely pleased with, I'd say extremely enthusiastic about what we've seen there. I mean, that looks every bit as good as anything we've seen in the Wattenberg Field. But the other areas are still in much earlier stages. So we're going to have to do some more testing in those areas yet. I'd say -- you had the question on what we're thinking on densities and recoveries and all that. And I'd say we're still -- we've been asked before what inning are we in there. Maybe we've moved from the third to the fourth inning, but we're still early in what we're doing there. As I mentioned earlier, we're down testing some 40-acre spacing in the extension area of Wattenberg. So continued encouragement from that and we'll continue to expand that program. We'll continue to expand the extended lateral program, like I mentioned. We're going to drill 5x to 6x, as many of those next year. So there's a lot of testing and a lot of things still going on. But I'll go back to one of my earlier statements, we haven't been disappointed up here, whether you look at Wattenberg or whether you look at this East Pony area. So I'd say right now, out of the 600-and-some thousand acres that we have up here, we've probably have gotten extremely good encouragement on at least 500,000 of that so far.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then going back to that conversation on Israel and meeting demand next summer, I think you mentioned you could pick -- or you could potentially tap Leviathan, if I heard you correct in your opening comments. Can you just talk about what the level of demand your base contracts would cover? And then what are the pricing implications if you do have to or are able to run at a harder level than what those base contracts call for?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, most of these contracts have terms that allow for swing volumes. And so you can -- especially in the -- like in electricity generation there, as you get demand, it swings up. So we will see times, whether it's peak days or peak times of the day, where we will swing up under the existing contracts to the BCF a day, that is really the limit of our capacity, right as we've got it and as we're installing it now. So we'll swing up to that amount. There may be -- and there's provisions to have some additional customers that are more on what I'd call an interruptible basis, that might be able to fill in when we don't use all that capacity and that might provide some. But I think in the end, the real solution that we're seeing, because there are other customers out there that would like to buy gas, we are seeing that there's quite a bit of demand and the interest continues to grow with the savings -- the cost of savings that Israel is experiencing from natural gas. So our real focus is looking on, number one, a way that we can expand the capacity of Tamar, that will involve some installation of some additional facilities, and then also, a little longer term, looking at a development of Leviathan, that would -- probably the first phase of it, be a position to deliver to the domestic market in Israel. So those are the 2 pieces that we're really looking at to try to meet this growing demand in Israel. As I know you're well aware, when we designed Tamar, we had anticipated that the Egyptian gas would be continuing to flow into the market. And the -- and with Egyptian gas not flowing to Israel, that's left a demand gap.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Do you expect the incremental contracts that serve in a domestic market to be signed at more attractive pricing terms than the Tamar contract?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, each of those are negotiated on their own. So I think that -- I think there's a sense as to what the gas price market is in Israel. And we just have to take them one contract at a time.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Malone with Global Hunter Securities.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just staying with Israel for a moment, and it looks like Noa and Pinnacles perform pretty well. But how do you see that balance of those 2 fields versus the declining Mari-B kind of playing out between now and April? And on that, you talked about a blend of contracts as one of the reasons that realizations were down. How do Noa and Pinnacles play into that? I mean, does it imply that the contracted price for Noa and Pinnacles are lower than Mari-B?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, first of all, those fields are much, much smaller than what the original Mari-B was. So the whole plan with Noa and Pinnacles was to fill a gap here, especially in 2012, as Mari-B declined.  Even with Mari-B, there was a blend of different terms because as you recall, the original gas, some of it was contracted at about $2.65. And then we had some other supplemental volumes that were above that. But as Mari-B has declined, that mix has changed. And so it's a mix that has occurred at Mari-B, as well as these other fields that have come on. They've come on -- in some instances, they are also supplying that basic IEC or Israel Electric Contract. It's just, we have the right to meet that from various supplies of gas. So it's not like they were sold differently. It's the whole blend that moves around as we get down here at the real tail end on some of these contracts.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Going back to the DJ Basin or the Wattenberg and your extension areas there, it looks like the completed well cost has been moving up there from kind of the mid-to-low 4s earlier this year, now to $4.7 million to $5.25 million. And my question is, is that really an apples-to-apples comparison, reflecting the service costs? Or is there some scope change in there? And if you could kind of attribute the increase to those 2 things?","David L. Stover","No. Charles, I guess I'm not sure what all you're seeing, but I guess when I look at the costs this year, we're actually seeing them come down a little bit on the full drilling and completion, at least if I compare apples-to-apples type cost. For example, beginning of the year, we were seeing more of that $4.7 million in the Wattenberg area. And then as we got further north, it was closer to maybe $5 million. But you might be comparing, mixing and then matching some of those pieces. But I think now, what we're seeing is in the Wattenberg piece, you're seeing they're may be getting closer to $4.5 million to $4.7 million. So if anything, coming down a little bit. And in the Northern Colorado, they're now coming from maybe that $5 million to $5.2 million, that they were down into the high 4s. So you're actually seeing some downward movement to maybe $100,000, $200,000 per well at least on the drilling and completion, when you look from beginning of the year to what we're seeing now. And I think...","Charles D. Davidson","And also, you've got the potential in Northern Colorado to continue to bring some cost down up there because, in some instances, we've not gone to these high-density pads that we're using at Wattenberg. And that's one way that you can really get some cost savings, as well as time savings. And so as we really move forward, like in areas of East Pony, where it moves into a development phase with higher density drilling off pads, you can get some more savings as well.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. Yes, you actually didn't have the footnote, or you didn't have the slide on -- in this presentation, one of the early ones. It mentioned that may be well costs could have gotten up to $5.25 million. But it sounds like that was a mix shift and going into...","David L. Stover","That was those individual wells as we were testing new areas up in Northern Colorado. And so that wasn't representative of the development program.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Great. That answers my question. And the second thing, related to the curtailments of production in the area in 2Q and 3Q, is there any chance for makeup in Q4, coming in the form of maybe like unfractionated NGL volumes? Or is that just straight-up volume that didn't come out of the wellhead and there's going to be no makeup?","Charles D. Davidson","I think it's volume that didn't come out. I mean, in one case, there was a plant there in the field that they had some difficulties with their aiming system. They got it fixed, and -- but you really can't -- if you didn't produce it, you can't make it up. And as far as I know, we don't have any stored volumes of unfractionated NGLs. In this instance, they couldn't handle the gas at the inlet because of the aiming. So we never could get a chance to recover the NGLs.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Herrlin with Societe Generale Associates.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","I've got 2 quick ones. With respect to the extent horizontals, given the softness on the services cost side, all things being equal, if you did more pad-type activity, could we expect the development cost to drop, say, 7% to 10% per well? I mean, have you thought about the amounts?","David L. Stover","Yes, John, it's a good question. And I think as we continue to get larger -- I mean, more wells on pad drilling, I think you have an opportunity for that 5% to 10% type range. I mean, that's kind of what the team is working towards up there, over the next year.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. My next question, on Northeast Colorado, would you consider doing greater density pilots, I mean, like, say, a 40-acre pilot rather than the 80-acre pilot with more wells in a given area?","David L. Stover","I think that's something we'll definitely be considering up there. First thing, is that they look at the performance down in the extension area of that pilot we have. Those wells, those 40-acre wells, where we have that full section, that we went the 40-acre spacing, they'll just start to come online over the next couple of months. So that will take us a few months to see how that performs. If we get the continued encouragement from those that we've seen from that first pilot, I'd say that East Pony area is a next obvious target to move up there because you've got now an 80-acre base to compare against.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Eliot Javanmardi with Capital One Southcoast.","Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to know if we could get any color on Big Bend and what's happening there. And also, if you could take us back on the Gunflint appraisal well that you had drilled. I know that you had seen the results initially and reported what you had saw. Is there anything, upon further evaluation, that have -- could have you repositioning the next appraisal well at Gunflint?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, on Big Bend, Big Bend is drilling and there's -- so there's really nothing to update on that. We would expect results at the end --- by the end of the quarter and we'll announce that as it comes up. We've talked a little bit about the prospect. I think our Gunflint appraisal, I mean, I think we're getting, with the appraisal, the well that we previously announced, it helps us, give us a clearer picture of the structure. And the Parkers have agreed on the next location. We know we need to go to the South and appraise that flank of the structure, which we haven't seen yet. And so that's the intent. And so we're really trying to get this nailed down so that we can position it for a sanction for a project.","Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Appreciate that color, and lastly, do you -- the JV payment to CONSOL that happens in 3Q, I believe you have one more left after this year. But in the CapEx spend that's listed for the quarter, is that payment included in that figure for this quarter?","Charles D. Davidson","Actually, that was a commitment that was accrued at the time we entered into the JV. The accounting rules would say that you have to accrue that because it's a capital commitment. So that was all booked last year. And so obviously it's cash, but in terms of capital spend, that all went into our capital spend of 2011.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Yes, very quickly, I'm kind of curious about your East Pony project. And firstly, it's a very oily area, so are these wells on pump, cost-wise, a little more expensive than the wells in the extension area? And then, just a little more color on resource, have you guys come back and revised your outlook for this particular area? Then lastly, is the geology sort of continuous, or patchy, and then acres sort of look like a little rabbit ears. So I was wondering if that's the geology, or is it random?","David L. Stover","I'd say that if I can remember them in order here, Irene, on the first part, we would expect to go to pumping units on these sometime, maybe after a year or so. But right now, they're more starting out with gas lift initially and then actually holding these on some pretty tight chokes upfront, so we can continue to keep some back pressure on some of these and not open them wide open. That continues to seem to perform pretty well.","Charles D. Davidson","And on the, I think on the cost side, we were talking a little bit earlier, I think on an earlier question, about how we would expect costs to come down in this northern area as we go to more pad drilling and we can really do some concentrated wells. I was trying to get all this but before we get to the rabbit play, on the resources, we're working on that. We'll probably, in December, be able to provide an update for you on the resource potential of the entire Niobrara play. And I think that's a great -- I guess it's a rabbit or maybe it's a long-eared dog, but we got it as an East Pony and a West Pony, and I don't think there's any geologic reason that I can say there. It's just that we picked up some concentrated acreage positions and that's how it fell. And we continue to do a lot of seismic work on things, so we've got our own theories as to what's good and what's not good, but we kind of hold that tight.","Operator","And that concludes our Q&A session. I'll turn it back to our presenters for any closing remarks.","David R. Larson","I want to thank everyone again for participating in on our call today and certainly for their interest in Noble Energy. And I'd just like to hope to see all of you at our analyst conference on December 6, and have a great day.","Operator","That concludes today's conference call.

Following today's presentation, there will be opportunity to ask questions. Please note today's event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Whitmarsh. Please go ahead, sir.","Brad Whitmarsh - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you for joining us today. This morning, we issued our quarterly earnings release and new guidance for the remainder of the year. Following another strong quarter, we have again raised our full year volume outlook for Noble Energy while keeping our capital program consistent with prior expectations.","Our new guidance and comments today also incorporate an outlook for these new Texas assets, which we're excited to share following the closing of the Rosetta Resources acquisition in late July. We also posted to our website a number of supplemental slides for this call, which you'll find helpful as we talk through our prepared remarks. Later this morning, our 10-Q will be available as well.","Following prepared comments from Dave Stover, Chairman, President and CEO; and Gary Willingham, Executive VP of Operations, we'll open the call for questions and complete in about an hour. We ask that participants limit themselves to one primary question and one follow-up. Management members joining for the Q&A session are Ken Fisher, Executive VP and CFO; Susan Cunningham, Executive VP, Exploration and New Ventures; and Keith Elliott, Senior VP, Eastern Med.","I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains projections and forward-looking statements, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those items. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I want to share with you why I continue to have great confidence in our business and strategy. While these are challenging times in our industry, it does not diminish the fact that Noble Energy has exceptional assets, as well as the financial strength and operational excellence to realize their potential. Our positive momentum, including the recent closing of the Rosetta acquisition, gives us great optimism for the future as we continue to execute on our strategy of driving value from a high-quality diversified portfolio that provides investment choices.","Our core competitive advantages continue to be focused in U.S. onshore unconventional development, combined with material offshore explorations and proven major projects execution. Additionally, we have the financial strength to navigate through a volatile market and take advantage of opportunities. All oil and natural gas companies are facing choppy seas right now, but I believe investors are very well-positioned with Noble Energy. We continue to effectively manage the things that are within our control and position the business for long-term value creation.","Our diversified portfolio underpinned strong performance in the second quarter. Volumes again exceeded expectations, and meaningful reductions are being realized on both capital and operating costs. Sales volumes were nearly 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, even with the impact of scheduled facility maintenance in both the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa.","For the second time this year, we've raised our Noble Energy legacy volume outlook for the full year. This is a result of our flexibility to reallocate capital throughout the year as we continue to see efficiency improvements in the DJ Basin program. Second quarter capital expenditures declined sequentially to under $800 million and we remain on track to meet our original $2.9 billion capital forecast. Our capital is trending lower quarterly for the year as we manage the cash flow in the second half of the year.","I'm also extremely pleased with our progress in reducing cash cost, specifically in the onshore business where lease operating expense was reduced to approximately $4 per barrel of oil equivalent in the quarter. This is down more than 20% from the first quarter. Total lease operating expense per barrel of oil equivalent for Noble Energy is now back to pre-2010 level, reflecting our portfolio changes and an intense focus on reducing controllable costs.","Operational execution continues to be an area of keen focus as we look to maximize long-term profitability with a number of a major accomplishments achieved during the second quarter. This included onshore horizontal production growth of 45% versus the same quarter of last year and record low drilling times in both the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale. Drilled and completed costs all in are trending below targeted well costs in both plays.","In our offshore business, the Ashdod compression project in Israel has been completed, increasing our peak deliverability and, at the same time, pipeline installation and top site facility modifications are progressing as planned on Big Bend and Dantzler in the Gulf of Mexico. First production from these fields is expected in the fourth quarter and around the end of the year, respectively.","On the offshore drilling side, we have three rigs currently operating: one progressing our Gunflint development and two drilling material exploration wells, including prospects offshore of the Falkland Islands and Cameroon. So from an execution standpoint, I am pleased with how our business is operating.","The acquisition of Rosetta enhances and further diversifies our onshore unconventional portfolio by adding two premier, low-cost operating assets. Strong underlying asset performance results from other operators in and around our acreage, as well as recent M&A activity in these basins, continues to affirm the long-term value of our transaction. It was the right opportunity at the right time for Noble Energy.","These high-quality assets provide prolific and low-cost production in the Eagle Ford with running room and a deep inventory of liquids-rich opportunities in the emerging Delaware Basin. Without question, these new areas will have a substantial impact to Noble Energy. When you think about more than 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production, at least 1,800 identifiable locations and around 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent potential, that's a very sizable business that can grow materially into the future. We've hit the ground running and we're already seeing more value potential than we originally assumed.","Combined, our Texas assets will deliver 15% compound annual growth for several years within the operating cash flows of this business. As such, we aren't pulling capital away from any of our other strong return opportunities, which is one reason this investment was so unique.","As shown on slide 3, we now have sizable position in four of the premier U.S. unconventional plays. This provides substantial flexibility in our future capital allocation and the ability to accelerate activity when appropriate. We will also realize about $40 million per year in G&A synergies while taking advantage of Noble's lower cost of capital.","Let me now hand it over to Gary to walk through an operations update.","Gary W. Willingham - EVP-Global Production & Supply Chain Activities","Thanks, Dave. I'd like to start off by sharing my thoughts on why the Rosetta acquisition was such a great move for Noble Energy. Our technical knowledge of these basins was built over the last several years as our business development and new venture teams have set all of the best basins in the U.S.","From this work, two things became apparent. First, we needed to focus our existing onshore U.S. portfolio on the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale, which consistently rank among the top basins. This caused us to exit a number of other plays over the last few years. Second, we wanted to be ready to further enhance our portfolio by capturing opportunities in other competitive basins when they became available.","The Eagle Ford and Delaware basins are both top-tier plays, and we've now obtained premier positions in some of the best parts of each. Over the last few years, we have dramatically improved performance in the DJ Basin and then transferred and accelerated those learnings in the Marcellus. With the addition of the Eagle Ford and Delaware positions, we are confident that our operational expertise will again unlock incremental value that otherwise would not have been delivered.","Our acquisition model applied value almost entirely to the existing production, the Lower Eagle Ford inventory and the Upper Wolfcamp potential in the Delaware. We see a lot of room to increase value further, from multi-zone development in both plays, refrac potential and additional locations that are not assumed in our current counts.","The high quality nature of our Eagle Ford asset is demonstrated on slide 5. The map illustrates estimated recoveries per lateral foot in the basin. You can see the outline of our acreage, the largest being a core position in Northern Webb County, where we will focus our Eagle Ford activity over the next few years. This is a sweet spot of some of the most productive rock in the play with tremendous resource recoveries ranging between 1 million and 3 million barrels of oil equivalent per well based on a 5,000-foot lateral.","We have highlighted in the table our current assumptions, including inventory counts based on current strip pricing and assumed spacing, estimated ultimate recoveries and average well costs. Highlighted on slide 6 is the 3 million barrel equivalent type curve for South Gates Ranch represented by the blue line. This is an increase of 25% from Rosetta's prior type curve shown in red. The green line is the average of two recent wells, which are outpacing even our increased type curve by another 20%.","We've provided our detailed Eagle Ford activity plans on slide 7 showing accelerating well activity through at least 2018. Our plan is to focus on the lower Eagle Ford for the next few years, increasing well lateral length to an average of around 7,000 feet. We are currently drilling our first Eagle Ford well and have already implemented improvements that have materially increased footage drilled per day.","Moving over to the Permian, this is an area where we see tremendous value and upside as we accelerate appraisal activities and move quickly to development mode. The Delaware is emerging as a world-class basin with multi-zone potential. Development plans will include multi-well pad drilling, centralized production facilities, and the potential for long laterals, none of which were being done in these assets. We will rapidly incorporate and leverage learnings from the DJ Basin and the Marcellus as we plan the long-term development of the basin.","Our focus in the Permian will be on the Delaware Basin position, which is a contiguous 45,000 net acres. In the DJ Basin, we've already experienced the significant value uplift that a large-scale systematic development approach can bring in terms of maximizing recoveries, lowering capital and operating costs, and minimizing the above ground impacts.","On slide 8, we have shown how this acreage compares to our DJ Basin East Pony IDP area in terms of size. And so this is clearly a material position for Noble. We've already identified over 1,200 gross locations based on current strip prices for development with 70% of these in the Wolfcamp A and 3rd Bone Spring and the remainder in Lower Wolfcamp zones.","Highlighted on slide 9, our recent Noble wells and those from other operators in and around our acreage. For the Noble wells, the peak 30-day average production rate from a normalized 5,000-foot lateral is nearly 1,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day on a two-stream basis and more than 70% of this production is crude oil. These production rigs are impressive and consistent with other operator results in the area.","Similar to what we have shown for the Eagle Ford, we have provided our 700,000 barrel of oil equivalent type curve, again, for a 5,000-foot lateral on slide 10. This type curve is up 30% from Rosetta's previous type curve. Recent well performance represented by the 14 wells in the green line gives us a lot of confidence in the potential of these assets.","We've also highlighted on this slide some of the anticipated operating efficiencies that Noble Energy will bring to these assets. You can see the substantial reduction in drilling cost per lateral foot that we have driven in the DJ Basin and Marcellus versus historical performance in these areas. Combining Noble's drilling expertise and knowledge of multi-zone developments with Rosetta's skill set and knowledge will no doubt deliver substantial operational improvements in the Delaware.","On slide 11, we have provided our detailed plans for acceleration in the Permian, resulting in 70 wells drilled in 2018 and anticipating continued activity growth beyond that. Under the current plan, capital investment in the Delaware is essentially equivalent to the Eagle Ford beginning next year and exceeds the Eagle Ford beginning in 2018, with even earlier acceleration of the Delaware possible as our plans continue to evolve.","Our outlook for the combined sector's assets has production growing to more than 100,000 barrels equivalent per day in 2018, as shown on slide 12. We estimate substantial annual free cash flow at the end of our forecasted period, which would only provide additional investment flexibility.","I'll now transition to the DJ Basin, where both our underlying operational performance and the infrastructure capacity continue to improve. Spud-to-rig release time averaged just over six days in the quarter for a standard-length lateral. Last quarter, it was seven days, which was already below our budgeted assumption for 2015.","Dave mentioned well costs are trending under our target for the year. Second half 2015, all-in well costs, including drilling, completion and allocated facilities, are expected to be $3.5 million in Wells Ranch and $3.9 million in East Pony. These are both $300,000 below our budget assumptions.","In addition, when you normalize our long lateral well costs back to a normal-length equivalent well, we are slightly below $3 million for these more capital-efficient wells, and roughly 60% of our drilling in the second half of this year will be extended laterals.","With current rig efficiencies and four rigs for the rest of the year, we expect to drill a total of 240 equivalent wells in 2015 compared to our original budget expectation of about 200 with the same number of rigs. That's an amazing increase in performance and a key contributor to our 2015 production uplift.","On the completion side, we continue to optimize stage lengths, proppant loads and fluid types across our IDPs. Most recently, we've seen very strong performance utilizing slickwater in East Pony, with the majority of these wells outperforming similar hybrid gel completions nearby. Our success in growth in East Pony has been tremendous. Net production in the East Pony IDP is now approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 100% from this time a year ago. And as a reminder, more than 75% of East Pony volumes are oil.","At the end of the second quarter, third-party infrastructure in Greater Wattenberg got a much-needed boost, with the start-up of DCP's Lucerne-2 gas processing plant, which is ramping the full capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day. The addition of Lucerne-2 is increasing third-party gas capacity on the DCP system by a third, to a total of 800 million cubic feet per day.","Now, earlier this year in certain parts of the field, line pressures averaged north of 250 psi, which created a tough producing environment for many of the legacy vertical and horizontal wells. Since Lucerne-2 start-up, we've seen line pressures reduced by as much as 50 to 70 psi in the early part of July. And that should be even greater as the plant reaches full capacity.","Volumes through July averaged more than 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with peak days greater than 115,000 per day.","Additional infrastructure projects in the basin continue to progress on schedule as well, including the Grand Parkway low pressure gathering loop. The combination of all of these projects position the basin well exiting 2015 and into 2016. And while we remain guarded in our production guidance until consistent midstream performance is seen, the early look is certainly very positive.","Finally in the Marcellus Shale, our operations continue to improve. Our drilling teams are performing extremely well and we drilled our longest lateral ever as a company in the second quarter, nearly 14,000-foot horizontally. In addition, we're looking forward to production results from our first Utica well before the end of the year.","Given the price environment, we're further reducing drilling activity in the basin in alignment with our joint venture partner. In the middle part of the third quarter, operated horizontal drilling will be reduced to zero rigs for the remainder of the year. And on the dry gas non-operated side, we anticipate going from two horizontal rigs to zero early in the fourth quarter.","These shifts in drilling do not impact our completion schedule for the remainder of 2015 and we are working with our partner on the right level of investment for 2016 with both companies focused on a cash-neutral program for the JV next year.","Let me now hand it back to Dave.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Gary. I want to spend a few minutes on the progress on the regulatory front in Israel and our upgraded 2015 outlook before opening for questions.","Over the last several months, we've worked diligently with the government on establishing a regulatory framework to provide necessary certainty for future investments. The product is a comprehensive framework that addresses the needs and interest of all parties, including Noble Energy, the government and citizens of Israel, and its neighbors, who can all benefit from these abundant gas resources. Both the Prime Minister's Office and the Minister of Energy have endorsed the framework and are working to achieve final approval.","For Noble Energy, this framework should provide certainty around regulatory and fiscal matters necessary to support future investments in the expansion of Tamar and the first phase of development at Leviathan.","For Israel, it provides price transparency and market competition. These projects can develop additional gas supplies within the country and bring the financial and geopolitical benefits of regional exports. We continue to engage with future export customers in the region on the potential to deliver both Israeli and Cypriot gas to market. The opportunity for expansion of natural gas used in Israel and the demand for natural gas in the region remain strong.","I look forward to unlocking tremendous unrecognized value in Noble as these projects come together. Company-wise, there are a number of positive catalysts in the second half of the year, which provides us near- and long-term benefits. We are encouraged that production capacity in the DJ Basin will continue to respond positively as we benefit from important infrastructure expansions while we focus on long laterals and additional completion learnings through the remainder of the year.","As Gary mentioned, the integration of the Rosetta assets was going very well. With a strong second quarter, where volumes were higher and costs lower than expected, these assets are off to a great start and complementary to Noble's overall performance.","Offshore, two new fields are anticipated to add 20,000 barrels equivalent per day by the end of the year in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, we will have results on two material exploration prospects this quarter, including 250 million-barrel-plus Humpback prospect in the Falkland Islands and 100 million barrels plus Cheetah prospect in Cameroon. Success in either of these wells or with our Rhea well in the Falkland later this year would de-risk additional exploration potential, provide new development opportunity, and add significant value for Noble Energy.","As mentioned earlier, we are raising our previous full year 2015 volume guidance. I'm pleased that we can see this amount of increase while holding full year capital flat to original plan and maintaining flexibility in our onshore activity should conditions and cash flow outlook change.","We've also provided new quarterly guidance for the remainder of the year, which includes the integration of the Eagle Ford and Permian assets. Base guidance reflects the quarterly trend of lower capital and operating cost through the remainder of the year while underlying volumes growth. Yes, these are tough times, but we are well positioned with exceptional assets and strong operating and financial capacity to navigate through these challenges no matter the duration.","We've been very thoughtful in our decision processes throughout the year as we continue to maintain strong capital discipline and manage the cash flow in the second half of the year. I am convinced Noble Energy's future is very bright.","At this time, we would like to go ahead and open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Dave, I wonder if I could squeeze a couple in. My first one is really just a point of clarification I think on one of Gary's comments relating to cash, I guess breakeven or neutrality. Obviously, you're not there yet and you've got a bunch of start-ups in 2016 in the deepwater, I guess, back-end of this year and 2016. So, what should we think in terms of you getting to cash breakeven? Is that an objective for management? Or do you expect to continue spending for the time being? And I've got a follow-up, please.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Doug, when you look at how we're managing the cash flow, if you look how that plays out this year, and especially when you \u2013 I refer you to the guidance we laid out for third and fourth quarter. You see our capital spend continues to come down dramatically as we enter the fourth quarter. A big part of that is the roll-off, if you will, of the capital spending on some of those Gulf of Mexico projects.","We'll actually have Dantzler on here by middle of the fourth quarter and \u2013 or, I mean, Big Bend by middle of the fourth quarter and Dantzler by the end of the year. So, you'll have two of the three big projects and their capital spend actually rolling off. So, we expect to be \u2013 even in this $50 to $60 world, we expect to be managing the cash flow here by the end of the year, and that will set us up very nicely for next year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's what I was hoping to hear. Thanks, Dave. My follow-up is I'm sure there's going to be a ton of questions on Rosetta. So, I'm going to go to a different one, if I may, which is the Marcellus decision to take rigs away there. I'm just wondering if you could tell us what the underlying decline rate is going to look like in the Marcellus with no rigs running. And I'll let someone else take the other ones. Thanks.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Doug, I think the real decision there is that it's not the time to be continuing to drill wells in the Marcellus with the outlook on gas price till we see that change. That being said, with some of the completion inventory and some of the completion activity, we'll still be ramping up in the second half of this year. And I think we'll still be flat to up some next year with that inventory, even with the drilling activity. I think the real impact of the drilling activity is when you start to look at the late 2016 and into 2017 timeframe. And then, that will be dependent on \u2013 when we ramp back up will be dependent on our outlook for gas price.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, we shouldn't confuse no drilling rigs with no completion activity, is that what you're basically saying?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. Right.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Okay. Thanks very much, Dave.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Good morning, guys.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Dave.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Real quickly, following up on the CapEx just a little bit for 2016. If I look at your run rate in Q4, can I assume that that's kind of the run rate you'll be doing on a quarterly basis going forward plus incrementals associated with Delaware and Eagle Ford kind of round numbers? And I know you don't want to commit to a number, but put you down year-over-year, maybe around the 2.8 type number?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Dave. I think when we look at 2016, and you're right, it's too early to get too far ahead of ourselves, but when you at it and you look at how we're finishing this year and how we're set up for next year, we've got a lot of flexibility. I mean, when I sit here and look at 2016, managing the cash flow, we can be down significantly in capital and still realize low to mid-single-digit production growth.","So, I think that positions us extremely well, and that flexibility allows us to adapt to a changing environment and a changing cash flow environment to be ready to accelerate when it makes sense and to be able to have the flexibility to hold back if that makes sense, but still have a growing business.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Okay. I appreciate that color. And then maybe one more just flipping over to the Delaware, where you guys outlined your cost on an annual basis in the wells, obviously, when I look at 2016, if I just did the math on wells versus capital, it would assume a pretty high cost that comes down dramatically by 2018 to about $5.4 million a well. I assume 2016 is incorporating upfront infrastructure associated with kind of the IDPs. And maybe if that's the case, could you talk to us a little bit about the capital or cash flow savings benefits you see from IDPs?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Dave. We wanted to make sure we laid out for all of the Rosetta assets what our plan looks like for the next three years. So, I'd take a hard look at all that. I'll have Gary add some color to some of this. But I'll start with that \u2013 when you look at 2016 and even the future years on some of the Delaware piece, you've got a mix of operated and non-operated spend in there, and I think we asterisked that. I think you also have some facility capital upfront as you put in some of this.","You brought up the point of the IDPs, and I think \u2013 and we showed kind of the overlay how that Delaware Basin acreage compares to, for example, an East Pony acreage position up there. I think it sets up extremely well for being able to apply the IDP concept in some that value that that will bring over time. But let me have Gary just talk a little bit more.","Gary W. Willingham - EVP-Global Production & Supply Chain Activities","Yeah, Dave. That's right. I mean, it's largely driven by fluctuations that we forecast in non-op activity in addition to some upfront infrastructure costs. And Dave's right. Our experience in the DJ Basin has clearly shown that pre-investing in infrastructure in these areas certainly pays off in the long run. Every time we look at our performance in the DJ, we see 25% to 30% uplift in the present value of those projects by our IDP-type concept in the integrated infrastructures. So we do have some pretty investment in there for that as well.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Okay. I really appreciate that added color. Thank you, guys, and great work.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Maybe if I can follow up on capital one more time. As you think about the run rate into 2016 and the priority this outline up to this point, if commodity prices were to be lower or higher, can you talk a little bit about how you would prioritize either further reduction in capital? Or if the commodity price were a little bit higher, where we should expect to see additional acceleration or capital increase?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think we've added some more flexibility and diversity when you look at our mix of onshore assets now. I think between the Marcellus, we've talked about our thinking about that going into the year. On the DJ, we'll continue to see the impact of the Lucerne-2 plant coming up. We'll see the line-looping system later this year, so I'll give some more insight on how we want to play off capital and match capital with capacity going into next year. And then in both the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford, we've laid out our base plan. I'd say all of those, we got the flexibility to adapt and adjust if it makes sense when you look at the commodity outlook.","Our big offshore projects, the only one really we'll still have in play next year, we'll be finishing Gunflint. The majority of that investment will be done by this year. We'll have Gunflint on line by middle of next year. We finished the compression project at Ashdod this year, so the next investment in Israel will be dependent on this framework coming together.","So, I think we're in real good place there on the exploration front. We'll have our rig in the Gulf of Mexico focused on appraisal and exploration next year. But overall, we're well positioned to bring capital down, continue to follow the trend that we've got into the fourth quarter this year, and then make sure we're managing to the outlook that we see.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And is there explicit commodity price implicit in the guidance for the Delaware and Eagle Ford programs?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think what we've laid out is implicit as kind of the strip price we've been seeing -","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...here recently. So, that's in that 50 to 60-some range over the next year or two.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And then maybe if I can ask one on the revisions to the type curve, you talked about a few of the things that you're doing differently, but can maybe -","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","... they've been impressive obviously, particularly in a relatively short period of time.","Can you talk a little bit about the primary drivers of the revisions up to this point, changes that you've made and maybe the types of wells that we're drilling? I know there's some in lateral length, and maybe even what you're seeing on the most recent performance that's still exceeding the revised type curves?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'll let Gary expand on it, but really it comes down to just the recent well performance. Not only our recent well performance, but recent well performance in the basin, for example, in the Delaware. And then in the Eagle Ford, we have history, especially as you move into South Gates Ranch from some wells that were drilled previously and then the more recent wells. So, you have a nice database in both areas. Gary?","Gary W. Willingham - EVP-Global Production & Supply Chain Activities","Yeah, Ryan. First off, as I mentioned, lateral length, those curves are normalized to a 5,000-foot lateral. So even though we're drilling longer and longer laterals in the area, that's not driving the type curve. Dave's right. It's really two things: It's moving more south into the Gates Ranch area, which is a much more prolific area, and then it's just continuing to improve on the completion designs.","Very similar to what we've done in the DJ Basin and the Marcellus with reduced stage and cluster spacing and also starting to increase our sand loadings up to 2,000 pounds in some cases. So, a lot of the same types of things we've done in the other areas, just bringing them to the Eagle Ford and soon to be the Permian as well.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. I'll leave it there.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Just wanted to get a little bit more color on Israel. When you guys expect to see a vote, and I guess a final approval, do you have a rough timeframe for the new regulatory framework? And then additionally, if that occurs, when will you guys start spending capital there?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Leo, I mean we're watching it as everybody is, as the government kind of gone through the public process and they're in the process of working to bring that framework to final resolution, final approval. I think we're both committed and still remain committed to seeing this done by the end of the summer. But I'll say the timing is important on this, but the actual lasting and sustainable framework and the nature of the framework and having a framework that allows us to move forward with investment, it is really the most important element.","I think what's very encouraging so far is that \u2013 and think back about this. When you go back to over the last year what's been accomplished, I mean, the progress on getting to a framework has been nothing short of a tremendous effort on all parties, on party of the government that's committed to doing this and on our team and our partners that have worked so hard to bring that to bear. I mean, a complete, comprehensive framework that sets up the ability to go forward with confidence and investment is a big step.","Another big step has been the commitment and support of the Prime Minister's Office and the Energy Ministry to make this happen. So I think when you look at it, the step of getting the framework to where it is and now the recognition and understanding of how important this is, not only to the country, but to the region, has just been tremendous.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful color. And I guess just shifting gears over to the exploration front, obviously you guys are drilling away at, I guess, Humpback in the Falkland and Cheetah as well. Do you guys kind of have a rough probability of success on each of those two wells, respectively?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll go through what we've kind of laid out on probabilities and then Susan can probably give you some more insight as to her thoughts on both of those wells. And then, also don't forget the Rhea prospect later this year, which probably has a slightly higher probability.","I think on Humpback and Cheetah, they're both in that 25%, plus or minus 25% range; both interesting, exciting prospects; both with a little different color. In Humpback, that's our first true exploration test on this huge acreage position down in the Falklands. I mean, you think about it, you think about how our acreage position overlays the North Sea, for example. It's just our position down there in the Falkland that's about half of the North Sea. That'll be really interesting to see what transpires here as we break out a new play, but it's a new play in areas where there's been proven hydrocarbon discovery, some fairly significant when you look at the whole scheme of things.","In Cameroon, you know, to me what's exciting there it's like Gulf of Mexico prospect on steroids, as I've talked about it, when you look at the shallow water depths and the high potential, but let me turn it over to the real expert here. Susan?","Susan M. Cunningham - Executive VP-Global Exploration, New Ventures, Frontier, EHSR & Business Innovation","Thanks, Dave. Yeah, Dave, the 25% is about right, plus or minus, for the two prospects that are drilling right now, and Rhea will be higher than that regardless of the outcome of Humpback. What's great about Humpback is the follow-up. It's over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent just in that immediate area if we have some encouragement there. So it's pretty significant. And Cheetah is only 10 miles offshore from the coast in Cameroon and it's in about 85 feet of water, so it will be very quick and easy and cheap to tie in and to develop if it's successful.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. Thanks, guys.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Leo.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning, Dave, and to the rest of your team there. I was wondering if I could ask a bit about the Eagle Ford assets and your outlook there. I think you mentioned in your prepared comments and also on the slides that your location count at the strip. But as I look at these assets, one of the things that set them apart is the NGL percentage. The Street is a little more obscure when it comes to talking about NGLs. Can you talk about what your current assumptions are there and what your outlook is, especially in light of it's been kind of the \u2013 maybe it's take it on the chin hard here in 2015 and maybe what your thoughts are for an outlook and how that affects your appetite for those NGL-heavy assets?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think it's something you have to take a hard look at, Charles. I think as we've looked at it, we've not assumed that NGL pricings are really going to change a lot this year. I think as we look at it and visit with our marketing folks that probably into next year, as you get more ships and so forth, especially can move more propane and butane that just start to see some real alleviation of pressure there.","That being said, you are close to the Gulf Coast and some of the Gulf Coast markets with the Eagle Ford volume, so that's helpful. But it's just part of the mix that we take into effect and account when we look at the economics of these. And I'll say the economics of the Eagle Ford, especially as you're hearing Gates Ranch and South Gates Ranch, stack up with everything and anything even considering all those...","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. So, David, I think I heard that you think there'll be some improvement of NGL prices in the 2016, 2017 timeframe as you get more export capacity.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's what we're hopeful. I think it's going to take something like that to really change that outlook.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you. And then on the Delaware Basin, can you talk about \u2013 the slide you put together with your results and energy results is really helpful. And you really focus on the Wolfcamp A there, but can you talk about what \u2013 you mentioned other zones. Can you talk about what those other zones are going to be, in rough order, of what you think the prospectivity is? And what your timeline would be to test some of those other concepts?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean you're right, Charles, that we're focusing initially on the Wolfcamp A. And I think within that, you have to look at how do you most effectively drain that whole Wolfcamp A horizon. I think there's opportunities to maybe even have multiple laterals, not that we're counting on that in that Wolfcamp A that also start to pick up some of that 3rd Bone Spring drainage.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But I think those would be the two initial pieces. And then you move down to kind of B and C as a longer term optionality that I don't doubt the industry will break out economically over time, but we're not counting on it.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. So, that kind of more extensive development of the Wolfcamp A that could get the 3rd Bone Spring, that's something we could maybe start to see in 2016.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think as we get into 2016, 2017, and also in 2018 where we kind of start to see the Delaware program really ramp up, you'll start to draw in some of that horizon. So, we'll start to see some impact from that from \u2013 but really, still what we've laid out as a plan is landing all our laterals into Wolfcamp A.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Though we haven't specifically target landing a lateral in the Bone Springs yet in that program.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you, Dave.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Brian.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","When you built your position in the DJ, you followed your Patina acquisition with the U.S. Exploration acquisition. As you look to the Eagle Ford and Permian, what's your ultimate goal in terms of the size of the position you're looking for and do you see additional opportunities that are front and center in this downturn to make that happen?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Brian, I'll go back to what we've talked about since we announced the Rosetta acquisition. One of the first keys to Rosetta was to be comfortable that, in and of itself, it had an enough size and growth within those assets that it wasn't dependent on another acquisition.","That said, being in the neighborhood, I think we'll continue to look at what's available out there and make sure we understand the value of different opportunities. I'd say we have a strong, solid balance sheet that gives us the ability and flexibility to be able to take advantage of opportunities if a great opportunity came around. But that's not the focus of what we're doing now. The focus of what we're doing now is on execution. And I think you can see that showing up not only in what was delivered in the first half of the year, but what were set up to deliver in the second half of the year, and that's the same focus we're applying to the Rosetta assets.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's a good tie-in to my follow-up, which is on that execution point in the legacy assets, the increased guidance that seem to reflect a lot of your outlook for a second-half uplift. Can you just talk more specifically about the drivers of the increased production guidance between the Marcellus, DJ, or elsewhere?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Glad to, Brian. Actually, we've been looking forward to this call for a period of time because we've been looking forward to getting to midyear here. The exciting part for us is we put a plan in effect at the beginning of the year and we got in motion very, very quickly. And now, we're benefiting from the results of delivering on that plan. I'd say we're actually ahead of that plan, and I think that's framed in what you look at for the outlook for the second half of the year.","When you go back to what we started the year, we ramped down and pushed down the Marcellus program pretty quickly. We very quickly reduced activity levels in the DJ from 10 rigs to 4. We level-loaded and kind of slowed down some of our completion activity so we could get Lucerne-2 in place. As a result of how things have moved through the year, we actually saw some of the Marcellus planned capital come down. We actually moved some of that capital to the DJ. Part of that was a reflection on just the continued improvement on efficiency.","We've talked before about those four rigs are drilling about 70% of the total lateral footage that we did with 10 rigs. So that's all enabled us to where the real driver in the second half of the year, and the biggest driver in that increased guidance is the outlook on this activity and performance in the DJ.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And that's partly, as you say, on the well productivity front but also on just unlocking midstream bottlenecks.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think it all comes together, and Gary may have some more to add on his thoughts there.","Gary W. Willingham - EVP-Global Production & Supply Chain Activities","Yeah. I think it's unlocking the midstream bottlenecks, which we had some increase in there in the original budget, but we've added a bit more based on the early results we're seeing. It's partly the underlying improvement and the completions. We mentioned the phenomenal success that we've seen recently in East Pony and then it's just a greater number of wells coming online throughout the year as we've continued to drive down the drilling times.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Morris with Citi.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Gary, you confirmed that the increase in the type curves at Gates Ranch and Eagle Ford were driven a lot by the cluster spacing and the sand loadings. I know overall costs have come down, but on today's costs, can you quantify for every 30% or the 25% to 30% increase in EURs what the associated increase in cost is percentage-wise for doing the cluster spacing in the greater proppant loading?","Gary W. Willingham - EVP-Global Production & Supply Chain Activities","Yeah, Bob. I think it's probably on the 10% range. But at the same time, I think we've got greater efficiencies that are going to offset quite a bit of that. I think when you look at what we're seeing already on the drilling side since we've closed the deal, we have been able on these first couple of wells to significantly improve the drilling times, especially through the lateral length. And I think at the end of the day, we're going to be able to take probably conservatively a couple of days off of the average drill time on the Eagle Ford well. So certainly, more stages or more cluster spacing and greater sand loadings adds to the cost, but we see some efficiencies offsetting that.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then a second question just on refracs. In the Marcellus, I know you're laying down all your rigs this year, but will you continue to test refracs in the Marcellus and what have you seen there? And then in the Eagle Ford, you mentioned some of the upside being potential for refracs. What gives you confidence that refracs can be successful in that play?","Gary W. Willingham - EVP-Global Production & Supply Chain Activities","Yeah. It's a combination really of refrac and in some cases, adding perfs or tightening up those cluster spacing, just like we're doing on the new completion. So we may have a few more scheduled in the Marcellus this year. I don't think it's going to be a significant number, but the early results we've seen on the ones we've done have been very encouraging, initial rates back up to the original initial rates in many cases.","I think what gives us the same level of confidence in the Eagle Ford is on those older completions. Very much kind of a similar story to the Marcellus, much wider stage spacing, fewer perf clusters, and so it's an opportunity to go in and not only add perfs, but improve the completion designs as well. So I think we'll see some nice uplift there as well.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","When do you plan to do your first refrac in Eagle Ford?","Gary W. Willingham - EVP-Global Production & Supply Chain Activities","Oh, I don't know we've got one on the schedule yet. We may try a couple before year-end, but I would suspect 2016 will be more of a test.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Rowe with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Yes. Good morning. Just want to quickly confirm that your Marcellus capital spending for this year is still going to be maintained at that $700 million level. And does the DJ Basin also staying at $1.1 billion, given the additional wells that you talked about adding into the program?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Michael. I think on the Marcellus, it's probably just a hair under that, which permits the DJ maybe a being a hair above that. So, I think plus or minus $100 million on either of those.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. I got it. And then just one corporately, can you just talk about how comfortable you are with your current hedge book and discuss how you're going to approach adding on more protection given the volatility?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'll make a few comments and then Ken Fisher can add to that, because he watches that continuously. Drags me into more meetings than I can believe on that. But, no, we're taking a hard look at that all the time. I mean, we do meet on that probably every couple of weeks to look at what makes sense; how is the market move; how are we positioned for not just the current year, but the following two years as we look at both our global oil mix and our domestic gas mix. It's also a time period where we reflect and remind ourselves how appreciative we are of having our Israel gas contribution, also that's kind of a natural hedge, additional hedge, if you will.","But we continue to look for periods especially in any market upswings, which we'd like to see more of on a commodity basis. But as we get into some market upswings, how do we layer in some positions as we go forward? Our philosophy and objective has been to hedge up to 50% on those different streams for managing cash flow. I think with our legacy position on oil, we were about 30% for next year. And I think on gas, it was 25% to 28%, somewhere in that range. But I'll let Ken add up a little more color.","Kenneth M. Fisher - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I mean, as Dave said, the program has been very successful through time, ensuring that we cut off the tail risk. So, if you look at it historically, we had big positive settlements in 2009 in the global financial crisis, and then we'll have about $750 million in settlement this year. We're, as Dave mentioned, about 30% hedged on oil; 25% hedged on gas going into next year. We don't typically make big moves all at one time, but average in, so we'll continue to look at that.","And then we picked up the Rosetta hedge book as well and they're pretty well hedged as well, about 35% for oil and 45% on gas production next year. So, all in all, our competitive position on the hedge book is strong and it's a shock absorber that allows us to realize those gains as we bring down the capital plan for the current investment environment and achieve cash flow neutrality.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Kelly with Seaport Global.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Just hoping to get a little bit more color on the production profile in the DJ. You dropped sequentially Q1 to Q2, but the July numbers look good. And with the midstream constraints abating and efficiency gains become more apparent, just hoping just talk about what the progression could look like here in the second half and then maybe just initial thoughts going into 2016 there.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'll start with that, Mike, and then have Gary provide some more insights. But, yeah, as Gary said in his notes, in his dialogue earlier, we've still remained pretty guarded as to what the full impact of this Lucerne-2 facility will be and then still what the line-loop will be later this year. We're seeing some very good encouraging results.","I would say we expect volumes to be up from second quarter and third and fourth. But I think it'll be nice to get this Lucerne-2 plant fully ramped up. It's been down here for \u2013 not down, but it's been impacted by the fact that they've had another facility planned maintenance that we still got a couple of weeks to see the full impact out there, but we've been very pleased \u2013 very, very pleased with what we've seen so far as that's ramped up. And let me have Gary give you some more color on that.","Gary W. Willingham - EVP-Global Production & Supply Chain Activities","Yeah. Mike, it's \u2013 3Q and 4Q will definitely be up from 2Q in our guidance. I'd second what Dave said. We're being very guarded, I would say, at this point until we see more of a sustained performance. The early look is very encouraging though, and we've said we're north of 110,000 in July, peak days greater than 115,000. We've actually even seen a couple of days in the 120,000 range. So that is all without Lucerne-2 running at full capacity yet and they haven't yet made it to the 200 million a day.","In the meantime, as Dave mentioned, they've had another facility down for some planned maintenance, which took about 120 million a day out of the system capacity. So that's part of the reason we're still being a bit conservative for now until we see more than just a couple of days with some decent rates through the system. But I think from the early performance we're seeing, line pressures down 50 psi to 75 psi across the field when they've got everything up and running, very excited about what we're seeing. I think we'll see some very nice numbers in the 3Q and 4Q there.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And should really position us well as we exit the year.","Gary W. Willingham - EVP-Global Production & Supply Chain Activities","And as we exit the year, then the Grand Parkway starts up, which provides even greater pressure relief and allows us even a better opportunity to get some of those legacy vertical volumes that have been so constrained over the last year-and-a-half into the plants.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Great, guys. Good color. And the follow-up is on the Eagle Ford. If you look at the page 5 of your presentation here, it does look like it's a pretty big delta in the lateral foot EURs and you talked about the kind of the sweet spot here in the Southern Gates Ranch area. Maybe you could talk about the difference in returns between that acreage versus what you'd seize in the Upper Eagle Ford and what you've categorized as other Lower Eagle Ford. And then as a follow-up to that, just what the opportunity set is to ultimately see the number of gross locations increase in that kind of 600 Boe per lateral foot area. Thank you.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'll start with that. But, yeah, I mean the Southern Gates Ranch, Eagle Ford is the best of the best down there. And you can see that even when you compare that across all the Eagle Ford acreage in the basin. It is a pure sweet spot there.","And then when you compare it \u2013 so it's got the highest returns, obviously. I'd say everything that we've put on here has a decent return at a strip price, especially when you look out into the future. And the Upper Eagle Ford probably has the most challenge yet, but I think we've got plenty of time before we get to those opportunities, and I would expect we'll continue to improve the outlook on those by the time we get there beyond that 2018 time period. But Gary, did you have anything else?","Gary W. Willingham - EVP-Global Production & Supply Chain Activities","Yeah. The South Gates Ranch is really is the area we're focusing in right now. And when you look at how prolific those wells are, I mean we see returns even in current strip price conditions of 75% to 100% returns in those areas, so extremely strong economics.","The other Gates Ranch, Lower Eagle Ford is obviously lower return than that given the EUR per lateral foot, but still quite economic in this price environment. And then as Dave mentioned, the Upper Eagle Ford is the most challenged to-date, but we do have awhile before we get there. So, hopefully, we'll see a little help on those from prices improving in the meantime. I'm confident we'll see help between now and then as we continue to refine the completion techniques in the areas where we're working in the meantime.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And it's also worth noting that those locations referenced are only the locations that met an economic hurdle within the strip pricing environment. So, more opportunity beyond that if we get a little better in pricing environment at some point.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Herrlin from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Thanks. Regarding the Delaware, you've given an outline of how you're going to spend in terms of drilling completions and IDPs. Would it be your best interest to own more infrastructure there so you don't have similar bottlenecks as you've had in the DJ with a third-party GTP or you'll just kind of run your business strategically like you did in the DJ and the Delaware?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. John, I think when you look at it, there's probably more infrastructure close to there in the basin than there was with what we started in the DJ.","That being said, I think as we continue to look at how to create the most value, both from integrating the subsurface with the surface facility piece, and especially as we start getting further into an IDP concept, we'll continue to look as to what makes sense from an overall facility structure. But I think this is all about going in and having a totally integrated plan, if you will, that includes everything from how you produce it under the ground, how you market it on the surface.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Dave. Last one for me is on the estimated dry hole cost for Humpback and Cheetah. Susan, could you give me that?","Susan M. Cunningham - Executive VP-Global Exploration, New Ventures, Frontier, EHSR & Business Innovation","I don't have that.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think, yeah. If I remember right, John, on the Humpback, it's plus or minus $100 million well, I think.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And we've got, what, 35% and we're paying a little disproportionate higher percentage than that as far as what it took to get into the play.","On Cheetah, it's a much cheaper well. I think that's maybe in the $60 million-type range, maybe on the high side on that. But, again, on Humpback, a big part of the cost is mobilization cost; also the allocated mobilization down there part of the rig sharing. But I think those are order of magnitude, and Susan will correct me if I'm wrong.","Susan M. Cunningham - Executive VP-Global Exploration, New Ventures, Frontier, EHSR & Business Innovation","Yeah, that's correct. Those are exactly the right order of magnitude.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from Philip Jungwirth with BMO.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Phil.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","With the increase in Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp EURs, is there a reason the 800,000 Boe a day production target by 2018 is unchanged with this improvement and recoveries already considered at the time of acquisition or is this just conservatism around giving multi-year growth target?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We've matched up the growth with the capital spend and the activity level. Again, you've got flexibility here as conditions change and more information available to continue to update that. But what we're doing right now is honoring the activity level and performance that we've input into the model to layout that three-year program along with the capital and cash flow that it provides. So we'll continue to update that as we go. We're just two weeks into this since we've closed, but very excited about what we've got and where we're going.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. And then with minimal capital being allocated to Marcellus in the second half and likely into 2016 and Noble having a deep portfolio of high return opportunities to allocate capital towards, how strategic is this asset to the company? And do we need to consider anything about the JV structure impacting a potential divestiture should you choose that route?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think what we like about the Marcellus, it is still the premier gas play in the U.S. And when you look at the operational performance, it's been outstanding out there, but it's that operational performance across the industry that's contributed to this supply-demand imbalance. I think when you look about at it, though, you love having a high-quality asset that's the premier asset in its mix in the portfolio and the optionality that that gives you for the future with the tremendous amount in running room.","The other thing that's I think very nice about our position and same with the JV is the fact that it's all essentially held by production out there. So you have the flexibility to adapt to changing conditions and make sure that you're making smart decisions on how you create the most value out of an asset like this.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Can you update us on your latest thoughts around the DJ Basin midstream MLP? I didn't see a mention in the presentation. Just any color around specific assets, invested capital or EBITDA would help.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. On the DJ midstream, we've worked and we've talked about it over the last couple of calls being in position and having the asset set up so that we've got flexibility on how we monetize and create value and leverage our midstream business up there, if you will. So we've got that in place. I think we still have the flexibility to decide what we want to do with that.","When you look at that part of the business that we've kind of bracketed, if you will, if I remember right and Ken will straight me up if I misquote this, but I think we've probably spent $500 million to $600 million invested in those assets so far.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Irene Haas with Wunderlich.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Hello. This will be quick. Question on Cyprus, so a little more color on the timeline. From this point on, how many sort of months would we require to kind of get through the necessary steps to probably first production?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Cyprus, it's still ways off in the future, but it's a great opportunity. We got a sizable discovery there. I think the next steps in Cyprus are establishing a market which we're in discussions with potential customers on, and then establishing someone to invest and put the equity and then laying the pipeline that's probably be required to establish and tie in that market. So I think that's the sequence of things, Irene.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","So it's going to be a subsea pipeline or what are we thinking?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Definitely, I think what you'd be thinking is a subsea line. One of the possibilities is a line from Cyprus that would tie in to Egypt given the needs and the regional demand in that part of the world, but that's why we got to get the customers in place first and also the equity owners in a pipeline. I think when you think of things over there, we've got three big projects over there between Tamar expansion, Leviathan and Cyprus that are all pretty interesting in their own rights.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","So, great. We're looking at two to three years possibly.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'd say at least that period. I think what we're thinking of on something like that, the end-of-the-decade type of thing. Keith, do you have any additional thoughts on that?","J. Keith Elliott - Senior VP-Eastern Mediterranean Region","Yes. So for first production looking at late 2019, mid-2020 kind of timeframe, I think in terms of sequence forward, really we're progressing the marketing efforts now, as Dave described, in building a project team and progressing toward a project FID that would put us in place for that kind of late, late in the decade first production.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Great.

[Operator Instructions]","Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Whitmarsh. Please go ahead.","Brad Whitmarsh","Thank you, Chad, and thanks to all of you for joining today\u2019s conference call. I hope you have had a chance to review the news releases and presentation deck that we published this morning. These materials are available on the Investors page of our website and they highlight our strong 2019 and an updated capital allocation framework with specifics on our 2020 plans. Later today we will file our 10-K with the SEC.","I want to remind everyone that today\u2019s discussion contains projections and forward-looking statements, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures in our latest news releases and SEC filings for a discussion of those items.","Following our prepared remarks, we will hold a question-and-answer session. I would ask that analysts limit themselves to one primary and one follow-up. Our planned comments this morning will come from Dave Stover, Chairman and CEO; as well as Brent Smolik, President and COO. Also joining us for Q&A is Ken Fisher, EVP and CFO; Hodge Walker, SVP of Onshore; and Keith Elliott, our SVP of Offshore. I also want to extend a welcome to Robin Fielder, SVP of Midstream who is joining us for her first call as well. Our planned comments will go about 25 minutes and we will wrap up today\u2019s call in an hour.","With that, I will turn the call to Dave.","Dave Stover","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. At this time last year, I started my comments by saying we were on the cusp of something very unique and very special. Today, I am excited to highlight how we have now delivered and poured the foundation for Noble Energy to provide a differential future for investors.","I want to start this morning by taking a proud look back at 2019, which was a remarkable year for the company as we executed on our strategy of a low cost diversified E&P, delivering moderate growth and sustainable free cash flow to our shareholders.","As highlighted in our fourth quarter press release and slides, we finished the year with another impressive quarter of operational execution and cost discipline. Production was toward the high end of expectation, and capital and unit production expenses were again below plan.","For the full year 2019, we delivered extremely well on all areas in our control. It was quite possibly the best year of execution and delivery of our strategic objectives of many years that I have experienced in this business. I want to congratulate the Noble Energy and Noble Midstream teams, our partners and shareholders for all that we accomplished last year. Many of our accomplishments can be seen on slide three.","Beginning the year, we lowered our capital expectations 17% from 2018 levels, while anticipating 5% pro forma volume growth. We actually drove nearly 7% total production growth on 25% less capital. Combined our capital savings of $240 million and operating cost reduction of $120 million improved our total cash flow by $360 million from where we expected when we started 2019.","In our U.S. Onshore business, we delivered 10% total equivalent and 10% oil growth over 2018, while achieving record safety performance for the year. We promised to have Leviathan on production by year end and did so, at more than $200 million under budget.","Also in our Eastern Med business, we substantially expanded the total quantities of our gas sales contracts into Egypt, while securing a pathway through the acquisition of interest in the EMG pipeline. In West Africa, we sanctioned the Alen Gas Monetization Project and first production remains on schedule for early 2021, driving incremental cash flow and volumes next year. We also commenced production from the Aseng 6P oil well, which is producing in excess of expectation.","2019 was an exceptional year for reserves as we replaced 233% of our production at just over $7 per equivalent barrel development cost. U.S. Onshore approved developed reserves were added an attractive cost of under $8 per equivalent barrel.","On the portfolio side, we continued to build long-term value potential for Noble Energy with an exploration farm in offshore, Colombia and we added to our low-cost unconventional acreage position, now totaling over 200,000 acres, primarily in the Powder and Green River Basins in Wyoming.","We targeted $500 million to $1 billion in portfolio proceeds for 2019 and we were able to achieve that outcome with full year proceeds of over $800 million, including $670 million from the Noble Midstream transaction. This helped us close the -- close out the year with $4.5 billion in financial liquidity.","I was also pleased that our Board approved a 9% increase in our dividend last year, reflecting confidence from the significant cash flow increase that is occurring in 2020.","On the ESG front, I mentioned earlier, our record Onshore safety performance in 2019, we noted other advancements in our eighth Annual Sustainability Report and our first Climate Resilience Report, which utilize the TCFD framework. We also welcomed Martha Wyrsch to our board in December, our third new member in the last two and half years.","The greatest single achievement in 2019 was successfully bringing Leviathan Offshore Israel on production. The safe and successful execution of this unique development has been world-class, continuing our exceptional track record of major project delivery.","We are already delivering volumes into Israel, Jordan and Egypt, making it the first time in Israel\u2019s history to have significant exports to regional customers. Brent will provide more details on the fields ramp up and sales outlook, but I am extremely pleased with the early production history and reservoir performance. The notion that world-class fields get bigger and better certainly applies to Leviathan.","An essential part of Noble\u2019s competitive advantage comes from the blend of short cycle Onshore unconventional assets with world-class Offshore conventional assets. Few companies have this combination in their portfolio. This asset mix provides us investment optionality, a top tier corporate decline rate and the ability to build the company in a capital efficient manner focused on generating returns.","If you have seen slide nine before and we have updated it to highlight a real differentiator for Noble Energy. With Leviathan now on production, we expect our total company annual production decline rate to be in the low 20% range.","You can see how well that positions us compared to the decline profiles of key U.S. Onshore basins. This year we expect over 30% of our production and nearly 40% of our operating cash flows to come from our conventional low decline assets. This provides more certainty of cash flows, lower maintenance capital and ultimately positions us to make the right capital allocation decisions for our shareholders in all macro environment.","We have also updated slide 10, which represents our multiyear capital allocation framework. As compared to last year, 2020\u2019s model reflects a substantial improvement in our maintenance capital needs from $1.6 billion projected annually to $1.4 billion going forward. The improvement primarily reflects the significant reduction in oil costs from our Onshore business.","This framework remains highly focused on generating strong returns through commodity cycles and driving sustainable free cash flow. As mentioned many times before, our planning targets the following; one, plan the business for a long-term WTI oil price of $50 per barrel to $60 per barrel; two, generate a competitive free cash flow yield annually with significant return to investors, focus on delivering at least $500 million in upstream free cash flow this year with the potential to continue to grow going forward; three, maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility; and four, drive a long-term production growth CAGR of 5% to 10%.","For 2020, we have set our capital budget at $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion at the upstream level, as we prioritize our free cash flow generation and balance sheet support over additional growth.","Capital spend for 2020 is estimated down 25% from last year while production volumes should grow 10% and operating cash flow grows even higher. This occurs as our margins improve with Leviathan startup but also from the allocation of capital within the U.S. Onshore business unit. Brent will touch on this more later. But even with level year-on-year onshore equivalent volumes, we expect moderate U.S. Onshore oil growth.","Use of free cash flow will continue to be prioritized for return to investors through dividend growth and balance sheet improvement. With everything we have delivered in 2019 and recognizing commodity price volatility, I am even more confident now in our ability to generate sustainable free cash flow, while continuing to build our business.","This year we have also modified our short-term and long-term compensation programs to further highlight our focus on organic free cash flow and ESG improvement. These changes reflect an increased weighting in the short-term bonus pool towards defined metrics, with organic free cash flow being the highest weighted metric for 2020.","In addition, we have modified our long-term incentive plans, moving away from solely peer relative total shareholder return performance and incorporating cash return on capital employed and ESG measures. I believe these changes further align our interest with those of our shareholders.","As I hand over to Brent, I want to highlight three key factors where Noble Energy is distinguishing itself. First, outstanding execution, which set the stage for 2020s decreasing capital and increasing cash flow and volume.","Second, the move to a lower annual corporate production decline rate and maintenance capital.","And third, a global inventory that includes substantial low cost discovered resources that can utilize existing infrastructure to generate competitive returns.","Our accomplishments in 2019 serve as evidence of our ability to provide differential performance for our investors.","Thanks for your time this morning and I will now hand this over to Brent.","Brent Smolik","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. 2019 was truly a tremendous year for the company. We closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter and with an extensive list of accomplishments during the year. As we move into 2020, we are building on our 2019 successes, and as Dave discussed, we expect to increase cash flow and production and decrease capital and expenses.","In the U.S. Onshore, we achieved sustainable reductions in capital last year through several initiatives including faster drilling rates, accelerated completion times, lower cost facilities and well connects.","On the expense side, optimized compression, improved uptime and reduced workover frequency are examples of long-term changes in the efficiency of our base production operations.","I expect the 2019 capital and expense gains to continue into 2020 and beyond. We also achieved those improvements in our execution and cost culture, while -- cost structure, while maintaining a strong company-wide safety culture.","In 2019, we achieved a record low total recordable incident rate for the U.S. Onshore and we delivered the Leviathan platform in Israel and the Aseng 6P well in Africa without a recordable injury. Each of these programs are well executed for less capital than planned, which strengthens our conviction that efficient operations are safe operations.","Our 2019 execution success has also shaped our thinking about capital allocation for 2020. As Dave mentioned, we set the total capital budget for the company of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, which includes Offshore major projects, exploration capital and essentially maintenance capital level for the U.S. Onshore.","Through the year-over-year improvements in capital efficiency, we are planning a similar number of activities in the DJ and the Delaware for the 2019 drilling campaigns for approximately $200 million less capital. The program is expected to generate DJ growth to offset Eagle Ford decline and maintain or modestly grow Delaware production.","We think that the focus on DJ makes sense based on the scale and the remaining inventory in the DJ Basin, our track record of successful execution returns there and the ability to grow while generating significant cash flow.","We expect this capital plan to deliver moderate onshore oil growth as production increases in the more oily DJ assets and offsets decline in the NGLs and natural gas and the Eagle Ford. All three U.S. basins are designed to generate free cash flow in 2020.","Jumping into some asset specifics, in 2019, the DJ Basin delivered more than 20% growth over 2018 and during the year Mustang and Wells Ranch both delivered quarterly record production. The strong performance in the Mustang development area resulted in positive reserve revisions of almost 27 million barrels equivalent for the year, validating the quality of our acreage and the importance of consistent row development.","DJ operating costs were down more than 15% year-over-year with record lows in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, the DJ DD&A rates improved by more than $3 a barrel for 2020 reflecting the improvement in EUR and cost per well. The exceptional performance for the year is trending into 2020 and we expect even more efficient development in Mustang.","Our first sales for the year will complete Row 2 in Mustang on the far eastern side of the development and then we will move to Row 3 which is immediately adjacent to Row 2, and we plan to utilize the existing upstream and midstream infrastructure, therefore, reducing the well costs and improving the efficiency of the well connects. In the first quarter, we plan to run three rigs and two frac crews, and are targeting about 20 TILs.","Our North Wells Ranch comprehensive drilling plan is progressing through the approval process and the CDP will add about 250 long live drilling permits to our existing permit inventory and It will give us the clarity to about two more years of drilling activity.","In 2019, the Delaware Basin delivered 25% growth over 2018 and during the year, we realized several important improvements in the asset. Row development has improved the consistency of our well results, drilling and completion efficiencies have helped reduce well costs by over 20% and LOE has decreased by more than 30% on a per unit basis.","In my experience, it is rare to see such dramatic year-over-year improvements in an asset and it would be difficult for us to replicate the magnitude of the 2019 improvements. However, we still expect to see cost structure and well performance gains in the Delaware again in 2020.","So, for example, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed four wells in the southern portion of our Delaware acreage and the 30-day IPs on those wells averaged 200 barrels of oil per 1,000 foot or 260 barrels per foot on an equivalent basis. Those great results demonstrate how we can further improve well performance with optimized landing zones and customized completion designs.","As we apply those ideas and techniques across the acreage position, we expect to see improved well performance, increased capital efficiency and even better returns in 2020. In the first quarter, we will have two rigs and two frac crews running in the Delaware and deliver about 15 TILs. The Eagle Ford asset will continue to be a considerable cash flow generator as we maintain focus on base production optimization in 2020.","Closing out the U.S. Onshore, I want to highlight the strong underlying performance of Noble Midstream. The team at Noble X has done a great job of building out the gathering infrastructure to support Noble Energy\u2019s activity in the DJ and the Delaware.","Like Noble, Noble Midstream is nearing the end of a heavy investment cycle and transitioning the longer term sustainable cash flow and the impact of long haul pipes out of both basins along with significantly reduced organic capital outlook positions Noble Midstream very well for 2020 and beyond.","Turning to the Offshore. We delivered several strategic milestones in 2019 clearly punctuated by the start up of Leviathan at year end. As we signal, we expect EMed and Leviathan to be the growth engine for the company in 2020. Since startup, the field has been ramping up and on peak days, we have exceeded 1.8 Bcf per day from both Tamar and Leviathan combined.","As Dave mentioned, we also successfully opened up new markets in the region with exports flowing into both Jordan and Egypt. As we ramped up production in the field, the Leviathan wells have proven to be even more prolific than we anticipated, with well deliverabilities exceeding 400 million cubic feet a day due to the very high reservoir permeabilities and thickness.","Our focus in 2020 is going to be to deliver safe operations, demonstrate supply reliability and increased value through greater contracted sales. We have a combined 2.3 Bcf of capacity and we are primarily focused on increasing the utilization of that capacity this year.","Capital allocation for 2020 in EMed will be approximately $100 million, which includes the Tamar South West Pipeline project, compression at Ashkelon on the EMG pipeline and the debottlenecking project on the Israel INGL pipeline grid.","In addition to the value creation of the project and the regional economic benefits, Leviathan is a very long-term source of clean reliable energy because the use of more natural gas and less coal for electrical generation will result in significantly better air quality in the region.","In West Africa, the Aseng 6P well and the Alen sanction were the highlights for the year. The 6P well has continued to outperform expectations and will help reduce base declines in 2020. Also for 2020, we will allocate approximately $165 million to the Alen gas project facilitating an early 2021 startup.","The project already had a positive impact on the 2019 results with 34 million barrel equivalents of reserve additions from Alen and 18 million barrels of positive revisions from extending the economic life of the Alba Field.","Bigger picture, our longer term capital planning also includes exploration as a means to adding future resources and maintaining longer term portfolio value. In 2020, we allocated $65 million to drill the Kumbia prospect in Colombia, which is in the second half of the year. This will test targets approaching 0.5 billion barrels of resource at the midpoint of estimates and a successful well here will derisk additional prospects in the basin.","So I will wrap up this morning with guidance, first for the full year. During the year, we expect U.S. Onshore capital spending to be about 60% weighted to the first half of 2020, similar to the profile in 2019 and we also expect the 2020 production profile to be similar to 2019 with second half growth in the U.S. Onshore driven by peak second quarter TIL counts. Importantly, U.S. oil production is expected to be up 3% to 5% year-over-year and 5% to 7% 4Q to 4Q.","In the Eastern Med, we anticipate the second quarter to be the lowest sales for the year with a peak in the third quarter due to growing contract quantities and second quarter lower seasonal demand. Based on the successful startup of the field, we are maintaining our prior guidance of 1.4 Bcf per day to 1.6 Bcf per day gross from our Israel fields in the first half and 1.8 Bcf per day to 2 Bcf per day in the second half of the year.","Due to shift in Africa due to greater capital and maintenance activities this year and then in 2019, we expect more quarterly variability in our sales, expenses and cash flows. Q1 sales will benefit from additional lifting and then we also expect some fourth quarter downtime as we prepare for the Alen gas project to come online and do a planned maintenance at the Aseng and the Alba Fields.","Specifically in the first quarter, we expect Q1 volumes to be up meaningfully from the fourth quarter primarily due to our incremental Leviathan production and all three U.S. Onshore business units should be down in Q1 because of low fourth quarter and first quarter activity levels. In Israel, we expect 410 million cubic feet a day to 440 million cubic feet a day net from our Tamar and Leviathan assets.","In West Africa, all sales are anticipated to be higher than production with total equivalents down slightly quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to natural gas declines in the Alba Field. Total company sales for the first quarter anticipated to be 378,000 barrel equivalents per day to 398,000 barrel equivalents per day. Now I would expect the second quarter to be relatively consistent with the total first quarter volumes before we see another substantial jump up in the third quarter.","For 2020, we remain committed to capital discipline and shareholder return and we believe it\u2019s prudent to prioritize total company free cash flow generation over U.S. Onshore production growth, particularly when considering the total company year-over-year production and cash flow growth from the Eastern Med and the uncertain commodity price environment.","Beyond 2020, the combination of the depth and quality of our unconventional and conventional inventory, our ability to execute on our plan and manage costs, our low decline rate and our capital discipline all enable us to deliver long-term sustainable growth and free cash flow.","This completes our prepared comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram","Yeah. Good morning. Dave, you did reduce your maintenance CapEx by $200 million. I wanted to know how you will deal with uncertainties in 2020 regarding the plan, you obviously have the Coronavirus, the warm start to the winter weather season and weak gas prices in the U.S. and Europe. So wondering how you would flex 2020 if prices are below the reference prices that you highlighted in slide 25?","Dave Stover","Appreciate it, Arun, and I will tell you what, it\u2019s great to be sitting here in 2020 despite all those other outside influences coming off the momentum that we created in 2019. And I think that will go partly to answering your question as I talk about it.","Because I think to your point, we had a reference deck out there we were looking at when we budgeted, but we have also obviously kept track of strip pricing and so forth. And I\u2019d say even in the strip case that\u2019s out there now, that\u2019s been influenced by some of those things that you have talked about, we are still staying committed to that free cash flow generation, partly because of the hedges we have in place already and partly because of the momentum that we are continuing to carry in on the capital efficiency improvements. So, I think, we are staying committed and focused on that and we will play it out from there.","Arun Jayaram","Yeah. Fair enough. I had one question regarding 2021. I was wondering if you could help us think about the volume impact from the Alen gas monetization project. It looks like it\u2019s going to be start up in early 2021? And in your mind is the path to get to full volumes at Leviathan in 2021, 2022?","Dave Stover","Yeah. I think when you think about a Alen, we should be able to and what Keith and his team is working on, is getting that ready for early \u201821. I think a full year impact of that what we laid out in there was around 260 million a day gross. So somewhere in on an equivalent basis 15,000 barrels a day to 20,000 barrels a day equivalent for us if I am not mistaken. So that\u2019s a nice catalyst as you look into \u201821.","And then the other piece that you referenced is and you look at the profile this year, is the ramp up in the Eastern Med in the second half of the year and carryover into next year. So our focus in \u201821 will be on carrying over that ramp up from the second half of this year.","And then seeing if we can supplement that by filling out some of that capacity that we still have available there. So I think you have got opportunity for both of those things to be a very nice catalyst as you go into \u201821.","Arun Jayaram","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","Dave Stover","Good morning. Brian.","Brent Smolik","Hi, Brian.","Brian Singer","First question is on Israel gas, little bit of a slight follow up there. You talked about increasing utilization of Leviathan over the course of the year and I wondered if you could just add even more color on some of the moving pieces, production capacity versus seasonal demand versus maintenance or pipeline constraints versus contracting as we go through the year, and specifically, what you see as the market for additional contracts and how that could impact your production and pricing.","Brent Smolik","Yeah. Brian, this is Brent. We took all those things into consideration when we originally guided the third quarter last year -- on our third quarter call last year for this year\u2019s full year. We still think we are going to see a step-up in the first half to the second half all factors considered.","But the startup has gone very well. And as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we have been above 1.8 Bcf a day on peak days from the combined total of Tamar and Leviathan on a gross basis. So I think other than some seasonal lower demand in the second quarter, we think we have got the profile model about right.","And then, remember, as we move into the second quarter, the contracts and the exports to Egypt step up, so we go to 450 million a day. So that\u2019s what\u2019s influencing our second -- first half to second half year growth and what\u2019s already contracted.","Brian Singer","My second question is on proved reserves. Can you speak to the drivers and the production mix in the U.S. of the increase in PDP and then what drove the downward revisions? And how does the reserve report as well as the point that you made on expectations for well performance and costs in 2020 impact your interest in pursuing inorganic growth projects in the U.S. going forward?","Dave Stover","Yeah. I think just to hit on the proved reserves, the biggest positive revisions and improvements on proved reserves in the U.S. were in the DJ. The downward revisions were more a reflection of change in activity timing and making sure that we are staying in that four-year to five-year level on activity and then also, there was obviously some impact from price, there was significant price changes from \u201818 to \u201819.","Brian Singer","And then from an inorganic perspective, when you take that and how you see the costs and expectations for performance in the U.S. business? Does that make you more or less interested or uninterested in pursuing inorganic growth acquisition types in the U.S.?","Dave Stover","Well, I think, we have said and we have consistently said, we are not focusing on acquisitions, if that\u2019s what your question is, but we are focusing on continuing to get more and more efficient and develop out the large global resource base that we have both U.S. and international. We have that significant benefit of a large global discovered resource base.","Brian Singer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles Meade","Good morning, Dave to you and your whole team there.","Dave Stover","Hi, Charles.","Charles Meade","I wanted to ask a question about the U.S. Onshore and if you guys could deliver or offer for more details on how some of the drivers over the back half of \u201819 into \u201820. If you look at the -- you guys came in under CapEx guidance in both 3Q and 4Q and I think part of that was the U.S. Onshore and when we look at your 1Q guide, the U.S. Onshore oil is going to decline, depending on where you fall in your guidance, 8,000 to 10,000 barrels a day, but you guys are putting the -- you guys are putting the pedal down, it seems, on your spending in 1Q. So can you talk about what those drivers were and how much of that decline we are seeing in 1Q was really a function of you guys coming in perhaps below what you are spending -- what you thought you are spending was going to be in the back half of the year.","Brent Smolik","So just to give you a little background, we got more activities done through the full year 2019 than we budgeted for less capital, but it\u2019s timing related, because we were accelerating the completion pace and the drilling.","We pulled some of those third quarter completions in the second quarter and some of the fourth quarter into of the third, so our fourth quarter last year and our first quarter of this year TILs, the new projects it turned into line, were lower than we would have thought about at the beginning of last year. So that\u2019s what contributed to the production outperformance through the year. It also -- it is also what\u2019s causing the shape of it as we go fourth quarter to first quarter.","All that was in line with our expectations with the exception maybe of the outperformance that we saw in the DJ and so in that case, we beat volumes in the DJ over what we would have guided in the fourth quarter and we grew more oil in the full year 2019 because of that outperformance. So far we are not seeing anything negative in the way we were modeling well performance, capital, or capital efficiency.","Dave Stover","I\u2019d say, Charles, just to add to that and Brent highlighted it as prepared comments, you look at that even fourth quarter to fourth quarter oil volume increased from \u201819 to \u201820, that\u2019s pretty significant for the onshore portion.","Charles Meade","Got it. That\u2019s some of the color I was hoping for. And then I have a question on kind of your -- a refresh or an update on how you guys are thinking about your target leverage or target debt, you guys -- you are going to have some free cash flow this year. You guys mentioned the dividend is a priority, but can you tell us or give us an update on your thinking on what metrics you guys use, whether it\u2019s an absolute debt level or whether it\u2019s a consolidated leverage or upstream only leverage that you are looking to get to?","Dave Stover","Yeah. Charles, I think, we have been fairly consistent of staying focused on talking about the net upstream, that the EBITDA target of 1.5 or lower over the next few years and that\u2019s the trajectory we are going to continue to watch and stay focused on. So I\u2019d say the priorities as you mentioned are dividend and balance sheet trajectory.","Charles Meade","Got it. Thank you, Dave.","Dave Stover","Okay, Charles.","Operator","The next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Dave Stover","Hi, Doug.","Doug Leggate","Dave, I wonder if I could hit Israel first of all, I mean, thanks First of all for the cadence in the second half. But I wonder if you can give us some idea as to what your exit rate looks like in Israel, what your expectations are, maybe in the answer if you could address some of these headlines that have been circulating around Jordan as it relates to the exports and I have got a follow-up question?","Dave Stover A - Dave Stover","Yeah. We have been very pleased with our export and what we have been seeing out of both Jordan and Egypt and the support and cooperation in both places. I think it\u2019s been remarkable. When you look at our second half of the year, what we have said that 1.8 Bcf a day to 2 Bcf a day for the total Eastern Med volume, and I think that\u2019s still a reasonable place to be thinking about.","I think when you look even beyond that and it was touched on earlier, it is a good place here to dive into this, I think, but it\u2019s been absolutely remarkable, the impact that Leviathan has had on the region. When you think about how it\u2019s brought together the countries. I mean, obviously, the cooperation between Israel, Jordan, and Egypt.","But then you think about it on a bigger scale, you now have an Eastern Med gas forum that started up, you have got countries like Cypress, Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Palestinian authority that are all getting together to think about how do you use this huge resource in the area that\u2019s now, and I think, partly from Leviathan getting a lot more international attention.","And then, you have got other groups that are looking at things like how do we get gas to Europe. You have got groups pulling together discussions on a pipeline in the Europe. We are looking at FLNG as a competitive option. You have got the opportunity to use the gas plants in the LNG plant in Egypt.","So you have got some very strong competing options and a very strong pull to get gas into Europe at some place and just expand the whole horizon of development and broader reach of this large resource and that\u2019s getting attention. It\u2019s getting attention from the country\u2019s themselves and it\u2019s getting attention from a lot of international players. So I have got to give Leviathan a lot of credit now for having now been online just creating kind of a revitalization of that part of the world from an energy perspective.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate the lengthy answer, Dave. My follow-up, I am not sure if you will be able to offer any color here, but I am looking at slide 20 in the book and I think for -- at least for those on the sell side, that\u2019s a really helpful chart in terms of how the cadence of a land kicks in for the production profile. But my question is what can you tell us about your cash flow coming out of EG, because obviously you are providing the resource but there has not been much disclosure around the terms, obviously, so I am just curious when we think about the contributions of volumes coming from your legacy asset. How does your cash flow trajectory evolve as we look at that chart evolve as we look at that chart on page 20?","Brent Smolik","Yeah. Doug, we haven\u2019t guided yet -- this is Brent again. We haven\u2019t guided yet to that level. We have stated the volume level. But we will remind everyone that this is very low cost to liquefy, a very low cost project to operate, because it\u2019s all existing infrastructure with the addition of a new pipeline to the LNG plant.","And then the only other variable would be global gas prices that you can think about, right now they are softer than they have been in the past, but long-term it would be a global gas price, because we own the equity gas to end markets.","Doug Leggate","All right, guys. I thought I\u2019d give it a go. But I appreciate the help and appreciate the capital discipline. Thanks.","Brent Smolik","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","Michael Hall","Thanks. Good morning.","Dave Stover","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Hall","I appreciate the time. I just want to -- I guess focus a little bit on the U.S. Onshore business, that exact growth rate you provided for U.S. oil. It looks pretty good relative to where we were. I am just curious how are you thinking about the sustainability of that level and then how would you frame your inventory depth in the U.S. Onshore, let\u2019s say, for 2021 and beyond, at this point, how are you thinking about that?","Brent Smolik","Yeah. Mike, this is Brent, again. Yeah. I think the second question first is, we still feel like we have got a long runway both in the DJ and the Delaware, high return, high quality inventory, partly because of the size and scale of the DJ position and then, partly because of a lower activity levels that effectively extends our inventory life in both places.","So we think we have got lots of sustainability in terms of depth and quality of inventory and Colorado specifically, we have got a deep inventory of approved drilling permits and we are working to extend those more with the new CDP we are working on.","In terms of the oil part of it, it\u2019s -- even though we are keeping the U.S. essentially flat year-over-year 2019 to 2020 with the current capital plan because we are focusing it in the DJ and the Delaware that are oilier than the Eagle Ford by comparison. Then -- that\u2019s why we are able to grow well and that trend would continue going forward as long as we continue to focus capital on those two basins.","Michael Hall","Okay. That last bit was what I was hoping to hear. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess, maybe if you could also translate to total corporate oil. I mean, I know there\u2019s some downtime in the fourth quarter in West Africa, is that just affecting gas volumes, should we -- how should we think about the fourth quarter, exit currently for the corporate place?","Dave Stover A - Dave Stover","Yeah. Primarily, yeah, there is some oil condensate type of mix. But then when you get into \u201821, we will have that behind us and then Alen will also have some condensate that comes with that.","Michael Hall","Okay. Great. I appreciate it guys. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Scott Gruber with Citi. Please go ahead.","Scott Gruber","Yes. Good morning.","Dave Stover","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Gruber","I just wanted to follow-on the last final question really focusing on the DJ, because that\u2019s where you are growing in 2020. You mentioned maintaining that momentum into \u201821, given the inventory depth. But just as you think about the asset long-term, is there a plan to shift the asset to the maintenance mode at some point, and if so when? And just how could international growth opportunities affect that timing?","Brent Smolik","Yeah. I don\u2019t think -- this is Brent. I don\u2019t think we think about it like shifted to maintenance mode or not. It\u2019s -- our capital allocation, long-term is returns driven and the DJ returns stack up very well right now in the portfolio. And so I think as long as it\u2019s in that position, then it would continue to garner its funding and then the growth would be an outcome, not a goal. Remember that asset is already like all U.S. assets, but even at the current capital and current growth rate, DJ is free cash flow positive at the asset level and so we can continue to stay in this mode for long-term.","Scott Gruber","Got it. And a follow-up on the seasonality in the U.S. both from a CapEx and production standpoint, it sounds like it\u2019s going to repeat again in 2020 and potentially CapEx flexing down a little bit more in the second half if commodity prices stay weak. But, in general, are you comfortable with that seasonality on an ongoing basis, would it be better to try to smooth out the CapEx over the course of the year? I guess the real question is do you feel like you are losing any efficiency in our operations with that seasonality?","Brent Smolik","Yeah. That\u2019s -- it\u2019s always -- always best case if you could be perfectly level loaded in all aspects of the business. But if you look at the performance from \u201818 to \u201819 and look at the improvements and cycle time reductions, capital and capital efficiency for the U.S. Onshore, even though we were kind of 60% front half loaded in 40% back half loaded on capital. I think we found ways to manage that little bit of unlevelness. It\u2019s not that much. But it\u2019s manageable and we are still able to hang on to or drive even significant improvements in the capital efficiency. It takes a lot of planning and scheduling. But that\u2019s what we do.","Scott Gruber","Got it. Appreciate the color.","Operator","The next question is from David Deckelbaum with Cowen. Please go ahead.","David Deckelbaum","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions and thanks for the outlook. Curious as you guys look at Leviathan and we have read reports that from some of your peers out there and some of your partners that there are decisions this year on expansion. I think, Dave, you talked about floating LNG as a viable option. Can you give us a timeline on when you would expect to make those decisions around expansion and given some of the productivity, where you sort of see that capacity tapping out for the feel at this point?","Brent Smolik","Yeah. This is Brent. Maybe I will jump in and take that. We have said pretty consistently for 2020. Our priority is making sure we can demonstrate safe, reliable supply coming from the Leviathan project and so far so good in that regard.","And then utilizing the existing capacity, so in total, we now have 2.3 Bcf a day in the Med and so those are definitely going to be our primary focus for 2020 and even 2021 when we roll into it. But because of the size and quality of this resource, we are -- I think we are a long-term -- for a long-term going to be talking about expansion possibilities.","So the one that we have talked about publicly is that we have got a floating LNG, FLNG FEED study underway, as Dave mentioned, and that\u2019s a possibility to expand to additional markets, the others would be in all three countries. We could expand in Israel, Jordan, and Egypt and we can ultimately maybe get it exported out of Egypt through the LNG facility. So all of those are all actively being worked and we are looking to be able to expand with demand.","David Deckelbaum","Got it. I appreciate the color there and recognize it. There is not a whole lot you can say there. And just wanted to ask a question on U.S. Onshore, you talked about the mix right now, the focus on DJ obviously in Delaware and that mix of 60-40 split, is pretty consistent I guess with 2019. Is there a point and your long-term development profile where that switches -- does it happens beyond the proposed Wells Ranch CDP? And I guess as a follow on to that is, as we think about capital of those assets, I know it\u2019s returns base at this point? But given the corporate level focus on free cash generation, now if we are looking at strip now in the low 50s, is there a sub maintenance profile that makes more sense from a free cash generation perspective?","Brent Smolik","It feels like we have gone a long way here from \u201818 to \u201819 to \u201820 in terms of driving down U.S. Onshore capital and driving up capital efficiency. At the level that we are at now to the earlier question, we are pretty low in terms of activities, rigs and stems and we have got it matched up pretty well in the pace of development.","And so it feels like a good level. If prices go lower though, we have been very, very consistently committed to our free cash flow objectives. And so we would have to think about something in the back half of the year for an adjustment.","David Deckelbaum","Thanks, Brent. Appreciate the color, guys.","Brent Smolik","Thank you, David.","Operator","The next question will come from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold","Yeah. Thanks. I am just kind of building on a couple of the line of questions a little bit. Obviously, in 2020, you got the nice growth in Leviathan and then EG in 2021. As you look a little bit bigger picture longer dated. I mean, do you feel, I mean, do you see the need to continue to ramp up the U.S. Onshore a little bit more as you get into some of those out years to provide that 5% to 10% growth? And maybe as a part of that discussion, when you think about things like FLNG, how long of a timeframe do you really have there, is that two years -- one year, two years, three years. Can you give me -- give us a sense of how long that would take to come to fruition.","Dave Stover","I think, let me start with the last question on FLNG we will be doing a hard look FEED study this year. So by the end of this year, we will have a better perspective and I think to actually bring it about to a reality price takes say plus or minus three years, let\u2019s call it, something like that.","I think on your other question, which goes to the longer term outlook for the company. I think that\u2019s where our ability to have maintained our exploration capabilities also comes into play. I mean, hopefully, not missed in the discussion was the fact we are back to drilling significant material exploration prospect this year Offshore Colombia.","And we have consistently focused on three to five key material potential plays going forward that any of those could supplement our outlook as we go forward just as our Offshore developments so far were driven by exploration in the past.","And then in the Onshore business, let\u2019s not forget the significant position we have built in -- particularly in Wyoming up there in the inventory. And my expectation is over time -- over the next five years, that will start to compete with DJ and Delaware to give us another leg to build off.","So I think the beauty of our portfolio -- of a diverse portfolio is the fact that we have maintained our Onshore capabilities, our Offshore capability and our exploration in major project execution and that gives us a lot to look forward to going forward.","Scott Hanold","That was a great color. And my follow-up is, is on the Eagle Ford, obviously, getting really no capital this year and not much last year? Given it\u2019s free cash flow, but it is a declining asset and just from a visual perspective, it obviously weighs on that U.S. growth rates on, especially in a BOE perspective, what is the big picture or long-term plan of the Eagle Ford?","Brent Smolik","Yeah. Scott, some of the things we have talked about in the past is there is still a lot of resource there, that\u2019s in the secondary upper parts of the Eagle Ford and we tested last year a pilot program to do some refracs to see what we could do with the older wells in the older vintage completions.","So those -- that upside still exists and there is still potential that\u2019s out there. But right now the heads up drilling capital doesn\u2019t compete with the Delaware and the DJ, so it will stay in its free cash flow generation posture.","Scott Hanold","Would it be a monetization candidate?","Brent Smolik","Yeah. I mean, we have said off and on that we are willing to think about investing non-core assets and we have done a fair amount of that over the last couple of years. So if somebody came out with a big enough check, we think about it.","Scott Hanold","Appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng","Good morning. Thank you, guys. Two quick questions. One, do you have an estimate -- what is the remaining prospect inventory at DJ and Delaware, Based on a $50 WTI and $2.50 Henry Hub on all-in, including CapEx, G&A and all that to generate 10% return?","Dave Stover","I don\u2019t have numbers right here in front of me, but what we have continued to say is that the activity levels, we have got 10 years type inventory or beyond on this stuff that fits our return\u2026","Paul Cheng","And\u2026","Dave Stover","\u2026criteria so...","Paul Cheng","Right. And Brent that when you guys say 10 years, what kind of returns that you are based on and then whether that\u2019s including on the all-inclusive on the field level. What I was trying to understand what\u2019s the baseline that we are using?","Brent Smolik","Yeah. So just a reminder, our investment for the next well AFE is our hurdle rates of 30% hurdle rate and that\u2019s what we would start on these long-term inventory kinds of conversations. And then remember that we have been driving capital efficiency significantly. So when we take out a couple of million dollars of well cost and\/or improve the productivity of the wells, like, we have been doing in both DJ and Delaware, then not only that increases the value of the inventory. So that\u2019s the way we think about it long-term.","Paul Cheng","Okay. Then second one that, I think, with issue with that, now your total capacity 2.3, I think, you have two opportunities, maybe up 400 million cubic feet per day at a time. Just curious that, I mean, do you have a rough estimate, what is the CapEx requirement if we do want to expand the next 400 million cubic feet and then the next one?","Brent Smolik","Yeah. I think the best way to think about it is to take you back to our long-term capital framework. We have laid out, total company 1.82 Bcf a day to 2 Bcf a day over the next five years, that includes both exploration and major projects. And those expansions you are talking about and the Leviathan fit within that framework. So the major project capital for a year includes our thinking about how those expansions would come in over time.","Paul Cheng","So at least one of them is included in that, say, call it, the next five years?","Brent Smolik","Paul, say that again please.","Paul Cheng","Does it mean that at least one of the 400 million cubic feet per day expansion is included in the next five years?","Brent Smolik","Yes. You can assume that because remember, the first expansion is really low cost. We are only talking about some incremental wells and facility mods, and so the first expansion easily fits within our capital framework.","Paul Cheng","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Leo Mariani","I guess, I wanted to dig in a little bit more into the trajectory of the Permian production here. In 2020, I think, you guys were kind of talking flattish year-over-year, you did have some pretty good Permian growth in the second half of \u201819. So kind of gets to flattish, should be thinking that Permian is kind of down a little bit in the first half of \u201820 before ramping in the second half of \u201820, just wanted to see if I am reading that right?","Dave Stover","Yeah. That\u2019s right. And before I expand on it, remember that it\u2019s flattish on equivalents. It grows on an oil basis year-over-year. And then it should grow exit to exit, the fourth quarter to fourth quarter, which means then because of the completion activity in the fourth quarter -- lower completion activities in the fourth quarter and first quarter, then we are down a little bit in Q1 and then we grow through the year, got it right.","Leo Mariani","All right. That\u2019s helpful for sure. And your comment with the oil growing and the equivalent sort of flattish. Is that just reflecting where you will be shifting some activity in the Permian, some oilier areas in \u201820?","Dave Stover","No. It\u2019s -- that was really a mixed comment. That was flattish on equivalent basis for all of U.S. Onshore, for the Permian it will grow oil and equivalents.","Leo Mariani","Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess, just jumping back over to Israel, obviously, you have got a significant ramp in production here in 2020. I just wanted to get a sense. I think that all of that ramp is volumes that are already under contract, which will clearly benefit you guys into 2021 as well. Just wanted to get a sense, now that Leviathan is online and the wells look great, are you starting to see accelerated discussions around new contracts there and you think there is a decent chance you guys might be able to get something in place here in \u201820? And lastly, with respect to Israel, is there any possibility you could sell volumes above what\u2019s contracted in 2020 and 2021 or do you sort of need kind of hard contracts to get those new volumes going?","Brent Smolik","I think to your question, Leo, we were starting to see accelerated interest before Leviathan even came on line from potential customers. So I think those discussions will continue kind of get back to that more when you build it and they will come type of thing and you are seeing that and you are seeing that interest over there.","The other thing to keep an eye on is how quickly Israel starts to displace coal. We have always talked about that being about a 600 million a day plus or minus type opportunity there and now with Leviathan on, we will see if they kind of accelerate some of that conversion on that opportunity.","So I think they have already talked about moving that up from late this decade to middle of this decade and now that Leviathan is on, I think, that\u2019s an opportunity. So, yeah, we will see. We are obviously not limiting ourselves, we are not limited on capacity right now, we have some room to grow beyond what we have laid out this year and we will see how it progresses, we are just a month -- a little over a month into this and everything looks great so far, so a good start.","Leo Mariani","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Next question is from Irene Haas with Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.","Irene Haas","Yeah. Very quickly to follow up on Brent\u2019s comment earlier that Noble X right now is going past a heavy investment stage, so any plan for debt reduction like term loan, due \u201821, \u201822? And also related to this, your interest in Noble X Midstream, are you okay with it, any need to reduce ownership and deconsolidate in the near-term? That\u2019s all I have.","Dave Stover","And so, Irene, you are asking of financing our capital structure, question for Noble X.","Irene Haas","Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.","Dave Stover","So, we will have that call a little later this morning too. But, yeah, you would expect as that business grows over time. It would term out some of its debt. That makes sense. In terms of the ownership after the simplification and drop, we now own 62% of the units. And as you know, we consolidate that business accordingly. And so we have a lock-up for the first six months through mid-year this year.","So nothing would happen in the first half and then longer term, we would have to look at the merits of owning 62% of it. We don\u2019t have to own that much of it to be able to manage -- maintain the control of the pace of development to keep up with our DJ and our Delaware activity. So it\u2019s an option to think about.","Irene Haas","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Gail Nicholson with Stephens.","Gail Nicholson","Good morning. First question on the LOE side, there is a lot of moving pieces in 2020, but if we just specifically look at the Delaware and the DJ, can you talk about LOE trajectory in 2020? Is that should we think that\u2019s in line with 4Q \u201819 levels or should we think there\u2019s incremental improvement throughout the year?","Brent Smolik","I think you think about it more in line with -- this is Brent. Think about it more in line with the second half of last year. The fourth quarter was an exceptional U.S. Onshore LOE performance, so it was our lowest per barrel unit cost that we have had in the U.S. Onshore.","It was a combination of things, we had really mild winter, not much to deal with there in the late part of the quarter. We had very low workover kind of maintenance activities. We had really good run time and wells and facilities. So we managed cost well and compression well and those kind of things. Some of those are sustainable and they will flow right in to this year. But we will probably not be as low as fourth quarter as we go through the full year and we have got it more like second half.","Gail Nicholson","Great. Thank you. And then I just kind of wanted to tack onto Irene\u2019s question regards to that -- the deceleration times with last year being that heavy NBLX CapEx. How do you guys think about the benefit of that ownership in regards to free cash flow generation really in 2021 forward, like, market doesn\u2019t fully give you guys credit for kind of that annuity like situation, I was just kind of curious on your thoughts of ownership benefit to the cash flow stream in \u201824 forward for NBLX?","Dave Stover","Well, yeah. As Brent alluded to it, Gail, on his comments that for NBLX, it\u2019s entering its phase like we have entered now with Leviathan with the new pipes coming on in the big inflection -- infusion I guess is a better word, of cash flow that will start to come in here this year and that will carry over on a full year basis next year.","So that\u2019s the big benefit that we see of that, that it\u2019s not that dissimilar to what we have seen from Noble, that NBLX is undergoing their big inflection and transition right now too. And so you get beyond this year and you have got both companies now that are seeing the benefit of these past investments that are generating a tremendous amount of cash flow going forward.","Brent Smolik","And if I just add one thing, I think I understand your question better. The two big things that we saw last year when we announced the end of the strategic review were the benefits of having the two business together because of the collaboration and the synergies.","And we can -- real examples of lower OpEx and lower CapEx that is directly related to the synergies of having the business together. And then the quality of the cash flows in the midstream business, especially as it expands downstream into the oil pipes, we like the quality of those cash flows and the ability to upstream some of that to Noble.","Gail Nicholson","Great. Thank you.","Dave Stover","Yeah.","Operator","The next question is from Nitin Kumar with Wells Fargo.","Nitin Kumar","Good morning, gentlemen, and thank you for taking my question. I had a quick question on slide nine, as you have brought down the costs in the U.S. Onshore business. What is the breakeven price oil or something for that business today, because it seems like you are doing free cash flow out of the U.S. Onshore with the new plan, is that fair?","Dave Stover","So two questions in there. So the breakevens definitely come down, partly depends on how you define it. So if you are talking about just break even at a cost to capital return, it\u2019s going to be sub $50. We invested a higher threshold than that, but that we have driven it down sub $50 for straight cost to capital like returns. What was the other part of the question?","Nitin Kumar","Is the U.S. Onshore business standalone today, free cash flow neutral, let\u2019s say, at strip, or $50?","Dave Stover","It is today in our plans for the total of U.S. Onshore and each asset area, each business unit, so DJ, Delaware and Eagle Ford at this year\u2019s capital plans are all free cash flow positive.","Nitin Kumar","Great. The other question, David, you said in your prepared remarks, obviously you have raised dividends about 9% last year in anticipation of the Leviathan free cash flows. As you think about 2020 in the cadence of your spending and production, clearly, it is going to be the second half where it is free cash flow profile. Are you -- do you think the Board or the management team is looking to wait till you have more line of sight on actual free cash flows before raising the dividend or you could do it in anticipation of the growth?","Dave Stover","Well, we look at that each quarter. If you look back over the last two years, it wasn\u2019t just \u201819 but \u201818 also we raised the dividend in April. So I imagine we will take another pretty hard look at that this coming April also and we will see where we get to.","Nitin Kumar","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor, Pickering & Holt. Please go ahead.","Jeoffrey Lambujon","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is just a follow-up to one of the earlier responses regarding staying committed to the free cash flow generation. It sounds like the $500 million target is what will remain intact even if something closer to strip plays out. So if that\u2019s a fair interpretation, just wanted to get a little more color on what the facts could be on the budgeting side in that scenario?","Brent Smolik","Yeah. I think, you are right from the standpoint, we are staying committed to that even at a strip price scenario. The hedges helped protect that, we don\u2019t see that big of an impact when you move from the 55 to the strip because of that, the hedging that we have in place.","And then the capital efficiencies that we have seen and we are continuing to stay focused on not just capital but operating efficiencies also, give us a lot of confidence and if we stay in that kind of a ballpark, we can still stay focused on delivering that cash flow target.","Jeoffrey Lambujon","Got it. And then my second one is just a nuance one on the Eagle Ford, just wanted to see if you can give us a sense for what to expect there in terms of exit over exit production or just how you see PDP declines in general, just thinking about the DJ and the Delaware receiving the bulk of the U.S. Onshore budget?","Brent Smolik","Yeah. I don\u2019t have the Eagle Ford decline rate in front of us. But if you look on page nine, we showed a typical Eagle Ford declines in the 30% to 40%. That\u2019s probably pretty similar to where we are, obviously, as you get further away from making investments, the decline will level off a little more than that or slow down a little bit, but as we go into 2020 that\u2019s probably a reasonable range.","Jeoffrey Lambujon","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brad Whitmarsh for any closing remarks.","Brad Whitmarsh","Sure. Thank you, Chad, and thanks to all for joining us today. Kim and I are around for questions and answers all afternoon if you have anything and we look forward to talking with you.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect."],"15227":["Noble Energy (NASDAQ:NBL) Q4 2013 Earnings Call February  6, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","David R.

Welcome to Noble Energy's Fourth Quarter and Year End 2013 Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Larson. Please go ahead, sir.","David R. Larson","Thanks, Shannon. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Noble Energy's fourth quarter and year end 2013 earnings call and webcast. On the call today, we have Chuck Davidson, Chairman and CEO; Dave Stover, President, COO; and Ken Fisher, CFO. This morning, we issued our year end 2013 earnings release, and it does include our proved reserves, which you have hopefully had a chance to review. A few supplemental slides for this call were posted as well to our website this morning, and they'll be a good reference point for today's discussion. The agenda for today will begin with Chuck, highlighting our performance in 2013 and an outlook for 2014. Dave will wrap up with a discussion of our 5 core operational areas. We will leave time for Q&A at the end, and plan to complete the call in less than an hour. [Operator Instructions] I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements, as well as references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those.","With that, let me that turn the call over to Chuck.","Charles D. Davidson","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we find ourselves fully engaged in executing our 2014 plan, and it is one that I find very exciting. Before moving to discuss the current year, I think it's appropriate to reflect on some of our notable achievements for 2013. Starting with production, we are up 20% over 2012. That's excluding the impact of non-core asset divestitures. Reserves were up 19% to over 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 2013, and discretionary cash flow was also up 19% to $3.4 billion for the year. It's no surprise these are all record levels for Noble Energy, driven by the acceleration of our onshore unconventional opportunities, as well as the delivery of multiple major project developments in the global offshore areas. It was an outstanding year on the major project front, as we started up our first central processing facility at the Wells Ranch integrated development plan area in the DJ Basin, and commenced production at 2 offshore major projects. We also extended the project pipeline with the sanctioning of 6 new major projects during the year, including Big Bend and Gunflint and the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Tamar Southwest, and our compression project at Tamar in the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as the Kyoto gas processing facility in East Pony integrated development plan area in the DJ Basin. 2013 was also a year of further exploration momentum as we added 4 new discoveries: 2 in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and 2 in the Eastern Mediterranean which provided additional opportunities for growth in the future. We also continued to optimize our portfolio in 2013, divesting a number of assets that were no longer core to our business. At the same time, we were able to further enhance our core areas in the onshore area of the U.S. through the addition of the Allegheny Airport and Dominion acreage in the Marcellus, and the completion of a strategic acreage swap in the Greater Wattenberg area. It's all about focus, positioning ourselves with sole attention on premier return opportunities and eliminating the distractions that drain resources.","Quickly wrapping up 2013, we finished up the year with a very good fourth quarter, delivering sales volume of 293,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which tied our previous quarterly record, and was substantially higher than our original fourth quarter guidance. Highlighting our performance was the DJ Basin with production of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase over the third quarter despite the impacts of the devastating Colorado floods and the asset exchange mentioned earlier. Our Marcellus Shale assets are delivering as well, averaging almost 200 million cubic feet equivalent for the quarter, and exiting the year at over $210 million per day.","In Israel, production was impacted positively by high seasonal demand due to cold weather and cold plant maintenance. Tomorrow's reservoir performance and reliability have been outstanding, at times supplying up to 70% of the fuel needed for electricity generation in Israel. We also experienced strong liquid volumes in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and West Africa despite being underlifted during the period.","In summary, all 5 core areas contributed above expectations for the quarter and ended the year in great fashion. Revenues were over $1.3 billion for the quarter with liquids representing 80% of the total. Discretionary cash flow from continuing operations was $925 million, up 10% from the fourth quarter last year, and we ended 2013 with $1.1 billion in cash, and total liquidity of over $5 billion, as well as net debt to book cap ratio of 29%. These strong metrics include the impact of a $1 billion 30-year bond issuance during the fourth quarter, which further strengthened our financial position.","On the cost side, lease operating expense was slightly lower than our expectations, averaging under $5.10 per barrel equivalent, and DD&A was $15.70, reflecting strong reserve bookings at year end. Transportation cost was up slightly from the prior quarter, primarily a result of U.S. onshore growth and the startup of the Wattenberg oil trunk line in the fourth quarter. Exploration expense included significant seismic expenditures in the Falklands and Eastern Mediterranean, as well as costs from our initial well, offshore Nicaragua.","I'll also point out that taxes, on an adjusted basis, were higher than our third quarter level, resulting from the full year true-up of the tax provision and the impact of Nicaragua well in the fourth quarter. Besides our usual adjustment for unrealized derivative activity this quarter, there were a couple of other adjustments to GAAP earnings, resulting from our continued portfolio optimization. Prior to year end, we completed the sale of deep gas rights in the Powder River basin in Wyoming, which resulted in a realized gain. This was essentially offset in terms of the impact to the P&L by an impairment recorded on our tri-state shale gas properties, which have now executed a sales agreement.","Our portfolio work continues in 2014, with our having also executed a purchase and sale agreement to divest our natural gas assets in the East Texas -- North Louisiana Hainesville play, and we're working on additional non-core divestments as well. As I mentioned earlier, we ended the year with total reserves of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent, an overall increase of 19% versus year end 2012. Total reserve replacement, including additions and revisions, was a very strong 369%.","In the U.S. onshore, we added nearly 280 million barrels in total, approximately 190 million barrels equivalent from discoveries and extensions, another 50 million barrels equivalent of positive performance revisions, and the remainder primarily from the Marcellus acquisitions mentioned earlier. The very strong performance that we've been experiencing in the DJ and Marcellus are now starting to show -- starting to be reflected in reserves, and thus the positive reserve revisions this year.","Offshore, we booked reserves as a result of sanctions at Big Bend and Gunflint in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Tamar Southwest in the Eastern Mediterranean. Our offshore businesses accounted for nearly 60 million barrels of extensions and discoveries and over 30 million barrels of positive performance revisions. The startup of Tamar and Alen also contributed to a significant conversion of proved undeveloped, approved developed, which resulted in our overall PUD percentage decreasing to 40% from 61% at the end of 2012. All in reserve replacement cost was approximately $12 per barrel equivalent.","At the end of last year, we provided an updated 5-year plan at our Analyst Conference, including a deep dive into each of our core business areas. It's an aggressive plan, but one we are certainly confident in delivering with essentially all the resources necessary to deliver the plan having already been discovered.","Slide 6 highlights the major outcomes from the plan. Production is planned to grow at 18% compound annual growth rate over the next 5 years, delivering more than 620,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018. Discretionary cash flow was planned in excess of $8 billion at the end of the 5-year planning period, more than double our 2013 discretionary cash flow. Proved reserves and return on capital employed are also anticipated to grow dramatically, and we'll execute the plan with significantly lower committed capital than what was assumed in our previous plan. These are exceptional outcomes for a company of any size.","Before handing it over to Dave, I wanted to just highlight some of the exciting things to look forward to this year. First, our capital budget reflects substantial acceleration in the onshore areas, significant investments for the next round of major projects, and continued commitment to material exploration. Production is anticipated to increase significantly in 2014, led by the onshore core development programs in the DJ and Marcellus, and then our Israel gas is expected to be up with growing domestic demand there.","Our onshore U.S. programs will receive approximately 70% of our capital investment in 2014 as we target the drilling and completion of over 500 wells this year. Beyond the growth in both programs, the DJ and Marcellus will also see significant down spacing activity in 2014, increased drilling of long laterals, and further focus on reducing drilling and completion costs. Success in these areas has the potential to significantly increase our captured resources and enhance already strong rates of return and net present values per well.","We will also continue exploration in the Wilson new venture play in North East Nevada this year, having recently finished drilling our second vertical well in the play and taking a vertical core for detailed analysis. Drilling results, thus far, have confirmed the existence of a thick Elko reservoir section, hydrocarbon saturation and thermal maturity. By midyear, we anticipate completing at least 1 of our 2 drilled wells, and we are currently preparing additional drilling locations for wells in the second half of 2014. In our offshore business, after bringing on Tamar and Alen in 2013, we're moving forward aggressively with the Big Bend and Gunflint developments. In addition, we're progressing multiple discoveries towards sanction in 2014, including Dantzler in the Gulf of Mexico and Diega in Equatorial Guinea. Both will ultimately be tiebacks into existing infrastructure, with first production targeted in 2016. We're also planning for multiple exploration prospects this year, including wells in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Cameroon, which provide the opportunity for new discoveries this year. Our new ventures teams are progressing multiple opportunities towards first drilling, and we are supporting those programs with significant seismic and processing this year.","In the Falkland Islands, we're nearing completion of our northern 3-D seismic acquisition, which will bring our total 3D data acquired to nearly 5,000 square miles. Sizable prospects are being matured, and I would anticipate a rig contract being secured shortly in support of drilling in 2015. In the Eastern Mediterranean, it will certainly be a very busy year for Noble Energy. On the production side, we're expanding the Ashdod onshore receiving station through the addition of compression, which is designed to increase the deliverability of gas to Israel. This year, we will also begin developing our newest discovery at Tamar Southwest, tying it in to the existing Tamar infrastructure for first production in 2015.","We continue to work predevelopment on many fronts for the Leviathan field, and we are working to obtain all necessary approvals to sanction the initial phase of development this year. Discussion and negotiations regarding the Woodside farm-in are progressing now, in that we have an export policy approved, and other regulatory approvals are moving forward. We look forward to the tremendous value this partnership is capable of delivering. It's also important to point out that we're close to finalizing an agreement with the Israeli antitrust authority, which is likely to result in the sale of a couple of our smaller discoveries to another operator. The Canada fields, Tanin and Karish, total approximately 3 trillion cubic feet of gross natural gas or just over 1 trillion cubic feet net. We expect to have this matter resolved shortly as well.","The demand for our discoveries in Mediterranean natural gas continues to ratchet up. We are in very active negotiations with several potential regional customers, and I would expect us to execute a number of sales agreements this year. We also expect we'll make substantial progress towards an LNG or FLNG solution for not only the Israeli discoveries, but also for our Cyprus discovery as well.","At the same time, we'll be preparing for a return to exploration in the Eastern Mediterranean later this year or early next year or the natural gas prospect being matured for drilling in Cyprus and the high impact deep Mesozoic oil opportunity as well.","Well, it's a lot to cover and to pay attention to in 2014, what I see is a lot of possibility in all areas of the business. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave.","David L. Stover","Thanks, Chuck. As you pointed out, it is an exciting time for the company, and especially thrilling to be part of creating something special. For each of our core areas, I'll cover current activity and highlight new information. Beginning with the DJ Basin, we had a strong fourth quarter, led by record production and activity levels, new infrastructure coming online and continued efficiencies as we implement our Integrated Development Plan strategy.","We ended the year with 45% year-over-year oil growth in the basin, and approximately 100% increase in our total horizontal production over the same timeframe. Fourth quarter volumes of 100,000 barrels equivalent per day is a great wrap up to 2013. Our underlying growth in the DJ more than offset the impacts of the September Colorado floods, and the volumes conveyed as a result of the Greater Wattenberg exchange in October. We've accomplished this through acceleration of both drilling and completion work, having spud over 70 wells in the fourth quarter, completed more than 85 and turned a record 90 wells to first production in the period. I will highlight the performance of a number of these Wells, including both standard and extended reach laterals after describing the infrastructure activity in the quarter. The expansion of both crude oil and natural gas infrastructure in the basin is supporting our growth. Multiple major facilities started up in the fourth quarter, beginning with our own first central processing facility within the Wells Ranch IDP area. Maximum daily oil sales from the CPF have reached nearly 20,000 barrels per day, and we're already under construction with Phase II, which is planned to double the facility capacity later this year. The Wattenberg oil trunk line, Tampa pipeline and Plains Rail facility all started up as well, reducing trucking costs and delivering Noble oil to multiple end markets.","You can see on Slide 7 our strategic approach to diversification of market for crude. Approximately 90% of our oil was either exported from the basin or tied to longer term local pricing contracts. On the gas side, the startup of DCP's Wells Ranch compressor station and their O'Connor plant has increased gas capacity in the Greater Wattenberg area. During the first quarter of this year, DCP is anticipated to further ramp-up the initial phase and add an expansion as well. DCP is already moving forward with plans for the next facility, having approved the construction of the Lucerne II plant, a 230 million cubic feet per day facility, scheduled to be online in the first half 2015.","Operationally, we're continuing to drive efficiencies and cost savings through our integrated development plan approach. As we discussed at the Analyst Conference and highlight on Slide 8, the implementation of IDPs across the DJ Basin has the potential to deliver over $1 million in net present value impact per well, resulting from reduced development and operating costs. And when you have an inventory of thousands of locations to be drilled, that's a huge impact to an already robust operating program. Our recent highlight is the drilling and completion of a 10 well pad in one of the best areas of Wells Ranch, with an average lateral length of 4,700 feet. These wells averaged around $4 million per well, about 5% less than what we showed in December, and early production is very strong. 8 of the 10 wells are tracking a 400,000-barrel equivalent curve, with the other 2 consistent with our average Wells Ranch type curve of 305,000 barrels of oil equivalent. Our activity levels are increasing in the DJ Basin in 2014, and we anticipate that we will generate positive cash flow in the play this year. Our drilling program is planning for approximately 320 operated wells this year, with an increasing focus on extended-reach laterals. Approximately 70% of our operated wells will be in the Wells Ranch and East Pony IDPs, with another 20% planned in the core Greeley Crescent and Mustang IDPs, which are being moved forward for sanction.","Now that we have relocated the rig from our Nevada play back into the DJ, we're operating 10 drilling rigs and 3 full-time completion crews in support of our 2014 activity. We highlighted during the Analyst Conference our strong level of confidence in drilling a minimum of 16 wells a section throughout the majority of our 6,000-acre position. This year, we're implementing an active down spacing program with between 30% and 40% of our total wells to be drilled at a higher density level as shown on Slide 9. These wells will be in at least 5 of our identified IDP areas, which total more than 50% of our DJ Basin acreage. With continued focus on multi-zone development, including the various Niobrara intervals and the Codell, the down spacing activity exposes us to even further upside, and I would expect first production from these wells beginning in the middle part of the year.","Shown on Slide 10 are a number of other recent well results, including extended reach laterals which continue to exhibit strong performance.","Our first Codell medium length lateral was drilled in the Wells Ranch IDP area with a 7,000-foot lateral length. The well has been online for over 2 months, with current production fairly flat at over 500 barrels equivalent per day. We have also recently brought online our first long laterals in East Pony, which are equally as exciting. The first of these was a 9,000-foot horizontal, which is currently producing over 700 barrels equivalent per day after 90 days. 3 additional long laterals, which have been producing for less than a month are performing strong as well, with similar total production at very high initial oil cut, over 95% of the total volume. We've also highlighted some standard length lateral wells in Wells Ranch and the core IDPs, which are performing very well. The Marcellus delivered a record quarter for Noble Energy, with production averaging nearly 200 million cubic feet equivalent per day and exiting the year over 210 million per day.","The fourth quarter average was up 17% from the third quarter as a result of strong continued performance from existing wells, and the impact of 19 new wells commencing sales during the period. We continue to operate 5 drilling rigs in the wet gas area with 3 in Majorsville, one in Pennsboro, and the fifth rig drilling our first wells in the Shirley area. Our partner, CONSOL, is operating 3 drilling rigs on the dry gas portion of our joint acreage, and combined, we drilled a total of 42 wells in the fourth quarter.","In 2014, the joint venture plan is to drill around some 175 wells in the Marcellus, up nearly 50% from last year. More than half are planned in the wet gas portion of the play, including our first wells in the Allegheny County Airport IDP. We'll be drilling higher density wells, testing 500-foot spacing in multiple areas. As a reminder, this is equivalent to 65-acre spacing compared to our more typical pattern of 100-acre spacing. Together with CONSOL, we also plan to drill several Burkett wells this year, following on our initial Burkett well last year, which continues to perform well. Similar to the DJ, this down spacing and multi zone activity provides substantial upside to our position.","A recent highlight on the wet gas side is the 6 well SHL-17 pad, which includes the longest laterals we have operated as a company averaging over 10,000 feet in lateral length. These wells were drilled and completed at an average cost of $9 million, which represents more than 35% reduction in total cost per lateral foot completed. The application of longer laterals and continuing to drive down absolute well cost is significantly reducing our finding and development cost across the play. Production from the SHL-17 pad commenced in December and started up at nearly 40 million cubic feet equivalent per day. On our partner operations, the application of shorter stage lengths and reduced cluster spacing is delivering very positive results. Initial 24-hour production rates on wells utilizing this completion design have been as high as 18 million cubic feet per day, and averaged 12 billion cubic feet per day per well for 8 wells brought online in the fourth quarter. These initial rates are up to 40% higher than the previous completions, and 4 of the wells had 30-day averages of more than 10 million cubic feet per day each. A large portion of the dry gas wells will be completed with this modified completion design this year, and we're implementing the reduce spacing on our wet gas acreage as well. Our first operated wells with reduced stage and cluster spacing are expected to be online in March. I'm also looking forward to commencing production from the Oxford\/Pennsboro\/Shirley delineation area in West Virginia, which is expected in the second quarter. The initial pad, including 6 wells will include tests of 550-foot down spacing, and reduce stage and cluster spacing.","Another highlight in the fourth quarter was the bolt-on acquisition of a relatively contiguous 90,000 gross acres in West Virginia. This acquired acreage directly offsets an area where we have seen some very strong wells come on recently, including the Philip I-13 [ph] Pad, where the average 24 hour IP for the 6 wells was more than 10 million cubic feet per day. We've already identified 350 drilling locations with net risk resource potential of approximately 2 trillion cubic feet equivalent.","Combined between the DJ and Marcellus, we're allocating approximately $3 billion in 2014 to the acceleration and development of our core onshore unconventional plays. These programs are anticipated to deliver tremendous growth this year. In addition, we are pursuing significant upside in both areas that is not assumed in our current long-term outlook. Combined with testing our Frontier play in northeast Nevada, 2014 will certainly be an exciting year for our onshore business.","Shifting offshore to the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Production during the quarter was 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 90% of which was crude oil and natural gas liquids. Growth from the third quarter was driven by the addition of the Ticonderoga #4 well, a development well which commenced production in late September. As Chuck mentioned, the 2013 sanctions of both Gunflint and the initial phase at Rio Grande set the stage for the next leg of production growth for our Deepwater Gulf business. Rio Grande will initially be a one-well tieback of our Big Bend discovery, with first production estimated in late 2015. Additional phases of Rio Grande will include the tie-in of our recent discovery at Dantzler in 2016, and the possibility of an expansion at Big Bend. At Gunflint, we're planning for first production in mid-2016 as a 2-well tieback to existing infrastructure. Combined, these discoveries are estimated to double our Deepwater Gulf of Mexico production base over the next few years. We're currently completing the Big Bend #1 well, and expect our first exploration well will be the Katmai prospect in Green Canyon. Towards the end of the first quarter, the Atwood Advantage drillship will join our Deepwater Gulf of Mexico program, and will be primarily devoted to our extensive development activity, including work on Rio Grande and Gunflint.","Moving to our International business. In West Africa, net sales for the fourth quarter were 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Aseng continues to perform well, and Alen production ramped up in the fourth quarter, exiting 2013 at about 28,000 barrels per day growth. Alen is expected to continue to grow in 2014 to a level of 30,000 to 35,000 barrels per day. In the fourth quarter, we completed our extended flow test at the Diega oil discovery. The well flowed at a constrained rate of 7,300 barrels of oil per day, confirming deliverability of around 10,000 barrels per day at production. Information gathered during the test indicates a larger reservoir than anticipated and project sanctions targeted for later this year. The field will be developed at the tieback to the Aseng FPSO infrastructure with first production planned for 2016.","In the Eastern Mediterranean, Tamar continues its outstanding performance and we had a very strong fourth quarter, producing 248 million cubic feet net per day. The demand for our gas in the Eastern Med, both Israel and Cyprus, continues to grow. Chuck already mentioned multiple ongoing negotiations with a number of potential regional customers. Even within Israel, we're continuing to see new potential buyers interested in natural gas. We've recently executed multiple contracts to sell Tamar gas to local distributors who resell to industrial customers. The continued demand for our gas in both Israel and other regional areas combined with the potential for multiple LNG or FLNG solutions sets us up for some dramatic growth in this region over the next decade or longer. We're making significant progress on our compression project at the Ashdod onshore receiving terminal, which is designed to substantially increase capacity and deliverability in 2015 to meet Israel's growing needs for natural gas. Coinciding with the expansion of the onshore terminal, we're also planning a tie-in of the Tamar Southwest field to the Tamar infrastructure for additional deliverability in 2015.","As I wrap up, I'd like to comment on reserves and take a quick look at first quarter guidance. As Chuck discussed, we had significant reserve additions at year end 2013, which were driven by execution across all of our core areas. The U.S. onshore was up 34%, Israel up 10%. The Deepwater Gulf and West Africa were essentially flat combined. I'm particularly pleased with the sizable performance based revisions, which alone, replaced more than 80% of our 2013 production. With just 3 years of PUD booked in the DJ, and actually less than 2 years booked on average in the Marcellus, we have huge discovered unbooked resources yet to convert to future reserves in the U.S. onshore areas and a number of offshore areas as well. Nothing has been booked yet for Dantzler or Troubadour in the Gulf, a number of our West African discoveries, and then of course, the Leviathan, Cyprus and other discoveries in the Eastern Med. This provides a platform of low-risk resources from which we will grow into the next decade or more.","On Slide 14, we've provided detailed first quarter guidance, including both volumes and expenses. We have not changed any full year expectations, and in fact, a lot of our ranges for the first quarter match what we have previously provided for the year. But as usual, there are a few things that can move around on a quarterly basis that you'll want to pay attention to. Although not shown, I will add that we expect first quarter 2014 Israel overall gas price to increase from fourth quarter 2013 to an average of $5.40 to $5.50 per MCF based on the blend of Tamar and older Mari-B contracts. When you look at our strong fourth quarter volumes this year, our 10,000-barrel equivalent per day outperformance versus initial guidance benefited from a couple of special items along with the strong performance in each area. A large portion of the improvements resulted from coal plant maintenance in Israel, and we have now seen those coal plants come back online which affects our first quarter expectations. In the fourth quarter, we also benefited from some year end true-up of plant volumes in the DJ Basin. For first quarter 2014, taking into account winter weather, we expect to average between 280,000 and 288,000 barrels equivalent per day. The mid-point of this range is an 18% increase over the first quarter of 2013, right on track with our expectations, and consistent with our overall 2014 growth rate. The sales of our tri-state and Haynesville gas properties, which total 30 million cubic feet per day of current net volume, are expected to close during the quarter. As in prior years, our volume profile is expected to continually increase through the year, exiting 2014 around 330,000 barrels equivalent per day.","So let me conclude by saying it's really a dynamic time at Noble Energy. 2014 is off to a strong start, and there are a number of important milestones and opportunities in each of our core areas. Execution is the key. We sanctioned 6 new major projects in 2013, and we now expect to sanction a similar number this year. This positions us to maintain our strong track record of delivering both in the onshore and offshore areas as we create a special and unique future for our company. Shannon, we'd like to now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first, we go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merril Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Chuck, gas prices obviously have ticked up here a bit. Can you give us an update on the current status of the carry arrangement with CONSOL and how that might change your activity level on a go-forward basis?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, a couple of items, obviously, gas prices have ticked up, and as you recall, the threshold at which the carry kicks in is when Henry Hub gas prices average $4 or above for 3 months consecutive. So certainly, as we look at the forward curve, it appears that we're headed down that path. I know Dave may comment a little bit on what impact that may have on our capital program this year, but I think I would just add that we have reached an agreement already with CONSOL on the program that we expect to execute this year. So I think it's safe to say that right now, we're not anticipating any change in that program knowing that the 2 companies, if they chose, they could mutually agree to make some adjustments down the road.","David L. Stover","Yes. And I guess, Chuck, just to add to that, as you've mentioned, we've set the budget, we've got our plans. And I don't see that changing based on any near-term outlook on pricing on that. I think the overall carry impact, and we've included that in some of the numbers, I think if it went in place here in March and carried for the full year, that's about a couple of hundred million dollars. But that's offset somewhat, probably at least by half, by the additional cash flow we'd see, so...","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sure, great. Just one other if I may, fellows. The -- Dave, the color on your activity levels in the DJ is helpful. I'm wondering if you could maybe peel back the onion a little bit further in terms of the long lateral activity as a proportion of your overall program. And how do these -- well, it looks like fairly encouraging wells in the Codell. Has that been figured into your guidance for this year and how it might not change your development planning if you continue to see the kind of success that you saw with this first well?","David L. Stover","Yes, Doug, I think the plans for this year call for drilling somewhere between 55 to 60 extended-reach laterals, and there's a mix. There's Codell, like we've seen. Probably just a few at most. Codell, that's planned in there right now. We've also had a mix of some of the A and the C interval wells also. In fact, we've also done a few of those. I think probably, 20% to 30% of our extended-reach laterals have been outside the B interval that we've already done. And that's probably similar to what we've got planned for this year. So everything that we've laid out is based on kind of that outlook as we go forward. As we start to get into more of the Integrated Development Plans and you start to see those come together, you'll start to see a growing increase of activity of an extended reach. But that would probably be more into 2015 and '16.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So there's no change to the plan part of the guidance you gave us in December?","David L. Stover","No change to that plan. I think the thing that we kind of highlighted today, there's a significant amount of activity that's really moving now towards this down-spacing. We're moving beyond the 16 wells per section. I think we mentioned and we show that on one of the slides, and that's throughout the field, not just in one area but in -- essentially in 5 different of our potential IDP areas. So I think that's a key component of this year's program.","Operator","And next, we go to Arun Jayaram with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","My first question -- I just wanted to ask you quickly on guidance. Dave, if I heard you correctly, you're anticipating kind of a year-end '14 kind of exit rate of 330,000, is that correct?","David L. Stover","Right.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then you talked about -- also, Dave, about 6,000-barrel equivalents of asset sales in the first quarter. So if we -- does that 330,000 exclude those asset sales, so you would have been at 336,000? Is that -- I'm just trying to understand the exit rate.","David L. Stover","I'd say it's around 330,000 there. I mean, again, those properties tail off some. There's a little bit of decline in it. But when you look at it, overall, as far as when we will close on those, I'd say you're probably looking at some time in March. So with or without those, you're still going to be close to that 330,000 range by the end of the year.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough, fair enough. Chuck, my second question, you may, as part of the antitrust, be -- have to sell some properties in Israel. Talked about 1 Tcf net to Noble. Could there be some meaningful proceeds -- and obviously, some good demand in Israel. But could this be -- could we anticipate some good proceeds from these properties in Israel, source of...","Charles D. Davidson","Well, of course, we -- we're still in the process of finalizing our agreement with the antitrust authority, but we do anticipate they'd involve the sale of a couple of those smaller properties. So we would expect certainly proceeds from it. Now this is a process that will go for a period of time. So right now, we've not included those in any cash flow projections or anything like that, that we've shown for guidance this year. But it's like our ongoing portfolio optimization. These are the things that, as we move through, provide some of our additional cash and liquidity as we go forward. But I don't have any estimate right now as to what might be potentially the proceeds on the sale of any properties there.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just my final question, obviously, there's some investor concern around DJ Basin differentials. You obviously have some good outlets outside of the basin. If you're going to ballpark what you thought your estimated differential from WTI would be in '14, can you give us a range?","David L. Stover","I think when -- we've actually been looking at how is it running now versus how it ran in the fourth quarter. And it looks like for January, at least, it's very similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. I think you'll start to see some help on that when you see the White Cliffs expansion go into place in the second quarter. It's also been impacted somewhat up there. There's been some facility turnaround and maintenance on some of the local refineries. I think those are starting to come back on somewhat. So I think a real change in the netbacks, and locally up there, probably starts to get some alleviation of pressure on that when you see the White Cliffs expansion come into play later in the second quarter. So I don't see it changing from what we've seen in the fourth quarter for the first quarter, anyway.","Operator","And next, we will go to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","I was wondering on the Diega flow test. That sounds like a pretty strong rate, but I'm curious -- two things. One, how did that come in versus your expectations? It sounds like it was better at least on the pressure drawdown or something, but -- or the buildup. But also, is there a gas injection that you're going to have to do there? And is that -- kind of does that play into the 2016 start date?","David L. Stover","Yes, it does. I mean, it -- these reservoirs, when you start looking at things like Diega and Carla, Charles, they're a little more complex than some of the [indiscernible] and so forth. So we've had to go out and take a measured approach of testing some of this. What we saw on this flow test was very encouraging, probably at least as good or better on flow rate that we saw, probably closer to the high end of maybe what we would've expected. And the other thing that we really saw here, it provided some insight into -- from a size standpoint, we weren't seeing boundaries that we maybe would've expected from just some of the seismic and so forth. So both of those things were very encouraging. But you do have to -- and it is a reservoir you're going to have to do pressure maintenance on. You're going to have to recycle gas most likely. So it adds that complexity that takes a little time to bring it online.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, got it. That makes sense. And then going back to the DJ there, if I -- just to make sure I got this right, so a lot of the big bump we saw in NGL volumes in the fourth quarter was really just the annual true-up from your plant processing?","David L. Stover","Right.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","And then I think Arun touched on this. I -- there's a lot of talk even from other operators in the basins [ph] about that weak spot pricing in the DJ. And so it was -- that was a great slide, you guys, but -- Slide 7 talking about all your takeaway there. But you're not seeing that in Q1 at this point? I guess that's what you're saying.","David L. Stover","What we're seeing in Q1 is about the same thing we saw in Q4. And one of the nice things of having that diverse supply -- and actually that marketing strategy really builds on the commitments that we made to get this Plains Rail facility in and get the White Cliffs in and now get the expansion underway on both of those. So as we mentioned, I think actually we're moving probably 80% of our volume out of the basin.","Operator","And next, we go to Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just trying to get a sense of kind of current Niobrara production, and maybe you guys can walk us through your first quarter production guidance, in a bit more detail. I guess that's down a little bit from the fourth quarter. Or maybe you could kind of help us a little bit with some of the pieces there to get there.","David L. Stover","Yes. Leo, no problem. You have a number of kind of nonrecurring or one-off items, if you look at them. It will start with one of the bigger items which I mentioned on the call. I think Chuck and I both mentioned, is over in Israel, where in the fourth quarter, you had the coal plant maintenance where it was down. So we were providing a -- if you call it disproportionate amount of gas at that point in time. We also benefit in the fourth quarter from some of the colder weather. If you remember some of the pictures over there of snow in Jerusalem and so forth. So there's kind of a step-down as those coal plants have come back on over there. So that's a -- probably at least 6,000 barrels a day or more of impact there. And then you have on infrastructure and facility infrastructure in both of Gulf of Mexico and EG. In the first quarter, you have some maintenance items there, along with the weather piece. I'd say what we're assuming for weather is probably around 3% to 4% of our volume for the first quarter, similar to what we've seen and used in the past up there. So I mean that's kind of what's impacting kind of the DJ and Marcellus portion, when you look at it. And also, as we mentioned, the DJ benefited from some of these plant true-ups in the fourth quarter. So a few things moving around there, but really right on track. First quarter is really right on track with where we expected and right on track to deliver the growth rate that we've laid out this year.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess just focusing on the DJ a little bit, I think in your prepared comments, you talked about how you had somewhere around 30% of your extended laterals coming from the A, C and the Codell, sort of outside of the B bench. Could you expand upon that a little bit more? I'm really just curious as to kind of, in your different key areas there in the DJ where you think the A may be derisked, the C derisked and the Codell. And just some color on where you think it's prospective will be helpful.","David L. Stover","I'll tell you, probably, Leo, the best thing to do is look at Slide 9 that we've put in there where we talk about some of our down-spacing testing, and we kind of highlight the benches that we're focusing on, on the down-spacing testing. And you can see there's a mix of different intervals in each of those 5 IDP areas. For example, in the Wells Ranch, our base program is down to 16 wells per section in there, with a lot of B activity. So what we're moving to on down-spacing is picking up the A and C. It's all getting back to how do we get a greater percentage of original oil in place recovery here. If you go back to what we showed on analyst day, we were still under 10% on 16 wells per section with as much as the oil in place has grown up there. So if you go back to there, you get on to 24 wells per section. I think you got us back up to about 12%, and you get down to 32 wells per section. You're getting closer to 15%. So that's where we're moving towards.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And I guess do you think that's all going to be sort of flushed out here in 2014 where by the end of the year, you'll have a really good idea of the -- sort of how you're going to develop everything? Or do you think that some of the A, C and Codell and different areas are still kind of more in exploration mode, and there's still a question mark? Just trying to get a sense of what you think has been kind of proved up or is it still kind of in test mode here.","David L. Stover","Well, I think what we've seen, and we've had a mix of wells in each of these different horizons, so what we've seen is -- is we're taking this down-spacing into moving it closer, more towards development. I sure wouldn't call it exploration on any of this. And when you look at the different intervals in each area that we're testing, I think we're going to aggressively move through that. Now with 30% to 40% of the wells this year focused on this down-spacing piece, we'll have learned a lot by the end of the year. You look at the number of wells we're bringing on each quarter. And I'd say when you look at these 5 IDPs we're talking about, I would anticipate we'll have those 5 IDPs fairly well proved up by the end of the year.","Operator","And next, we go to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On Israel, you mentioned that you would be likely to sign some contracts with regional customers for Israeli gas. I just wanted a little bit more color, were you referring to customers to take gas who are not in Israel? And can you just give us a status on the viability of non-LNG solutions within the region?","Charles D. Davidson","Sure, I think when we refer to regional customers, what we're talking about is markets that would be outside the Israel domestic market. So some of the countries we've talked about in the past have included Jordan, Egypt, Turkey and even -- we also consider the recent announcement of gas to Palestine for our power plant there. That falls in that category of regional outside the domestic Israel market. So our view is, is that in the past year, Brian, those have strengthened substantially just because of changes in the region. And that's what we point to as a lot of optimism as we go through this year of being able to firm up additional sales to those markets. We obviously are in discussions with a number of potential customers. Don't have anything to announce at this point. But again, we're seeing strong regional demand, and as a result, what it does is -- our belief is, is that there still is a need for an LNG solution here. But it may not need to be as large as what we were anticipating a couple of years ago. And as a result, some of these regional markets give us an opportunity to not only market more gas but also to accelerate the development. Obviously, sales through pipelines in the region can be done at an earlier date than waiting for LNG. So that was our thinking, and of course, that was part of what we outlined in our December analyst meeting as well. That's what it's all about.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just following up on that, do you expect, as you sign these negotiations this year, that you would make capital commitments on the midstream side to getting the gas from point A to point B? Or would that be done by someone else? And how should we think about the pricing relative to what you've been reporting or what you've [indiscernible] in Israel?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think in terms of midstream investments, it appears for some of these is that we will likely not need to be making any midstream investments, that in the case -- there could be some connections that will be made through the Israeli pipeline system, in which case they would be making those expansions and, of course, then charging a tariff for the movement of that. In some of our other discussions with potential customers, we've actually talked to them about coming to us. In other words, they making some midstream investments, again, pretty early on this since these are all under consideration. I think that we do see a strong market demand there as a result versus what we're selling in Israel that we would expect pricing to be at least that or even higher.","Operator","And next, we go to Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","A little question on Nevada. What is your #1 option if it turns out to be a successful venture? Are you still looking for the West Coast?","David L. Stover","I think yes. I think we've mentioned in the past there's been a lot of interest from some other refineries out West to pick up this type of crude if we're fortunate enough to have a significant play here. So the next step out there is to complete a well and see what we can flow out there. And we'll do that before midyear and then set up our plan for drilling some of these and actually probably testing some of the other areas that we haven't ventured into yet out there in the second half of the year.","Operator","And next, we go to David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Just thinking about the Wells Ranch area as a whole and the longer laterals plus kind of higher sustained IPs, it seems like after 90 days, kind of the initial rates that you're talking about there and at East Pony and in the Codell are a little higher. Are you getting better completion designs? Or what's driving a little bit better 90-day rates?","David L. Stover","I think as we've evolved, David, we take the combination. We do a lot of technical work. I mean, believe me, between the geoscience and the engineering placement of the wells, and then that also goes into the completion of the wells. And we've also done a lot of work on just how we flow these wells back. If you recall, and I think Gary's talked about some of this in the past, too, we've really gone to bringing these wells back online slowly, minimizing the drawdown. And we've seen really fantastic results from that. So yes, I mean, you're right. The characterization upfront is exactly right. We're very pleased with how the performance has continued to develop out here on these new wells and the wells we're bringing in, and we're starting to bring in more and more of them each quarter.","Operator","And next, we go to Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Just one question for me. Can you provide just a quick outlook on service cost and availability in the DJ and the Marcellus for this year?","David L. Stover","I don't -- I haven't heard of any big changes on anything there. I mean, and that's helping us obviously continue to bring costs down in both of those plays. One of the things I mentioned was that 10-well pad and Wells Ranch, for example, where the average well cost, drilling completion cost is now around $4 million. And if you recall, it wasn't that long ago where they were $4.5 million or more. Same thing when you look at that plot that we provided in Marcellus and how we continue to bring costs down in both of those areas. So I think overall, as far as pressure on service cost, it's been fairly consistent or fairly level. I haven't seen a big change there.","Operator","And next, we go to John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Yes, 2 quick ones. What would the ballpark be on an FLNG facility? Do you have any sense of that? And also, when would you have to really commit to that on a cost?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think on FLNG, with the engineering work still proceeding, it's probably a little bit too early on that. We are looking at FLNG that would probably be a little bit smaller than you would see in an onshore, maybe somewhere around 3.5 million metric tons per annum. But again, there's a lot of engineering work that's still going on with that. Overall, I think our -- there's really not much change from what we presented in December in terms of our overall thinking on schedules going forward for the foreseeable future. Again, this is all going to be a combination of -- as we sequence in Israel, just thinking about it, starting with the additional work that we're doing on compression at Tamar and some additional expansion work there and then moving into regional sales, as well as domestic demand for Leviathan. And then the LNG -- FLNG solution is really the -- one of the final phases there. And there's still multiple options. I know Keith talked about these in December, multiple options that are being looked at. So that's a bit down the road. And I know, Dave, you may want to comment a little bit more on that.","David L. Stover","I mean, you mentioned it, Chuck. The work is ongoing right now on FLNG pre-FEED work, if you will. So we'll have a much better handle on that later in the year. But it's too early to focus on a number yet.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay, that's fine. Regarding something you said, Dave, about PUDs in the DJ and also the Marcellus, it seems like a 3-year or 2-year time horizon is kind of short. Why didn't you book more? It seems very conservative.","David L. Stover","Well, John, the way we approach it, we look and we only book specific well locations that are tied to development plans. And that enables us to maintain flexibility in programs. What we don't want to do is to get in there and book a number of specific locations that we then have to pull off and -- as things change over time. So we don't want to get into a number of revisions, if you will. So we tie it specifically to well locations that we have tied up the development plans and laid out specifically.","Operator","And we will take our final question with Peter Kissel with Howard Weil.","Peter Kissel - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, one quick question. Really, it goes back a bit to the analyst day, but beyond 2016, the free cash flow generation gets to be pretty stout. And I'm just curious to see if internally, you've been able to rank what ability you have to redeploy that cash. Or is it going more towards debt paydown, share repurchases? Or any sort of color you could give there will be great.","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think anytime we have a free cash flow, we're going to look at all the options. We have been -- as we highlighted, we've continued to grow our dividend. And so we've had strong growth, and we compare very favorably with peers in the past on that. And certainly, in the past, we've looked at a number of options, but at the same time, we're -- we want to keep a very strong balance sheet. So we're not getting too excited too quickly about that free cash flow. We know it's coming. At the same time, we want to make sure we maintain a very strong balance sheet. And if there's opportunities to retire some debt, we can do that. If there's some other things like you mentioned, those are certainly possibilities. But we haven't made -- certainly, we've not made any decisions at this point as to exactly what we would do. 2016 is still a ways away.","Peter Kissel - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. And another thing you mentioned in your prepared remarks were just the ongoing portfolio management and how successful that's been over the last couple of years. But looking into 2014, should we expect it to be a bit less drastic and maybe focus on some smaller noncore packages versus some larger ones?","David L. Stover","[indiscernible]","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think we've...","David L. Stover","Go ahead, Chuck.","Charles D. Davidson","Yes, I was just going to say that we've continued to work through our portfolio. So there's the -- as we've mentioned, we've got some few cleanup items that are left and that we'll continue to look at it. But when you look outside, as we move through the year and you've looked at what we've done the last couple of years, so we've really got ourselves highly focused down to our 5 core areas plus what we have reserved outside those for new ventures. So with that, certainly, our biggest program was a year ago, and we're getting our portfolio, I think, thinned down now. So I wouldn't expect to see as significant of a program this year as what we've done and perhaps a couple of years ago. Dave, you were going to add something on that.","David L. Stover","No, I was just going to say when we talked about this at the analyst day, we kind of placed our divestitures for this year in at the end of the year. And the focus is on anything we can do to accelerate that process on some of those and pull those up earlier in the year. In our minds, that would actually be a positive. But they're not large pieces, but there are some cleanup noncore pieces, both internationally and domestically, that allows us to continue to focus on resources and everything else on the core areas that we're continuing to develop and deliver on. So that's the focus on the portfolio piece this year.","Operator","And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session.

Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (NYSE:USA), Inc.","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to Noble Energy's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2016 Earnings Results Webcast and Conference Call. Following today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brad Whitmarsh. Please go ahead, sir.","Brad Whitmarsh - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Dana. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope you've had a chance to review our fourth quarter 2016 news release which highlights another strong quarter of outperformance for Noble Energy. We also released our 2017 detailed guidance yesterday, and both of these releases along with a number of supplemental slides are available on our website. Later today, we anticipate filing our 10-K with the SEC.","Following our prepared comments, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would ask that analysts limit themselves to one primary and one follow-up question. Dave Stover, Chairman and CEO; and Gary Willingham, EVP of Operations, will provide some commentary. Ken Fisher, EVP and CFO; Keith Elliott, Senior Vice President of the Eastern Med; and Susan Cunningham, EVP of Exploration, are also here and will be available for Q&A.","I want to remind everyone that this event may contain projections and forward-looking statements as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures in the latest news releases and SEC filings for a discussion of those items.","For the fourth quarter, total company volumes came in at 410,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, it's the high end of our guidance, while organic capital was below expectations. Onshore, the DJ Basin had a great quarter from enhanced completions, and we saw strong results from new wells in the Delaware Basin as well. Robust volumes in the Gulf of Mexico and strong natural gas demand in Israel were also significant contributors.","Of particular note, total company oil volumes of 131,000 barrels per day were above expectations, and again, this was driven primarily by the DJ Basin and the Gulf of Mexico.","I would also point out that our U.S. oil differential tightened to more than $1.00 during the fourth quarter, as we continue to optimize our pipeline and rail markets onshore.","On the costs side, unit lease operating expense stood out, down about 10% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. DD&A was below guidance as well, reflecting strong U.S. onshore reserve adds.","Discontinued operational outperformance allowed us to deliver a beat on earnings and cash flow for the final quarter of 2016.","I want to point out some slight changes to our guidance and reporting going forward. As you can see on the slides, we are providing additional transparency on our volumes, including a breakdown between the U.S. onshore and offshore and by each hydrocarbon as well. Beginning with the first quarter of 2017, our reporting of actuals will reflect this same level of detail.","With that, I'll turn the call to Dave.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Hey, thanks, Brad. And I appreciate your bearing with me as my voice is a little raspy this morning. Say, looking back at 2016, it was an impactful and significant year for Noble Energy. Amidst substantial changes in commodity prices, beginning in 2014 and through most of 2015 and 2016, Noble stayed on course, delivered what we set out to do, and actually accomplished much more.","2016 was truly a year of outstanding operational, financial, and safety results. It was also one of great progress on key strategic objectives which we've outlined on slide 4.","I don't believe there are many peers with this extensive of a list of accomplishments over the year. I'm truly proud of our teams for delivering these achievements. We exit 2016 exceptionally well positioned to deliver top-tier long-term shareholder performance.","Before moving to our 2017 outlook, I'd like to take a moment to turn your attention to our 2016 year-end reserves update. As you can see on slide 5, we ended the year with total proved reserves of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent, which was up slightly from the previous year. Organic reserve replacement was over 190% of 2016 production from nearly 300 million barrels of oil equivalent of additions and performance revisions.","Even more impressive, total F&D cost was less than $5 per barrel of oil equivalent on an organic basis. Within the U.S. onshore, our increased activity outlook, along with performance improvements across all basins, led to an organic replacement of 280%.","On the right portion of the slide, you can see an adjustment to reserves for the divestments made in 2016. Including the 3.5% of Tamar as well as the Marcellus JV dissolution. Additions more than exceeded production and positive performance revisions, and essentially every one of our business units offset divestment impacts and price revisions from a lower SEC price deck. At the end of the day, the DJ Basin was up 13%, as was our combined Texas position. And the Marcellus was up 10%, despite the JV dissolution impact.","We continue to remain prudent on PUD bookings, having between three to four years at most of future activity reflected in proved reserves. And internationally, given the Leviathan sanction expected this quarter, you will see a material increase as first reserves from the field are booked in 2017.","Now, let's turn to 2017, on slide 6, we've outlined our major goals and outcomes for the year with a primary focus being the acceleration of our development programs, both onshore and offshore. Onshore, we're driving additional capital efficiency gains while rapidly increasing our activity. The expected closing of the Clayton Williams transaction in the second quarter will further our ability to benefit from this focus.","With the expansion of our onshore program, our midstream business will continue to grow. This is showcased through our integrated development approach, as multiple new NBLX facilities are starting up this year.","Offshore, we will begin development of our world-class Leviathan project in Israel. Another key objective listed, we're targeting additional asset proceeds of at least $1 billion for 2017. There are multiple pathways to achieve this target, including a potential dropdown of retained assets to NBLX, farm-down of Tamar and\/or Leviathan working interest, and potentially monetization of assets that may make better sense in someone else's hands. And we have the opportunity to participate in a very material exploration prospect, offshore Suriname, late in the year.","We're already off to a great start in 2017. We have leading positions in two top oil basins in the U.S., and we'll enhance our Delaware position upon closure of the Clayton Williams Energy acquisition. Both our DJ Basin and Delaware Basin positions contain 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent resources net to Noble.","Slide 7 and 8 are essentially repeats from the acquisition announcement, so I won't spend much time on these.","Drawing your attention to slide 8, I will remind you of the enhancements to our plan through 2020 with the acquisitions, as we aggressively develop our high-quality inventory. The outlook we provided in January is 3 percentage points to 5 percentage points higher across the board on volumes versus the November outlook represented in red diamonds. And operating cash flows grow at an even higher rate, up 7 percentage points from our November outlook.","Following the announcement, we've had great conversations with many shareholders and analysts, and the response has been extremely positive. The discussions have focused on how well the acreage fits with our existing position, the incremental impact to our onshore inventory, our ability to generate additional value as well as how it increases our volume and cash flow growth outlook.","Obviously, one of our major goals for the year is an efficient and safe integration of the company and assets into Noble. In particular, Gary will highlight the outstanding performance we've had through both drilling improvements and enhanced completions during the fourth quarter, and I look forward to seeing the results that our unconventional expertise can bring to this high-quality asset.","Now, let me highlight the momentum of our Leviathan development. We are on track to sanction the project this quarter with first gas targeted by the end of 2019. The final steps of the sanction are coming together nicely as we finalize contracts and permits required to begin construction. We're seeing excellent support from the energy ministry and other government agencies. Our teams continue to progress engineering design and have already begun purchasing long lead materials. We're bringing our key supply partners onboard, many of whom were part of the teams that deliver our highly successful Mari-B and Tamar projects.","In addition, we're planning to commence Leviathan development drilling by the middle part of the year. So, we're moving full speed ahead. Total capital spend in the Eastern Mediterranean is anticipated to be over $500 million this year, and our teams are excited to begin development of this world-class asset.","Before turning the call over to Gary, I want to spend a few moments on our outlook and plan for 2017. As we discussed in November, we're planning our business with a view that oil prices will remain in a range between $50 and $60 per barrel for the next few years. Despite the expected increase in U.S. onshore industry activity, when you step back and look at the global picture, I still see this as a reasonable range to plan our business. With this as a backdrop, I really like how we are positioned on the far left side of the cost curve in the U.S. with two huge oil plays onshore and substantial running room. Offshore, our strong oil linked cash flows and huge international gas resources which are ultimately linked to oil prices rather than U.S. gas, provide further support.","Looking at our 2017 volumes and capital outlook, we made a few adjustments from what we've provided late last year. We've raised our organic capital expenditure range to $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion, reflecting the rig additions for the expected timing of our Delaware acquisition and an accelerated rig addition in the DJ Basin. We've also built in some additional costs for the higher intensity completions that we have planned in the DJ and the Delaware.","As shown on slide 10, 75% of the total capital will be allocated to onshore development. Add in our Eastern Mediterranean program, and you have 95% of the program focused on these assets. We've also increased full-year total company volumes, 15,000 barrels oil equivalent per day compared to our November analyst event. This results in a 2017 range between 415,000 and 425,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","We've indicated on slide 10, the build throughout the year of total company volumes are expected to steadily increase each quarter with the second half of 2017 averaging between 440,000 and 460,000 barrels of oils equivalent per day. This is up more than 10% over the second half of 2016 after adjusting for divestments.","In the first quarter, we're impacted by a substantial underlift on oil in West Africa and the fewest number of U.S. onshore completions this year. You can also see the impact of the Marcellus JV dissolution and Tamar's 3.5% divestments within the first quarter. Obviously, the second half trajectory really stands out, reflecting our organic growth onshore along with the timing of the Clayton Williams acquisition.","The rig additions we've just made in the Delaware, the timing of new Eagle Ford completion, and a third rig added to our DJ Basin in the second quarter allows for a consistent volume growth trajectory throughout the year. As I have shown, current momentum, combined with our upward trajectory through 2017, puts us in a great position to deliver our long-term outcomes.","Now, let me hand the call over to Gary to provide further details on our robust U.S. onshore outlook for 2017.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Dave. We've highlighted our U.S. onshore program on slide 11, including details of wells to be drilled and brought on production by basin. We began 2017 with seven rigs running and will increase this throughout the year to exit with nine rigs across our U.S. positions.","As mentioned earlier, the DJ, Delaware, and Eagle Ford drive substantial total and U.S. onshore oil production growth for Noble. Combined, these assets are expected to be up by approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the second half of 2017 over the second half of 2016.","Oil makes up nearly half of the increase and our total oil onshore is expected to be up nearly 40% from the second half of 2016 to the second half of 2017. Three months ago, at our U.S. onshore update, we spent a substantial amount of time highlighting the strength of our U.S. onshore portfolio and our differentiated operational execution. I'd like to highlight some items that demonstrated this in the fourth quarter and how these results position us for another impactful year in 2017.","We exited 2016 with an accelerated pace of development. During the fourth quarter, we added two onshore drilling rigs in the Delaware Basin, bringing our total onshore rig count to seven, three in the Delaware, two in the DJ, and two in the Eagle Ford. I've been impressed with the operating efficiencies our teams continue to generate, especially on the drilling side where we are reducing both total drill time and costs, and doing so with outstanding safety performance.","Within the DJ Basin, we reduced average time to drill a long lateral wells at under six days. And in the Delaware, our average drilled footage per rig per day is up nearly 30% from the start of 2016. So, our long track record of driving efficiencies continues.","Looking at well productivity, clearly the results we are delivering from enhanced completion techniques highlight our leading onshore capabilities. We again saw great results from using longer lateral wells and higher proppant concentrations across our U.S. onshore position.","On slide 12, we've outlined some of these strong results starting with the DJ Basin. During the fourth quarter, we had 19 wells in Wells Ranch that reached peak production. The average lateral length was 6,500 feet, and you can see the wells in green on the plot versus the 1 million Boe type curve we provided in November.","Wells had an average proppant concentration of over 1,800 pounds per foot versus our type curve of 1,400 pounds per foot. And it's notable that 60% of the production from these wells is oil, which is considerably above our type curve assumption.","In addition, the blue line shows extended results for wells with 2,500 pounds per lateral foot or more. These 13 wells, none of which were represented in the green line, show even slightly better performance.","So, the key takeaways are value creation is not just about IP 24-hour or even IP 30-day, but sustainable performance over a longer period of time.","These enhanced completions and the way we are controlling the flowback of our wells is providing a longer plateau of production. In the case of these wells, peak production is being reached around day 90, and in some case, even out to day 120. It will be important to watch declines on these wells and the potential impact to ultimate recovery.","Our development plan in 2017 will continue to shift towards higher proppant intensity completions, targeting an average of around 1,800 pounds per foot while continuing to test some wells with over 2,000 pounds per foot. The majority of our wells on production in 2017 will be in the Wells Ranch and East Pony, some of the oiliest areas in the entire basin. We will be adding a third rig to our DJ Basin drilling program in the second quarter, a little earlier than expected, and we will run these three rigs for the remainder of the year.","Earlier this year, DCP announced plans for the next two major gas processing plants to be constructed in 2018 and 2019, along with a number of near-term projects to help expand capacity in 2017. This is a major step to ensure processing capacity keeps pace with the growth outlook in the DJ Basin.","On our own side, NBLX has commenced construction of the Mustang central gathering facility which should be operational late this year. We're drilling a number of wells in 2017 that will be ready to tie in to that facility late this year or early in 2018.","We've also seen very good results from our enhanced completions in the Delaware. Looking at slide 13, we provided initial performance of our most recent five wells that were brought on production in the fourth quarter. The wells tested a range of proppant concentrations between 3,000 and 5,000 pounds per foot.","Four of the wells were landed in the Wolfcamp A and are, on average, performing in line with our initial expectations for larger completions, above the 1.2 million barrel of oil equivalent type curve. It is still very early days with less than 60 days of controlled flowback production on most of these wells, and we will continue to watch performance uplift through time.","I'd like to draw your attention to the Sam Prewitt well. This well was completed with 4,200 pounds of proppant per foot. It's averaged over 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the first 30 days from a short lateral length and a 77% oil. Importantly, this is the southernmost well we have brought online to-date and is the closest well to the Clayton Williams Energy acreage.","Similarly, the Sky King and Jersey Lilly wells on the western extent of our acreage continue to confirm the quality of our acreage position. And orange on the map, we showed the Gaucho Estate which is Noble Energy's first operated Wolfcamp B well. It was completed with 3,000 pounds of proppant and is performing consistent with our initial expectations for the Wolfcamp B.","Similar to the DJ, it will be important to see what production rates are after 60, 90 and 120 days. In addition to the 35 wells expected online on our existing acreage in 2017, we will be bringing online 15 wells in the Clayton Williams Energy acreage this year following closing. Our activity will continue to focus on enhanced completions with the majority of our wells in the Wolfcamp A interval.","We've highlighted on the bottom left of this slide some of the operational efficiencies we're seeing with our Delaware drilling program. Compared to the first three quarters of 2016, fourth quarter average drill times reduced by two days even with an average lateral length increase of over 30%. This improvement resulted in an average drilling cost per lateral foot reduction of nearly 40%.","In addition to the integration of Clayton Williams Energy in 2017, our Delaware priorities are to continue to drive substantial operating efficiencies as we've transitioned in the full development mode. We're focused primarily on long laterals and multi-well pads. In fact, we recently completed the drilling of our first 10,000 foot wells on the three-well Monroe pad, and frac operations are currently underway. This pad includes our first 3rd Bone Spring well.","With that, I'll hand the call back to Dave.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Gary. Before ending our comments today, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the contributions of Susan Cunningham, who'll be retiring next month after 16 years of service to Noble Energy. Susan has been instrumental in establishing an industry-leading exploration program and team, and has been a valuable member of the executive team. Susan, we certainly wish you the best in retirement.","In summary, I am pleased with what we accomplished last year and where we're headed. Noble Energy has a clear line of sight on its future. We're designed for generating industry-leading returns from a world-class portfolio. We are already off to a great start this year.","So, let's go ahead, Dana, and take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. We'll go first to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, everybody.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Dave, I've got two questions, if I may. The first one is on the Wolfcamp A and B results that you talked about, and I realize there are lots of land limits on the A's in particular. But I'm just kind of curious, are you honing in on what \u2013 or how would you characterize, I guess, what a standard well design, if there is such a thing, that you view as optimal in terms of returns for the incremental cost of the proppant loading and taking into account any limitation you might have in McMoRan, what should we think as the \u2013 the opportunity you could take as you think about the development programs being called?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Doug, just to make sure I'm clear, you're you talking about what's standard lateral length we're looking for?","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","It would seem that the Wolfcamp A result obviously was shorter than, I guess, we would think going forward as a normalized sort of standard well design if there is such a thing but more importantly, I guess, I'm thinking about the incremental costs of the proppant loading relative to the uplift you've seen, relative to some of the other wells around you. The uplift could've been a little better, but I realize that the bigger problem you've got longer cleanup times and so on. So, I'm just trying to understand if you're honing in on what you think a standard well could look like, and obviously, would you expect that to come with a higher type curve?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I'll turn it over to Gary in a minute, but first, I'll say that we're very encouraged by what we're seeing so far, and Gary can kind of explain why and how we're thinking about it.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Doug. This is Gary, I think when you look at what we've done so far, some of these wells, as you point out, the lateral lengths are in the 3,500 to the 5,000 foot range, certainly we're transitioning to longer laterals. We mentioned just having drilled the three-well Monroe pad that's 10,000 foot lateral. So, just like in the DJ and the Marcellus, we think longer laterals are the right way to go here.","As far as the proppant concentration, I'd say it's still really early. The five wells that we just released range anywhere from 3,000 to 5,000 pounds, and that's above our type curve that we released in November which was 2,000 pounds. And very excited with what we're seeing so far with these higher proppant loadings, but we just need to see more data here as we've said that we need to see in the DJ Basin over time.","End of the day, we're really focused on what creates the most value, not the highest initial production rate or the highest EUR. So, we need to get a little more production data and make sure that we understand what the highest value completion is. And when we think we've got enough data, then we'll adjust type curves if we think we need to. But certainly, that's what we're focused on right now.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, I guess that it down for me but I guess what I was trying to understand was, are you at a point when you can confirm whether the costs of the incremental proppant loadings is still on an upturn or an improving curve, or if you sort of crossed the point of optimal return if you like, and it's still too early?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Doug, we're certainly not there yet in the Delaware. I mean these five wells we just released are the first ones we've done with a higher proppant loadings, and we've got, most of the wells, 60 days or less of production. So, I think we've said in the past, through these higher proppant jobs, we'd like to see at least six months, maybe as much as a year of production data, really be able to understand what the true ultimate uplift in EUR is versus maybe early time performance, and make sure that translates into value.","Obviously, the higher proppant jobs cost more, it takes more time to pump. So, cycle times are longer. And we just need to make sure that at the end of the day, it's worth it. We've been very encouraged with what we've seen, but we just like to see more data before we zero in on what we think the optimum completion is.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate your patience with my question. My follow-up is only a quick one. Big inflection on production in the back end of the year, could you give us some idea of pacing of \u2013 of how your completion schedule, in terms of rigs relative to production looks as we move through the year? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","I think, if I heard you right, Doug, the question's on the completion schedule in the second half of the year relative to the first and what's driving...","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","...what's driving the production increase in the second.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","With that and \u2013 with regards to the Permian as well, Doug?","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, you're definitely going to see completion activity pick up through the year. We just added two rigs to our legacy position there in the fourth quarter, going from one to three. We anticipate closing the Clayton Williams acquisition in second quarter. They're running one rig right now, and we've said we'll add another two rigs there by the end of the year. So, huge increase in drilling activity from fourth quarter of 2016 through the end of 2017, and you'll certainly see the pace of the new wells online pick up as well. I think when you look at the total Permian, we've said we'll bring about 50 wells online for 2017, and the vast majority of those will be in the second half of the year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. I'll give . Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Dana, are you there?","Operator","I am. We'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Hey, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Picking up on the topic of well costs, wanted to actually switch to the DJ Basin. Can you just give us an update on your well costs there at latest and greatest level of completion intensity and lateral length? And just give us some sense for where you see all that heading over the next year and any service cost inflation you expect in the DJ.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Brian. This is Gary. I think when we talked in November, we had rolled out costs in the DJ of $5.5 million to $6 million, depending on where it was, and those were based on the same type curves that we rolled out at the time, which were based on 1,400 pounds per foot at average proppant concentration. Clearly, the wells we've brought on recently are higher proppant concentrations than that. So, those come with a higher costs. But I think we'll continue to evaluate those completions. And as we've said, 6 to 12 months of data is probably what we need to zero in on what the right design is. So, later this year, we'll probably be coming out with some updates on those curves. I think in the meantime, we're certainly watching our costs, and understanding where those are headed.","I think when you look at all the different cost categories and the different basins we play in, we would expect to see something on the order of 5% to 15% cost inflation, depending on what it is and where it is. We've certainly included some of that, I think, in our midpoint guidance offset by some further assumed efficiencies. If we see some of the higher cost inflation numbers that some folks are quoting out there, that'll push us more towards the high end of our capital guidance for the year. But on an individual well basis, again, we're focused on value. Obviously, the bigger jobs come at a bigger costs, and we just need to ensure that we get the value for that through the higher EURs over time.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And I'm sorry, can you just give us \u2013 you mentioned a $5.5 million to $6 million based on 1,400 pounds per foot, what's the current number for 1,800 pounds and lateral length of 9,000 feet, or how much more is that right now?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Oh, just going from 1,400 to 1,800 adds another probably $300,000 to $500,000, something like that, assuming no further efficiency improvement. But we'll see where we land.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And in DJ, how do you \u2013 you highlighted the production mix and how the oiliness has particularly improved from some of the recent IPs. How do you expect that to trend over the life of the well?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","In the DJ?","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Exactly. Yes, in the DJ.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, I think, you see oil mix declining over time. The wells do get a bit gassier over time, so it'll definitely decline off. I think the type curve that we put out there in November for Wells Ranch, we assumed 40% oil. That's 40% over the life of the well. So, 60% in these first three months or so on these wells is certainly above the average we've assumed for the life. That'll come down over time. We'll see how it compares to the 40% over the life of the well.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. And last one, as you go into the development phase for Leviathan over the next year, you highlighted some of the flexibility you have to sell assets, I think, $1 billion is what you mentioned. Do you have a specific target for net debt-to-EBITDA or a comfort zone based on commodity prices, or how aggressive you want to ramp activity elsewhere we should think about?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think Ken does a good job of looking at a number of factors. It's not just net debt-to-EBITDA but all the different factors that also tie in to our discussions with the rating agencies, and \u2013 so, we continue to look at all of those, and stress those at lower price. One of the things \u2013 if you go back to last year, one of the discussions we had with the rating agencies that really landed well was our stress case when we looked at much lower oil prices and how we were able to withstand much lower prices over a number of different criteria. So, it's not just a criteria.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Yeah, good morning and thanks for taking my question. I'm just curious on that Mustang IDP. What does that do for total net DJ deliverability versus where deliverability is at today?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Are you talking about gas capacity in the basin, Pearce? Or what are you \u2013 give me a little more idea what you're talking about.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Yeah, so gas capacity in the basin.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I mean, I think as we move into drilling some wells in the Mustang \u2013 and we're not drilling a tremendous number there this year, it's more towards the end of the year. But those are definitely gassier areas, and so, you'll see a higher gas cut there. We've timed that to the first facility that NBLX is building in that area to make sure we've got capacity there, and then I think it's certainly timed very well with some of the capacity additions that DCP has planned with the first \u2013 the next big plant coming on in 2018 and then some in-field optimization and capacity improvement projects they're doing this year. So, you'll definitely see a little more gas from those wells, but I think it's matched up quite well with the capacity growth that we see coming in the basin.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Thank you. And then, my follow-up is, where do you see current sand cost? And then, what is your target for 2017, in the Delaware Basin, your average sand loadings that you're expecting on the wells that you're going to complete?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, I think sand cost is one of the things we're watching, and I think it's not just the cost but availability. We've had very good supplier relationships on sand for a number of years and feel quite confident that we'll be able to get all the sand that we need. But obviously, costs are creeping up. I think it's within that 5% to 15% range that I mentioned overall, depending on what service and what area. I think as far as what we're assuming for the Delaware for this year, the type curve is still based on 2,000 pounds per foot. Obviously, the wells we just released were higher than that, 3,000 to 5,000 pounds. I think most of the wells you're going to see us complete in 2017, at least until we have some more longer-term data on the higher completions, are probably in that 3,000-pound range. Those come at a higher cost again, obviously, so that's part of the increase in capital that you've seen since our November analyst day.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, everyone. Just a direct follow-up to the sand question, if I could. Is that the biggest pressure that you feel on costs, or are there other areas that are of more concern to you? Thanks.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","So, I wouldn't say it's the highest by any means. I mean we've got our eye on sand, we've got our eye on pumping services, drilling rigs, tubular. So, we're watching everything. We've got good long-term relationships with key suppliers in all of those areas. So, we feel pretty good with our ability to control those costs and offset some of it with efficiencies as best we can. So, sand is part of the mix, but it's certainly not the only one.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. But would it be the biggest one or are there other things that worry you more?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","I wouldn't say it's the biggest one. I also wouldn't say I'm overly worried about any of them.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Fair enough. A total change of tack, if I could. We were in Washington yesterday, speaking to policymakers. What's your perspective with your business mix of policy in Washington, and what concerns you there or excites you? And I'm thinking not only about domestic policy, but obviously also foreign policy. Thank you.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think I probably won't get into any policy contemplations here, Paul, because I'm not sure I know exactly where it's going whether it's domestically or internationally yet. So, we'll reserve comment and judgment, and see how it plays out.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, I think that's fair enough, insofar as it does seem that there's tremendous uncertainty about where we're headed, I just wondered if you guys had a particular agenda that you wanted to promote in any way?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","No, we'll stay we'll stay flexible.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Good. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We'll go next to Irene Haas with Wunderlich. Hearing no response, we'll move on to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Are we losing people there, Dana?","Operator","I think so. We'll move on to John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Yeah, hi. Thank you. With Leviathan, Dave, will you book reserves at the end of the first quarter with FID or year-end?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","We'll book them by year-end. I mean obviously, it'll be set up to be booked with FID but just \u2013 as far as actually reflecting it externally, it'll show up at the year-end reserve booking.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Okay. That's fine. With the Eagle Ford, given Clayton Williams, is it as critical for Noble going forward?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Is what as critical, John?","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Eagle Ford.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Oh, Eagle Ford. Well, it's still a sizable position when you look at the resource, it's still close to 0.5 billion barrels, and it's going to be a nice impact especially as we finish out a number of these wells in the South Gates Ranch this year. I think, longer term, the real driver will be our ability to define the Upper Eagle Ford as a key target, and do some of those tests and we'll have some of those tests later this year. So, it's still a very nice contributor.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Okay. Thanks. Last one for me. With the greater sand loadings, do you feel that you're just keeping the brittle formations open more, or are you getting more communication, say, with the interbedded clayier type shales within the formations?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, John. I mean those are all things that we're looking at. I think as we get through this year and talk about what changes, if any, we're going to be making to type curves, we'll roll out some commentary as to why we think performance might be better.","John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Gentlemen, can you hear me this time?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","We can, Charles. Sorry.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay. Whatever \u2013 no, whatever got Irene got me too there, and I apologize if maybe I've missed. I know John just asked a question about Leviathan, but if I could follow up on that. Could you talk about how that's going to progress over the year? I know you mentioned that you have sanction expected sometime this quarter, but can you talk about what we will expect in the way of construction progress or things along those lines in 2017? And also talk about what your preferred time line would be for a sell-down or to entertain a sell-down there?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I think \u2013 let me take the second question, and I'll turn the first one over to Keith, since he's driving all that timing in the project. The second question, as far as timing on sell-down. I think for Leviathan sell-down, that's probably best after sanction obviously, and as we get a little further on in the project. But we'll be open to looking at when we can get the value that would make sense. I think on Tamar, what we've talked about is I think we still have, what, five to six years on that. Five years from a timing standpoint. But I would expect that probably over the next couple of years, you'll see us bring that down to the 25%. A lot of interest in that opportunity, especially when you look at the cash flows.","Onto the first part of that, I'll let Keith talk a little bit about how he sees the progression of construction work over the next couple years.","J. Keith Elliott - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Charles, we're moving into the development phase there now. We have started a procurement for \u2013 of the raw materials for both the subsea and the platform construction project. I'd expect that that would lead us into moving to cutting steel around early second quarter to midyear. At the same time then, we'll be moving toward bringing a drilling rig in to the field to start the first development drilling sometime around the midyear to, again, mid second quarter.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful, Keith. And then, if I could ask a question going back to those DJ completions, and perhaps this is best for Gary, but I know you've filled a lot of questions on this already, but I'm wondering if you could talk about \u2013 I thought one of the most striking slides you had was the one people have talked about already, showing that uplift with your more recent completion designs. Can you talk about perhaps what you may be doing differently on the flowback of those wells with the higher proppant concentrations that is making them continue to increase their rate all the way through 90 days or beyond? And \u2013 yeah...","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Charles, I would have to echo your comment. That's one of my favorite slides in the pack, on slide 12, I think the results are just phenomenal, what we're seeing there. But let me turn it over to Gary, and I'll contain my enthusiasm here.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Charles, and I don't think we want to give away too much of what we're doing, but we're definitely controlling flowback on those wells. And I would say, they're staying flatter for longer under that control of flowback than what we've modeled for a typical type curve. And then, once we start seeing decline, we see shallower decline than is modeled in the type curves. So, the combination of those, if you can picture kind of a flat production profile versus a declining type curve, over time, the outperformance \u2013 cumulative outperformance versus type curve just continues to widen, right, until the actual production starts to decline as well.","So, that's what we're continuing to see on these wells as we get out to 90 to 120 days, we're continuing to see widening performance versus the type curve, over 50% above as we've noted in the comments. We'll see how much longer that lasts before we start to see some decline, and what the ultimate uplift to EUR is. I'd be surprised if it's 50%, but it'll certainly be more than what we've got modeled in the type curve. So, again, we'll gather some more data, continue to watch the wells, and later this year, probably come out with some new type curves for that area.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thanks, Gary.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","And we'll go next to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Morning. Gary, I was just wondering if you could give us a bit more color on what you're baking in, in terms of your outlook, in terms of enhanced completions on the production and CapEx side. It sounds like you are baking in higher completion costs, assuming 3,000 pound completions in the Delaware, but it's unclear what you're doing on the production side.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Arun, I think on the cost side, as we said, we'll focus mainly on kind of a 3,000-pound average in the Delaware this year. We'll probably continue to have some higher than that, but on average, that's probably a pretty good number to assume.","In the DJ, again, probably 1,800 pounds for average, some higher than that as well, but that's versus a 1,400-pound type curve. I think as far as what we assume for production, we're certainly looking at the early results in both areas, and as we've said repeatedly, very encouraged by it. But also, until we have enough data to really increase the type curves, I'd say we're continuing to be a bit conservative in how we're modeling production in those areas until we have more long-term data.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Fair enough. And I was wondering, Gary, if you could just comment on your thoughts on your initial Wolfcamp B completion as well as the Upper Eagle Ford.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, excited about the Wolfcamp B. I mean this is the first Wolfcamp B well that we've brought on as Noble Energy. I'd say, it's producing right in line with our type curve expectations. It's pretty flat right now, so we'll get some more data. That's another one where we've got less than 60 days of data on, so we obviously we need to see some more data. But very excited about that as our first Noble-operated deeper test in the area.","I think when you look at 2017, in the Permian, probably about 80% of our activity will continue to be focused on Wolfcamp A, Upper and some Lower. But we will start to test more 3rd Bone Spring, more Wolfcamp B. And so, we're excited with these early results.","On the Upper Eagle Ford, also quite excited. We've talked in the past about how we're looking at areas where historically the Upper Eagle Ford compared similarly to the Lower Eagle Ford, and then with our enhanced completions, we thought we could increase performance on both of those zones to where they would be very nice programs. I think the first well that we've got on supports that assumption. We're very happy with the production we're seeing out of this first Upper Eagle Ford test. It's actually as good or maybe even a little better than some of the recent Lower Eagle Ford wells that we've had in the area. But it's one well, so we need to get the second well online. We need to get extended production from both. We need to get some tests in some of the other areas. We've talked about some L&E tests that \u2013 or Upper Eagle Ford tests in the L&E area that we've got coming on later this year as well as a pilot in North Gates Ranch. So, all that data, we'll inform our conclusions as we go forward, but very excited with what we're seeing in the early days.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Gary.","Operator","We'll go next to Irene Haas with Wunderlich.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Yes. Can you hear me?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Irene, you're there.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","That's right. Thank you. So, a quick question on \u2013 oil price differentials is looking better, can you give me a little bit color on which geographic mix it's coming from?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think some of what you're seeing is a reflection up in the DJ, as we've moved more product through the pipeline. I mean it results in a little higher transportation costs, but it's more than offset on the netback revenue. So, that's really stood out over the last quarter and into this quarter.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Great. If I may ask, one other question is, everybody is drilling these longer lateral wells with higher intensity frac, delivering more oil, and probably with a flatter decline, I mean what would that do in aggregate to U.S. supply? I mean, are we going to see probably the money you spend getting more oil for longer with less decline, is that what we should expect for sort of the U.S. oil macro?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","It could be. I think the companies that have the large contiguous positions will benefit probably the most with the ability to put a larger percentage of their wells into the longer laterals and design them for longer laterals. So, yeah, we'll have to see how it plays out, but we've seen the efficiency improvements over the last two years. I think I've always said I don't think we're at the end of that. I think a big driver of that will be some of this longer lateral and higher proppant concentrations . But as Gary said, we're only going to do what creates real value for us in the price world that we're in.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Got you. Great. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Scialla with Stifel.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Another question on the enhanced completions in the DJ. There's been some thought, I think, that the completions there with the bigger fracs may work in the oilier areas like Wells Ranch or East Pony but maybe not so much in the gassier areas. But I believe, you showed back in November some data from the Moser wells and the Mustang area that looked pretty encouraging, just wonder if there's any update on those.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yes, Mike. We haven't given an update on them in the pack, but performance is still very strong on those wells. I think, in general, you're right. I mean I've heard the same thing that as you move to the gassier areas, the optimum proppant concentration could be lower than what we see in the oilier areas. Obviously, our experience, so far, has been limited to those Moser wells. And so, as we drill more wells in the Mustang area later this year, we'll start to get a better handle on that ourselves, but that is a possibility.","I think when you look at the performance of those initial Moser wells and the proppant concentrations that those were pumped at, I can't remember exactly what it was, I think it was around 1,400 pounds per foot, which in and of itself is enhanced, right, relative to the historic frac designs in those areas. It's just not as enhanced, if you will, as the oilier areas. But we're quite happy with that. We'll continue to watch those wells. And as we move into the gassier areas in the coming years, not in a big way anytime soon but in the coming years, we'll test different designs there just like we have in the oilier areas.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then, on the Wolfcamp, a lot of your competitors have been talking about two zones within the Wolfcamp A nearby, wondering if you're thinking along the same lines. And if so, any plans to test that concept either with the staggering or stacking wells this year?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yes, I mean we talked about Wolfcamp A, Upper and Lower as well. And both will be a focus for us in 2017. I think when you look at our existing position prior to Clayton Williams where we're going to drill around 30 wells or so, probably two-thirds of those are in the Upper, a little less than a third maybe in the Lower, and then a few Bone Spring wells.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And last one, if I could. Gary, you mentioned when you did the acquisition of Clayton Williams that you really didn't put a lot of value on the Bone Spring, some other operators there have been talking about the shale intervals in the Bone Spring in the Southern part of Reeves County, I wonder if that is anything you guys have looked at yet.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I wouldn't say we spent a whole lot of time looking at it yet. We don't have the deal closed yet, but it's certainly something that we're keeping an eye on other's activity as we get the deal closed, and start to ramp up activity, we'll keep an eye on it. Near term, I think you're going to see most of the activity on the Clayton Williams acreage continue to be Wolfcamp A as well. But you're right, we didn't put any value really on anything beyond the Wolfcamp A, so to the extent other zones, whether it's 3rd Bone Spring, Wolfcamp B or C have value potential going forward, that's just additional icing on the cake, if you will.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to go back to the DJ in the context of the initial results on these enhanced completions. I mean, if you think about this kind of leading-edge result and the potential implications around the EUR relative to the well cost increase, how do these compare within the portfolio at this point in terms of how they compete on returns or F&Ds relative to the Del Basin in particular, but also relative to Eagle Ford?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","I think they perform quite well, Michael. I mean when you look at the onshore economics that we rolled out in November, DJ economics were very strong, 30% to 50% returns, that was at the type curve assumptions, so 1,400 pounds per foot. It would be equivalent to the black line on the Wells Ranch plot that we released again today that were, in the early days, showing 50% performance above. So, clearly that outperformance adds possibly substantially to the economics. And again, we continue to drive efficiencies and costs down where we can too.","So, economics are only getting better. They certainly compete with anything else in the portfolio, and it's in an area that we continue to focus a large part of our capital program on, drilling roughly 150 wells this year and bringing on 120 or so.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Right. Great, makes sense. Yeah, it certainly seems like you'd think it competes with most anything in the Lower U.S. and I guess just as a follow-up, trying to think through, if you continue to have these sorts of results that are outperforming expectations in DJ, Delaware, and Eagle Ford, really I mean, how should we think about potential use of, let's say, additional proceeds from that outperformance, meaning as you bring in more cash, recycle more cash, what's kind of the anticipated first use? Would you accelerate activity or, I guess, just put it on the balance sheet? How should we think about that?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, from an activity standpoint, Michael, I think we're staying consistent with what we've been talking about which is going to be DJ and Delaware. I mean that's going to be dependent on performance, but what we've seen, there's nothing that would change our mind at this point.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","But potentially though, if you continue to have the outperformance, you'd maybe do more in those areas? Is that \u2013 am I hearing that right?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","I think if you look at our plans for 2020, it shows increasing activity over that plan, then it's just a matter of how fast and what supports any changes over that period of time. So, as Gary said, it's too early to tell, but we're sure watching it awfully close.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Got it. Appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Gail Nicholson with KLR Group.","Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC","Good morning, everyone. I'm going to actually switch tack to \u2013 on the exploration side. You guys have the test in Surinam late 2017. You picked up some more acreage in Newfoundland. When you think about your exploration portfolio holistically, what area or region are you most excited about? And if you had some incremental CapEx to allocate to exploration activity, where would that go?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, well, I think there's a number of areas we're excited about. I think we're not spending as much as we did a few years back, and we're probably not spending in as many areas, but what we are spending it on we're pretty excited about. The project in Surinam, for example, is a very large opportunity that our folks have worked with partners to continue to progress, and we're excited to get that drilled. I think the same thing goes for what we picked up offshore in Newfoundland, the acreage we have in Gabon and continuing to look at that area. But I guess, Susan here, probably I ought to turn it over to her to give some of her comments.","Susan M. Cunningham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, generally, I still like West Africa if you get the right opportunities. We're excited about what we have in Gabon, and we're looking at other possibilities. And we're also evaluating Mexico. We've decided the last couple bid rounds not to participate, but we're still evaluating it and looking for the right thing with the right kind of economics on it.","Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC","Okay, thank you. And then, just in regard to the higher oil composition at Wells Ranch, do you think that is more driven by the choke management, or do you think that's potentially more driven by the enhanced completion design?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","That's a good question, Gail. I think it could be a combination of both. But again, as I said before, I think we'll continue to work through why we think we're getting better performance than we expected to see. And as we get later in this year and start to update some type curves, we'll roll out some information as to where we think that's coming from.","Operator","And we'll go next to David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Morning. Just one quick follow-up. If I think about the Marcellus, the decision to go ahead and complete those wells, what \u2013 I mean obviously price impacts that. But what was the decision there, and then, how do we think about the Marcellus as part of the portfolio going forward?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think, like we've talked about, we've got some developed, drilled uncompleted wells that we're focusing on this year. And then, we'll continue to watch the longer-term outlook for gas price as we move through the year.","In our plan, we had plan to bring a rig in later this year. Of course, that's always dependent on how it's competing in the portfolio and the economic outlook. I think overall in the area, we'll continue to look at what makes sense for us to do relative to what others' plans are in the area. And if there's something that makes sense for somebody else that they have a plan to do differently and it fits in their portfolio different, we're open to looking at that. But for right now, our plan is to focus on the uncompleted wells this year that have very good economics, very competitive, and then evaluate the rig as we're getting closer to later this year and looking into next year.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then, just one more back to the DJ. Is there any difference in the way, whether it's the Niobrara or Codell, those formations are accepting the proppant, are you seeing a difference? And I know the focus has been obviously the East Pony and Mustang, but have you seen a difference in that?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Difference between Niobrara and Codell?","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, as far as the enhanced \u2013 as far as which rock is willing to accept the higher proppant, is there a difference between formations?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I mean, I think just given the nature of the formations, it's a little bit easier to pump into the Codell. But I'm not sure as far as the performance of that whether we've seen a whole lot of difference.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our final question today from Paul Grigel with Macquarie.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Just one on first quarter guidance here to start. You note the DJ is likely to decline. And the release notes that's due to the low north completions in the first quarter. With the flatter declines that you guys have talked about, should we be viewing this as due to timing of completions that happened in fourth quarter, or even back to third quarter? Just trying to reconcile the declines there, given the relative uplift that we've seen from the increased proppant.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Paul, I think it's both. We actually had fewer completions in the fourth quarter of last year than the third quarter. And then, looking at 2017, we've got the fewest number of completions in the first quarter of all the quarters through 2017. So, it's just a bit of a low spot over those two quarters in the completion activity. Typically, I think we've seen that kind of through the winter period in past years, too. So, that's just kind of what's driving it.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I think if you go back and look at the last four years, first quarter's been the lowest quarter for us, three out of those four years.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Perfect. And then, as a follow-up to that and without pressing too hard on to 2018. Given the strong second half growth, how should we think about momentum into 2018, given the number of completions that are back-half weighted and the typical seasonality in 1Q? Should we be viewing 2018 in a similar vein? And then, how should we thinking about kind of a longer-term governor on activity? Is that still spending within cash flow post the acquisition and post the update today?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think, as you said, it's too early to give the outlook and trajectory for 2018. But I think in general, and I'll go back to my comment, if you look at history. Historically, the first quarter or the first half has usually been less than the second half, just based on activity and also accounting for winter months, et cetera. So, I would expect without having a clear view of it yet that I'll be surprised if it's not a little bit of the same.","I think as far as spending, we're continuing to look at over the next four or five years. And what we laid out for our plan was the ability to spend within cash flow. In a $50 world, if we get a $60 world, we're probably generating excess cash flow, with the plan we've laid out, that would drive us to look at what we could accelerate especially if we're seeing the results, like we're seeing in these program, so far. So, we'll continue to develop that and lay it out as we go.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Perfect. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session.

Please go ahead.","Brad Whitmarsh - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jamie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we issued our quarterly earnings release and we also posted to our website a number of supplemental slides for this call. You will find them helpful as we talk through our prepared comments. Later this morning, our 10-Q will be available on the website as well.","Following prepared comments, we'll open the call for question-and-answer and we'll complete in approximately an hour. We would ask the participants limit themselves to one primary question and one follow-up. Management members participating today are Dave Stover, Chairman, and CEO; Ken Fisher, Executive VP and CFO; Gary Willingham, Executive VP of Operations; and Susan Cunningham, Executive VP of Exploration and New Ventures.","I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains projections and forward-looking statements, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures in the latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those items.","With that, I'll turn it over to Dave.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had a great quarter. And as you can see from our operating results, we were able to achieve more, while spending less. Before discussing specific items, I want to take a moment to reflect on the quarter. First, I'm extremely pleased with the fact that we were able to significantly reduce capital and controllable costs, while still delivering outstanding organic volume growth.","Second, it is notable that discretionary cash flow was greater than our capital this quarter. And third, we saw continued capital efficiencies in our onshore program, supporting returns and margin improvements in the business. This all positions us to extremely well for finishing the year strong, and beginning 2016 even stronger.","Starting the rest of our discussion with capital expenditures, we continue a trend of reducing our quarterly capital. This has come not only from adjusting our activity levels, but also from our relentless focus on increasing operating efficiencies and driving down well costs. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were down approximately 20% from the second quarter of this year, and 50% from the first quarter. This was accomplished, despite the incremental capital allocated to our new Texas assets, beginning this quarter. We've made great progress towards our goal of aligning capital with cash flows.","Full year 2015, capital has now been reduced to slightly less than $3 billion, approximately $100 million under previous expectation. While working the capital side of the business, we put an equal effort into bringing controllable unit costs down. We've reduced third-quarter lease operating expense and total production cost per barrel of oil equivalent to their lowest level in five years. These results have been delivered, while maintaining a best-in-class safety record and the lowest recordable incident rate in our history. So, I couldn't be more pleased with the efforts of our business units.","Operationally, we've continued our tremendous momentum. Sales volumes for the third quarter totaled 379,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, substantially outperforming both original guidance and our raised expectations.","I am pleased that each asset in the portfolio delivered higher volumes than our original forecast for the third quarter. And we're carrying that overall momentum into the fourth quarter. We have raised fourth quarter volumes now to range between 385,000 and 405,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. A major contributor to our performance has been the DJ Basin. The operating teams have done an amazing job, enhancing value by realizing material efficiency gains, drilling longer laterals and improving completion techniques.","Third quarter sales volumes averaged a record 116,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and total liquids production was a quarterly record as well, up 10,000 barrels per day from a year ago, most of which is crude volumes. This quarter, we saw the positive impact of the late June startup of DCP's Lucerne-2 plant. Lower line pressures helped our legacy vertical production, which averaged 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter. This is an increase of more than 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day above pre Lucerne-2 rates.","Additional infrastructure build-out continues with the Grand Parkway low pressure line-loop system. This project is on schedule for startup at the end of this year or early next year and will further improve gas infrastructure reliability in the Basin. Drilling performance continues to be exceptional, and we have lowered spud-to-rig release times from standard lateral wells to between five days and six days. Total well costs including allocated facilities capital are on track to be below $3.5 million in Wells Ranch for a standard lateral.","We're also on track to be less than $3 million for a normalized long lateral. We've continued to modify completion techniques and we are seeing good success with slickwater fluid completions in certain areas.","On slide eight, we have highlighted a recent development area, which includes our first slickwater wells in Wells Ranch. Early results show strong production performance and lower overall well costs. During the quarter, we closed on the merger with Rosetta Resources, which established new core operating positions for Noble Energy in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basins.","While still early, initial results show that we are materially enhancing the value of these assets. Since closing, we drilled seven Lower Eagle Ford wells, and one Delaware Wolfcamp A well. And have already substantially reduced spud-to-rig release times in both plays. In the Eagle Ford, spud-to-rig release times averaged eight days for a 5,000-foot lateral, a reduction of approximately 30% from the average on these assets earlier this year.","And our first operated well on the Delaware Basin was drilled 10 days faster than the average of prior wells on our acreage. Production performance in the Lower Eagle Ford remains very strong. We've highlighted on slide nine the two most recent well results, which are Noble Energy's initial designed and executed completions in the Eagle Ford. They include modified completion designs versus the historical practice on these assets.","Most wells are performing materially above the 3 million-barrel type curve for the area. In fact, the most recent well, which is still in flow back, looks to be the best well ever completed on the acreage. These are strong and improving early results, highlighting the very productive nature of this acreage position and the value from Noble's technical expertise.","Moving forward, we have plans to continue testing enhanced completion designs. Including, reduced stage and cluster spacing that we've brought from our other onshore plays. We anticipate a one-rig program in the Eagle Ford and a one-rig program in the Delaware, as we exit this year.","Now, turning to our offshore operations. Both Big Bend and Dantzler, recently commenced production. I want to commend our exploration, appraisal and development teams for their outstanding performance on this project. Delivering both fields ahead of schedule and on budget, extends our exceptional track record of major project execution and highlights the competitive advantage for Noble.","Production is quickly ramping to an expected combined grows maximum rate of over 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or about 20,000 per day net to Noble. In fact, Big Bend has already tested close to full rate over the weekend. And Dantzler, should ramp up quickly as well. These fields are major contributors to our fourth quarter and 2016 cash flow and oil volume growth.","At Gunflint, the rig has completed drilling operations, and wells completions are underway. Installation of pipelines and subsea equipment has begun. And first production remains on schedule for mid-2016.","Moving to West Africa. Our operated projects at both Aseng and Alen continued to outperform internal estimates. The non-operated Alba compression project, which will stem field decline and extend productive resource life, advanced to over 80% complete, and is on schedule for startup mid next year.","As expected, temporary Alba field shut-in while installing the compression module, will result in a sizable impact to both first quarter and second quarter 2016 sales volumes. On the exploration front, our initial operated well offshore the Falkland Islands provide substantial knowledge about the petroleum system. We will use well results to recalibrate the seismic interpretation.","The Humpback play was just one of several play types across our vast 10 million acres. At the end of the year or beginning of next year, we will drill the Rhea Prospect in the Northern license area, which is adjacent to proven oil discoveries. Results should be available toward the end of the first quarter.","In Israel, our natural gas sales averaged a record 305 million cubic feet of gas per day during the third quarter, an increase of 15% from the same period last year. For the month of August and most of September, the field averaged over 1 billion cubic feet per day and stellar operational performance continued with nearly 100% uptime at the facilities.","Marketing efforts in the Eastern Mediterranean continue, where regional demand for our natural gas remains strong. The recent Egyptian discovery by another operator, which is targeted to domestic Egyptian use for power and industrials has heightened the interest in the Basin.","Regional customers remain under-supplied by almost 4 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day now, and we estimate that shortfall growing to 9 billion cubic feet per day by 2025. The proven reliability and performance at Tamar, along with the fully appraised and flow tested Leviathan field, have us well-positioned to supply gas to this under-supplied region.","During the third quarter, a number of significant steps were completed to provide a clear line of sight for the next round of project developments in the region. The regulatory framework for hydrocarbon development was finalized and approved by the Israeli Cabinet and the Knesset. And Israeli government is currently taking action to follow through on this framework. Yesterday's announcement from the Prime Minister's office is a further indication of the commitment to moving forward with gas development.","So, as we're approaching 2016, we intend to be cash flow neutral or better, while maintaining long-term operational capacity. Our diversified portfolio provides exceptional investment optionality and we will continue to be extremely disciplined and diligent in our capital allocation process.","Next year's onshore capital program will again focus on those activities with the highest returns and values. Our positions in the DJ Basin and Texas should continue to attract the majority of our investment. Offshore capital will mainly be attributed to our one-rig exploration and appraisal program in the Gulf of Mexico, until Israel projects are sanctioned.","While exploration capital will remain lower in 2016 than previous years, we believe this is a great environment to enhance and deepen our exploration inventory of high quality opportunities at a relatively low cost of entry. Although production growth is not the focus, our 2016 volumes will likely be higher than pro forma 2015 levels.","The momentum of our business can deliver this at significantly lower capital program than this year. As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, we intend to continue achieving more, while spending less. I believe, we are well-positioned to build a great future.","With that, Jamie, I'd like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. We'll take our first call from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning, guys and great operational results today.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Morgan \u2013 Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. It's Evan, yes. I know it's early for the budget and I appreciate your comments earlier. Yet philosophically, how are you thinking about that budget in terms of what you're solving for, right? Your offshore startups, your DUCs, your operational momentums, you clearly have an ability to grow volumes within cash flow at the strip. Are you looking to generate free cash flow into 2016? Or are you solving for more minimal operational capabilities through the trough? Any color there would be appreciated.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. I appreciate them. I think, we're still in the early stage of the finalizing the plans for next year. You've hit on a couple of the key elements. We are going to manage within cash flow, that's the way we're setting ourselves up.","I think at the same time, as you mentioned we have a lot of flexibility, especially when you look at the overall portfolio. So I think, as we look to next year, we're going to make sure we maintain our financial strength, we're going to make sure we allocate the capital to the projects with a greatest returns and value. And then at the same time, we'll maintain the financial strength. We're going to watch and make sure we're keeping the operational capacity, such that as things do turnaround and we get into a higher price environment, we're well-positioned to be able to take advantage of that very quickly. I think those are all some of the things that we think about as we're looking at next year.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And then maybe I could switch gears on Israel. I appreciate your, the macro demand commentary and the update. Once the framework is approved there, which could be any day, could you provide color on what happens next? I mean, where are you in the process of Leviathan feed or Tamar expansion? Any range of potential capital spend there in 2016?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. I think to start with, we'd still expect minimal capital spend in 2016. The main pieces that will come together as you move forward with the framework, you have the contracts, you have the actual contracts, the marketing arrangements if you will, moving those LOIs to executed contracts, that will move forward. The same time, that will setup the opportunity to finalize financing and in conjunction with all of that we'll be going to back up to the market to bring in the new costs for the projects in the new market environment.","So I think what we've continued to say is now that the framework has been approved and moving forward with that. We've been looking at kind of a timeframe of about a year to bring all of this together to move to FID.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Appreciate it guys.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Dave and to the rest of your team there.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Dave, you made \u2013 I want to follow-up your comments you made about Equatorial Guinea in 2016. I know you said that you're \u2013 I believe you said, you're adding compression at Alba facility and that's going to negatively impact volumes in the first half. Is that mostly going to be \u2013 mostly gas? Or can you give a little more detail on what that impact will be?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's really on the full field. I think the expectation, Charles, is that towards the end of the \u2013 midway towards the end of the first quarter, you'll see the full field go down for about \u2013 oh, half a month. And then, I think about another month of partial or half field impact. So it will be a mix of the full field impact. But that's as we expected that's no different than what we have been planning for since we started the compression projects. So that's all been accounted for in the way we continued to look at 2016 and...","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. That makes sense and is helpful. And then shifting back over to the DJ, where you guys have had great results, particularly this last quarter. But it's a little \u2013 could you give us the narrative in your mind about how you progressed to the slickwater fracs? And really I guess the question is, is this something that just works in the oil \u2013 is more appropriate for the more oil rich areas and that you guys were really on this hybrid gel frac? Really because that was what was typical for the field more in the gas center of it? How has this progression worked?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'd say starting with, I'm extremely pleased that the team continues to look at what's the next step, next evolution and development here, they're always kind of pushing the envelope and testing what could be even more efficient. I think I'll let Gary kind of expand and talk about how they've thought through this process and how it applies?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah, Charles, we've talked about many times in the past, how we're constantly looking for ways to improve our completions out there and also how we don't expect one optimal completion design to work across the entire field, it's likely to be different, depending on where we are operating at any given time. So where we've been focusing the slickwater completions most recently is in East Pony and Wells Ranch, which is the oilier part of the field.","We haven't really had that much activity back in the core gassy part of Wattenberg recently. So, too early to say, whether slickwaters might provide some benefit there in the future. Again, we're focused on Wells Ranch and East Pony right now. But seeing some very nice results, there's a slide in the pack that shows an area of Wells Ranch, where we've got a number of slickwater wells that are significantly outperforming the gelled hybrid jobs in those areas.","We're seeing similar results in East Pony and we'll continue to test that as we go forward. And it also reduces our well cost by about $400,000 per well. So it's a good performance to-date.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Yeah. All right, Gary, thanks for that detail.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, good morning, everybody. So a quick follow-up on that last question, if I may. So the slickwater, I think you said in your commentary, that there were some areas where you're choosing to move forward with that. What's the differentiating factor as to why that wouldn't be deployed across the whole play? I guess as an add-on, what are the implications for how we should think about the type curve that you've given us in those areas?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think it's just too early to say what other parts of the Basin it will be applicable to, Doug. As you know, we like to move in a fairly measured approach as we test new completion techniques and like to show that it's repeatable before we just make wholesale changes across the Basin. So, we'll continue to monitor these wells, we'll shift more activity in these specific areas to slickwater in the near future. But before we're ready to declare that's the right way to go across the Basin, we'll just take a more measured approach to it.","I think as far as the uplift, I think if you look at the performance on those wells, on the slide for Wells Ranch, I'd say that that's the performance that we're seeing to-date, no reason to suspect our near-term activity in Wells Ranch, where we're using slickwater that we'd see anything different than that.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. But no formal upgrade at this point, but pretty much is, the writing's pretty much on the wall; right?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I mean, I think you can look at the early performance and probably draw some conclusions, we don't have enough data yet to really come out with the new EUR type curve over the life of the well, given how recent it's been, but you can probably draw some conclusions based on that early data.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","[Okay].","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But as we've done in the past, we usually like to get three months, six months or longer production and then reevaluate.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. My follow-up is really I guess is going back to the capital question for next year, really more of capital allocation between the Lower 48, Permian relative to DJ. I'm just wondering if you've got any early look as to how you're thinking about how you might allocate? I'm thinking really more about the potential to ramp in the Permian in favor over the DJ? Or just how you're thinking about it at this point? I'll leave it there. Thank you.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's probably a little early to get into too much of that. But we've laid out at last call our initial look, coming out of the box with Rosetta of how we would start to ramp up the Delaware Basin over next couple of years. The bigger ramp in Delaware, I think, really starts in 2017, but we'll be evaluating both the returns and value-add per incremental capital in each of those areas between \u2013 specially between DJ, Eagle Ford and Permian and it gives us a lot of flexibility now, with all three of those assets that are performing very well.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Appreciate the answer, Dave. Thanks very much.","Operator","We'll next go to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe if I could follow-up one on CapEx. Can you talk a little about the drivers of the lower CapEx level on this quarter? And then as you look at fourth-quarter CapEx, is that kind of low $600 million run rate, is that a reasonable run rate and kind of activities level into 2016? Or should we expect negative or positive drivers one way or the other into next year?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think when you look at third quarter for this year, that's kind of an outcome of the way we set up the program starting the year, where we rapidly got in motion to bring down activity. And for example in the DJ, we've ramped down pretty quickly on activity. We brought the Marcellus and that alignment with our partner in the Marcellus to bring down activity there, start to see some of the roll-off and getting through the completion of some of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects. So, not a huge surprise to us. I think the other element there though, we started to see actual cost per well come down pretty dramatically too. So that factored in to, I guess being a little ahead of where we expected to be by that time in the third quarter, and you're seeing all of that carryover into the fourth quarter.","I think as far as read through the next year. I mean still too early to give out any specifics, but I think as we mentioned earlier, we're going to be managing within cash flow for next year. We've got a lot of flexibility on activity levels that probably the big swing pieces will be our onshore activity. And again, we'll focus that between what we just talked about in the Texas assets and the DJ Basin is the \u2013 what's the right activity level there.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And then maybe if you could talk broadly about your exploration strategy going forward. How much of the budget should we expect to see allocated to exploration going forward? Should it be a similar level to 2015? Or I guess any of your comments in terms of how that fits within a broader context of capital allocation over the next couple years.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Let me give you a few comments on how I see it and Susan, maybe expand on how she's thinking about exploration in this environment. But it will be a low level, again next year, it was around 5% or so of our capital this year. I don't see it being much beyond that next year. The focus next year will probably be in the Gulf of Mexico as far as actual drilling activity.","But then the rest of it is looking at how we build inventory right now, and let me ask Susan, that just expand a little bit on her comments about this environment?","Susan M. Cunningham - Executive VP-Global Exploration & New Ventures","Yeah, we're really focused. This is a great time to really be focused on getting the best quality portfolio that we can possibly get. We do expect that our percentage in terms of capital in 2016 might be a little higher than this year just because the capital is down and we're drilling in the Gulf of Mexico a little bit, but not significantly. So, it's really going to be focused on building the portfolio with real quality possibilities.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good. Would that entail \u2013 I guess as you look forward, there's a lot of people exiting offshore plays and deepwater assets around the world. Would you guys look to take advantage in terms of increasing your exposure to longer term resource and acreage going forward?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think so. I think the advantage we have is, we have an exploration staff that's had a tremendous amount of success in the past, that gives us that capability right now where others may not have that, and I think that creates opportunity. I mean when you step back and look at it, we're benefiting from that capability with our three offshore assets now that are delivering tremendous margin and stability. So I think it's something we'll continue to look at. But I think you can do that in this environment at a relatively low cost versus what we've seen in the past few years.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll next go to Steven Richardson with Evercore ISI.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore ISI","Good morning.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Steve.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore ISI","Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Israel. I appreciate your prepared remarks, Dave. But one question was, in terms of talking about an FID maybe 12 months from now on a project, can you delve a little bit deeper into what that means for \u2013 is it one FID for both Leviathan and this prospective export project from Tamar? How are you thinking about the linkages or the de-linkages of those two projects? And if you could, any idea on kind of timing between FID and kind of first sales from the project scope you're looking at?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Steve. I think the \u2013 nice part or one of the nice elements of this framework, it actually delinked Tamar and Leviathan. So we're actually looking at those as two separate FIDs. And the timing on Tamar is really going to be dependent on getting that contract with the Union Fenosa LNG facility, hammered out and being able to move forward, from that standpoint, Leviathan will be tied to getting its contracts lined out and then the project financing actually pulled together for both of those. I think when you look at actual first production, we've been talking three years to four years from FID, the first production.","There is probably an opportunity that Tamar's project could be probably a little bit quicker than Leviathan, but we'll just have to see how that plays out. The other thing we're keeping a close eye on to and I didn't really mention it on the prepared comments, but just this interruptible volume to Egypt is actually could be the first project to come online at very little cost to us, but significance from the standpoint of establishing an export arrangement between Israel and in neighboring countries. So that's the other one we're keeping an eye on as we're moving over the next few months too.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks. Just a quick follow-up on the Marcellus. I guess one question, clearly that seems like an area, just listening to your partner's remarks as well, that this is a place where we could see Noble just draw down the inventory of DUCs next year and limit capital based on your view of higher returns elsewhere. I guess what would have to happen for you to change that view? Is it a question of, is there a certain \u2013 would $1 higher gas price kind of make that project compete for returns elsewhere? If you could just kind of size \u2013 what's the hurdle rate to get capital back into the Marcellus, I guess is what I'm getting at.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think we're well aligned with our partner to manage within cash flow. So, obviously every Delaware gas price improvement helps the cash flow out in that area and we'll continue to look at it. I think you're right from the standpoint that the plan going into next year at least as we're both looking at it now, is to focus on completion activity and being pretty selective and judicial on how we manage that. And then we'll just have to keep watching the market. As we've talked about this doesn't feel like the gas price to drill into in that market, but we'll just continue to watch how that changes.","We've got tremendous amount of flexibility because the acreage is pretty much all held by production, which was another key advantage of the partnership when we got into that arrangement. So that just gives us a lot of flexibility to manage it and we're well aligned with our partners. So that's a good position to be in going into the year.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bob Brackett with Sanford Bernstein.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I had a question on the Texas assets. It looks like they were producing maybe 66,000 in 1Q. And they're running at 54,000 for 3Q. What's causing that decline? Is that a drop in CapEx or a build in DUCs or something else?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll have, Gary, expand. Bob, I'll tell you, it's right on track with what we've projected when we modeled this for the acquisition. We fully expected that third quarter would be a low quarter, probably the low quarter for the year based on the way we saw activity shaping up. But, Gary, can give you some other color.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah. No, Bob it's tied to completion timing. You might remember that Rosetta's full-year guidance for the assets was 60,000 for the year, they had it coming down through the year as Dave said, 3Q was always indented to be the low point of the year. So I'd say we're right on track with what we've anticipated all along.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But I think what...","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And then...","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But the only thing I was going to add, Bob, what we've seen from the results of what we've focused on so far. I think we're in position and kind of our overall theme just to be able to do more with spending less out there as we're seeing on both the initial wells out of the box on drilling and then some of these initial completions.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah. Efficiencies are definitely trending up better than we had modeled actually, you'll recall that we, few months ago, increased our type curve for the area. Our most recent wells in the Eagle Ford are exceeding even that increased type curve by 3% to 5% at least, so we put a slide out there and has some commentary on a couple other most recent wells, we think the one that's in early stages of flowback right now is probably the best well ever completed on the acreage, that's the result of bringing a lot of their completion design concept that we've refined in the DJ and the Marcellus to the Eagle Ford. So, it's going to be interesting to see what we're able to do here in the next few months, I think.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And you think a rig in each Basin will be enough to hold production flat?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that's where we're going to start off and I think with this drilling efficiencies that we're seeing is fair to model more wells per rig certainly for 2016 than what's been done in the past.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Actually, when you look at what we've laid out there and consistent with starting off with the rig in each of those Basins, we actually expect this volume will continue to grow. We don't see that 15% growth, average growth over the next three years changing from what we've laid out, managing within cash flows, so nothing has changed on that. In fact, we're feeling even better about it.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll next go to Leo Mari, I'm sorry, John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yes, thank you. You mentioned savings that you are getting with things like slickwater. And you talked about improvements in the Eagle Ford, et cetera. What kind of well designs are you using that are different? Are you're dropping intermediate stream casing? Are you doing sliding sleeve? Plug-and-perf? What's kind of different in your approach, if anything?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In the DJ?","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yes. And in the Eagle Ford.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, in the DJ, slickwater has been the biggest driver so far of bringing those costs down. We are doing some mono-bore completions like you've heard from others, which allows you to drop that intermediate string of casing. So we're testing that to ensure that we think that's a viable economic solution going forward, but we are doing some of that. In the Eagle Ford, most of the improvement has come on bringing, again, those same completion techniques from the Marcellus and the DJ.","So reduced stage and cluster spacing in this most recent well that we expect to be the best ever is a reduced stage and cluster spacing well, it's roughly 2,000 pounds of sand per foot, and like I said performing very well. So we are continuing to test a number of things, but we seemed to be on the right track.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Next one for me, on Israel, I know it's early. You're not at FID and all that. But E&C costs have to be coming down. Do you have any kind of sense where things are now versus when you were looking a few years back?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, not yet. What we didn't want to do is get out ahead of ourselves on rebidding cost. So we'll get into that as we move through 2016 and that's when I'll start to have a real sense is to how much. I mean you've got to believe when you look at the number of projects that have been delayed or deferred that the use of this equipment, which is a lot of the high cost piece, lay vessels and so forth, is going to be coming down just based on usage.","We know rig costs are down, way down from what we had, I'm sure, assumed originally, when we put the estimates together seeing \u2013 you can see where the moving pieces ought to apply some downward pressure. But in totality, we won't have some real insight into that probably until mid-year or so.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Thanks, Dave.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","We'll next go to Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Just had a question around the drilled uncompleted inventory. I think in your press release, you guys talked about 50 wells in Texas, 40 wells in the DJ and 80 wells in the Marcellus. I'm assuming that the Marcellus obviously is built up as a result of dropping the rigs here. But just curious if the Texas DUCs and the DJ are more a normal course of business? Are you guys purposely trying to defer some of the completions here because of low price environment? Are there commodity price hurdles that you're hoping to hit before you start fracking these wells in each of the areas?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Leo, this is Gary. I'd say it's more normal course of business. We're not intentionally building up drilled\/uncompleted inventory in any area.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And are there any commodity price hurdles you guys are hoping to see in the Marcellus before you start bringing those wells online?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Well, I think as Dave has mentioned, we're trending towards cash flow neutral for a budget for the Marcellus next year, that's kind of where we're seeing it with our partners. So we're taking that into account. As you know, we've laid down all the drilling rigs. We've had some completion activity towards the end of this year and then we'll have more completion activity next year versus drilling activity. We'll just have to monitor that as we go relative to the price and the impact on cash flow, Leo.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And I guess your costs were extremely low this quarter. You guys cited at a five-year record here. Just looking at your guidance, it looks like you are expecting costs to uptick a little bit in the fourth quarter. Is something sort of going on there? Is it more just a function of being conservative? Can you explain that a little bit?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you've got some mix, you'll have a much larger impact of the Gulf of Mexico, the new production coming in from the Gulf, which is at a little higher operating cost. You've got the Eastern Med dropping off significantly, seasonally as it always does in the fourth quarter, expect it to. And those are probably the two main pieces \u2013 just as two mixes.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Irene Haas with Wunderlich.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Yes. This is really focused on the Appalachia. And it looks like you guys are pulling back on the Marcellus a little, waiting for things to improve. And my question for you is, how do you feel about the Utica? I noticed that you have a well in Marshall County, West Virginia. I was just wondering how much it cost at this stage? And then when do we really kind of need to treat the Utica dry gas as the next Marcellus?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that's a good question, Irene, on the last one. We just don't have that much history and that much Utica acreage to have a strong opinion on it relative to the Marcellus. I'd tell you, we'll start to get some insight from our own operations here as we bring our first Utica well on probably later this year. But then I think the real question on the Utica has been kind of the decline relative to the Marcellus, and as you referenced, the overall cost of projects at the deeper depth.","So, we don't have a big inventory. We've probably got probably 20,000 acres or so of Utica position that we've brought in along with our partners. We've picked up additional acreage out in the Basin, but we're probably in the early stages of us doing that. Gary, may have some other insight from his perspective.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah, when Dave says 20,000 acres, that's the gross, that's in the JV, that we have an interest in, so our net is about half that, about 10,000 acres. We just drilled the one well, so I think it's too early to speculate on what cost would be on a development type scenario, because we've done quite a bit of science on this first well. But we do expect to have it on here in the fourth quarter, and should be able to start talking about it a bit more on the call next year.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","How much did you spend at this first well?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","It's in the $15+ million range on this first well, but like I said, there is quite a bit of science in that one.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Yeah...","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","We'd look to that as a development well scenario.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Rowe with TPH [Tudor, Pickering, Holt].","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Yes, good morning. I just had one question about the DJ Basin. So you mentioned, you're dropping a rig late \u2013 in the latter part of this year, but you're drilling wells more quickly. And your anticipated well count's a bit higher for the year than budgeted. So, can you just provide a little bit more context around kind of how the well count's going to change for the full year? And any changes to the capital budget for that region as well.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah Michael. This is Gary. I think it's \u2013 again it's driven by efficiency. So we've recently dropped to three rigs from four rigs. I don't see our latest guidance on well count changing that much, given the increasing efficiency, we continue to see. I think the last numbers we put out there was about 200 wells plus or minus, actual well count and about 250 wells on an equivalent basis.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think our change to DJ capital occurred first half of the year when we actually shifted some money into the DJ earlier in the year, and that turned out to be a pretty smart move with what we've seen from the impact of the Lucerne-2 plant coming on.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then lastly, just on the Gulf of Mexico wells, these are obviously coming online and adding quite a bit of production cash flow over the next 12 months. Can you just remind us kind of how we should think about the production profile and declines for these wells over the first, call it, 12 months to 24 months?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'd say over the first 12 months, once we get them fully lined out here towards the end of November. So, I think they'll hold pretty flat. I mean there will be some ups and downs, but they'll hold pretty flat through the first 12 months. And then, I'd say decline from after the first year or so, it's probably 20% to 30% range. Now, the nice part about it is that it's not the end of the opportunities in that Rio Grande area, because one of the things we'll be looking at pretty hard over the first year, is the potential based on production performance for another development well at Big Bend and also potential for water injection support going forward. So, lot of things still to look at out there and we'll see how that fully plays out.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Kelly with Seaport Global.","Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Mike.","Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","I was hoping to get a better understanding for Israel in 2016. And I'm interested, if we assume similar weather next year versus 2015, what organic growth could be? One, just no change to \u2013 on the regulatory front. Two, if we do have a comprehensive agreement signed here in the next couple of weeks? Thanks.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","If you're talking about volumes, I think we're going into next year. I think it will be relatively flat. We benefited this year from the fact that we had the compression project that Ashdod fully up and running. And so we were able to take full advantage of that this past quarter. And you can see the nice impact from that. I think the wildcard over there is, if we can get this interruptible supply agreement and actually start physically moving volumes from Israel to Egypt next year. We're not assuming anything for that at this point until it happens. But that could be a significant opportunity.","Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","How quick could that be up and running, Dave?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think physically up and running, I think you can do it in a matter of months. I think it's all a matter of getting the agreements, finalized, getting both governments signed up and onboard. And I know they're both very supportive from all discussions. And then getting all the agreements with the owners of the pipeline in place and gas moving. But as far as physical activity to move gas, it doesn't take much, I don't think.","Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And my follow-up is kind of longer term, if we look at Leviathan and Tamar. And I know there's a lot of moving parts and variables here and it might be way premature to ask this, but if you guys are thinking about this in terms of, on the potential internal NAV of these projects, how should we think about it? How really impactful could these projects be to you? Thanks.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think if you just take a look and you model out the cash flows per year from the types of volumes, when you look at \u2013 for Leviathan, adding over a Bcf a day, we've talked about on average maybe 1.2 Bcf a day or so forth, when it's fully up and running here on the initial phase. When you look at Tamar adding 400 million cubic feet a day to 500 million cubic feet a day and you just model those cash flows out, it starts to give you an impression of how impactful those projects can be.","Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Beard with Coker & Palmer.","David Earl Beard - Coker & Palmer, Inc.","Hi, good morning, everyone.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Dave.","David Earl Beard - Coker & Palmer, Inc.","Two questions for you, a macro and a micro. On the macro front, how closely linked in your mind are changes in commodity prices for changes in CapEx? So that's first. And then second on the micro front, just back up to the DJ and the slickwater fracs, can we think of applying these to the majority of the Wells Ranch wells and even at the longer lateral lengths? And maybe just talk about what's going on at East Pony on slickwater versus Wells Ranch.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me take the first one, and I'll let Gary take the second part of that. But on the CapEx versus commodity price, I mean they are linked from the standpoint of our focus, especially in these lower commodity price world of managing within cash flow. So it's going to be a direct linkage there between what commodity price is and how it impacts our cash flow and therefore what capital we invest. So...","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah. And on the slickwater, how we roll that out, like I said, we're focusing on Wells Ranch and East Pony right now, it seems to be working quite well in those areas, we'll continue to test it in those areas, that's where most of our activity is going to be next year anyway. As far as the long laterals, we're certainly pumping slickwater on long laterals, I would say on the longest laterals, the 9,000 foot type wells, we're still pumping the gelled hybrid in those first few stages in the toe, just because if we have a screen out situation, it's a bit more problematic and costly to get those cleaned out, so we want to make sure we can carry the sand the whole way, but otherwise we're pumping slickwater on the majority of those as well.","David Earl Beard - Coker & Palmer, Inc.","Great.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Whitmarsh. Please go ahead.","Brad Whitmarsh","Thanks, Andrea, and thanks to all of you for joining our third quarter conference call this morning. I hope you've had a chance to review the news release and presentation deck that we published earlier today. These materials are available on the Investors page of our website and they highlight continued strong performance for the business.","Later today, we plan to file our Form 10-Q with the SEC. Want to remind everyone that today's discussion contains projections and forward-looking statements, as well as, certain non-GAAP financial measures. You read our full disclosures and our latest news releases and SEC filings for a discussion of those items. Following our prepared remarks, we'll hold a question-and-answer session and we will wrap up within an hour today. I would ask that analysts limit themselves to one primary and one follow-up.","Our planned comments this morning will come from Dave Stover, Chairman and CEO; as well as Brent Smolik, President and COO, who has lost his voice somewhat. Also joining us is Hodge Walker, SVP of Onshore, and Hodge will talk us through the U.S. portion of our comments. Both Ken Fisher, EVP and CFO, and Keith Elliott, our SVP of Offshore are joining us remotely this morning.","With that, I want to turn the call over to Dave.","Dave Stover","Thanks, Brad, and good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. Our teams have continued to execute very well through 2019. We went into the year, focused on creating more certainty throughout our business and positioning our company for long-term success. This morning, I'll highlight how we've already accomplished many of our key goals and targets for the year. In fact, we're on track to realize $300 million of capital and cost reductions, while generating more operating cash flow and volume than the original 2019 plan.","Whether it is taking the Mustang project in the DJ Basin from 0 to 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day within 18 months or the Leviathan project execution in the Eastern Mediterranean, Noble Energy continues to deliver and lead across the board. The capital efficiency improvements onshore, progress on offshore projects and capturing new exploration opportunities are all substantial, visible contributors to a long-term sustainable future for our company.","Looking at third quarter results, we performed extremely well on all items within our control, including lower capital, lower cash costs and higher production. Capital expenditures for the quarter came in more than 12% below expectation, with reductions in our U.S. onshore well costs and facility capital and lower Leviathan costs. For the full year, we're now estimating to be $200 million below our original 2019 company capital guide. We continue to maintain discipline and are prioritizing these savings to the balance sheet instead of allocating to additional growth.","On the expense side, we again came in below expectation on production costs and we materially reduced our G&A in the third quarter both benefiting from continuous improvement initiatives. For 2019, we've reduced these cash costs by more than $100 million as compared to our original expectations. Also during the third quarter, we launched a debt transaction designed to extend our maturity tower, clearing out near-term maturities through late 2023. In addition, we issued at record low coupon rates for Noble Energy, which will save a few million dollars per year in interest. I was pleased with the execution of the transaction and the bond market's reception of the issuance.","Total company and U.S. onshore volumes for the third quarter came in at the high end of guidance. The U.S. onshore teams delivered a 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day increase over the second quarter of the year, including 10,000 barrels of oil per day. Each onshore business unit reflected material sequential growth. Our original full-year company guidance indicated approximately 10% growth from 2018 to 2019 and we are trending above that number with our performance year-to-date and fourth quarter guidance.","On Slide 4, we've provided a look back at the key deliverables we targeted as we entered the year. The number of check marks here reflects the tremendous execution of our teams and delivery across the portfolio. In addition to the onshore capital efficiencies and major project development successes, I also want to highlight the dividend raise earlier this year, the recent success at Aseng with a new development well, execution of the Columbia exploration agreement and the submission of another comprehensive drilling plan in Colorado. I'm also proud of the effort to produce the company's initial climate resilience report that's available on our website.","Just yesterday, we announced the extremely significant milestone of closing of the EMG Pipeline acquisition, which opens a key pathway for natural gas deliveries from Israel into Egypt. Keith is in Israel, as we speak, ensuring the final steps of the Leviathan project completion and field start-up. Leviathan's first gas sales is fast approaching with initial deliveries now expected in December. In addition to an early start-up, we've lowered the gross capital expenditure estimate to $3.6 billion, $150 million decrease from the original budget. It's extremely exciting and remarkable to be involved with the project that will have such a historic impact to a country and a region.","There is a tremendous amount of effort remaining to bring the project to completion and we remain highly focused on delivering a successful and safe start-up at Leviathan. I want to thank all the Noble project teams, our partners, vendors and key regulators who have all worked so hard to bring this transformational project to reality. One other important catalyst for us as we close out 2019 is reaching conclusion on the midstream strategic review. We've worked through multiple alternatives and are on track to complete the review by the end of the year. Our focus has remained on the best long-term value creation for Noble shareholders and NBLX unitholders. I'm confident that we are reaching the best outcome for all.","Let me now hand it over to Brent to update you on our operational performance and then I will come back with some closing comments before opening for questions.","Brent Smolik","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. And I apologize, little scratchy this morning, so I'll try to get through this here. As Dave mentioned, we had a tremendous success so far in 2019 and we\u2019re undergoing substantial transformation as we move into next year with significantly lower capital, increasing cash flow and increase in production volumes. Our rate of change is largely due to Leviathan. And if you look at our Israeli assets, they're high quality reservoirs with reliable production, which reduces volatility in our cash flows. In fact, we recently surpassed 2 Tcf of production from Tamar with over 99% runtime since inception in 2013. The Leviathan project remains ahead of cost and schedule, once again demonstrating the skill of our major projects team.","During the third quarter, the production decks were successfully installed, including a world record offshore crane lift at 15,300 metric tons. We're now in the final commissioning phase of the production facilities. As Dave mentioned, we estimate cumulative gross savings of about $150 million versus the project sanction, which is truly remarkable for a multi-year project of the scale and a credit to our teams and the 2,200 people that have worked on the project around the world. We're nearing the finish line and we're looking forward to first production next month.","In Q3, we had announced the amendment of the Dolphinus gas sales agreements in Egypt from Tamar and Leviathan. The original firm contracts of 1.15 Tcf over 10 years have been expanded to 3 Tcf over 15 years, reflecting the long-term demand in the region. Initial firm volumes under the Dolphinus agreements begin at 200 million cubic feet per day, step up to 450 in mid 2020 and increase to 650 in mid-2022 and the rest of the 15-year term. These gas export contracts to Egypt and Jordan represent a new era of exports for Israel and a new chapter of regional cooperation and our Noble team is excited to take part in that transition.","Post Leviathan, Noble is moving from a single asset supplying Israel domestic customers to multiple assets supplying over 45 gas sales contracts to customers in three countries. As demand in the region evolves and our Leviathan production capacity expands, we naturally expect a greater range of sales volumes. We currently estimate combined Tamar and Leviathan sales to average between 1.6 Bcf per day and 1.8 Bcf per day gross for full year 2020 and we expect the first half of the year to range from 1.4 Bcf per day to 1.6 Bcf per day with growth in the second half of the year to 1.8 Bcf per day to 2 Bcf per day.","We had a really important inflection point for Noble Energy and it's made possible by bringing on the largest project in our history and one of the largest ever infrastructure projects in Israel. In West Africa, Aseng 6P development well was drilled and completed under budget this quarter. First production commenced in October and the well is performing as expected. Over the well's life, we expect to recover approximately 10 million barrels of oil, which will add to about 100 million barrel milestone that we recently surpassed at the Aseng field.","At Alen, we continue to focus on base decline in reservoir management, which has resulted in lower production decline in the field. The Alen gas monetization project is progressing well. Construction materials are expected to arrive in the first quarter of next year and we're still targeting start up in the first half of 2021. As a reminder, this is a unique capital efficient project that will utilize existing production wells and facilities and the LNG infrastructure on Bioko Island. We're very excited about the cash flow profile of this project and its ability to grow without additional CapEx as Alen gas backfills are growing LNG plant availability.","I'd ask now Hodge to take us through the U.S. onshore update, if you would, Hodge.","Hodge Walker","Thanks, Brent. Good morning, everyone. In the U.S. onshore business, we achieved further capital efficiency improvements and substantial production growth in the quarter. Production volumes were up 11% sequentially with capital down over $70 million. Our well costs have continued to improve as a result of shorter cycle times and better execution. For example in the DJ, we set a world record of over 10,300 feet drilled in a 24-hour period and in the Delaware, we drilled 9,300 foot lateral in under 12.8 days. These new records are setting the drilling benchmarks in each area. There are also fundamental in our continuous improvement culture. If we can do it on a single well, then we can improve the average well.","I'm pleased to report, as we've improved execution efficiencies, we've also improved our personal and process safety performance. This reflects a strong safety culture of our organization and demonstrates that efficient operations are usually safe operations. On discussing the U.S. onshore operations, I want to point out that our midstream business also had an excellent quarter of execution. They delivered record gathering volumes and capital efficiency gains in both the DJ and Delaware Basins. And we'll look for opportunities to collaborate on ways to make both businesses more efficient.","Slide 11 includes a little more color on the U.S. upstream results by BU. The DJ Basin continued to deliver significant growth, setting record production volumes, while generating free cash flow. Total volumes of 158,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day were higher than our expectations and up 25% from third quarter of last year. During the quarter, we drilled 38 wells, 15 in Mustang Row 2 and the remainder in Wells Ranch. Our Mustang Row development produced over 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net to Noble.","We've also deployed our first electric line power drilling rig in Mustang, which reduces noise and emissions and reduces capital, due to less diesel fuel in use . We've also moved to electric powered compressors and tankless production facilities. All these changes enhanced environmental stewardship, while continuing to improve safe and efficient operations. In the fourth quarter, we expect to TIL approximately 20 wells in the DJ Basin, primarily focused in Wells Ranch in the East Pony areas. Looking further ahead, we're pursuing a second CDP in North Wells Ranch. The application consists of about 38,000 acres in the oilier part of the basin and the new CDP will ultimately add up to 250 additional drilling permits.","In the Delaware, we had another quarterly record of 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The Delaware production benefited from shorter cycle time and productivity improvements during the year. In the first half of 2018, 24-hour test rates on our new wells averaged approximately 190 barrels of oil equivalent per 1,000 foot of lateral. During the third quarter, new wells averaged over 220 barrels of oil equivalent per 1,000 foot. In addition, we have several wells in the southern portion of our acreage, which started up early in the fourth quarter with encouraging early time production. In the fourth quarter, activity in Delaware will be lower with 10 TILs planned.","Wrapping up the U.S. onshore, in the Eagle Ford, we brought on 16 DUCs late in the second quarter, which contributed to the significant third quarter jump in production. We also partially offset some unplanned downtime at one of our large production facilities, which required production to be shut-in and a portion of the field during most of September and October. We've made the necessary repairs and oil production is coming back online. However, the third and fourth quarters will be impacted by about 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and about 1,000 barrels of oil per day.","With that, I'll hand it back to Brent.","Brent Smolik","Thanks, Hodge. So, clearly, capital and operating cost improvements have been a big focus for us in the onshore U.S. business. Our results are summarized on Slide 14. In addition to the drilling gains, as Hodge mentioned earlier, completion cycle times have also continued to improve, average well cost in both the DJ and Delaware Basins are down, an incremental $500,000 from mid-year of this year. In total, we're down almost $2 million per well from the end of last year in each basin, which is a remarkable accomplishment. It's a significant driver of the reduced capital guidance for 2019. In the current environment, I feel really good that we can maintain these cost reductions heading into 2020.","Lease operating expenses have also been front center for our production ops teams. The DJ Basin is down 15% per BOE from the fourth quarter of 2018 with improvements in compression optimization and chemical costs leading the way. Delaware Basins decrease unit LOE by over 30%. Costs are lower in almost every expense category including lower workover costs. So, going forward, we expect our recently installed electric power facilities to further reduce fuel and rental generation cost, while at the same time increasing the reliability of our production.","So overall, I'm very pleased with the year-to-date execution on capital expenses and our volumes in both the U.S. onshore and offshore. In total, we've successfully reduced our capital expenditures by over $200 million and by reducing cycle time we've benefited from lower capital and an accelerated TIL schedule and higher volumes in the first three quarter. Since we've chosen to not redeploy the capital savings into further growth, we expect 4Q volumes, onshore volumes to be down some from the third quarter and TILs will be down in the second half of the year versus the first half.","Eagle Ford is anticipated to be down meaningfully, because we haven't had a new activity there since the first half of the year. The Delaware will be down \u2013 down flat to slightly down and the DJ will grow slightly in Q4. On the international front, West Africa gas sales should be lower than Q3 and Israel could be down slightly due to normal seasonality that we see in Israel. I wanted to point out that we've not included any of Leviathan volumes in our guidance for the fourth quarter. However, we expect to have some sales of meaningful amounts of commissioning gas in the month of December.","Before I hand it back to Dave, I just want to summarize some of the things that really excited me and I think are competitive advantages for Noble as we move into 2020. First, our continuous improvement culture is delivering the sustainable reductions in capital per well, significantly reducing our annual maintenance capital needs. Second, we've improved our execution in the U.S. onshore business with Row developments and we're now positioned to deliver free cash flow in 2020. Third, our Leviathan project readiness and long-term availability. So we sanctioned that project just 2.5 years ago and it's literally changing the future of our company. And fourth, we're commencing the next major project at Alen in EG. These major projects are important sources of long-term stable cash flows and are significant growth and value drivers for the company.","Brad Whitmarsh","Thanks Brent then Hodge both of you for the good wrap up on the operations. As you've heard from us this morning, critical to our differentiated outlook is our diversified portfolio, providing both high return and high margin unconventional opportunities, as well as, long life, low cost conventional major projects. This combination enhances capital allocation optionality and reduces long-term volatility.","Slide 15 is a slide that you've seen in our presentation, disclosures from earlier this year, highlighting one specific benefit and competitive advantage from our portfolio. You can see in the bar is the rate of change in our corporate decline profile, as Leviathan comes on production. From mid 30% range this year to low 20% range next year, this lower corporate decline benefits us by reducing annual maintenance capital needs.","Leviathan also creates a noticable net cash flow swing from 2019 to 2020, as capital investments roll-off and we generate substantial cash flow in 2020. Benefits of the diversified portfolio become even clearer when you consider the significant growth potential as Leviathan production expands to the installed capacity and Alen gas comes online. The growth in offshore provides us great flexibility in making the right capital allocation decisions in the U.S. onshore business, while prioritizing returns and free cash flow generation.","As we move into this transformational 2020, we continue to face a volatile commodity environment. We are evaluating various capital scenarios for next year and we remain focused on generating organic free cash flow, improving corporate returns, protecting the balance sheet and returning capital to investors. In all potential scenarios, we remain laser focused on an organic free cash flow target of at least $500 million. I expect our 2020 outlook will reflect continued capital efficiency improvement.","As we wrap up 2019, I want to come back to three key factors where Noble Energy is distinguishing itself. The positive rate of change heading into 2020 from significantly decreasing capital is the first and increasing cash flow and volume; second, the move to an even lower annual corporate decline rate and lower maintenance capital; and third, a global inventory that include substantial low cost discovered resources that can utilize existing infrastructure to generate significant returns. Our accomplishments through 2019 are setting the stage for a significant transformation of the company as we head into 2020, providing a platform for long-term sustainable free cash flow for our investors.","Thank you for the time this morning and we'll now open for questions. Andrea?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram","Dave, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on your thoughts on the U.S. onshore business next year. I know you plan to prioritize free cash flow generation. You do have Leviathan coming along, but given some of the improvements you've seen in terms of capital efficiency. Do you plan to have a program, if oil was in the mid 50s that could, keep call it, U.S. onshore oil growth flat with the second half levels? Or are you thinking more on a year-over-year basis?","Dave Stover","Well, yes, I think, Arun, it's one of the things that we're reviewing right now as we lay out our plans and look at scenarios for next year. I think that you highlight a couple of key things. One is that the focus, the primary focus is on making sure that we set ourselves up to support and generate that $500 million plus of free cash flow for next year. So, that's kind of first and foremost. In the current price environment, there has been a little softer commodity price on NGLs and gas. But as you highlighted the efficiencies that we've seen help offset a lot of that. So, I think when you get down to it, the thing that we'll continue to ask ourselves is with this double-digit growth rate that Leviathan, not just Leviathan but the Eastern Med business provides for next year? What is the right amount of growth to drive in the onshore business from the US?","I think to your point, whatever capital allocation we end up with the oil growth will be higher in our onshore US than our base onshore growth. Just when you think about it from the way we're allocating capital in the onshore US to the DJ and Delaware, and the Eagle Ford will be declining off. So, our onshore oil growth rate will be higher than our overall onshore growth rate on a year-on-year basis. But we'll finalize that as we determine what's the right amount of capital to spend in the onshore business and how much growth do we want to drive overall in our onshore business next year. So, I guess, long way of saying, we're looking at some different sensitivities there. Primary focus again is on making sure that we support and sustain that free cash flow growth that we've kind of highlighted and promised to investors.","Brent Smolik","And as Dave said that really well, Arun. But just to add some emphasis on all of the U.S. onshore scenarios that we've been looking at grow year-over-year.","Arun Jayaram","That's helpful, Brent. Brent, I was wondering if you can maybe also talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of well productivity in the Delaware Basin. I also \u2013 in particular, I was hoping you could elaborate on what you're seeing in the southern portion of your acreage position in Reeves County?","Brent Smolik","Yes. So, I think the way I'd summarize the Delaware high level, Arun, is that we've made significant improvements on the execution side and I'm really proud of the cost and efficiency gains on both the CapEx and the OpEx side. The work that we still have to do is optimizing the completions. Hodge pointed out in the prepared comments that we're improving as we go through the year, but I don't think we're done yet. I think we still got work to go. We definitely have some \u2013 there's an area we call [indiscernible] you're down to \u2013 in the southern part that you referenced that we like the early results of, but I don't think Hodge those are even released yet on the 24-hour test. So, I think we're in that phase or that stage where we're continuing to optimize the completions and get them \u2013 make them even better.","Arun Jayaram","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","Dave Stover","Hey, Brian.","Brian Singer","I wanted to follow-up on Arun's question with regards to the 2020 outlook and your response there. Should we view 2020 onshore growth as below what you would regard as a sustainable growth rate because you're essentially choosing to slow it \u2013 potentially choosing to slow it given the greater growth temporarily coming as a result of Leviathan? Or are you kind of looking more at trying to create more ratable sustainable growth as you go into 2020, again assuming oil prices are mid-50s or whatever you would regard as reasonable?","Dave Stover","Yes. Well, I think it starts with what we've said previously is that we want to make sure our onshore business is supporting itself with its own cash flow and so we'll set it up accordingly. I think as we've talked about, we're going to be looking at some different scenarios there on the onshore business. I would expect and we've seen this over the last few years too, as you look at how you shape at the onshore business in 2020, the shape will be somewhat similar to the shape this year where its first half will be a little lower than the second half, just based on activity levels in any scenario we lay out there.","Brent Smolik","Yes. The other thing I'd say, Brian, is if you go back to what we rolled out in February for the long-term, the way we're thinking about the business and the five-year capital plan. We're right on that plan. And remember what we said at the time was that we had some flexibility and growth rates in the U.S. because we have discretion in that program and we have years like 2021 Leviathan is coming on where U.S. doesn't need to grow as much. So, I think we're right on top of that plan.","Dave Stover","And the other thing to add and that's a good point from Brent is that our 2020 and I made this in my prepared comments, but our 2020 outlook will reflect in improved capital efficiency as you're looking at year-on-year. You go from 2018 to 2019; we saw an improvement 2019 to 2020 is going to be a significant improvement. One, you've got the impact of Leviathan, obviously but second, I can't overstate the importance of the efficiency improvements that have been now embedded in the business that Brent, Hodge and the teams have done that will roll forward into 2020. So, I think whenever we finally rollout our 2020 outlook, I think everybody will be very pleased with the capital efficiency outlook that gets rolled out.","Brian Singer","That's great, thanks. And then my follow-up is that you made a reference to exploratory activities. And I just wondered if you can give us an update on key areas of focus and timing?","Dave Stover","Yes. Exploration is obviously has been a capability that we've maintained. I think it's going to become even more important going forward. As you look at the importance of the conventional assets. I think you're seeing a resurgence in the recognition of some of the importance of these conventional assets. Obviously for us to bring some big major projects on like a Leviathan, like a Alen and the expansion of Eastern Med I like that. But all of those came from exploration successes. So, we're going to be anxious to get back to some exploration drilling next year. Again this is starting out at a modest level, but probably the first key well will be the well in Colombia, next year. It will probably start at about mid-year, the second half of the year, but we'll have results on that next year and we're really looking forward to being able to test that, very high quality project down there.","Brian Singer","Great, thank you.","Brent Smolik","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Doug, your line is open on our end. Are you muted?","Doug Leggate","Hi, sorry guys, I was on mute \u2013 no, I'm here. I'm here, I had mute on, I'm so sorry.","Dave Stover","It\u2019s okay. If you're on mute...","Doug Leggate","Well, I guess, you can hear me now. Yes, it's been one of those weeks. I'm sorry, fellows. So, I've got two questions. I'm afraid, I'd like to hark on \u2013 I was talking to myself, there for a minute. So, I'll repeat myself. I'd like to hark on a little bit, but this onshore story, a little bit and ask the question a little differently. The efficiency gains that you have secured and outperformed, I would say, relative to, I think what the Street was expecting. What would the minimum level of activity on the onshore required to be in order to make sure you don't lose \u2013 you don't give any of those up? And I'm thinking everything you've talked about 5%, sub $2 billion CapEx. Is that, I know you want to be specific, but am I in the ballpark?","Brent Smolik","Say again, the number.","Doug Leggate","5%, sub $2 billion capital.","Dave Stover","Yes, you're talking on company level as far as total capital.","Doug Leggate","No, just on onshore \u2013 onshore oil sub 5% growth. But total company capital sub $2 billion. That's kind of, I'm just trying to get a handle as to you don't \u2013 you're already one of the most competitive growth stories in the sector with Leviathan. You don't need to go to Lower 48. So, I'm just trying to understand what the minimum would be to retain those efficiencies?","Dave Stover","Yes, I think let's talk about it from an activity standpoint. This year we were at relatively low activities, we had two rigs running most of the year in the DJ and we're able to drive these efficiencies. But we've been able to reduce the frac crews to less than two on average because they're getting faster. I think we'll be able to hang on to all those operational efficiencies. And then some of this year's capital was Eagle Ford, remember though it was just completing DUCs and that's going to fall off next year because we don't have any DUC inventory in Eagle Ford. So, we'd really be back to speed down to the Delaware and so focusing in those two basins, I think we'll have enough activity in each area that we'll be able to hang on to all the operational efficiencies.","And then it just leaves \u2013 and remember that we didn't get all those operational efficiencies on day one in January. We've been acquiring \u2013 accumulating them over the year and I think we'll have a full year benefit of those cycle time reduction kind of efficiencies next year. Then on top of that, if you look at inflation, it feels like we're in a good place right now with relatively low fourth quarter activities that started even back in the third quarter. So, we're feeling pretty good that we can hang on to all of the efficiencies for the full-year of next year, at levels kind of near this year or even a little below.","Hodge Walker","Doug, you bring up a good point to emphasize that, which is the significant rate of change story for us going from 2019 into 2020 and what we laid out earlier this year and what Brent highlighted is the consistency and actually the improvement in that story that we've now created through the visibility of that through what we've done this year. I mean, if you think back to the two key elements that we've laid out going forward. One was delivering that organic free cash flow, which I think is underpinned with more certainty even now with the efficiency improvements that we've seen and the cost management that the organization's delivered through a wide spectrum of commodity price environments, if you will.","And secondly, that rate of change is driven by our year-on-year significant decrease in capital that we've talked about previously, and significant increase in volume and both of those elements are going to be still realized. So, we're pretty excited about where we are right now and I share your enthusiasm.","Doug Leggate","[Indiscernible] sorry for joining.","Brent Smolik","I think you're $2 billion reference, if you go back to the five-year framework, on average we said we'd expect to spend $2 billion to $2.2 billion a year and you kind of laid out how we thought about \u2013 thought about allocating that capital. I think for 2020 we're comfortable we're going to be below the low end of that range.","Dave Stover","And I think you'll see when we roll stuff out for the full picture is that our maintenance capital is coming down. I mean, there is no doubt.","Doug Leggate","That was what I was trying to get to guys sub $2 billion. Thank you for that.","And my follow-up, hopefully is a quicker one. I have to say I disagree slightly with one of my colleague's comments about the temporary growth in Leviathan because to me it can set you up for a multi-year growth phase beyond the start-up. But can you \u2013 I just wonder if \u2013 I wonder if you could just walk us through any visibility you have on incremental expansion, not capital expansion, but sort of free growth if you like with our additional spending over the next couple of years and I'll leave it there?","Dave Stover","Yes, I think the point you're alluding to is that Leviathan our Eastern Med volumes over the next year or two can expand without capital, given the infrastructure and capacity will have in place. And you start to see just the way we've kind of laid out, first half to second half of the year how we're kind of growing into some of that capacity. We haven't filled it up by the second half of the year. But as you move into 2021, 2022 and you start to fill that up, you have inherent growth that essentially no capital, which creates an ongoing capital efficiency improvement story, if you will.","I think the other thing that's key there is we'll start to learn more about this as we start to get a few months of production on with Leviathan, then as we have a chance to come back in February we'll have gained a good bit of knowledge just from commissioning sales and starting to see actual product moving both in country and exports. So, we'll be able to continue to update as we go. But it's setting itself up for a \u2013 just a fantastic story, which is why it's so significant this milestone. Not only the ability now to make sure we're going into Jordan and Egypt and have exports, but now with Leviathan online and visible in the next month or so. Then you're setting the stage for a growing market in Israel also.","Doug Leggate","I would just say, Dave, if you build it, they will come. So I am very grateful for taking my questions. Thanks so much.","Dave Stover","Thanks, Doug.","Brent Smolik","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jeanine Wai of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jeanine Wai","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Dave Stover","Hi, Jeanine.","Jeanine Wai","Just trying to follow-up on a couple of the prior questions. So, you indicated that all of your 2020 scenarios involve the U.S. growing year-over-year. But I think that might have been specifically in regards to 2020? And so, I guess, when we're thinking long-term given upside opportunities elsewhere in the portfolio. And there's been a lot of talk about upside in Eastern Med so far. Are you thinking about the U.S. onshore long-term as more of a growth asset or more of a free cash flow assets?","Dave Stover","I think it will be \u2013 it will be transitioning into both here over the next year or so. That's the part about setting it up, so that it can live within its own cash flow and actually start to generate cash flow and as it continues to grow and it will continue to grow in any plan and scenario that we're looking at. It will be able to do both over time. So, the nice part is as we've laid out the program, when we talked about earlier this year, modest growth setting ourselves up as a company, but sustainable organic free cash flow delivery. It will be supplemented at a time with major projects coming on, which will give you a high growth years like we're seeing in 2020 at times, but underpinning all that you have growth in both parts of the business. You have growth in the offshore and you have growth in the onshore.","Jeanine Wai","Okay, great, that's very helpful. And then, let's see switching here to the Eastern Med. On Slide 8 of your presentation, can you talk about any changes in volume expectations across Tamar and Leviathan that went into your updated gross volume forecast? They're a little bit different than what we had expected?","Dave Stover","Well, I think what we're representing, and I mentioned it earlier that we're still early in this. You got a lot more customers, so you're bringing in a lot more new information, if you will. So, we're going to start out with our best understanding at this point, as we get a few months into this and get some real production and see where it's going, and who has taken what, we'll be able to highlight a little better how it's split between pieces. But I think obviously, first half of the year Tamar has the larger portion of the volume and you would expect that because it coincides with what we laid out in the Dolphinus amended agreement too, how it ramps up from first to second half of the year. And then the second half of the year Leviathan starts to catch up some.","Jeanine Wai","Okay, great, very helpful, thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Todd of Simmons Energy. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd","Thanks. Maybe a couple of kind of specific ones, I mean, on your \u2013 the amount that you've been able to drive down costs this year, not just on the well side, but on the operating side as well. I'm thinking like your unit lifting costs and even G&A. Do you expect to be able to carry all that momentum into 2020 and how would you think about unit cost to trend next year given the material uplift in volumes from the low cost Leviathan project?","Brent Smolik","Yes, I think we should expect it to trend. Again in the right direction because we didn't realize all those LOE savings on day one this year. We've been working our way through those changes and then we'll have increasing \u2013 flat to increasing volumes, as we've been talking about. So, that \u2013 in the U.S. onshore, so that will help with the unit cost story. And then, G&A is the same thing. The G&A savings we've had are relatively recent. So, we'll get a full-year benefit next year. So I think we're going to \u2013 I think we're going to we're going to continue to trend well on op costs.","Dave Stover","Well and then think about it, you got that large volume in the Eastern Med at a very low operating costs, so brings your weighted average down and really sets you up nicely.","Ryan Todd","That's great, thanks. And then maybe in the DJ Basin, there was obviously there was a greater mix at Wells Ranch and East Pony wells relative to Mustang in second half. But as we look into next year and I think you said the next Mustang well to come out maybe in 2Q, But on an overall idea as we think about 2020, what sort of mix should we expect in the development phase of between kind of Wells Ranch, East Pony and Mustang. Any thoughts there?","Brent Smolik","Yes, we're not all the way there yet, on our final plans. So, Hodge, I mean, at a high level it will be similar to this year, right. I mean, most of the scenarios we're going to \u2013 we could pick up a little more of the oily portions of the basin in 2020 versus 2019.","Dave Stover","Yes, going into 2020, I think you would expect that we're going to start that year going back into Row development within Mustang. And as we move through the year, I think from an operational standpoint, a little bit less East Pony next year than this year. But overall, it will be between Mustang and Wells Ranch.","Hodge Walker","And the Row you're moving into in Mustang is a little oilier Row than you were in this year.","Dave Stover","It will be a sister to our Row and we'll be moving to across.","Ryan Todd","Great. I appreciate the color, guys.","Brent Smolik","That is high level though. So we get everything finalized.","Ryan Todd","Of course, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","Michael Hall","Thanks. Just kind of wanted to I guess come back on the capital efficiency side of things as you kind of look out to 2020, given the well costs that we had in the third quarter. I understand, we took down capital $200 million this year, but that's kind of a weighted average through the course of the year. If you were to annualize the current well costs, what sort of savings would that have represented for 2019 if you have that. And then how should we think about PDP declines in the U.S. only business in 2020?","Brent Smolik","The cost for \u2013 to the cost first, that's let me think about answering the question. So, we got quite a bit of the savings early. So I'd probably would say we were within $1 million fairly quickly in the year on average per well and then by the end of the year we're at $2 million in the fourth quarter. So, thinking of an annual trend $1 million early, $2 million late, $1.5 million kind of average. I think the numbers will go around.","We did get a few more wells, you know, so that's clear, we'll get a few more wells done in the DJ than we originally had budgeted for less capital. So, some of that's being utilized. But I think that's a reasonable way to think about it. Base declines, I don't have in front of us Hodge. So, the total company that we've been talking about is probably the best place to start. But I don't have the basin by basin ones in front of me. In total company's probably in the low-30s and then after Leviathan comes on, we're going to be in the low-20s.","Michael Hall","Okay. Yes, I can follow-up on that. Yes. That's helpful though. And yes, I guess following up on the last question, what sort of LOE should we use in the Eastern Med, just want to make sure we're thinking about that right going forward?","Dave Stover","I think it's probably going to be pretty similar to Tamar LOE.","Michael Hall","Okay.","Brent Smolik","A little higher starting up.","Dave Stover","Yes, start-up maybe a little bit higher, but as we get it lined out, especially as you get into the second half of the year. I would expect it to be fairly close.","Michael Hall","Great, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold","Thanks guys. Hey, quickly on the Permian Basin, with this big slug of wells that you all put on in 3Q in the Row development. Is there anything that you learned in that process that surprised you to the positive and negative? And could you also give us some sense of, it looks like the oil cut is around 61%, it's dropped, I guess, over the last several quarters. Is that because of better gas capture or is that just the trend we should continue to expect to see?","Brent Smolik","Yes to the second part, I think better capture. We did drill one pad that was further East that we talked about in the last quarter that was \u2013 we knew would be gas here, but we haven't been surprised on GOR across the field. Those forecast have held up pretty well. So, some of its we're right regionally, but I think we're on top of that, okay.","The other part on Row development is clearly the benefits that we've seen from the efficiencies and they show up in both the midstream company and the upstream company by being able to develop them in that fashion. We're driving down cost on D&C and facilities both companies and so, I don't think it was surprised but it was a pleasant surprise how big it was. I think on LOE, we had a factor because obviously everything is right there in the close proximity. So, we get a benefit on the LOE side on how we operate the fields. So, I think all of that stuff is as good as we expected or better.","On the completion side, as I mentioned, we're still optimizing. We may use less 100 mesh for example, and we may use and we may change some of the stage pacing, but that's normal optimization, I would say.","Scott Hanold","Okay, got it. And a quick follow-up on the Eagle Ford and I know that you guys are going to have details on 2020. But, I guess, am I reading into your comments that the Eagle Ford may not get a lot of capital allocation next year? And where does that strategically fall in terms of like do you guys need to have that asset?","Brent Smolik","The benefit strategically is I think there was a question earlier about onshore strategy and Dave answered and in total for onshore, within that strategy though we've got three assets. Eagle Ford will be more cash flow contributor with less growth expectations from it. The DJ Basin is already free cash flow positive for all of 2019 and then Permian is moving into that phase. So, I think it has a fit in the strategy in that regard because it's a cash flow contributor.","Scott Hanold","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Leo Mariani of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Leo Mariani","Hey guys, I was hoping you could just clarify a little bit on the $500 million of free cash flow. Just wanted to make sure that that's a pre-dividend number in 2020, and I was hoping you could talk to the uses of that free cash flow in terms of priorities? Is the priority to pay down debt? Is it to get the buyback program going again or increase the dividend? How do you think about those three pieces?","Brent Smolik","Right. I think on Slide 16, we touched on some of that, Leo. But, yes, it\u2019s consistent with the way we've been talking about it, it's before dividend. And again, the discussion has been around generating at least $500 million free cash flow whatever commodity price environment we're in or supplying that. The \u2013 no change in how we thought about uses of that free cash flow. We've always talked about dividend growth with cash flow growth. We've talked about continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and then be an opportunistic on share buybacks. So, I think those three pieces are all part of that balance.","Leo Mariani","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess, just you one slide, where you talked about the Israeli gas price for 2020. I think it was $5.25, just kind of looking at this past quarter, in third quarter I think it was about $5.55. Just wanted to get a sense there. Is that just really reflecting the fact that your Leviathan volumes are going to be closer to $5 next year where your Tamar is going to be closer to that by $5.50, just trying to make sure I kind of understood how that price changes in 2020?","Dave Stover","Well, you've got a mix, now you're blending a lot more contracts, I think what we talked about over 45 contracts, they get blended into there. And the other thing, when you think about on a lot of new contracts, they're tied to Brent. Some of the old ones weren't, they had some different ties, if you will, and what we're assuming the Brent price of I think around $60. So, those obviously have room to move at higher oil price.","Leo Mariani","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Welles Fitzpatrick of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Welles Fitzpatrick","Hey, good morning.","Dave Stover","Good morning, Welles.","Welles Fitzpatrick","On the north Wells Ranch CDP, a; is it fair to say that the Roadrunner, which I think is an [indiscernible] gave you confidence in the area to pursue that? And what are your thoughts on the Codell up there. I know you have some \u2013 some older wells from 13?","Hodge Walker","Hi, Welles. This is Hodge. I think to your point on did the Roadrunner gave us confidence. The Roadrunner was one of the appraisal wells we did up there. Taking into consideration the other wells in the area, our experience down in Wells Ranch putting all that together is what's giving us confidence on that CDP and moving that CDP forward.","Welles Fitzpatrick","Okay, fair enough. And do you think that you guys could have a development rig up there in 2020 or was that probably one with the CDP process?","Hodge Walker","Possibly 2020, we are moving through the process right now and expectations are that \u2013 that will be occurring here. That process is ongoing and we should be moving through that probably in the first half of 2020.","Welles Fitzpatrick","Okay, perfect. That's all I had.

We've also posted a few supplemental slides on our website and later today, we anticipate filing our 10-Q with the SEC.","Following our prepared comments, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would ask that the analysts limit themselves to one primary and one follow-up. Dave Stover, Chairman and CEO; and Gary Willingham, EVP of Operations will provide some commentary, while Ken Fisher, EVP and CFO; and Keith Elliot, SVP of our Eastern Med Assets will join for Q&A.","I want to remind everyone that this event may contain projections and forward-looking statements as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those items. Before highlighting our performance for the third quarter, I want to ensure you all saw the announcement that Noble Energy will be hosting an additional webcast in just two weeks, on November 16, at 9 o'clock AM Central Time. Our team is looking forward to providing a long-term outlook. Focusing on the company's U.S. onshore operations, so you'll understand today if we save our plans for 2017 and beyond.","Now, let's get to the numbers. Total volumes for the quarter were 425,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 12% in absolute and 8% pro forma over the third quarter of last year. Versus our internal expectations, total volumes were 15,000 barrels equivalent per day above the midpoint of our range.","By business unit, this was the result of higher-than-expected volumes in the DJ Basin, Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. Our hydrocarbon, oil was a significant outperformer comprising nearly 60% of the higher number. NGLs were also higher and natural gas volumes reflected a record quarter from Tamar in Israel.","We want to highlight that across the board nearly every unit cost item came in under expectations as well. This was the result of higher-than-forecasted production and continued capital efficiency and cost control. The higher volumes and lower costs contributed to a meaningful earnings and cash flow beat for the quarter. Financial liquidity at the end of the third quarter grew to nearly $6 billion, including $1.8 billion in cash.","During the quarter, we received approximately $300 million following the very successful Noble Midstream IPO. As Noble Energy is the general partner, Noble Midstream's results are fully consolidated into Noble's financials. You probably noticed some specific adjustments in our earnings release tables to reflect the new public entity both on the income statement and the balance sheet where we have identified the portion attributable to the non-controlling interest. Dave will talk more about the success of NBLX, and how it positions us with competitive advantages for the future.","With that, I'll turn the call to Dave.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. After being unable to engage with you for the last couple of months due to the timing of our Midstream IPO, I've been looking forward to this opportunity to share what Noble has accomplished. And we've accomplished a lot.","As you look at our operating and financial numbers, they are up where we want them to be up and down where we want them to be down. Last quarter, I commented that Noble Energy was executing at the highest levels I've seen in my time with the company. Results from the most recent quarter solidify that view even further.","Taking a look at slide 3, we've delivered tremendous results everywhere. Volumes, product mix, cost control and cash generation. We're delivering everything we set out to accomplish in 2016 and more, much more. Yet the numbers are only a part of the story, we've also recently accomplished some big things that are strategically significant to our future.","These include: the highly successful launch of the Noble Midstream IPO; the separation of the Marcellus JV to provide both companies independent control of their future development; the signing of Leviathan's first sizeable sales export contract; a significant debt reduction that help support our long-term growth plans; and an acceleration of our onshore development program. All of this was accomplished while delivering top quartile debt adjusted production and cash flow growth in 2016.","Looking beyond 2016, we will provide a view into our future at the November 16 investor event. The combination of our exceptional portfolio, leading operational execution and financial strength and flexibility provide significant competitive advantages, differentiates our future, our growth potential and our value.","This morning, I'd like to spend a few moments on a number of the recent major accomplishments mentioned. Steps along the path in delivering our future; steps that are enhancing our ability to accelerate our growth; and steps that are generating industry-leading returns.","Starting with operational execution, the momentum we've generated in every area of the business continues to deliver outstanding results. We highlighted in last night's release a number of new wells in the DJ Basin, Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin. Our teams continue to push the leading edge of enhanced completions across our onshore business, and we remain encouraged by the productivity and capital efficiency improvements.","We've recently added two rigs to our U.S. drilling programs, bringing our total onshore rig count to six, two in the DJ, two in the Eagle Ford, and two in the Delaware. Based upon our current view of pricing, we're positioned for additional activity increases in 2017. In the Eastern Mediterranean, third quarter volumes were outstanding. They reflect the high seasonal period in Israel and also the government's continued focus on increased dependence on gas usage for power generation. We've also made excellent progress on Leviathan, and have line of sight on projects sanctioned around the end of the year or early next year.","And in our other offshore areas, we benefited from strong reservoir and facility performance at Gunflint in the Gulf of Mexico and the Alba compression projection in Equatorial Guinea. Both are producing at higher rates than expected.","Beyond operations excellence, we've continued to strengthen our financial position. The successful IPO of our Noble Midstream business highlights tremendous work by Terry Gerhart and the Midstream team. With the IPO proceeds, this public vehicle has already returned the capital investments made in those assets back to Noble. The long-term value potential for both Noble and the NBLX unitholders is substantial.","Slide 4 highlights the NBLX assets, and on slide 5, we've shown a combined valuation in Noble for both Noble Midstream as well as CONE. In total, we estimate a Midstream value for Noble at over $2.5 billion. This value is expected to grow quickly as we move into 2017 and beyond.","Including the initial distribution from NBLX, we've generated almost $1.5 billion in portfolio proceeds this year, and increased total liquidity to nearly $6 billion. We are in the enviable position of being able to accelerate development activity while also reducing leverage to maintain our financial strength and flexibility. We're doing precisely what we have said we would do all year.","Since the end of the third quarter, we've paid down $850 million of our term loan. With free cash flow being generated organically and expected portfolio proceeds, we still estimate that at the end of the year, we will have well over $5 billion in liquidity on hand.","The third area of competitive advantage is our portfolio. Earlier this week, we, along with CONSOL, announced an intent to dissolve the upstream Marcellus joint venture. It's now been five years since we entered the asset with CONSOL. The accomplishments over that time period have been remarkable. Significant ramps in both production and recoverable resources have highlighted the strong coordination and technical excellence of both companies.","Over the last several months, the parties focused on how to maximize value and flexibility. We agreed to split the upstream acreage and production in such a way that each party controls 100% of its assets and future activity. Noble will retain 100% working interest in 363,000 acres, and current production of approximately 450 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We will keep our core wet gas Marcellus operations in Majorsville and Moundsville, including the Utica potential in Moundsville and substantial gas inventory for future development. You can see a before and after look of the transaction on slide 7. Closing is anticipated before year-end.","I'd like to personally express my appreciation to both the CONSOL and Noble teams that have worked so well together for the past five years. There're no changes to the CONE midstream ownership, acreage dedications, or services. We will continue to work with CONSOL as sponsors to enhance the value of that business. Other recent portfolio optimization efforts have included the DJ Basin acreage trade and the initial sell-down of our Tamar interest. We anticipate the Tamar transaction will close during the fourth quarter.","On the topic of portfolio, I want to address the recent market speculation around Noble's interest in a potential Permian bolt-on acquisition. Let me be clear. We feel no urgency, nor have any desire to bid up prices in the basin. And as always, we will be patient and selective in evaluating any additions to our position in the heart of the Delaware play. We remain focused on increasing drilling activity in our existing position. And we'll highlight during our call in two weeks, how dramatically and quickly we can grow our volumes and increase our value there.","Each step we've made over the last couple of years, including those mentioned today, has been centered on enhancing our future and the value potential for shareholders. Our company is well positioned and focused. Our capital is prioritized to accelerate our Delaware Basin asset, develop our DJ and Eagle Ford positions, and post sanction implement the first phase of Leviathan. These things will be clear on the investor call in two weeks.","Now, let me hand the call over to Gary to walk through our excellent operating performance.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to share with you on November 16, so I'll keep my comments relatively short today.","Let's start with the DJ Basin. Third quarter production totaled 113,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That's several thousand barrels equivalent per day higher than expected. This resulted from continued success with enhanced completions and relatively low-lying pressures throughout the basin. Majority of our activity in the DJ Basin continues to focus on the Wells Ranch and East Pony areas, although we also brought online several Mustang wells during the quarter.","In total, we commenced production on 43 wells with proppant concentration averaging over 1,600 pounds per lateral foot. I'm particularly encouraged about some DJ wells that have recently come on production testing even higher proppant concentrations, 2,000 pounds plus. And we should have some Wells Ranch higher intensity results for you on the call in a couple of weeks.","During the quarter, we completed the previously announced strategic acreage trade with PDC Energy, which expanded our Wells Ranch position by approximately 20%. This transaction is consistent with our strategy to focus on areas with higher oil content where we have more contiguous acreage and can drive efficiency gains through longer lateral development and existing infrastructure. For Noble, this transaction added substantial value to our forward development plans.","Moving to Texas, we continued our successes in the Delaware with the Johnny Ringo 9 3H well. The well is nearly 5,000 feet in lateral length and completed with 2,500 pounds of proppant per lateral foot and slickwater fluid, another outstanding well. One of the top two industry wells in the third quarter in the basin.","Total production from the well is almost 1,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day with approximately 70% oil. With the second rig added to our position there, the pace of our drilling and completions will ramp up quickly. Fourth quarter activity will be higher than the first three quarters of the year combined with an even further acceleration into 2017. I'm excited about the fact that we are now doing our first pad drilling in our first long lateral wells.","Also, we will soon be testing multiple zones beyond the Wolfcamp A that we have in the heart of the Delaware Basin. Over in the Eagle Ford, we announced strong results from new wells in Gates Ranch. The five Lower Eagle Ford wells we brought online in the quarter had 500-foot lateral spacing at an average lateral length of nearly 5,900 feet. IP-30 rates have averaged more than 3,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","During the third quarter, we shut in 33 Eagle Ford wells for about a month to perform offset fracs. In the fourth quarter, we're bringing on a number of new wells in Briscoe Ranch including a couple in the Upper Eagle Ford. And they will be Noble's first test of this potentially large resource.","Dave mentioned earlier the recent production performances at Tamar. As a result of the increasing Israeli gas demand outlook, we've recently commenced drilling an additional development well at Tamar. This well will provide reliability and additional production capacity.","At Leviathan, we are continuing to target a final investment decision around year-end or early next year. We've now contracted up to 450 million cubic feet per day for 15 years equating to estimated gross revenues of more than $12 billion. Our recent contract with the National Electric Power Company of Jordan represents the first Leviathan export contract. We look forward to supplying gas to Jordan for many years into the future.","The Leviathan FEED work continues, and we're making substantial progress on all of the bids and awards. Over the next couple of months, we expect to finalize remaining key milestones for sanction. This includes additional domestic sales contracts and financing plans, as well as completion of the engineering work, project cost estimates and required construction permits.","Offshore, in the Gulf of Mexico, we brought online our Gunflint development in mid-July. This is a third Middle Miocene tieback to commence production in the last 12 months. And these three contributed to the more than doubling of our Gulf of Mexico volumes over the last year. The net amount from Gunflint to Noble Energy during the quarter was 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is higher than expected due to additional open capacity at the host facility.","We continue to see strong production from the Big Bend and Dantzler fields during the quarter, and recently celebrated the one-year anniversary in both of these fields.","We provided fourth quarter 2016 guidance on slide 8. As mentioned in the press release, we are increasing our fourth quarter capital guidance to $425 million to $475 million reflecting the rig additions and higher activity levels. Even with this activity fits (16:51) acceleration, we will still be well under $1.5 billion in capital this year.","We've maintained our previous fourth quarter volume guidance despite the impact of asset divestitures that were not previously modeled. Otherwise, we would have projected above the high end of our 400,000 barrel to 410,000 barrel equivalent per day range. The largest of these transactions is the Marcellus JV separation that Dave talked through earlier.","With the close anticipated in November, we expect about 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day impact on the fourth quarter. Making up the difference is higher volumes than previously expected in the DJ Basin and the Gulf of Mexico, which also contribute to a slightly higher oil mix for the quarter as well. We also reduced a few of our cost item expectations for the fourth quarter, including LOE and G&A.","There are a lot of catalysts to look forward to as we approach 2017. Drilling activity is accelerating. The effectiveness of enhanced completions in all basins continues to improve, and we are leveraging our onshore infrastructure advantage with NBLX. In addition, our offshore assets continue to generate substantial cash flows to the business and a sanction at Leviathan is near.","We'll have much more to show in two weeks. I hope you'll plan to join us then as well. And at this time, we'll go ahead and open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. And we'll go first to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Dave, obviously doing an off-cycle kind of update call in November, I know you're going to leave the details to November 16. But I did want to ask you, clearly, I think you think the guys maybe miss it or the investors may be missing something from a bigger picture standpoint. What do you think the market may be missing as we think about Noble relative to your peers and what do you hope to accomplish with that call?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Arun, I appreciate the question, and also the plug for the 16th. I think, no doubt. We want to highlight just the performance and the long-term expectation performance of our onshore business. I think that gets lost a little bit at times, and I think we can do a great job of laying that out. And also just what we're focusing on, where we expect to spend capital and what are going to be the growth drivers for us that went out of our multiple years. And that I think just making that clear since we really haven't had a chance to give a bigger picture, longer term outlook for a few years now. As we've maneuvered through the last couple years, I think we want to highlight how bright the future is for us.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Makes a lot of sense. And just one quick modeling question. On the Eagle Ford, I know you guided to this last quarter, but your Texas volumes were impacted on a sequential basis by the shut-in of 33 wells. I know you brought on five in the quarter. How should we think about shut-ins in the Eagle Ford going forward? Is this an unusually high level of shut-ins and how do we think about that perhaps going forward?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Arun. I think having 33 wells shut-in, I would say, is unusually high, but shutting it off that wells to frac new completions is standard in the area. We've had some of that all along. Rosetta had some of that in the past. So, we'll continue to have that going forward, but 33 wells was an unusually high number I would say.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We'll go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. My first question is, can you guys discuss the strategic drivers on the dissolution of the CNX JV? And given the assets unlikely that could be for capital versus the balance sheet portfolio, should we expect the disposition or do you view the asset as a gas option worth holding? Any comments?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","No. I think the driver was, as we progressed and I think Nic addressed this on his call the other day too, but as we progressed over time, and you just looked at the different portfolios for both companies, it made a lot of sense to set it up to where we each could control our own development plans and our own future going forward. So, I think that was the driver. And pure and simple. We had a great relationship for the five years and delivered a tremendous amount of value. But as you look forward and looked at it from a, just the whole portfolio aspect for each company, it made a lot of sense to set it up where each company could operate, and drive at 100%, their own portion of it.","I think when we look at it going forward, we like the position we have there, especially the ability to control the timing and pace of development. And so, we'll just see how that plays out, then look at it relative to the returns of the other parts of our portfolio as we make decisions on capital allocation. But we like the position. It does give some nice option value and the best gas basin in the U.S., and it's still a significant position.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. And maybe that'll be clear on November 16 when we see the forward capital spend. My second question, or a few questions on the Delaware, and I realize it's early there. Given your contiguous position and long lateral leadership in the DJ, when do you expect to test longer laterals? And then on the zones, you drilled four successful wells in the Upper Wolfcamp with strong results. When are you planning to test the Bone Springs and Lower Wolfcamp A? I'll leave it there.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I'll let probably Gary comment on a minute, but definitely, that's one of the areas we'll highlight our plans on November 16, so Gary can talk a little bit more specific about some of those aspects.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I think we're headed that direction now. We noted in the press release that we just (23:27) our first long laterals in the Delaware, it was almost 7,800-foot lateral length. As you know, we've got a nice contiguous position there, and the ability to drill more long laterals going forward. And I think you'll see us do that, just like you've seen that transition in the DJ, where we averaged over 9,000-foot in lateral length in the third quarter.","As far as the other zones go, we've mentioned in the past that we're testing or drilling our first Lower Wolfcamp A well and our first Bone Spring well this quarter. They won't be on in fourth quarter. They won't come on till next year. But those will be the first tests of those zones that Noble has drilled. And so, we look forward to those results next year.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Appreciate it, guys.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Evan.","Operator","We'll go next to Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Scott.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Hi, Scott.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, if I could ask the Marcellus question in a different way, when you look at where returns are, based on strip prices at the Marcellus, how does that rank with some of your plays? And maybe you all will be giving some more specifics in a couple weeks, but just generalized, can you compete with the DJ and Eagle Ford and Permian right now?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, yeah. Obviously, it depends on longer term gas price, and we'll see how that plays out. Right now, I think it's been pretty clear. Our capital allocation has been in DJ, Delaware and Eagle Ford right now, and I don't see that changing near term. I think in the Marcellus, we'll continue to watch how gas price plays out. I think we've always talked about this and (25:08) keep kind of improving netbacks in a $3 type gas price. There's still a nice portion of it that'll compete well over time. And I think, as we've talked about, we'll lay that longer term picture out here in a couple weeks.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. I appreciate that. And as a follow-up question, in the Permian, you all have added a rig, you're up at two right now. Logistically, on the footprints you have right now, what do you think your max capacity of being able to run rigs on that position is, and maybe it's wells, not rigs, but just generalized, can you run four rigs, five rigs, six rigs on that position? What is your view over the long-term on that asset?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Scott, you'll see a lot more on that here on November 16. I'd say the range you put out there, it's a realistic range, probably at the lower end of that range on a rig count over time, given the efficiencies we expect to continue to generate there and drilling more wells with fewer rigs, just like we've seen in the DJ over time. But for now, we've added a second rig. We'll ramp up activity from there. We'll make sure that we can do it in an efficient and safe manner, and we'll talk more on November 16 about how quickly we increase it further from there.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Shifting a bit to international, you mentioned the FID for Leviathan is potentially by year-end or early next year. I know you haven't actually done that yet, but can you talk to the financing strategy there? How quickly you would expect, and how significantly we should expect the capital budget to go up as you prepare for that growth? And then, the interest level in outspending cash flow.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I think, when you think about Leviathan, we've always talked about that as probably, majority of the investment will occur over three years, with probably the larger portion of it in the second year and third year, while the first portion is probably less than a third of the total capital. The other nice part about that is essentially, really prefunded that first year with the sell-down of the interest we've sold down this year in the Eastern Med. So, we're in good shape there from the standpoint of being able to fund Leviathan and not take away from any of our other development.","What was the other part of your question, Brian?","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I guess, the extent to which you'd outspend cash flow, or we would see that versus project financing or financing Leviathan through additional asset sales, including Leviathan itself.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I think it's a good point because what we've also said is, I would think high likelihood, almost an expectation of before Leviathan comes on production, we'll have sold down the other 7% or 8% of Tamar. Chance we could sell down some interest in Leviathan also. We've always said that we'd be open to that for the right price, especially post sanction. So, I think you got a number of ways to make sure that you've got that funded, along with the fact that we're still looking at some project financing. And I would expect that will still be an element of things.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks. And then going back to the onshore, obviously, a lot of specifics you're planning for a couple of weeks from now. But just in more strategically, how do you think about what the constraint is to how aggressively you push the envelope onshore U.S.? Is it a cash flow constraint? Is it a leverage target for the company overall? Is it you want increased activity to the point at which operational efficiency would be sacrificed to something else? As we think about modeling this out, what should we think of as the constraint to where you push the envelope?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think we'll give you a much better clear picture of that, so we can guide you to what that activity level will be. But I think when you think about the considerations, all of those are considerations. I think you have to look at cash generation or cash uses and cash generation. So, you're going to look at the whole mix of that piece. Some of the things we've done this year already help with setting up the activity for next year, like NBLX being out there, some of those types of things. So, that'll be a good supporter of activity going forward.","I think the other elements you mentioned, how you look at your balance sheet. The key element also is just how do you efficiently and effectively drive the growth activity? And that's something that you want to make sure you're doing it efficiently, so you're creating value as you go. And you're creating the most value you can in optimizing the asset base as you go.","So, all of those things are going to be considerations. I think the execution is going to be key to all of that. And I think if you look at the history of Noble, it's always been strong on execution and that will continue to be the key attribute going forward. Supplement it with the fact that we've maintained the strong balance sheet to support that execution. So, those are the two key elements, both the financial strength and the operational execution, that will help support the plan that we lay out for you.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Dave, and to the rest of your team there. If I could ask one more question about the Marcellus. As I look at your map and you have what, 363,000 net acres now. Can you give us an idea of what percentage of that is HBP and if the natural gas strip bears out the way it looks right now, we're looking at $3 for the next few years. What do you imagine that acreage position will be two years, three years down the line?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think the nice part about it is that it's almost all HBP. So, you have the flexibility, which, I think, the heart of your question is, you have the flexibility to develop it and maintain the position that gives you that optionality going forward, Charles. So, I don't think you lose anything or are forced to have to drill something that you're not ready to drill.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Right. Yeah. That's what I was after. You got long-dated option there.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. That's right. You're knocking me (31:57) into this. It's nice part about this, splitting up for both companies is, you do control your development plan. It's not controlling you.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Right. Got it. And then if I could ask another question about the Delaware Basin. I think you guys made it clear in your prepared comments that you're on your front-foot there. You've accelerated and you're getting ready to accelerate more, and I understand that we're going to get more detail on that in a couple weeks.","But I wondered if you could characterize just this last data point you got with, we had this really encouraging well result with high well rate with the big frac you put on it. Are you more in the phase of figuring out what your completion is going to be and honing-in on what your (32:46) design is going to be or is it, in contrast, is this more of a kind of a opening people's eyes and increasing the possibilities of what we may be looking at going forward?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Charles, this is Gary. I think it's a little bit of both. I think we're certainly still in the phase of optimizing completions in the area, figuring out what the right proppant concentration is as we complete these wells. This is really the fourth well that we brought on as Noble Energy. And we completed this when we were 2,500 pounds of proppant. Third well, we were 3,000 pounds of proppant. We said at the time, we continue to test different ranges. That's what we're continuing to do.","We've got another five or so wells, six wells coming on in the fourth quarter. Those will be different proppant levels as well. Testing all the way up to 5,000 pounds per foot. So, we'll see those results here in another three months or so. So, we're very much still optimizing what the right completion strategy is for these wells.","I think to the second part of your question, it does pretty clearly, I think, demonstrate the quality of the acreage and the potential that's there as we continue to develop the most efficient strategy for playing this out. As we noted in the prepared comments, according to a third-party report that's out there, this well is the second best well in the basin in the third quarter. So, still a lot to do. Still a lot of improvement, I think, we can get beyond this, but hard to be disappointed in what we've seen so far. That's for sure.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","It's helpful detail. Thank you, Gary.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Hey, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Dave, I wonder if I could follow up on a couple of those. On the Marcellus, could you characterize how your standalone outlook contrasts, perhaps, with the joint decision process? And what I'm really getting at is that you've got a lot of ducts I assume do compete for capital in an asset that may otherwise decline. So, what's your objective there, and not digging into too much hopefully on the call in two weeks? Is it to stabilize production or to just characterize how you think about the outlook there?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think as we've mentioned, Doug, that now we can kind of control that pace of development. I think we've got in our portion that we're now operating in and control 100%, I think we got 20 or a little over 20 ducts in that, all high quality that will continue to play into our plan going forward. And then, the pace of development on the different pads, if you will, or the different areas will be driven by how it competes for capital. So, we're not changing how we compete for capital on the best returns are going to play, and that's going to be where we're going to allocate our money. And I think you'll continue to see that.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess what I'm getting at, it's almost a sizable portion of your overall company production. So, the decline rate could be a bit of a headwind. So I'm trying to understand if you're objective is to start out by stabilizing production and go from there. Or is that not really the way you think about it?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I don't think we're thinking about it from that particular area, we're thinking about it from how we want to manage the whole company. Again, and that's the benefit of having the portfolio. So, I think as we'll lay out for you and especially as we focus on the whole onshore portfolio here in a couple weeks, I think it ought to be pretty clear on where we're putting our money and what the impact should be in each area.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. My follow-up, hopefully it's an easy one. And again, I'm not sure how much detail you want to go into it today, but four weeks we rise (36:41) the production versus 23 drilled with a very different average lateral lengths in those two buckets. Should we think of the 23 wells, the 9,000-foot cross pipe average, is that going to be the dominant length for those incremental wells going forward? Or are we still going to see a mix you think? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Doug, I'm not sure I heard the very last part of the question, but as far as lateral length, there's pretty big disparity between what we drilled in 3Q at over 9,000-feet and what we brought online at around 6,000-feet. Now part of that is where the activity has been focused. A large part of the wells we brought on in 3Q were in East Pony, which tend to be a little shorter lateral length. Most of what we drilled in 3Q was in Wells Ranch, which tends to be longer lateral length.","I think when you think about going forward in Wells Ranch, we'll continue to see those long laterals. As we move into areas in Mustang in the coming years, you'll see long laterals there as well. Certainly, our preference is to continue to drill those long laterals everywhere we can, plus or minus 9,000-feet. So, that's the way I think about it in the areas that we're active in.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, East Pony will still be the shorter lateral, I guess, is what you're saying.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","East Pony still tends to be shorter laterals. There're some offsetting acreage there. It's not quite as contiguous and locked up as Wells Ranch and Mustang is.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the answers, guys. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Just to stick with the DJ, obviously some big wells on the additional proppant. Can you talk about Mustang and kind of what you're seeing in those areas similar to the ones outside of where you stepped out a little bit versus East Pony and Wells Ranch?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, David. When we brought on our first Mustang IDP wells earlier in the year, we talked about that in the past. Extremely excited about the performance of those wells. This is down in the southern half of what we consider the Mustang IDP. So, it's pretty good step-out from where we've been most active over the last couple of years in the Wells Ranch and East Pony.","Very pleased with the results that we've seen. Again, it's an area where we can drill long laterals. We're just now starting to build out the infrastructure for that area. So we'll able to take advantage of the efficiencies and the cost reductions from that when that's constructed, just like we have in Wells Ranch and East Pony, but very excited about the results. EURs have been well above the type curve projections. And that's an area that, as we get infrastructure built out over the next year or so, you'll see more activity in that area.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And obviously, judging by your comments, those wells are holding up and you haven't seen any difference three months to six months out at some of those earlier wells?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I'd say we continue to be very, very pleased with the results and you'll see more of that here in a couple of weeks on the call.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Just one more. Overall for the corporate \u2013 I don't know, Dave, if this is for you or whoever wants to take it \u2013 but overall for corporate, how should we think about maintenance CapEx today as compared to three months, six months ago, or a couple years ago?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I think we continue to get more efficient on some of this. We've got the development of Leviathan. We would expect it'll be a significant element next year too. So, I think, if you can, David, I'd hold that as we can break out and break out the different elements of capital and impacts in a couple weeks, and I think we can address that then.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Pearce Hammond with Simmons Piper Jaffray.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. My first question pertains to service costs and what you're seeing on that front. Are you seeing any inflation right now in the basins you operate in? And then, as you look out to 2017, how are you planning around that? And are you doing anything to try to help mitigate any type of inflation? Thank you.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Hey, Pearce. This is Gary. I mean, we're starting to see a little bit of cost creep in some areas. Steel prices have gone up. Rig costs are starting to creep up ever so slightly. Those are probably the areas we've seen the most in so far. I wouldn't say it's anything significant yet.","And, as we've talked about in the past, well over 50% of the cost savings and capital efficiencies that we've been able to deliver over the last couple of years, we expect to stick with us even after prices come up and some of the service costs come back up. So, not anything to be too concerned about yet. We've got a supply chain group here that stays very much on top of where everything has headed. We've got great relationships with our key partners and suppliers, and continue to work that every chance we get.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Excellent. And then my follow-up is just high level, what are the next steps on Leviathan to reach FID by the time you want it, by later this year?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Right. Well, I think, it's getting a little more line of sight and some more progress on some of contracts, especially some of the domestic portion. We now have 400 million to 450 million a day, with the addition of Jordan and what we've done already domestically. We've got some things we think we can pull together over the next short period of time, getting some of the additional permits in place, some of the agreements, whether it's between governments, within the government on some of the key elements of those, lining up some of the financing, making progress on that, finalizing our bids coming in on some of the key technical aspects and just pulling those together. So, I think everything's all on track. Great progress. I don't see anything that's giving me any concern at this point.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Well go next to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe if I could just follow up with a couple production-related questions. First, in Israel, can you help us understand how much \u2013 I mean, if you look over the course of the strong production that you've had this year, how much of that has been driven by seasonality and weather, and how much do you think is a result of structural improvements in Israeli demand that should be recurring going forward?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I'll let Keith talk a little bit about that, but there's still seasonality. You see that as you move from third quarter to fourth quarter with Israel, that you got the expected seasonality. But demand's been strong, and let me have Keith kind of accentuate that a little bit.","J. Keith Elliott - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Ryan. I think what you see in Israel is, we've really seen the impact of the government's decree of the sort of 15% year-on-year coal reduction from 2015 to 2016. So, that's had a meaningful impact, as Dave said, still seeing the seasonality that comes in. But that seasonality, I would say, has probably been less of an issue this year, as we've seen. Typically, we see much more of a kind of dip in the shoulder months of spring and autumn, and we're not seeing as big a dips as we would historically expect.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then maybe on the Gulf of Mexico, and maybe this will come in a couple weeks, but any insight on how do you expect volumes to track, in particular from the three most recent developments there, Gunflint, Big Bend, and Dantzler over the next, I guess, as we look through 2017, over the next 15 months or so? And then any commentary on kind of decline rates overall for that part of your business?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I mean, and you're right, we'll show you more, but I mean just in general, I think things are going as expected. You've seen Big Bend and Dantzler now on for a year. So, we would expect those to start to decline. And Gunflint, we'll have the advantage of a full year next year for Gunflint. And it's been doing as expected, at least as well as expected.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","But should we expect moderate declines out of the Gulf of Mexico next year, year-on-year?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","We'll lay that out. We'll lay out the plan on what we should see on each portion of the business. So, it'll be helpful and give you some more transparency.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Gail Nicholson with KLR Group.","Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC","Good morning. Looking at the location of the Johnny Ringo, that seems to be closer to the Calamity Jane well that had a lower oil cut. Could you talk about maybe the higher oil cut in Johnny Ringo that was driven by the completion technique, or potentially where you landed in the zone?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Gail. I think it's more of the location of the well where we are in the zone. The Calamity Jane well on the far northeast side of the acreage, I think we got the toe section of that lateral into an area that tends to be a bit gassier, which is why you saw a little bit lower oil cut there. I think the oil cut that we've seen on the Johnny Ringo is probably more representative of what you should expect to see in the eastern half of that acreage.","Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC","Okay, great. And then looking at the updated 4Q volume guidance that you provided, the outperformance in the DJ, is that assuming a 1,600-pound per proppant foot loading? Or you talked about those 2,000 pounds that you did, or is that higher expectation of proppant loading in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter proppant loading?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, our proppant loading has been creeping up as we've talked about. I think we've been pretty conservative in the past about assuming the uplift that we would see on production from those higher loadings until we saw more history. I think the ability that we have in the fourth quarter now to offset the 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day that we're losing as part of the Marcellus trade with higher volumes in the DJ and GOM, you're seeing some of that performance start to show up. So, I think the way we've got it modeled for 4Q is representative of what we're bringing on in 4Q. We'll see how those higher concentration jobs perform over time, and we'll see where we go from there.","Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Tim Rezvan with Mizuho Securities.","Timothy Rezvan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, folks. Thank you for taking my call. First question, in prepared comments I wanted to make sure I got the numbers right. There was discussion of $850 million of the term loan was paid down and you expect liquidity of over $5 billion at year-end. Are there any other moving parts in that kind of equation or is that assuming you'll be free cash flow positive in the fourth quarter?","Kenneth M. Fisher - Noble Energy, Inc.","This is Ken. We'll be free cash flow positive in the quarter, and we also expect to receive some proceeds for the sell-down of the 3% interest in Tamar. So, you'll have a very robust quarter, and we'll end the year in very strong position in terms of liquidity.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","And then there's the $200 million as we close the CONSOL and Marcellus agreement that we'll be paying out there too. So, those would probably be the moving pieces to think about.","Timothy Rezvan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. And then, the timing of the possible 1% incremental sell-down, is there clarity on when that would be?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, their decision is by closing. So that's probably something we'll know more of over the next month. We would still expect closing probably over the next month or so of the initial 3%. And so, they have to decide by closing.","Timothy Rezvan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And my follow-up question is more of a modeling one. Does 4Q 2016 NGL guidance you provided, if we take the mid-point, you're down about 9% quarter-over-quarter. Is that entirely from the Marcellus JV or are there kind of other factors driving that?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I think, obviously, there's some impact from the Marcellus portion there. It could be just a mix of what we're bringing on in the Eagle Ford from that balance too. I think as we've seen in the DJ, it's actually a little higher oil cut in some of the other areas. And follow up with Brad, he can probably give you as more insight into the specifics.","Timothy Rezvan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We go next to Mike Scialla with Stifel.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Last quarter, the BOEM issued a notice to the Gulf of Mexico operators about posting supplemental surety bonds or other collateral, I guess, to ensure you have 100% of the future decommissioning costs covered. Wanted to see if there's any impact to Noble based on that? And does that change the landscape for the Gulf of Mexico for the industry in general at all?","Kenneth M. Fisher - Noble Energy, Inc.","This is Ken. I think we've been granted some decent amount of selfish insurance under the program. So, that's the primary waivable cover. Secondly then, we would have access to surety bonds for any additional piece of that. So, I don't see it having any real impact on us. I think the other thing that's beneficial is, is that your partners will also be posting collateral if they're less credit worthy. So, I think that's actually in a way a good thing. So, I don't see it having an impact on the way we think about that business.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Ken. And I wanted to see the plans for the rig you have drilling at Tamar right now, is that rig under long-term contract? Or what are you going to do with that rig going forward?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","The contract on that rolls off, I think, towards the summer of next year. So, we haven't defined exactly what we're doing after Tamar. We're in discussions on a number of different things there after this Tamar-8 well that we're drilling. But, I mean, that well will go through probably with drilling completion into probably late first quarter or so.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference call back to Brad Whitmarsh for any closing remarks.","Brad Whitmarsh - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. And thanks everybody again for joining us.

Welcome to Noble Energy's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. I would now like to turn the call over to David Larson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","David R. Larson","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Noble Energy's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call and Webcast. On the call today, we have Chuck Davidson, Chairman and CEO; Dave Stover, President and COO; and Ken Fisher, CFO.","Earlier this morning, we issued our earnings release for the second quarter, and it is available on our website. We have also posted a few supplemental operational slides that we hope you will find useful as you review our results today. You may have also noticed in the morning's press release that we have reclassified our North Sea operations as discontinued operations. To assist you with the accounting impact, we provided an additional table to our earnings release.","Following our call today, we expect to be filing our 10-K with the SEC, and it will be available on our website. In a few moments, I will be turning the call over to Chuck, who will discuss our results for the quarter and some of our ongoing efforts to grow and monetize our project inventory. Dave will then provide a detailed operational review and our -- on our near-term plans and outlook. We'll leave time for Q&A at the end and plan to conclude the call within the hour. [Operator Instructions]","I want to remind everyone that this webcast and the conference call contains projections and forward-looking statements based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. We provide no assurances on these statements, as a number of factors and uncertainties could cause actual results in the future periods to differ materially from what we discuss here today. You should read our full disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that influence our business.","Finally, we will be referencing certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted net income or discretionary cash flow on the call. When we refer to these items, it is because we believe they are good metrics to use in evaluating the company's performance. We provide you with reconciliations in our earnings tables.","Now let me turn the call over to Chuck.","Charles D. Davidson","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We've got lots to cover as our activity levels remain very high. I'm going to start out by reviewing our second quarter results, including our full year guidance and then comment on some of our planned activities for the rest of the year.","And before we get to the numbers, let me just comment on the reclassification of our North Sea properties to discontinued operations. David referenced this in the opening. We are doing this as a result of our recent announcement to divest the majority of our North Sea business. Previous quarters have also been reclassified to reflect the impact of this change, and you can see the references to discontinued operations in the schedules that accompany our earnings release this morning.","Adjusted net income for the second quarter totaled $145 million or $0.77 per share diluted. Excluded from adjusted net income were unrealized gains from commodity hedges and 2 domestic asset impairments related to commodity prices. As previously announced, we have recorded $118 million pretax in exploration expense related to the Deep Blue project, which reduced earnings this quarter by approximately $0.42 a share.","Revenues from continuing operations were $966 million for the quarter. That's up 15% from the second quarter last year, with a big driver in the growth being crude and condensate revenue, which was up 57%. Our total sales volumes for the quarter, including sales from discontinued operations, were 231,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was near the upper end of our second quarter guidance range. As expected, total sales were down from the first quarter due to planned maintenance early in the quarter at the Atwood plant, as well as reduced gas sales in Israel where we continue to manage reservoir depletion.","In addition, we experienced an impact in the DJ basin of approximately 4,000 barrels a day equivalent as a result of third-party processing downtime and hot weather. Over 85% of the volume decrease from the first quarter was in natural gas sales, with the remaining decrease in natural gas liquids. Crude oil volumes were actually up 2% over the first quarter. Sales from continuing operations averaged 224,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Of that amount, sales of crude and condensate represented 86,000 barrels a day, which is a 62% increase over the second quarter last year.","Domestic sales totaled 134,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and benefited from the first full quarter of production from South Raton, as well as the start up of Galapagos near the end of the quarter, as well as strong results from the horizontal drilling programs in the Marcellus and the Wattenberg and the Niobrara. Internationally, sales volumes were 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We brought Alba back to full production after completing maintenance early in the second quarter and delivered another very strong quarter of production from Aseng.","As I mentioned previously, our decision to divest certain North Sea assets has triggered reporting our entire North Sea business as discontinued operations. As a result, all of our North Sea production has been removed from our reported sales volumes. Financial results for discontinued operations are rolled up to a single line item in the table as income from discontinued operations net of tax, and as David mentioned, we've provided an additional schedule in the back of this quarter's earnings release that gives greater detail on that line item.","Separately, we've also announced that we've entered into sales agreements for our mid-continent and Permian divestiture packages. To help you through the volume story on all of this, on Page 4 of the supplementary slides that we've provided alongside our earnings release, we have reconciled our original 2012 sales guidance, that is the range of 244,000 to 256,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We have reconciled that to a new pro forma range of 234,000 to 242,000 barrels of oil equivalent. This pro forma was prepared by removing all the North Sea volumes for 2012 and adjusting volumes for all U.S. divestments based on the expected closing dates.","In looking at our performance to date, as well as estimates for the remainder of the year, we're raising our full year sales guidance by about 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent above the original pro forma guidance. Thus, the new guidance for the full year is 236,000 to 244,000 barrels of oil equivalent. I know there's a lot of pluses and minuses to get there, but really the bottom line is clearly that the strong performance at Aseng and now Galapagos are helping us to lift the guidance range.","Additionally, as noted in the press release, we have lowered the guidance range for lease operating expense. We've raised the range on DD&A to reflect the greater mix of new high-value oil production and adjusted exploration expense guidance to reflect our latest estimates. All other guidance items remain unchanged.","Our discretionary cash flow for the quarter was just over $700 million. That's up 7% from the second quarter last year. Liquidity remains very strong at over $3.7 billion. Our already announced $1 billion of non-core divestments will provide additional support to our strong balance sheet. On our divestment program, I'm very pleased with the interest in the marketplace and the speed at which we've been able to execute. We expect to continue divestments of our smaller non-core packages throughout this year and into next year.","David mentioned at the beginning of the call that for this quarter besides the earnings release, we also provided a package of supplementary slides. We believe this material will be helpful to you in understanding not only our quarterly performance but also the key drivers of our growth going forward. I mentioned earlier that our activity levels are extremely high, and we have many exciting things happening in virtually all of our core areas. The supplementary materials provide additional detail and color on our programs, and I encourage you to review the package.","In the DJ basin, Dave will discuss later some of the substantial improvements we're seeing in our horizontal drilling program there. It's hard to believe that it was only 15 months ago when we began seeing the upward inflection point in production from the horizontal Niobrara that told us that this program truly had the potential to dramatically change our company. At that time, we had been running 3 horizontal rigs and had about 30 horizontal wells online. Since then we've experienced more than a fivefold increase in production and now have 7 rigs drilling horizontal wells, with plan to be at 10 rigs by year-end. Our horizontal well count should easily top 250 by then.","The era of vertical drilling in Wattenberg is rapidly coming to a close. Our plan today for this region bear little resemblance to what they were 15 months ago. Field development plans have gone through dramatic changes in scale and scope, and major industry investments are being made in oil transportation, gas processing, gas and NGL transportation to accommodate this growth.","Earlier this year, we announced we expected to invest $8 billion in this region over the next 5 years. Our operations continue to expand northward. We recently opened our new operations center in Greeley, which will expand as we grow our activities in the DJ basin. At this new facility, our technicians are able to remotely monitor, operate and optimize production from over 6,000 Noble-operated wells across the basin. Utilization and expansion of this technology are bringing tremendous efficiencies to our operations and enhancing our safety and environmental performance.","Switching over to the Eastern Mediterranean. We're rapidly moving forward with the development of our major discoveries there. The development of Tamar, which will provide gas to the Israeli domestic market, is progressing on schedule. Obviously, the sooner we can provide that gas to the growing market, the better.","After receiving approval from the public utility authorities and the Israel Antitrust Authority, the sales agreement with Israel Electric Corporation has now received final regulatory approval from the Israeli cabinet. This long and detailed process is now over, and the contract is fully executed and effective. While we continue to progress Tamar towards first sales oil next April, we've been developing 2 smaller fields, the Noa field and the Pinnacles field to support near-term domestic market needs.","Noa started delivering gas in the second quarter, and we just now brought Pinnacles online after resolving some gas-specification issues. The cost of substitute fields in Israel is very expensive to us, so there's significant economic benefits to our customers and the people of Israel from these gas deliveries. Once Tamar is online, our work is not over by any means. Domestic demand continues to grow, and we're working on additional solutions to meet this growing demand.","With respect to exports, we're studying several options. The first phase of our pre-FEED work on LNG site locations has been completed. Additional concept selection studies will be completed before launching a FEED study targeted for the first half of next year. To complement our onshore initiatives, we're also developing floating LNG strategies. We're learning a lot about the technology that could be applied to Leviathan and Cyprus, and we're evaluating those options as well.","Discussions with potential Leviathan partners are ongoing, with several companies already having been through the data room and several more scheduled in the coming weeks. Also, we expect final recommendations from Israel's gas policy committee shortly. We're optimistic about both our domestic and export sales plans. We have numerous options. We'll continue to move forward in parallel several of these over the coming months.","Let me finish up with just a brief review of our exploration activities in each of our key offshore basins. In West Africa, we look forward to beginning the drilling of an exploration prospect offshore Cameroon, called Trema, around September 1 with Atwood Hunter rig. Trema is an oil prospect in about 2,000 feet of water, with gross unrisked mean resources of approximately 120 million barrels oil equivalent and a 38% geologic chance of success.","Following Trema, we plan to spot an appraisal well at our Carla discovery before the end of the year. Carla is located beneath the Alen field and has an estimated gross resource range of 35 million to 100 million barrels equivalent, with about 80% liquid content. Following Carla, we've got a deep inventory of West Africa drilling plan for 2013.","In the Gulf of Mexico, our appraisal well at Gunflint has reached TD at 29,975 feet. While we still have a rig on location and we're finishing up the open hole evaluation, we can provide a preliminary status at this time. Hydrocarbons have been found in several, but not all of the target sands that contain hydrocarbons in the original discovery well. The appraisal well has also confirmed excellent reservoir properties and continuity, thus establishing the commercial viability of the field. The results to date indicate that the resources are within Noble's previous range, although likely below the midpoint, given not all of the sands are showing pay at this appraisal location.","Our plan is to drill a new well later this year in the southern part of the field, which we expect will determine the development of Gunflint as either a subsea tieback or as an standalone host facility. The current well will be temporarily abandoned for future use as a producer.","Also in the Gulf of Mexico, we next plan to spud an exploration well at our Big Bend prospect later this year. This oil prospect is located near our second oil prospect named Troubadour. If successful, we envision using subsea tiebacks for these yields just as we recently completed Galapagos.","And in the Eastern Mediterranean, we're working on arrangements to spud a well to test the deep oil potential offshore Israel in 2013, and in Cyprus, we plan to spud an appraisal well at our discovery there by early 2013, depending on rig availability, with that well to better -- help us better understand the resource potential and better define our development options there.","I continue to remain very excited about the path we're on. Our major projects execution continues to be outstanding with Aseng and Galapagos, delivering exceptional results that are well above expectations. The same can be said for our unconventional developments in the DJ basin and the Marcellus. Our next generation of projects are on track for 2013, and we have lots of high impact exploration in front of us. I wouldn't trade our position for anyone at this point.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave, who will take you through a review of our ongoing operations.","David L. Stover","Thank you, Chuck. I will touch upon the operations in each of our core areas, beginning with our activities in the Marcellus Shale play, as next month we'll mark the 1-year anniversary of our announcement of the joint venture with CONSOL.","By focusing on our Marcellus areas that provide the strongest returns, we're now producing over 2.5x our net production at the time of the announcement last year. For the recent quarter, we averaged 74 million cubic feet per day from our Marcellus horizontal program. All of this production is from the dry gas area, and we expect to start our first wet gas production by the end of this month.","In the wet gas area, we are currently operating 1 rig and will be adding 2 additional horizontal rigs in the third quarter. We took over operatorship of the first pad, which was drilled by our partner in Marshall County, West Virginia at the beginning of the year. The 5 wells on that pad have been drilled and completed, and we are finishing the gathering system hookup, which will allow transport of the wet gas to the MarkWest processing plant.","The second pad has 8 wells that have been drilled, and completion operations are underway. We estimate that those wells will also reach first production in the third quarter. The third pad contains 7 wells and drilling is nearly complete. We'll then be moving our rig to the fourth pad, which will likely be an 11-well pad.","Our longest lateral in the wet gas area so far is approximately 6,200 feet, and we're actively optimizing our lease positions to allow us to continue maximizing lateral lengths. In the dry gas area, planned drilling operations for 2012 were completed in central Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia.","During the quarter, CONSOL brought the first well of a 4-well pad onto production, and although we only have a short production history, this well produced just under 18 million cubic feet in a 24-hour period. These 4 wells are among 8 recent wells with lateral lengths of 8,000 feet or greater, and they demonstrate the partnership's successful efforts to increase lateral links where possible. CONSOL is presently operating now 2 horizontal rigs, both in southwestern Pennsylvania where drilling efforts will be focused on several pads in Greene County.","Strong well results in southwest and central Pennsylvania and in West Virginia have allowed us to increase our EUR significantly above our acquisition model. We now believe our Marcellus net risk resource estimate is closer to 10 trillion cubic feet equivalent compared to the original estimate of just over 7 trillion cubic feet equivalent at the time of the acquisition. On Page 11 of our supplementary slides, we show an example of this increase for our southwest Pennsylvania dry gas area.","Looking forward. In 2012, we now expect to drill just over 30 wells in the wet gas area and just under 60 in the dry gas area. We're benefiting from our continuing trend of lengthening laterals and now believe that our average lateral length in 2012 will be greater than 5,000 feet. The efficiencies of pad drilling, the initiation of production in the wet gas area and our focus on the high EUR and high net revenue interest area of southwestern Pennsylvania will all have a positive impact on the economics of our program. By the end of the year, we expect to be producing 140 million cubic feet equivalent per day net from the Marcellus.","In our second onshore domestic core area, the DJ Basin, second quarter production averaged 73,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day despite an impact of approximately 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from third-party processing facility maintenance and unseasonably warm weather. Crude oil represents 40% of the production, with another 17% from NGL.","Our horizontal program continues to outperform expectations and is rapidly expanding. During the second quarter, this program accounted for 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or approximately 1\/3 of our DJ Basin production. Our horizontal production is up 60% year-to-date and is currently producing 27,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net, with 66% liquids. Since June of last year, the horizontal production has more than tripled. We're adding an eighth horizontal rig in August and have contracted 2 additional horizontal rigs that will start up before the end of the year.","In the first half of this year, we spud 83 horizontal wells and performance continues to improve as a result of a number of key learnings. Slightly more than half of these wells are in the extension area, where the wells brought on production this year are tracking EURs almost 10% above the 310,000 barrel of oil equivalent type curve, with greater than 75% liquids. We have highlighted this year-over-year performance improvement on Slide 7 of the supplemental material. In the core area, we spud a total of 24 wells this year, where liquid content average is close to 60%, and again, our EURs are exceeding previous type curves. And in northern Colorado, where we plan to drill 35 to 40 wells this year, we continue to see approximately 80% crude oil content on the wells completed to date.","With respect to our extended reach lateral program, our initial well is located in the extension area. This 9,000-foot lateral continues to track above a 750,000 barrel of oil equivalent type curve even after a year of production. Cumulative production to date is close to 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent. Our next 2 extended reach wells are approaching 30 days of production, with excellent results similar to the first extended reach well. We just finished completion operations on our fourth long lateral well and recently turned it to sales. We have plans for approximately 10 additional extended reach wells this year.","We are collecting a significant amount of production and performance data at our first EcoNode pilot project, which began production earlier this year. We call this 9-well project as testing aerial and vertical recovery of the Niobrara formation. We encourage -- we are encouraged with the performance of all 9 of the wells. In fact, it appears that the wells placed closest to each other at 40-acre spacing are producing the best.","Based on these results, we are preparing another increased density pilot project. This program will consist of 15 wells in a section, testing different development concepts with 40-acre density and multiple targets. We will, again, be targeting the B and C benches, but also intend to horizontally test the A bench and the Codell from the same pad. The 15-well pilot will be located in the extension area near the 9-well pilot, and we expect to spud the first well in August with initial production late in the fourth quarter.","Our goal with these pilot tests is to maximize the economic recovery of the original oil and gas in place, while minimizing our surface footprint. Refer to supplemental Slide 8 and 9 for further information on these 2 pilot programs. The majority of our development plans this year are focused in the oilier extension area, where we envision new numerous multi-well pads incorporating the EcoNode concept supported by a central processing facility, with pipeline infrastructure enabling the offtake of  oil and gas. Meanwhile, we will continue to delineate the northern Colorado portion of our acreage in preparation for the implementation of our next-generation development plan building up on the EcoNode and central processing facility concepts.","With respect to infrastructure, we're obtaining additional oil transport and gas processing capacity through pipeline and plant expansions, new gas plants and a new rail terminal. The capacity of the White Cliffs oil pipeline was previously expanded to approximately 75,000 barrels per day. We have approved an infield oil gathering system, with initial capacity of 50,000 barrels per day, with an expansion capability to 80,000 barrels per day. The system should be operational in the third quarter of 2013.","We have also committed 10,000 barrels per day to a new rail terminal in the area expected to be online late next year. Third-party gas processing capacity continues to increase through expansions and new facilities. And with respect our water needs, we have a number of water supply projects underway to support our development.","To summarize our DJ Basin activity, we're on pace now to drill close to 190 horizontal wells this year, with 75% of those on multi-well pads. Our vertical program will be ramping down to 1 rig by the fourth quarter, as we continue to shift capital to our horizontal program. Our production has grown dramatically, performance continues to exceed expectations, and we are encouraged with recent data from our pilot project as we continue to focus on increasing recovery.","I will now discuss our Deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations. In the Gulf of Mexico, production averaged 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day throughout the second quarter, up over 30% from the first quarter, primarily due to the first full quarter of production from South Raton and a small contribution from Galapagos in June. We will see greater growth in the third quarter with the benefit of a full quarter of production from the Galapagos field.","Current oil production from the Galapagos field is about 30% greater than our original expectations and has significantly increased our contribution from the Gulf of Mexico. As Chuck mentioned earlier, our next Gulf of Mexico exploration well will be Big Bend, with another Gunflint appraisal targeted for late this year. We were also active in the recent Gulf of Mexico lease sale where we were the apparent high bidder on 6 blocks.","Turning to our international activities. I'll begin in the Eastern Mediterranean. We've been working hard to bring on additional supplies of natural gas. During the quarter, we completed and started production from 2 wells in the Noa field. We also recently started producing from our well in the Pinnacles field. Overall, we expect to hold our Israel gross production between 200 million and 250 million cubic feet per day over the third quarter as we continue to manage our volumes until Tamar comes online.","Our development plans at Tamar are progressing thing on schedule for sales to commence next April. Well completions are continuing, and we recently completed a flowback test. The deck and jacket fabrications are over 95% complete and progressing toward platform installation later this year. We plan to begin commissioning Tamar in the fourth quarter. As Chuck mentioned, finalizing all approvals of the Israel Electric contract and the continuing increased gas demand in the country sets us up well for our 2013 deliveries.","At Leviathan, we completed a successful gas flow test on the #1 well and are evaluating drilling an appraisal well in the fourth quarter. We are targeting initial Leviathan production to support the growing domestic market in the 2016 time frame, followed by an export project. We've been pleased with the interest shown in our Leviathan marketing effort, and we continue to move toward a new partner announcement by year-end.","In West Africa, we continue to see great results from Aseng. It produced an average of 63,000 barrels per day throughout the second quarter and hit a daily peak rate of just under 70,000 barrels per day. We initially brought production on at 50,000 barrels per day, and the strong reservoir performance has allowed us to continue ramping up production. We plan to produce the field at a gross rate of 65,000 to 70,000 barrels per day through the third quarter. By the end of the second quarter, we had already produced nearly 14 million barrels of oil.","We're also making good progress on our Alen project. All major platform fabrication has been delivered, and power generation modules and gas compressors have been installed. The subsea platform, well operations and flow line installations are complete, and the project remains on schedule. We believe there are significant prospectivity remaining in our current lease positions  offshore Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon. As Chuck mentioned, we have exploration drilling starting this quarter and continuing through 2013.","Before we open the call to questions, let me touch upon our expectations for next quarter's volumes. As I mentioned in our last earnings call, we expect tremendous growth from our core operations during the second half of 2012. For the third quarter, we estimate volumes to be 242,000 to 250,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 10% from second quarter based on the midpoint. On supplemental Slide 5, we show the adjustments to the range, which include announced U.S. asset sales and discontinued operations.","Onshore volumes will continue to grow with the DJ Basin activity and the initiation of our wet gas production in the Marcellus. Our Gulf of Mexico production will also be up with our first full quarter impact from Galapagos. Internationally, we expect West Africa sales to remain strong and volumes in Israel should reflect the added deliveries from Noa and Pinnacles.","The significant growth in the second half of this year is the initial springboard for our 5-year average annual growth rate of 17% we highlighted late last year. Combined with the ongoing exploration and appraisal activities and the continued progress on the major 2013 startups for Tamar and Alen, this is an extremely active and exciting time for Noble Energy.","So now we'd like to go ahead and open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First, can you just talk to the cost trends that you're seeing drilling horizontal wells in both the Marcellus and in Wattenberg and whether you're seeing any changes per lateral foot or any atrocities from using those longer laterals, et cetera?","Charles D. Davidson","Yes, Brian, I think what you're -- initial results are very encouraging. What the target is, is as you continue to move out beyond these 4,000 to 5,000 foot horizontal laterals, you're really looking for something in a 2:1 ratio of improvement of recovery versus costs, and that's kind of what we've been seeing so far. So I think the real question is, is that proportional as you continue to move out from, say, 4,000 to 5,000 feet to 8,000 to 9,000. So that's really the price that you're looking for there. And as we've noted a number of times, especially where we're deep in the program in the Niobrara, the big driver of efficiency has been that our drill times have been coming down steadily, and so now we're -- it's one of the reasons that our well count for this year is moving up instead of -- we've just been able to drill the wells more quickly.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If we look at EUR charts that you have in your presentation. I mean, it does look like some of the wells that you've drilled so far are actually above your revised EUR, your revised type curves. Is that just conservatism? Or do you feel like you've drilled better wells than what you expect to have on average?","Charles D. Davidson","I think we're really starting -- continuing to improve and learn as we go out here. Part of it is how your bring the wells on production and how you maximize performance, especially in the early time period of the wells that sets you up for better recovery over the longer time period. I'd say on those charts, none of those reflect the extended lateral piece. For example, the charts on Wattenberg, those are those 4,000 to 5,000 foot operations. So I think we're just continuing to improve as we go, and we're continuing to learn as we go as you would expect in these types of plays, and I'd say we're probably further along in the DJ Basin than we are in the Marcellus.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And lastly, on Israel, can you put any more color on -- I guess, any greater certainty, if you have it, for where Leviathan facility, the LNG facility, would be located. And then as you speak with potential partners, whether there are specific key milestones that you all need to see from the government before moving forward.","David L. Stover","I think, Brian, I think the real key indication we're going to see is from the policy committee that is looking at their requirements for an LNG exports from Israeli gas, and of course, we've talked to them about the benefits of having perhaps a single combined facility in the Eastern Mediterranean rather than several. So I think the key milestones there will be the policy committee's report, which we do expect to have shortly. On our side of it though, we have as I mentioned, we've done a lot of pre-FEED work on a number of sites, Cyprus as well as Israel, also looking at floating LNG as well. So we've got a lot of pieces moving forward. Key milestones going forward are certainly the policy report, the work that we're doing to solicit a partner, which, again, that progress is we're making nice progress there. And hopefully, we'll be announcing something by the end of the year. We're getting a number of companies interested that have gone through the data room. And then in parallel with all that, we're doing some of this early engineering work on a number of options.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Leo Mariani with RBC Capital.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just curious about the downtime you saw in the second quarter in the DJ. Is that something you think is going to persist into the second half? And just curious if you've seen similar downtime in July.","Charles D. Davidson","I think most of that was back in April, Leo, with some of the facility maintenance and some of the downtime on the facilities. More of what the recent has been in June, maybe a little bit in the early July, has been the hotter weather. It's been extremely warm up there, I think approaching 100, is the third part of it. And when you get that really warm weather, it kind of ends up backing of some pressure. You end up with a little higher pressures in the system out there. So we get some relief from the weather, we'll be okay.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So no problem selling any of your NGLs at this point?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, the early -- one of the third-party downtime was with the problem with a fractionator. And so far our volumes -- of course, we go through a third-party processor as well, and those volumes have been moving out. We all know that the NGL market is very soft. Ethane, of course, is very, very soft, so we'll see it going on. But it's -- again, it's from our business, NGLs is not a huge part of our business so any impacts don't appear to be material to us at this time.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got you. And I guess just in terms of Israel, where is your current Mari-B production? And what do you expect Pinnacles to add as well?","David L. Stover","Yes. I mentioned in the call, for the quarter we'll be running in that 200 to 250 range total. I think when you look at capacity, Mari, we've been trying to keep that in the 75 to 100 range. Noa has had capacity to get up to 100, but -- so we'll be in that 70 to 100 range on that, and Pinnacles is probably in the 50 to 75 range. So just putting all those pieces together, we'll run in that 200 to 250 for the quarter.","Charles D. Davidson","Some of these components may have the capability to deliver at higher rates, but as -- I know you're well familiar with the story is, we are managing this, the bridge, all the way to next April when we expect Tamar to come on. So we're trying not to get into a position where we have a sudden depletion and then, say, the winter months that we don't have any gas to sell. So it's very much a managed sales process right now.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Lively with Tudor, Pickering & Holt.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Can you guys remind us what you are looking to sell or what you're looking to do with the Leviathan data room?","Charles D. Davidson","Yes. The Leviathan data room is open for companies who are -- we have asked to consider coming in as a partner in the development of Leviathan and potentially an export project in the Eastern Med later on. So these are companies who are reviewing the data because the anticipated transaction would be that they would be purchasing an interest in the Leviathan field.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up to an earlier question. On your Q3 guidance, how have you risked back for potential hurricane downtime? And are there any other planned maintenance downtimes you see across the portfolio?","David L. Stover","Yes. In both third quarter and fourth quarter, we put hurricane downtime risking in there. I don't remember exact Levi amount, but it's 10% or so, I think, of the volume for the quarter in the Deepwater. So that's part of what we go into the year budgeting for and planning for some downtime for third and fourth quarter. And I don't think we really have any planned maintenance of any significance in the third quarter right now. We finished up the West Africa maintenance early in the year, so we'll just knock on wood that some unplanned maintenance doesn't come up.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly on Gunflint. If I recall correctly, the range you guys had around it was 70 million to maybe 500 million-plus barrels. With what you've seen to date and with plans to drill another well, what are initial thoughts on timing to sales and maybe development costs that we should be thinking about incorporating as we build out a model around that?","Charles D. Davidson","Dave and I will tag team on that. What we're seeing right now is we could see a combination process on the development of Gunflint, and we've shown some of the mapping before. But it looks like we've got a nice 4-way structure there based on the original well and this appraisal well we've drilled. And as we've mentioned on the call, we've got another well to the south that we wanted to drill. But you could anticipate now that one possibility is to go forward with a subsea tieback on the 4-way while there's probably still some exploration that needs to be done in the deeper zones. That's one possibility, but we're still working with our partners. Some of our partners would say that maybe there's a possibility this could still be a single-hosted facility, and they'd like to see the results of this next appraisal well. But as you know, if it turns out to be a subsea tieback, that could possibly shorten, maybe by a year, the production timing as to when first production would come. But we'll know more after the next appraisal well. And I know you asked about cost, but it's way too premature to figure that out at this point.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that. And then maybe switching back over to the DJ Basin and the down spacing program, and I apologize if I missed this. But based on the results you're seeing right now, what's kind of anticipated timing to calling maybe victory to down spacing and what would that mean to total recoverable reserves in that area?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think the key is where we end up on this 40-acre type pattern and a big key to that, Dave, is this next pilot that we're doing that we're actually just starting the drilling now. So we won't start really seeing production from this next pilot until probably late in the quarter. So 2 things. We'll continue to monitor the wells that we had essentially set up on 40-acre spacing in the previous pilot that have looked very strong, and I think we included that in the supplemental slide. And you can kind of see that performance relative to some of the other wells. So that's given us some real encouragement. Now we need to get this next 15-well pilot drilled and start to produce from that, and that will give us a lot more data over a wider range here that will -- you'll really start to understand that data a little bit better by the first quarter next year. But if you go back to our resource potential and everything we've talked about, the 40-acre potential is something new. So we just need to get a handle on that, and I'd say it's very encouraging today. But we'll have a lot more information on that the first half of next year.","David L. Stover","And as you could expect, we would -- our thinking is, is that increased density may be more applicable to some parts of the area than others, and we have to figure all that out. But you're on the right track if the resources are going up as we get these positive results from the 40-acre test.","Charles D. Davidson","And I'd say the other thing there. We're testing some different things on vertical recovery there with this new pilot too. That will all enter into that picture. We kind of laid that out on the supplemental slide also.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I had a question on Leviathan. What fraction of Leviathan's reserves have to go to the export market to make the project viable?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, with Leviathan at 17 TCF, within almost any range, you've got more than enough resource. And I'm talking about -- the general discussion in Israel, so far, has been maybe roughly half, but we'll see what the final policy decision is on that. So you've got, even at half, you've got 8 or 9 TCF that's available, which is enough to support a project, but I think what's more important here is to try to make sure you've got an efficient project for the Eastern Med because of the additional resources at Cyprus. And there will be -- under this policy there will probably be several fields that will be set up to allow for exports. It won't just be Leviathan. So we're trying to see if we can to make sure that this thing is as efficient as possible, hopefully a single point location for exports. There may be a land base, as well as a floating. But I don't think right now we're as concerned about the amount of gas that's available for export. We certainly would like to see as much as possible because it makes a project more efficient, but we just want to make sure the logistics work out.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","But if that number is 25% or 0% that's allowed to export, does the project still work?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, it depends on how much you add at Cyprus because this is not necessarily just a single field. But I've not heard of any numbers that low. So that's just kind of speculating and is beyond what any speculations occurred in Israel.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple -- let me just go back to the Wattenberg. I know it sounds like you have got additional capacity coming on in 2013 as far as processing and getting some of the third party processing capacity up. But can you talk about between now and then -- I mean, you're ramping activity. I would say Anadarko is ramping and others. But it seems to be getting pretty tight as far as the takeaway capacity until '13, and yet you're still adding the rigs in the back half of the year. So can you just talk about what we're up against for the next 2 or 3 quarters as far as getting [indiscernible]?","David L. Stover","Keeping an eye on capacity and takeaway and managing the field to in tune with that. Now a lot of our effort, I'd say the majority, almost all of our effort has been in the northern part of the field, moving up into northern Colorado, which is the area we're continuing to delineate. And that's where we have the real high oil percentage, if you will. I think if you get the northern part of the field up in northern Colorado, we're up to 80% oil, 80% crude up there. So it minimizes the amount of gas you have to handle as part of that, while your allowing some of this additional processing, this expansion to catch up with that. So I think we've managed the field operations to be in sync with the capacity expectations, and what we see going forward with a large part of that being the focus in the northern part where you have the high crude content. Again, the whole idea is to stay a year or 2 ahead of this with the third-party processors to make sure that everything syncs up with our drilling schedule.","Charles D. Davidson","And at the same time, as Dave, I think, mentioned in the call, is that we're winding down rapidly the vertical program. A lot of that vertical program was in some of the higher GOR areas with the refracs and with the drilling of vertical wells. So it's managing all the pieces.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. One final question. Just as I look -- again, back to the DJ, can you guys talk about -- as you look to the Codell, but can you talk about any results in the Codell? As far as I know, there's been some chatter out there from some other players. And then have you done anything with the Greenhorn? And do you think it's prospective?","David L. Stover","Yes. I'd say first on the Codell, we've done a few tests on the Codell. And if you look at this 15-well pilot, we've got a couple more tests that we're going to do on the Codell. So it's something that still continues to interest us, and we've seen some encouraging results on the tests we've done now. Whether it's something that can be drilled horizontally across the whole field, I don't know. That's part of as Chuck alluded to earlier that some of these things may apply to different parts of the field differently. On other formations like the Greenhorn, I'd say they're kind of secondary behind what we're doing with the Niobrara and Codell here at this point. Still, it's somethings we're continuing to look at. We'll do some, what I would call exploratory work on some of that over the next year or so, but this is just a basin with a lot of resources and a lot of things that have shown hydrocarbons, and it's just something else that's further back in the queue right now.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. As far as the baseball analogy, what inning would you say you're in as far as field development and as far as climbing that learning curve?","David L. Stover","In -- I'd say in the Niobrara, we're probably in, I'd say, third inning or so of that as far as the horizontal Niobrara, of what we still have in front of us. And some of those other formations like Greenhorn and stuff, I'm not even sure we've stepped up to bat yet.","Charles D. Davidson","I think the other thing, just to add to it, is if you look up the history of Wattenberg, which goes back into around 1970, this field has reinvented itself a number of times. But this one is stunning. The horizontal development in this field is truly stunning, and we're probably cautious about assuming we know everything there is to know here. And I think Dave's got it pegged just right, is that for every quarter, we're setting new records, and we're learning new things. And fortunately, most of it has been extremely positive.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Hall with Robert W. Baird.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just had, I guess, another couple of questions on the DJ program. On the 40-acre pilot, you highlighted that the 40-acre test seemed to be performing better. Any thoughts as to maybe what's driving that, why you'd see better results from the 40 as opposed to the 80?","David L. Stover","I mean, one of the theories, Michael, is that really the more you break this rock up and the more you get it connected, the more recovery you're going to get out of this just as tight as this formation is. So what you start to see as you get down to the smaller spacing is you start to get this a little better connected and then more broken up. And with the brittleness here, that may lead to just better recovery overall.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And what do you think those recoveries are trending versus any internal target picture?","David L. Stover","I mean, if you go back to what we said when we started this on 160-acre horizontal Niobrara, based on our original type curves we're thinking about 5% incremental recovery for that. So as you keep cutting that in half, you're looking at 5% potential incremental price for each reduction in spacing. So I mean, that's kind of the price we're looking at.","Charles D. Davidson","Yes. We're absolutely -- in terms of ultimate goals, we're trying to push this well beyond 10% recovery. But we're still testing what the limit might be. We're also still getting a handle on how much original oil and gas in place there is, as to whether that's still growing as we continue to unlock some of this.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Fair enough, I guess. I'll just ask then what is the kind of current thinking on original oil plays [ph]?","Charles D. Davidson","We've started out and we always said it's kind of 20 million to 30 million barrels per section, per 640. And we haven't really changed that yet. But I'd say it's probably gravitating towards the upper end of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to follow-up, Chuck, a little bit on Leviathan. Obviously, you're waiting a little bit on the export decision. But there seems to be quite at a bit of chatter that you guys have launched a tender for an early production system at Leviathan with perhaps an FPSO in a 1.2 BCF of capacity perhaps coming online in 2016. I just wanted to get your thought process. Obviously, with Tamar that would take a deliverability well above 2 BCF potentially, which is a little bit higher than Israeli consumption. Just wanted to get your thought process behind an early production system at Leviathan.","Charles D. Davidson","Well, first of all, we are pursuing a number of options, and what we're zeroing on is that the demand for gas in Israel has grown substantially. And so we see a bigger market there than probably what we saw at the time we designed Tamar. And so we are looking at a number of options of how we can provide incremental gas to the Israeli market. The other thing is that the early results from the policy committee, and we'll see what their final results are. As suggested, they do want to have split deliveries from fields, so that -- it's not just a matter of Tamar supply the domestic market and Leviathan goes to export, is that we expect that on certainly the larger fields, they will be split between domestic and export. So that means that Leviathan would have a component that goes to domestic, and so we've been doing some work to see how we might develop Leviathan ahead of an export project because an export project is more long term. Ahead of an export project, that could help meet this increased demand of gas from Israel.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And that timing perhaps, Chuck, would 2016 be a possibility?","Charles D. Davidson","Oh yes, that's a possibility. And as you know that getting early production from Leviathan really boosts its value.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right exactly. Okay. Now let me shift gears a little bit in terms of the DJ. At the analyst meeting, you guys had talked about an inventory of about 2,000-plus wells possibly doubling based on down spacing. It seems like you obviously had some good success at 80 acres pushing to 40. When are you thinking -- or what are you thinking about the inventory today? And are you ready to say today, based on initial results of the inventory, it's pushing that 4,000 well number?","David L. Stover","I mean, you're absolutely right in the recognition that the inventory is growing because that inventory we talked about last -- well, I guess, last November or so included some 80 acre but not a lot of 80 acre and also didn't include all this northern Colorado piece. So between getting more comfortable with the 80-acre and the northern Colorado, that's grown the inventory a good bit and now we'll see where we get to on the 40-acre. And again if I go back to 40 acre, to be able to really start to get a good idea of how that's going to fit into the inventory of locations, you're looking at the first half of next year. But it's not unrealistic to be pushing this to 4,000 at some point here.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just one real quick one. It looks like now the rig count is moving to 10 on the horizontal side, which is up a little bit, I think, from 9 previously. Any thoughts as we think about 2013 on how many horizontal rigs you plan to have next year?","David L. Stover","Yes, I mean, we'll continue to work through that here as we get into the budget cycle. I mean, we'll be exiting the year with 10, so that's kind of our starting point. For next year, I think the other thing we'll be looking at pretty hard is the efficiencies because it's not taking as many rigs to drill as many wells, even on the horizontal program. You know what, at one time, we were think it would be 12-day wells to drill or turning out to be under 10 on a lot of this. So that's going to be a factor into the number of rigs that we need. The main thing we'll be working on is how many wells do we want to set ourselves up to drill, horizontal wells, next year. And then we'll back, back into the rig portion.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Malone with Global Hunter Securities.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just want to know, can you give a little more color on the 2 more recent extended reach wells you had in the Wattenberg? You said their actual results were kind of comparable to Wells Ranch. Are you seeing a certain -- a similar EUR potential for those and similar IPs?","David L. Stover","The reason, John, we haven't given more color is we're still less than 30 days in on those. So we don't like to get too far ahead of ourselves. What I would say on that performance within that 30-day time frame, it looked very similar to that type curves of that first extended reach horizontal well. If you go back and look at that. But that's something -- as we get another quarter into this and we can get closer to 120 days, we'll overlay that with the first one and be able to highlight how it compares.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And Marcellus, was it similar targets, similar parameters?","David L. Stover","Right, similar thing. It is just cleaning up now. In fact, I think we just put it on production in the last couple of days.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just on Gunflint. If I recall correctly, you talked in the past about the potential -- the appraisal, you're testing a potential spillover to another structure. From what you're seeing here, can we assume that, that spillover is not the case and it's just flowing closer?","Charles D. Davidson","We're still going through the evaluation of that but we've got -- we had, as I mentioned, there were some zones that had paid down to our current appraisal location because our appraisal is down-dipped moving more into that syncline line, other zones didn't. And then we've got some deeper zones that look kind of interesting. So I'd say the jury is still out in terms of understanding the resources there. But I'll give you that our thinking is there's probably some resources in the 3-way as well but we can't tell from this location what extent that might be.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just one last one. Just anything you can say about Sierra Leone plans there.","Charles D. Davidson","Still early, just in the phase of -- we've just been notified of the license, so there's work to be done. But going into that, we thought that was a very interesting and prospective area, so we're excited to -- it looks like we'll be invited to be a part of the exploration.","David L. Stover","More than 2 blocks it is.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Herrlin with Societe General.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Three quick ones. With Aseng, why the better performance reservoir? Or is it bigger than you thought?","Charles D. Davidson","I think on Aseng it's-- we always knew we had a high quality reservoir, and so it's really that reservoir performance when we look at the drawdown. It's just the wells had the capability to produce within the limits of our -- the boundaries that we set for drawdown on that. And we drilled these wells directionally, horizontally, and it gave us a lot of productivity. And then I think on top of that, John, is the fact that the surface facilities, the FPSO has performed extremely well. So we haven't -- we just haven't seen reservoir bottlenecks or surface bottlenecks. It's allowed us to-- we've been doing some modeling to make sure that we don't do anything that damages the ultimate recovery of the field by going at these higher levels, and everything we see suggests that's not the case.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay, good.With respect to Gunflint, what's your standalone volume threshold, your standalone facility threshold rather than the subsea? 100 million barrels?","David L. Stover","On standalone, it's probably at least 100 million. I mean, I think what we have now you've got 2 wells that we know we can produce and tieback to a subsea at a minimum. And as Chuck said, we'll  continue to evaluate the larger portion of it.","Charles D. Davidson","I think where you -- it's not only volume, but it's also looking at if you do a subsea, how much they can handle, right? And if it gets to where you're leaving a lot of oil in the ground or production capacity back up because they can't handle, then it's starts pushing you toward that standalone as well. So there's a number of moving pieces, and we really need to drill that next well to get a good handle on it, but that's the things being balanced.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. Last one for me is on the Cameroon lockout you described. Could you give a little bit more information on trap types of the 3-way or the 4-way, that sort of thing?","David L. Stover","Well, most of the work that we have been doing in that area, they have stratigraphic boundaries. You've got sand deposits that flow, so you got a structural component and a stratigraphic component. So I wouldn't call it a 4-way by any means.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","It's a combination, Chuck?","Charles D. Davidson","Yes.","Operator","Our last question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","My question was more on especially -- Slide 7 you talked about the different way you're completing these wells on the DJ. And I get on the first bullet point, you're talking about snubbing on completion that you're trying to hold the pressure there. But I'm less clear on how to interpret the early drill-out. And I was hoping maybe, Dave, you could address what you're doing there and how that perhaps fits with the closer 40-acre space that you're doing.","David L. Stover","Yes, I mean, this is just -- in general, what we've moved to is being able to move on these wells quickly after drilling these, go in and clean them out. In a lot of cases, with coiled tubing, go in and clean these out, while you're continuing to flow these back. So you continue to use the reservoir energy and not get in the situation where we started with some of these. When we initially started producing wells up here, we've let them flow and until almost they had died, if they will, or they lost energy. And then you go in and run tubing and move on. What we're doing now is we're starting with these from the beginning, getting them cleaned up early -- getting them cleaned out early, getting them set up so that you can move into production quickly and not be stopping and starting with these wells and playing with the reservoir energy that they have. So you're really using that with you upfront and getting in early, getting coiled tubing in there, running and cleaning out quickly while these wells are flowing and then getting them turned on to production. Again, what we're doing is kind of holding some -- if you will, holding some pressure on these to start to let them come on a little slower than they did initially, not open them full up. And you're starting to see some real benefits from these, especially as you line them out over the first 30 days or so.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","And are you guys still doing the slow packers? Or are you doing the plug and parallel?","Charles D. Davidson","We're using like a packers plug. Then where you have multiple packers so that -- and really where that helps us is in speed of the completion operations so that we can go through a full well stimulation process pretty quickly.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Larson, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","David R. Larson","There's a few more questions on the call there. But we've kind of hit our -- went a little over our time limit. Those that we didn't get to, I'll just remind you that we will be available to take your calls after the call. And then finally, I'd just like to thank everyone for participating in the call today and your interest in Noble Energy. So have a nice day.","Operator","That concludes today's conference.

I would now like to turn the conference over to David Larson. Please go ahead, sir.","David R. Larson","Thanks, April. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Noble Energy's first quarter 2014 earnings call and webcast.","On the call today, we have Chuck Davidson, Chairman and CEO; Dave Stover, President and COO; and Ken Fisher, CFO.","This morning, we issued our first quarter earnings release, which you hopefully have had a chance to review. A few supplemental slides for this call were posted to our website this morning as well. They will be a good reference material for the discussion today.","The agenda for today will begin with Chuck reviewing the quarter and providing an outlook for the remainder of the year. Dave will wrap up with a discussion of our 5 core operational programs. We will leave time for Q&A at the end and plan to complete the call in less than an hour. [Operator Instructions]","I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements as well as references some non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those.","With that, let me turn the call over to Chuck.","Charles D. Davidson","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The opening of 2014 has gone by very quickly, and we've certainly had a good start to the year. As we look across the energy landscape, we continue to believe that Noble's strategy of having a diversified and balanced portfolio, and that's both from a commodity as well as a basin perspective, is the best strategy for sustainable multi-year success.","We also continue to believe that within specific basins, companies such as ourselves, with scale and size that have the ability to implement integrated development plans and those that are best positioned in terms of market access, will differentiate themselves over the long term. That is why I continue to be excited about the portfolio at Noble Energy, which is comprised of 5 core areas with significant and transparent growth profiles for many years into the future. This is combined with a material exploration program that is testing significant opportunities to grow further our already extensive discovered resource base.","So let me start by providing a quick review of our first quarter financial and operational results, and then I'll spend some time talking through our accomplishments to date. Sales volumes for the first quarter were 286,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That's a 16% increase over last year's first quarter and is up 20% after removing noncore asset divestiture impacts. Our volume growth versus last year was driven by our horizontal drilling programs in the United States, as well as from higher volumes in Israel and West Africa due to major project start-ups there at Tamar and Alen during 2013.","Highlighting our performance was the onshore, our U.S. assets, where total horizontal production in the DJ and the Marcellus averaged 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a quarterly milestone for Noble Energy. You can see on Slide 5 that these programs have delivered growth of over 70,000 barrels equivalent per day in just 2 years' time.","20% total organic company growth quarter-over-quarter is a great start and right where we need to be as we move through 2014. We expect this volume growth will continue throughout this year, and Dave will go through our second quarter guidance and expectations for the remainder of the year in just a bit.","Total revenues were up 21% to approximately $1.4 billion for the quarter, supported by strong liquids pricing, both crude and natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices as well.","On the cost side, most items were right in line with our expectations or slightly lower, primarily reflecting continued efficiency gains in the onshore programs. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.82 for the first quarter.","We remain in a very strong financial position. In the first quarter, our capital expenditures of $950 million were just north of our discretionary cash flow for the period. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash, total liquidity of $4.9 billion and net debt-to-book cap ratio of 29%. We're still projecting $4.8 billion to $5 billion in total capital for the year, with a variance on that range associated with a Marcellus carry, which is now in place as Henry Hub has been above $4 since December.","Our Board of Directors recently authorized a 29% increase in our quarterly dividend, reflecting our strong performance and continued confidence in our future growth. This marks the eighth year out of the last 10 where we've increased our dividend to the shareholders.","We've continued our portfolio optimization process, which is focused on divesting the remaining noncore assets in our portfolio. During the first quarter, we closed on the sale of the Tri-State as well as East Texas, North Louisiana assets, and we executed an agreement to sell our Powder River shallow gas assets. In addition, we're finalizing an agreement to sell our assets in China and anticipate closing that transaction in the middle of the year. Combined, these properties were producing in excess of 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the beginning of the year.","As a result of these divestitures, we have adjusted our annual volume guidance, moving the midpoint of the range by 6,000 barrels equivalent per day, which is the full year effect of the divestitures. It's important to point out that the production -- projections that we have for 2015 through 2018 that we provided you last December remain unchanged as we had assumed in those projections that these noncore properties would be divested at the end of this year. This just represents an acceleration of the divestment process that was included in our long-range plan.","We've also made good progress on the next round of major projects. Here, I want to start off on the international side. On March 31, we celebrated the first anniversary of Tamar being online in Israel. In the first year of operation, Tamar produced 256 billion cubic feet of natural gas with an uptime of over 99% and 0 lost time incidents. At times, the field has produced up to the capacity rating of 1 billion cubic feet per day. It's been a tremendous first year of operation at Tamar, with outstanding performance from both the reservoir as well as the facilities. And we are taking Tamar to the next level, with increases in capacity planned for the next 2 years and the first phase of Leviathan then planned for late 2017. Dave will walk through the lineup of how we're increasing our Israel gas deliverability in each of the next 3 years, which will position us with combined capacity between Tamar and the first phase of Leviathan of approximately 3 billion cubic feet per day gross.","At Leviathan, we see nice forward movement in the last few months, following the export policy approval last year. In March, we reached a successful agreement with the Anti-trust Authority and also received a final 30-year development lease for the Leviathan field. The anti-trust agreement will now go through a public hearing period of 60 days before finalization. These are major accomplishments that will allow the development of Leviathan to move forward.","In addition, on the marketing side, we've made some great progress, with multiple regional opportunities continuing to emerge. Discussions with natural gas buyers are well underway, and I would anticipate, over the next 6 months, we will enter into a number of major long-term agreements for Leviathan gas.","Woodside negotiations continue regarding our entry into Leviathan, and we're hopeful an agreement will be reached shortly. In the meantime, we and our existing partners are moving the project forward, targeting a sanction of the first phase late this year.","We've also made great progress on our sanction projects at Big Bend and Gunflint in the Gulf of Mexico, with both on schedule for first production in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We're also preparing for project developments this year for Dantzler in the Gulf of Mexico and Diega in West Africa as well.","In the onshore U.S. programs, we're in the midst of aggressively developing our resources while, at the same time, pursuing additional upside. This is being done through active downspacing programs in both the DJ Basin and the Marcellus.","In the DJ Basin, we've highlighted in the earnings release our first wells testing beyond 16 wells per section, and the results there look very strong.","In addition, we're continuing to maximize the application of extended-reach lateral wells in both plays, which brings forward substantial value through cost efficiencies and enhanced recovery. We've shifted our drilling program in the DJ Basin to a higher percentage of extended-reach wells, based on the positive well performance we're seeing. We are now planning to drill over 90 long-lateral wells this year. That's up from our original plan of 55 wells. This is a major acceleration of value to Noble in the basin.","We've had great results in the Marcellus in the first quarter, including our first reduced stage and cluster completion, which is now on production. In addition, we are close to bringing on production in a number of new areas, and we'll be testing our first lateral downspacing to 500 feet in the near term as well. So we anticipate having a number of new items to discuss with you in the second quarter as well.","Another focus of our 2014 program is to maintain our high-impact strategic exploration program. We're currently drilling the Katmai prospect in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and are preparing for a very active offshore program beginning later this year and into 2015, with multiple tests planned in our existing core areas and new frontier opportunities as well.","Some of these new frontier areas have the potential to be a new core area for Noble Energy. You can see an updated exploration calendar on Slide 6, including multiple wells in the Gulf of Mexico, the Eastern Mediterranean and the Falkland Islands upcoming.","I wanted to spend a minute on the early encouragement we've had with our Wilson play in Northeast Nevada. Following the drilling of 2 wells in the center area of our acreage, we've now completed the first of those wells, which encountered a thick 700-foot primary target interval. We performed completion operations over a gross interval of about 175 feet, recovering oil of 35 degrees API flowing from each of the 3 completion stages. So we're now installing artificial lift, preparing for an extended production test of the well.","In addition, we're currently evaluating the potential for completing our second well in the play. And in the second half of the year, we'll be drilling at least 4 additional wells, 2 to the north and 2 to the south, compared with where our activity has been focused so far. This will give us additional information on the continuity of the output across our acreage. So it's still early, but certainly positive. It's a lot of activity to keep up with, but we're well on our way towards a big growth and an enhanced base of resources for development.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.","David L. Stover","Thanks, Chuck. As you mentioned, the first quarter really sets the stage for a very strong growth profile in 2014. In addition to volume growth, we continue to focus on delivering increasing returns through improved capital and operations efficiencies.","Now I'll provide highlights as I discuss each core area.","Beginning with the DJ Basin, we produced 95,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter, which included the impact of severe winter weather. Colder-than-normal temperatures affected our existing production, and we consumed more of our produced natural gas to keep major facilities running. In addition, the timing of bringing a number of wells online was delayed as a result of the storms and facility upgrades. All of these wells are now online and producing.","We are continuing to operate 10 drilling rigs in the DJ Basin and expect to maintain that level into the third quarter of this year. At that time, one of our DJ rigs will move over for a period to the Northeast Nevada Wilson play to perform additional drilling there. During the first quarter, we spud 67 wells in the DJ with an average lateral length of nearly 5,400 feet. 20% of these wells were extended-reach laterals.","Looking forward for the remainder of this year, our teams are extremely focused on accelerating value and pursuing the upside to our long-range plans. This includes 2 primary activities: downspacing tests, where we are developing beyond our currently assumed 16-well per section spacing plan, and continued optimization of extended-reach laterals in the basin.","With the strong and sustained results we have seen, we're highly focused on maximizing our extended-reach lateral program. You can see the change and acceleration of our long-lateral plans for 2014 on Slide 8, where we have also highlighted the potential economic benefit of these wells. Using our Wells Ranch integrated development plan as an example, long-lateral wells have seen estimated ultimate recovery 2.5x a standard-length well, with a net present value close to 3.5x a standard well.","Concentrating on continuing to improve the returns of the program provides huge value to Noble Energy. On the chart on the left, we have highlighted the shift from normal-length wells to long laterals of greater than 8,000 feet. In total, we are planning for approximately 96 medium or long laterals this year compared to our original plan of closer to 58 wells. Nearly half of these extended-reach laterals will be in Wells Ranch and East Pony, and the remainder focused in the other integrated development plans which are moving towards sanction.","Another upside area is the downspacing program, where more than 40% of our wells are targeting either 24 or 32 wells equivalent per section. The first of these tests included a couple of wells in the core IDP, as seen on Slide 9, and results look stellar. These wells were drilled in the fourth quarter last year at a spacing equivalent of 24 wells per section and have now been on production more than 100 days. They are standard-length lateral wells and are tracking at 600,000 barrel equivalent type curve, consistent with the average of all 5 wells we drilled on the Loeffler pad.","We're excited about these results and look forward to additional downspacing activity in multiple IDPs through the remainder of the year. Positive results will lead to an enhancement in recoverable resources as well as increased efficiencies as we determine the optimal development of our IDPs. Between the downspace activity and extended-reach lateral program, over 60% of our wells are focused on upside in the DJ.","I want to add a few comments on infrastructure in the basin, including both gas processing and oil export, which continue to support our long-term growth plans. The DCP O'Connor plant expansion to 160 million cubic feet per day is underway, and progress is being made on additional projects and sizable new plants that we expect will lead to over 1 billion cubic feet per day of capacity on the DCP system in 2016.","On the oil side, we continue to export over 80% of our volume out of the basin to minimize any in-basin price volatility. Additional capacity is currently under construction, including a doubling of the White Cliffs oil pipeline, which will be online by midyear. Also, the Pony Express oil pipeline is moving forward for early 2015, which will tie in our East Pony integrated development plan and provide additional market outlet for oil.","So I'm excited with where the DJ program is headed. The second half of the year should experience 15% to 20% growth over the first half as winter is behind us, fuel facilities are in place, an increasing percentage of extended-reach laterals come online and gas processing and handling capacity is expanded.","Shifting to the Marcellus. Production averaged 227 million cubic feet equivalent per day, a new quarterly record for Noble Energy. This is more than double our net production from the first quarter of last year. The joint venture is currently running 9 drilling rigs in the play, with a total of 36 wells drilled in the first quarter. Existing production from pads online in Majorsville on the wet side and Southwest Pennsylvania on the dry side continue to exhibit strong performance and relatively shallow decline.","On the wet gas side, we drilled 19 wells in the first quarter, averaging a lateral length of approximately 7,500 feet. Our team continues to drive down well cost through optimized drilling efficiencies, highlighted by the recent drilling of 2 8,000-foot lateral sections in less than 48 hours each. A year ago, these lateral portions would've taken over twice that amount of time.","In our Majorsville integrated development plan area, we anticipate over 60 new wells to commence production this year, including our first operated wells utilizing reduced stage and cluster spacing. Our initial test of this completion design was at the West Finley #3 pad, which commenced production in late March. This 4-well pad, averaging 7,500-foot laterals, came online with a rate of 35 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We utilized this new completion design on one of the wells and are seeing initial rates over 25% higher than similar wells with our standard completion design on the same pad.","In our other operated areas outside of Majorsville, I'm looking forward to our first production from the Oxford\/Pennsboro\/Shirley area, planned to be online in the second quarter. The activity in this area will include our first lateral downspacing test to 500 feet, and we'll continue our testing of the reduced stage and cluster spacing design as well.","We're also excited about first production from our Moundsville area, which is expected to be some of the most liquids-rich opportunities in our acreage.","We anticipate initial drilling this year in the Pittsburgh International Airport area, as well as a number of Burkett interval tests spaced throughout our acreage position. Our first Burkett well continues to be very strong, with over 9 months' production now and the well still producing about 3 million cubic feet per day, essentially flat from start-up.","As we look at the long-term expansion plans for natural gas from the Marcellus, we continue to believe being in the southwestern part of the play is advantageous for market access.","Maintaining market diversification is important. And we have highlighted on Slide 10 the multiple pipelines and pricing points we utilize in combination with our existing firm transportation position. This has helped inflate us on the differential side, and we have not seen some of the larger deducts experienced in the northeast part of the Marcellus. In addition, we have recently secured 200 million cubic feet per day of firm capacity via an open season on Columbia pipes starting in 2017, which will ultimately deliver to the Gulf Coast. And we continue to pursue additional out-of-basin projects as well.","So it's a similar message on both the DJ and Marcellus: strong growth outlook combined with cost and recovery performance focus that will develop material upside. Combined between the 2 areas, I'm expecting around 25% growth in the second half of this year compared to the first half alone. This will provide great momentum for entering 2015 and our 5-year delivery outlook. And as Chuck mentioned, our initial Nevada flow test was encouraging and provides further interest in our onshore activity.","Moving offshore to the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, production during the quarter was 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with about 90% crude and natural gas liquids.","Our development at Big Bend in the Rio Grande area remains on schedule for first production in late 2015, and we recently completed our discovery well.","Dantzler is moving forward as well and will ultimately tie in to the Big Bend infrastructure, with first production targeted in 2016. We anticipate sanctioning Dantzler for development by midyear. We now have 2 rigs working in the Gulf, following the arrival of Atwood Advantage late in the first quarter. This rig will be focused primarily on development work at Dantzler and Gunflint. Between Big Bend, Dantzler and Gunflint, we will double our existing production in the Deepwater Gulf in the next few years.","On the exploration front, we've spud the Katmai prospect in Green Canyon. Our working interest in Katmai is now 50%, with a lower paying interest in the initial well. We should have results in the third quarter, with time to drill another Deepwater Gulf of Mexico exploration well yet this year.","We further expanded our Gulf of Mexico exploration portfolio as apparent high bidder on 12 Deepwater blocks in the March lease sale. Our share of the lease bonus is approximately $16 million, adding multiple new prospects to our already deep exploration inventory. Our Deepwater Gulf program is in great shape, with a robust growth program coming from new production in each of the next 2 years and 4 to 5 new exploration prospects through 2015.","Internationally, production in West Africa was 81,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter and was impacted by underlifting of oil volumes at Alba. During the quarter, Aseng produced approximately 44,000 barrels of oil per day gross. In the second quarter, our sales volumes will be impacted by some maintenance at our methanol facility and Aseng, which will likely keep us in a slightly underlifted position for overall second quarter Equatorial Guinea oil volumes.","Alen continues to perform well and is expected to grow this year to a level of 30,000 to 35,000 barrels per day gross as we finish planned workover activities. Following on our successful appraisal well and flow test, appraisal well and flow test at Diega, we're targeting submitting a plan of development to the government later this year.","We'll be conducting a seismic shoot over our existing blocks, L and I, during the second half of this year to further evaluate exploration potential on -- in EG. This will also help to enhance current development and appraisal work.","In the Eastern Mediterranean, net production was nearly 220 million cubic feet equivalent per day during the first quarter. The expansion of our deliverability remains on schedule, as we're over 50% complete with the Ashdod compression project and are working towards the tie-in of the Tamar Southwest discovery as well. These projects will be the first part of a multi-year step-up in total deliverability from Israel, with the initial expansion next year, adding capacity installation at Tamar in 2016 and then the first phase of Leviathan in late 2017.","On the gas contracting side, we have recently secured 4 new contracts for Tamar, which total over $2 billion in gross sales over the life of the contracts. These include a number of new independent power plants as well as the first export agreement for Tamar to sell gas into Jordan.","I want to echo Chuck's earlier comments on the progress we have seen recently for the first phase of development at Leviathan. Our plan for Phase 1 development is a 1.6 billion cubic foot per day FPSO, which will support additional domestic gas sales in Israel and large regional contracts as well. And beyond Phase 1, we continue pre-FEED work on an FLNG project for Phase 2 of Leviathan.","On the drilling front, we anticipate bringing a rig back into the Eastern Mediterranean late this year or early next year for a multi-year program covering additional Cyprus exploration, deep Mesozoic oil exploration and development activities at Tamar and Leviathan.","On Slide 12, we've provided a walk-through of our total company volumes through the remainder of the year, including the impact of the asset sales mentioned earlier and our anticipated growth projections. As Chuck mentioned, we adjusted the midpoint of our annual volume guidance by 6,000 barrels equivalent per day for the estimated full year impact of the sale of noncore U.S. assets in China. We've also tightened the annual range a bit, leaving the bottom end of our range in place, reflecting our confidence in our delivery through the remainder of the year. Our profile through 2014 is similar to what we delivered last year.","For the second quarter, we have removed 6,000 barrels equivalent per day associated with the Tri-State, East Texas, North Louisiana and Powder River Basin asset sales. From there, we anticipate substantial growth from the DJ and Marcellus. After adjusting our noncore asset divestitures, our second quarter guidance at midpoint is up 16% from the second quarter last year.","Slide 13 will be helpful for those who are modeling our business as it lays out detailed second quarter and full year guidance.","So let me conclude by saying everything is right on track for 2014 in our longer-term plan. We're aggressively pursuing the upside in our onshore programs while adding to our major project portfolio, all with a focus on execution and performance enhancement.","So with that, April, we'd like to now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll first hear from John Malone of Mizuho Securities.","John T. Malone - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of real specific questions for me, Dave. Looking at the Loeffler pad, you talk about the 5 wells you've got there that are going over a 600 MBoe curve. What exactly are you doing at those wells? Is it downspacing and just different completion? Or what's different about those that they stand out?","David L. Stover","It's really an area where last year was probably the first of the program. We went in and started to look at something that would be equivalent to a 24-well per section test, if you will, John. So I mean, that's really what we're doing. That's down in that core area of the field. And so really, what -- we went in and drilled 5 lateral wells, all really normal lateral lengths, if I remember correctly, and they're all performing very well. The main point of that is that the 2 wells that really are testing the equivalent 24-well per section versus 16 are performing every bit as well as the other 3.","John T. Malone - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Right, right. Okay, that's impressive. And then just on the Marcellus as well, just talking about wells, the one which you got the 25% increase in the rate. You mentioned this before in your prepared statement, but can you elaborate on what was done differently there and how replicable it is in the rest of your acreage around Majorsville?","David L. Stover","Yes, that's where we talked about doing this reduced stage and cluster spacing completions, and we've actually -- our JV partner out there has also been doing some of that on the wet gas side, so we're trying to apply this now on -- I mean, on the dry gas side, so we're starting to apply this now on the wet gas area. So this is the first well where we did that, where you're essentially narrowing the area and impacting the area that you're affecting. If you go back to what we've normally been doing on 300-stage lengths with 60-foot cluster spacing, this has taken it down to about 150-foot stage lengths with 30-foot cluster spacing. So you're just getting a lot greater density on the completion there.","John T. Malone - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. What does that do to the CapEx per well? I mean, your 25% increase, how much did the CapEx go up for?","David L. Stover","It's slight increase. I'd have to check on that number.","John T. Malone - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","So not a comparable increase compared to the rates?","David L. Stover","No, no, not anywhere near that. Not anywhere near that.","John T. Malone - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just last question on that, are you changing the amount of proppant you're using? I mean, other than just -- and now you're using the total well. How does that change the proppant use?","David L. Stover","Yes, and we can get you more specifics on that, but it increases the amount of proppant, actually, because you're putting more into a smaller -- into the same area. When you look at the same effective area, you're putting more proppant into that area, and the idea is to create more connection within that same 300-foot space, if you will.","Operator","And next we'll hear from Arun Jayaram of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Chuck, I just wanted to ask you a little bit, given some of the geopolitical tensions in Ukraine, are you having some dialogue regarding some customers regarding gas in the Mediterranean? And how do you think about Cyprus as being a strategic asset, given some of these geopolitical concerns?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think, certainly, with what's happened on the course of the last month or so, there's greater interest in the Mediterranean gas. And clearly, we're seeing, and we've already pointed out, that the regional market there is very strong. There's certainly a lot more work to be done in terms of possible European markets. Yes, there's interest there, but we've also got tremendous interest from our customers in the region, as we've noted, Jordan and the potential for markets in Egypt. Cyprus is -- it nicely blends into the mix, although I think our view still is that Cyprus would be based on an LNG solution. But we have to keep in mind that LNG out of this region can be taken to Europe as well. It doesn't have to be through pipelines. It could be through LNG as well, either floating or land-based. So I guess the bottom line is, yes, we get calls. Yes, we're getting a lot of interest, but right now, we see Leviathan Phase 1 being strongly supported by the regional markets that we've been developing here in the course of the last year.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And Chuck, just to follow up, can you provide us an update? I know you're relatively close to completing the Woodside deal. I know export taxes appear to be the last hurdle. Can you give us an update on what the government wants and kind of where you're at in terms of getting the export tax issue taken care of?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, there's a couple of tax questions that came up on it. And really on the export tax, the government has provided a framework, a template of what they plan to do on that. So we're actually, in terms of moving forward with Woodside and our project, we're fairly comfortable with what that framework is. They still have to put it into final legislation. But that, they actually -- the government published the, I'll call it, the framework or the template for how that would work in late March, just before we were working on some other things. There are some other tax issues that both Woodside and ourselves were working on, and they have to do with how the transaction itself is taxed, proceeds that we receive, how Woodside would be allowed to write off their investments. I think from our perspective, we're satisfied. We've got things sorted out. And I'll leave it to Woodside. I hear encouraging things, but I'll leave it to Woodside to report on where they ended up on their tax issues.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Leo Mariani of RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Guys, just looking at the DJ here. Clearly, it sounds like you lost some pretty significant volumes in the first quarter. Would it be possible for you guys to quantify that all and maybe give us a sense of, now that it's recovered, sort of where current DJ production is currently trending?","David L. Stover","Yes. I think when you look at the first quarter -- and we had anticipated a good bit of that when we put the guidance out, Leo, but it was probably affected, when you look at just the weather portion, 5,000 barrels a day or so. And then the other element of that was it just pushed back some timing on completions and so forth. But like I mentioned, those that had been delayed a little bit, we've now got on. So we're catching up pretty quickly here in April and moving into May. But if you look at it really and you look at first quarter and even second quarter relative to the second half of the year, it's the same type trend we're seeing this year as we saw last year. I mean, you see that seasonality impact there in the first part of the year, and we probably saw even more of it this year.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess in terms of some of the asset sales you all talked about, I guess multiple packages in the U.S., it sounds like some of those closed. It sounds like PRB is closing maybe later this month or something. Do you guys have kind of a proceeds number to Noble for those asset sales at this point?","David L. Stover","It's roughly around $100 million or maybe a little over $100 million for the onshore U.S. portion.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right. And I guess, is China still kind of in negotiations in terms of asset sale price? Just wanted to get a little bit more color in terms of where we're at on that process.","David L. Stover","Yes. We're still working through that. I mean, we're expecting -- and kind of like we laid out there, we expect to have that all completed and make good progress on that towards midyear.","Charles D. Davidson","Yes. That's probably one, until we get it all wrapped up, we wouldn't want to disclose the value on it.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right. And I guess just lastly on the DJ. Any kind of comments on sort of where things are in terms of potential frac regulation that may be coming on, referendum ballots and kind of what you guys are hearing as kind of the latest and greatest out of there?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think, I mean, our communication efforts are fully engaged. As I think many know, we've formed with Anadarko and are getting support from other industry partners; a group, Coloradoans for Responsible Energy Development. And they're fully engaged in terms of communicating the benefits of development in Colorado and as well as a lot of our employee programs. Where we stand right now is there were a number of ballot proposals to go on the ballots that were submitted. They are just now going through the final review process. Some of them have already been pulled down, either duplicative or the sponsors felt they were not necessary. So we should have a better feel in the next few weeks as to what the emerging set will be. But then they still have to collect signatures. And so the deadline for signatures is early August. So we're really not going to know much more until then as to what may be on the ballot and what won't be on the ballot. We have through -- I would say that there have been sponsors who've submitted what I would call 4 countermeasure ballots. These are ones that are more, I think, supportive of development. And so we're going to have to see how those go and see which one of those collect the necessary signatures. But I think we're prepared for a full communication effort. It's going to be a lengthy summer, and we'll see. There's a lot of political dynamics that are happening here, and it changes daily.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Dave Kistler of Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly, just thinking about the DJ Basin and moving to the longer laterals there and the impressive results, can you talk a little bit about how that shift from shorter to longer impacts CapEx in that region and what that does in terms of the production profile? I would suspect longer laterals will lead to a little bit more lumpy production profile going forward.","David L. Stover","And I think you're seeing some of that, Dave, with the bigger increase in the second half of the year as you start to bring more of these longer laterals on. I think on the overall cost basis, we've adjusted the program and relooked at it in such a way that we don't see, actually, any increase to this year's capital program. We're still expecting the same overall cost. It's fewer wells now but actually the same or a little more total footage.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. I appreciate that clarification. And maybe shifting over to Nevada just for a second. You talk about having 700 feet of kind of identified play and completing about 150 feet, if I got those numbers correct. Quality of the crude, 38-degree, did it have a hot paraffin content in it? And did the quality of the crude vary at all amongst the various intervals that you completed?","David L. Stover","I think we picked 3 different intervals to test. And we tested each of those separately, at least initially, to let them flow a little bit, recover some of the fluid and see the oil content come up on each of them. All had very similar, about 35-degree, gravity. It is somewhat waxy, as we expected, so no real surprise there. And now what we're going to do now is put artificial lift on and get an extended production test.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. And just as a standalone on verticals, and I apologize for having a follow-up, but is it commercial on a stand-alone basis just as verticals? Or is this really just way too early to tell? I'm just trying to think about how we extrapolate that in terms of what it could look like longer term.","David L. Stover","Well, and that's some of the information we really need to see from this more extended test here. That's why we're going to put it on pump, get an extended test, Dave, and continue to look at it because that's one of the unknowns yet. Is this going to be potentially a vertical program and will it stand on its own on a vertical basis? Or even as we look at it, do we see enough of a sweet spot or something that we want to target a horizontal program? Those are some of the things we don't know yet, and probably we'll need to get more answers as we see how this play develops and we drill. Probably the next couple of wells, we'll drill a couple wells to the Northeast and a couple wells to the Southwest, and we'll start to get a feel for the continuity of the formation as we move over a wider area, along with getting an extended production test. Both of those things will be really helpful in us determining what type of play we move forward with here.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On the DJ, you talked about the increased use of longer lateral wells there. Can you talk more to both the impact on production you expect that to have and the impact on CapEx? Maybe in the context of Noble it's less material, but one would think there would be a positive impact on both.","David L. Stover","Well, I think longer term, what we're seeing is this should create more value as we go forward, the more we shift the program from normal length to longer length, as long as we can continue to duplicate the kind of results we've seen initially on some of this. But I'd say, for this year, by the way we've timed this in and laid it out, we aren't changing our expectations on volume or capital. As we continue to build the program into more longer laterals, I think it can have a positive impact on both. It definitely has a positive impact on overall, if you will, F&D per well here if you just look at those numbers that we laid out there.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then on the production trajectory you talked about in your slide, if we exclude the impact of seasonally higher Israel gas demand in the second half, can you talk to the key milestones or items on your critical path for you to get that wedge of about 30,000-plus barrels a day of growth in the second half over the second quarter?","David L. Stover","I mean, the biggest portion of that is the onshore programs. I think I mentioned in my discussion that we're expecting about 25% growth from our combined onshore programs, DJ and Marcellus, second half versus first half of the year, though it's going to be bringing on these additional pads in these new wells as we ramp up through the second half of the year here.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, are there a specific couple of dates that we should look for specific pads that are major contributors within the onshore piece, particularly as we look at the DJ? And you had talked to a number of wells that, I think, seem to be drilled or behind pipe.","David L. Stover","No, I mean, if you go back to -- and I think we've shown it on some of our indications of some of the downspacing, that's spread out through these probably mainly the initial 5 IDP areas. I mean, that's where the majority of the drilling is. I think Wells Ranch and East Pony still have a large percentage. But you're breaking out more wells in the Mustang, the Core, the Greeley Crescent IDPs. So it's going to be across all of them.","Charles D. Davidson","Yes. So just a lot of consistent execution on this, Brian. There's no real -- not one particular pad, per se, or anything, which makes it actually good, which also gives us a lot of confidence because it's got a lot of pieces that are contributing and a lot of diversification to it. So we're not at risk by one unique project.","Operator","Our next question comes from Irene Haas of Wunderlich Securities.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Two questions. DJ Basin, we have a lot of great news about the Niobrara in terms of the extended lateral, downspacing and such. How should we think about Codell? Is this a sort of more porous formation? The second question has to do with Marcellus. Are you transporting your extended lateral completion techniques over to Marcellus and getting even better results?","David L. Stover","Okay. Starting with the Codell, Irene, I think we've drilled approximately 14 Codell lateral wells prior to this year. We have probably 10 planned for this year. I think when you look at it, probably 2\/3 of them are in kind of a downspacing pattern test and probably another 3 to 4 are extended-reach laterals. So we'll start to get another mix of Codell like we've done Niobrara on kind of each element of this program. So more to come on that. I think when you look at the discussion on moving extended-reach laterals to the Marcellus, we're doing that. We've been doing that now for the last year. I think our average Marcellus lateral length is now up to 7,000 feet or so. And if you go back to the origin of this play, they probably started at 3,000. We've moved to 5,000. And now we're probably up over 7,000. I think we've actually drilled one pad out there that averaged around 10,000, if I remember. So yes, we're seeing great results out there, and we're moving more of the program to that extended reach. It's a little more complicated there from land issues. But that's where these contiguous acreage positions really pay off, acreage positions with scale.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Well, I apologize if this is a little bit kind of down in the weeds on the left of the pad. But it's really a remarkable result, even compared to -- especially for standard-length laterals versus the type curves you guys put out. And I'm curious, were those all in the same bench of the Niobrara? And is it a useful distinction to make, which bench you're in, in the Niobrara?","David L. Stover","Yes. My impression -- and I'll double check it, Charles. But my impression, it is all in the same bench. And the thing that you have to remember, even in the Niobrara, and you see more consistency in the B but especially in the A and C and so forth, the thickness does change somewhat in different parts of these IDP areas. And down here in the Core, it's probably, I think, on these wells, they're probably 50% liquid content, but they're also -- what was interesting, I think there was some vertical wells around this area, too. So it's very encouraging. But again, it's still early and it's a couple of wells right now. We're anxious to get a number more of additional of these downspacing tests in place and see some results second half of the year on a number of other patterns here.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And then shifting over to your Eastern Med stuff, I recognize that it's difficult to speak about someone else's negotiation going on. But could you maybe offer what your characterization would be of this kind of protracted negotiation? Is this more along the lines of the final haggling at the stall in a Middle Eastern bazaar? Or is this the sort of thing that Woodside might really just might decide they don't get the tax treatment they'd like and walk?","Charles D. Davidson","I think right now, what held up our final signing late last month was primarily an unresolved tax issue that Woodside had with the state of Israel, and they've continued with those discussions. And I'm very encouraged by what I hear. But again, as I noted earlier, I'll leave that to Woodside to discuss what final treatment they are looking for there. But this is complicated. We had a number of things that we had to resolve as well in terms of how this transaction would be taxed for us, and we did get those resolved. There have also been, as I point out, a huge number of accomplishments that were achieved. The resolution of the antitrust issue, which is now out for public comment, was a big hurdle that we needed to make sure that we had taken care of that because it paves the way for us to develop Leviathan and to market Leviathan gas in Israel. We've now got a final lease. And you say, \"What's important about that?\" That gives us the development plan. That basically gives us the roadmap of what is going to be approved by the petroleum ministry in terms of the development of Leviathan, so it allows us to move forward on that. So there have been a number of things as well as moving forward on the marketing side. So I'm really encouraged. And as far as the transaction with Woodside, this is -- it's down to the fine details. And hopefully, again, it will get resolved. We would like to have them as a partner as a part of this project. But right now, with all of the other things that have been cleared out, we and our existing partners are moving forward, and we're starting to take steps to make sure that we can deliver this project.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gail Nicholson of KLR Group.","Gail A. Nicholson - KLR Group Holdings, LLC, Research Division","Just a real quick question. When we look at the downspacing tests, are any of the downspacing tests in the Niobrara utilizing extended-reach laterals? Or are they all standard lengths at this point?","David L. Stover","Yes. There are a few that are -- will use some extended-reach laterals. So you'll have a test of both concepts, I guess, if you will, on some equivalent patterns.","Operator","Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I've got a couple of quick ones, if I may. First of all, Dave, it's only 4 months since you did your Analyst Day, and you've already more than doubled the plan on long laterals. I'm just wondering what -- how is the thought process changing in terms of how much further and how much more running room you've got to really pick up the pace of long laterals as opposed to the standards? And I've got a follow-up, please.","David L. Stover","Yes, I mean, to that point, Doug, we actually started last year, even as we were reporting the budget, to put plans in place to look at how could we increase the number of long laterals if it made sense and we continued to see the continued performance that we've been seeing. So on that regard, as we got into the year and started to look at the year and we got into the first quarter, we started to ask the question of how could we continue to expand that, not only in Wells Ranch and East Pony but into some of these other IDP areas, and building on some of these things, like some of those good results we saw out at Mustang and so forth. So we started to push the folks a little more to see if we couldn't shift the programs some to mix in a larger number of extended-reach laterals because the opportunity and the economic value is just so great, that potential there. So we wanted to get a more extensive test around the field on some of these areas. And so the team did a great job at shifting the program and building a lot more of that into there because we kept pushing how many could we accelerate into this year.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So we obviously -- we're all trying to figure out what the value of this asset is. And obviously, it's a huge difference between the long and the under the standard, I guess. So what I'm really trying to understand is, how should we think about how you develop the asset going forward? I mean, is this going to be -- is it kind of difficult to plan it and predict it? Or is it something that's just going to evolve, you know what I mean? Or should we think of more ratable kind of balance between activity between the 2 types of wells?","David L. Stover","Well, I think we'll start to get an even better idea as we go through this year, when you look at all the different things we're developing and testing this year. And we'll update that at the end of the year as based on the results we're seeing. But we're testing a number of different intervals. We're testing a number of different spacing. And you look at the long lateral, I think when we talked about what we sanctioned for our East Pony development, for example, we talked about the fact that we were going to continue to gravitate to more longer laterals. In fact, I think on the East Pony sanction, we discussed the fact that we could see that potentially being about 50% of those lateral wells being extended-reach laterals, whether it's at 7,000 to 9,000. So that's going to continue to evolve. I think also digging through my notes here, I'm looking at the potential. And just some of these different horizons, as we continue to focus on vertical recovery here, will be interesting to develop. For example, looking back through here, the Loeffler pad was actually the Niobrara C interval. All 5 of those wells were actually in the C. Those weren't even in the B interval. So I mean, it's just another data point. And we'll continue to get many data points through the year that will continue to build this plan.","Charles D. Davidson","Yes. Doug, I think I'd just also kind of just add one more thing. And that is, as we've kind of noted in the past, when we lay out a plan, like in last December, it's based on what we know at that time. We try to be very careful about not speculating where it might go and trying to roll some of that in. So generally, we are laying out a plan that we think is very deliverable that's got, certainly, upside to it. And these long laterals, and as you're starting to now and we're starting to see the increased density, are providing some really good hints that we need to keep pushing the program in that way. And that's going to mean that there will be an evolving growth. And as we say, this should certainly lead to some great improvement in value and, certainly, resources and opportunities going forward.","David L. Stover","But again, all of that overlaying with this thought process of treating these like major projects, laying them out in integrated development plans with large central facilities, minimizing the surface footprint and tying in the whole pipeline network to all these pads and wells. So it needs to be a well-thought-out plan, and this is all contributing to how we're going to lay it out.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from David Heikkinen of Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Just a question. As you think about accessing the Egyptian market, both the local markets and ability to access BG's underutilized LNG export facility, do you have any thoughts or comments you can provide around that as an option for East Med gas?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, it's certainly a very real option. We're at the early stages. But clearly -- and you really highlighted what the big opportunity is, and that is the underutilized existing LNG plants that are in Egypt. And you've got 2 major opportunities there with the BG facilities as well as Uni\u00f3n Fenosa. And so those discussions are underway. I mean, the Tamar partners are actually pursuing one of the options and the Leviathan partners are pursuing the other. The huge value here is that these are LNG plants that need natural gas. They're built. They're operational. So really it's your critical path. In the case of Leviathan, the critical path is developing Leviathan and the connection, which would probably be a new pipeline offshore to deliver the gas over there. But you don't have to wait for a market development or you don't have to wait for an LNG plant to be built. So it's one of the things that we see as the emerging regional markets that have really created some uplift in value.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","And how -- as I think about the diversity of kind of security of pipeline, 2 offshore pipelines, 1 that goes onshore to Israel and 1 that goes to Egypt, how do you think about security for basically offtake as well and the value of that? And then how would the Israeli kind of overall market and export think about it as well?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think certainly, our view is that as you look at -- for instance, Egypt having offshore pipelines provides a lot of security from the standpoint of its -- we just -- for obvious reasons. Physically, you're in deepwater, and it's a better asset. I think in the case of, for instance, the Jordan market, we'll be utilizing the existing Israel pipeline infrastructure. They've got a small segment that they need to connect over to Jordan, but it's using the Israel onshore system. So I think the key in this whole market is diversification, looking at multiple outlets, looking at multiple delivery points to both the onshore Israel as well as you look at these outside regional markets as well. I think also is just going beyond Phase 1 of Leviathan, we have to keep in mind also there's an LNG phase of the project, a potentially floating LNG, which then gives you access to global markets. That's in a second phase, but it's certainly very real because we've got the resources to support all of this.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Dan McSpirit of BMO Capital Markets.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And I have just one. Turning to the Appalachian basin, you state that firm transportation is expected to increase, what is it, by 500 million a day in 2017? Can you review how much of that takes gas out of the basin, whether to the Gulf Coast or elsewhere?","David L. Stover","Yes, Dan. I think I mentioned around 200 million a day for our share that would actually move gas out of the basin, most likely to the Gulf Coast.","David R. Larson","April, this is David.

I would now like to turn the call over to David Larson. Please go ahead, sir.","David R. Larson","Thanks, Celia. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Noble Energy's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2011 Earnings Call and Webcast. On the call today, we have Chuck Davidson, Chairman and CEO; Dave Stover, President and COO; and Ken Fisher, CFO.","This morning, we issued 2 news releases, one covering the fourth quarter and full-year earnings, and the second one was for our 2012 guidance. Later today, we expect to be filing our 10-K with the SEC, and it will be available on our website.","The agenda for today will include -- will begin with Chuck discussing final fourth quarter 2011 results and then will highlight our capital and guidance expectations for 2012. Dave will then give some detailed overview of our operational programs, including a summary of year-end reserves and a breakdown of our expected activity levels for the current year. We will leave time for Q&A at the end and plan to wrap up the call in less than an hour. [Operator Instructions] Should you have any questions that we don't get to this morning, please don't hesitate to give us a call, and we'll do the best we can answering you.","I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains projections and forward-looking statements based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. We provide no assurances on these statements as a number of factors and uncertainties could cause actual results in the future periods to differ materially from what we discuss today. You should read our full disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that influence our business. ","We'll reference certain non-GAAP financial measures here today such as adjusted net income or discretionary cash flow. When we refer to these items, it's because we believe they are good metrics to use in evaluating the company's performance. Be sure to see the reconciliation in our earnings release tables.","With that, let me turn the call over to Chuck.","Charles D. Davidson","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start out with a brief wrap-up on 2011 and then go into an overview of our plans for this year. As David said, Dave Stover will follow up with the operational highlights, as well as details on our planned work in each of our 5 core areas in 2012.","I have to say up front that 2012 is the year that certainly I've been waiting for, and I think I can speak for the rest of the Noble Energy team as well on that. You can see early indications why when you look at our fourth quarter results, results that included the start-up of Aseng, the first of many major projects that we're pursuing globally; it also included the first contributions from our newly added Marcellus Joint Venture; and another quarter, actually our third quarter in a row, of record DJ Basin production, driven by outstanding horizontal Niobrara results; and finally, the announcement just before the end of the year of yet another major gas discovery in the Eastern Mediterranean, in Cyprus.","All great results but not the only reasons I'm excited about 2012. This year marks the beginning of a multi-year period of growth for Noble Energy, driven by major projects and programs in each of our 5 core areas. As we announced at our Analyst Day back in November, we now expect the annual production growth over the next 5 years to average 17% per year. On a debt adjusted per share basis, we expect not only production but cash flow and reserves to grow at double-digit rates over the next 5 years.","Starting in 2012, we begin realizing the benefits from multiple years of exploration success and the strength, balance and diversity of our portfolio. The early start-up of Aseng offshore Equatorial Guinea clearly demonstrated our ability to deliver on projects of significant magnitude. Projects of this scale would not have been possible for us several years ago, but they're well within our capabilities today, both technically and financially. Our exceptional project execution, whether in the international deepwater such as Aseng or onshore U.S. such as the Wattenberg horizontal Niobrara, now parallels our best-in-class exploration program and gives us good reason to be confident about our future growth.","With Aseng now onstream and Galapagos ready to go shortly in 2012, Tamar in early 2013, Alen in late 2013, followed by many other developments, our major exploration discoveries are now turning into real production, cash flow and profitable growth with growing margins."," While our guidance for 2012 suggests strong overall growth this year of 13%, the real headline is that with Aseng, Galapagos and the Niobrara, we expect growth in oil production this year of 40% over 2011. At today's oil prices, that will drive real value growth, and that really gets us excited.","2012 -- excuse me, 2011 was a year in which Noble Energy experienced many unique achievements. Early in the year, we received the first post-moratorium drilling permit in the Gulf of Mexico, which resulted in the discovery of Santiago. Our Eastern Mediterranean portfolio was expanded through exploration, especially with the sizable discovery offshore Cyprus, and enhanced through our successful appraisals of Tamar and Leviathan. With the Tanin discovery announcement recently, we've now discovered approximately 35 trillion cubic feet of gross mean resources in the greater Levant Basin.","In our horizontal Niobrara program, we doubled our activity in 2011, which allowed us to de-risk the Wattenberg Niobrara resources and to extend the field's economic area by over 60%. We've also added a fifth core area to our portfolio through the joint venture with CONSOL Energy in the Marcellus, one of the lowest cost domestic gas plays, which further deepens and diversifies our global project inventory. And I'll talk more about the Marcellus later, as will Dave.","As you can see, we accomplished a tremendous amount in 2011, and we did it while maintaining our financial discipline and strong returns. We further enhanced our liquidity and lengthened our debt maturities by successfully completing 2 public debt offerings. Our most recent debt offering included a 10-year $1 billion unsecured note at a very favorable interest rate of 4.15%. We ended the year with a liquidity of $4.5 billion, $1.5 billion in cash and equivalents and $3 billion available on our new credit facility.","Our press release also included a summary on year-end proven reserves. We ended the year with record reserves of over 1.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, an increase of 11% from last year. All-in replacement of production totaled approximately 245%. Major reserve additions were in the Marcellus, the DJ Basin and Tamar offshore Israel. We still have another 3.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent of discovered unbooked resources, a majority of which we expect to convert to proved reserves over the next several years.","I will be reporting in our 10-K and SEC 10 valuation for year-end 2011 of $13.3 billion. That's an increase of just over 45% from last year. The increase was driven by our Marcellus acquisition, additional reserves from Niobrara and Tamar and higher oil prices. In the past 2 years, our SEC 10 value has climbed from $4.9 billion at the end of 2009 to the $13.3 billion at the end of last year, representing an increase of nearly 170% over the 2-year period. Although not a perfect measure, this increase does indicate the tremendous progress we're making in shifting unproven resources to proven reserves and the completion of major projects, all of which leads to growth and value in our company.","In the fourth quarter, our performance was demonstrated by strong metrics. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $211 million or $1.18 per share diluted. After removing adjustment items, including an asset impairment charge and an unrealized loss on commodity derivative hedges. As noted in our press release, the fourth quarter included $41 million of other operating costs, mostly due to the disposal of surplus inventory and reserves for legal settlements. The quarter also included $22 million of deferred compensation charges. All of these were essentially non-cash charges. Discretionary cash flow for the quarter was $677 million.","The asset impairment charges totaled $620 million and relate to various non-core onshore U.S. dry gas assets. They are a result of declining domestic natural gas prices that are in areas such as Piceance and Tri-State. These assets have received limited investment dollars as we have continued to focus our investment programs, primarily on oil or liquids-rich opportunities rather than the dry gas regions.","Sales volumes for the quarter averaged a record 233,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was an 8% increase over the fourth quarter 2010, excluding volumes from Ecuador, which we exited in 2011. Oil production was up 11% over the prior year's quarter, driven by the early start-up at Aseng and growth in the horizontal Niobrara. ","Revenue for the quarter was $985 million. That's up 25% from the fourth quarter of last year. The revenue growth was almost entirely driven by our liquid sales, which were supported by higher volumes and strong prices. The stronger oil volumes, coupled with their increased prices, helped grow margins even though we had higher lease operating expense and DD&A rates. Our full-year sales volumes were 222,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, at the high end of the adjusted guidance we provided last quarter and a record in terms of annual sales volumes for the company. ","Our capital plan for 2012 is set at $3.5 billion, which is slightly below the outlook we gave at our analyst conference in November. In this dynamic environment, there are quite a few moving pieces, and we continue to reallocate capital to the best projects in our diverse portfolio. Over 50% of the capital spending supports developments of our onshore U.S. properties. ","In Marcellus, our economics are fully aligned with our partner, CONSOL Energy, in the current low price natural gas environment, and we share a similar returns-based approach in capital allocation. We have jointly decided to slow the pace of development in the dry gas regions of the field, and as a result have cut around 40 wells from the original 2012 drilling plan. Dave will give you more details later.","The reduction in the Marcellus drilling, coupled with the fact that the deal's low-gas price circuit breaker was tripped, which deferred the drilling promote this year, has reduced Noble Energy's net 2012 investment in the Marcellus by approximately $250 million. Noble Energy has reallocated a portion of this capital with a higher return horizontal Niobrara program to Wattenberg. ","We continue to transition more of our vertical Wattenberg development to horizontal drilling, which offers better recoveries and returns. We are at full development mode in this field, while we continue to expand our program into Northern Colorado. And again, Dave will provide you some specific data points that attest to the size and scope of our operations there.","The next largest segment of our capital program comprises our international portfolio and accounts for approximately 40% of our planned investment in 2012. The funds there largely support the development work on Tamar  and Alen, as well as continued exploration in the Eastern Mediterranean  and West Africa.","And in our final area, the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we'll invest approximately 7% of our capital in both development and exploration programs.","Overall, our exploration encompasses about 16% of this year's capital program. The exploration program remained a big driver of our success, and we actively search for material opportunities with running room. The targeted exploration and appraisal wells are the primary mechanism by which we build our pipeline of future development projects. We tend to -- we intend to drill exploration wells in West Africa, Eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf of Mexico this year. We believe our core areas have significant growth potential, but we will also continue our efforts as a global explorer to look for other attractive opportunities as well.","Our 2012 sales volume guidance ranges from 244,000 to 256,000 barrels of oil equivalent. The midpoint of this range represent a 13% growth from 2011. This is very close to what we presented in November, with the only significant difference being we trimmed our outlook for Mari-B in Israel due to the high depletion that we experienced there last year.","The increased crude and condensate production is expected to account for 95% of our growth this year as we will have a full year of production from Aseng, new crude production from South Raton and Galapagos in the Gulf of Mexico and growing crude and condensate production from the DJ Basin in 2012. The overall liquids growth is expected to change our product mix to approximately 46% crude condensate and natural gas liquids, 31% natural gas and 23% international gas. This split does not account for any anticipated divestments of our non-core U.S. onshore assets.","Overall, we expect domestic volumes to be up over 20% from 2011, driven by the DJ Basin and Marcellus. Total international growth will be 3%, with Aseng volumes being partially offset by planned downtime at the Alba offshore Equatorial Guinea and reduced production at Mari-B offshore Israel. We had anticipated depletion at Mari-B, but we did not expect to produce at such high rates in 2011. Mari-B production in 2011 was much higher than our plan projected as the field was called on to replace volumes that Israel was unable to import from Egypt for most of the year.","In order to conserve deliverability for the peak summer demand period and to bridge these dwindling Mari-B gas supplies to early 2013 when Tamar is expected to come onstream, we'll be reducing the field's production for the remainder of the first quarter and the second quarter this year. In addition, we're working hard to develop alternate sources of natural gas for Israel until such time as Tamar comes online.","The growth that we have planned and worked for over the last several years is now in progress, and each of our core areas is making significant contributions. Our diversification has again proven its value as we continue to navigate the challenges of the environment. Our goal remains to continue building long-term sustainable growth, growth that is creating value for our investors. Our opportunities set remains large, diverse, but it's also matched by the capabilities we've built within the company and the disciplined capital allocation approach we employ. ","Dave will now give you the operational highlights and more details on our plans for 2012.","David L. Stover","Thinks, Chuck. I will start with a review of our reserves at the end of 2011 before discussing our operations and planned activity for 2012.","As Chuck mentioned, we reported total proved reserves of over 1.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, an increase of 11% from the end of 2010. U.S. reserves made up 47% of the total, with the remaining 53% from our international locations. The reserve additions for the year replaced 244% of our annual production.","In the U.S., net additions of 120 million barrels of oil equivalent replaced 279% of U.S. production. Additions were mostly related to the acquisition and development in Marcellus and by our continued development in Wattenberg. Downward reserve revisions were associated with a decrease of undeveloped vertical locations in the DJ Basin due to our continuing transition from vertical to horizontal drilling and a further reduction of activity in dry gas areas due to low -- sustained low gas prices.","Our horizontal reserve bookings in the Niobrara and Marcellus programs reflect only the specific wells already being worked by our teams and result in less than 2 years' worth of horizontal drilling booked for both programs. ","Internationally, net additions of 78 million barrels of oil equivalent replaced 205% of our sales. These additions were mainly a result of the Tamar drilling program, where we penetrated a third fault block, proving additional reserves. ","As you may recall, we reported in November that our net risk resource inventory was approximately 7.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Of that amount, 3.3 billion barrels was discovered unbooked. We expect the majority of this inventory of discovered unbooked resources to be converted into proved reserves over the next 5 years.","I will now focus on our operations and plans for each of our core areas beginning with our U.S. programs. In the DJ Basin, we produced 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter, with 57% liquids content. This is our third consecutive quarter of record volumes, with production up 16% and oil production up 20% year-over-year.","At year end, our horizontal Niobrara program produced 17,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net, a four-fold increase from year-end 2010. With 95 producing horizontal wells at the end of 2011, our average estimated ultimate recovery or EUR is over 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent, with liquid content currently averaging 65%. The more recent 18 wells we referenced in November continue to produce significantly better than our earlier wells, and we estimate their average EUR to be above 350,000 of oil equivalent, with similar liquid content.","We now have over 6 months of production data from our 9,100-foot extended-reach lateral well in Northeastern Wattenberg. The production profile is tracking a tight curve indicative of an EUR above 750,000 barrels of oil equivalent, with 84% liquids. Building on that success, our plans for 2012 call for drilling approximately 10 to 12 extended-reach laterals across our 400,000 acre position in the Wattenberg field.","In 2011, we drilled over 85 horizontal Niobrara wells, and our top performing rigs are now averaging less than 10 days from spud to rig release. We're currently running 5 horizontal rigs in the Wattenberg field, and we'll add 2 additional horizontal rigs over the next few months, one this month and one in April. Our plan is to operate these 7 drilling rigs, primarily in Wattenberg, throughout the year and to take delivery of 2 additional new-build rigs for the horizontal program in the fourth quarter of this year.","In November, you may recall we discussed doubling our horizontal rig count over the next couple of years, but we have now accelerated that plan to reach 9 rigs in the basin by the end of this year. As a result, we expect to double our horizontal activity from 2010 and drill over 170 horizontal Niobrara wells -- from 2011 and drill over 170 Niobrara wells in 2012, focusing in the more oil-prone areas of the play. To accommodate the increase in horizontal activity, we plan to drill approximately 200 fewer vertical wells in Wattenberg this year. ","With the accelerated horizontal activity levels and the improved drill times, we have ramped up our horizontal completion operations from 2 wells per month in early 2011 to approximately 10 wells per month at the end of the year. Our focus over the last several months has been to ensure that we can execute at these higher levels of activity. One result is the formation of a water management team that's procured long-term water supplies that will support our 2012 activity level.","In the Wells Ranch area, we have installed water storage and transportation lines that both reduce truck traffic and also ensure adequate water supply for our operations. In addition, we have secured frac sand and pumping services to accommodate the new levels of activity.","Concerning the Wattenberg horizontal Niobrara 80-acre pilot test program, an EcoNode concept that we announced in November, the well completions are under way on the initial pad and the EcoNode is being commissioned for start-up.","Of the 9 wells in the pilot project, 8 have been drilled in the B bench of the Niobrara, spaced as close as 300 feet apart. The remaining well is in C bench, less than 100 feet below the B interval. So we've previously discussed, this pilot is designed to increase Niobrara recovery while reducing our surface footprint, and we expect to share results from this project as we progress through the year.","I also want to mention that we recently spud a horizontal Codell well in the Wattenberg field, and we'll be testing and monitoring results over the next several months. ","With respect to capital spending, our plans are to invest $1.25 billion in the DJ Basin, with most of these funds supporting our horizontal program of over 170 wells. In addition to the developments in Wattenberg, we plan to use one of the horizontal rigs in Northern Colorado. This rig will continue the appraisal and delineation of our 220,000-acre position in this area. Thus far, we have been encouraged by the results, which we will share with you later in the year.","Shifting over to Marcellus, our second U.S. onshore core area, we reported production of 74 million cubic feet per day for the fourth quarter. Results are running above our acquisition model and production has more than doubled since the announcement of the joint venture in August. The joint venture placed 21 wells online in the fourth quarter, with average 15 days stabilized production rates of 5 million cubic feet per day and production tracking EUR curves of 5 billion to 6 billion cubic feet per well. Drilling completion costs remain around $5 million per well.","For the joint venture agreement, the carry is suspended until Henry Hub natural gas price rises above $4 per million Btu for 3 consecutive months. As a result, our economics are aligned with our partner, CONSOL Energy, as we make investment decisions in the low natural gas price environment.","The strong performance of the wells in the CONSOL-operated Southwest Pennsylvania dry gas area confirms that development in this area continues to be economically attractive at the current strip prices. The Southwest Pennsylvania drilling program for 2012 also benefits from an average net revenue interest of over 95%.","The joint venture acreage is predominantly held by production, which allows for flexibility in scheduling the timing and location of development. The partners have agreed to defer drilling in the dry gas areas outside of Southwestern Pennsylvania and Northwest West Virginia. The impact on the schedule is around 40 fewer wells than our original plan. In order to respond rapidly to the rising gas prices, the joint venture will continue the land and permitting activities at the originally planned level. Doing so will allow us to build up a strong inventory of drillable locations.","Without the carry we have approximately $500 million allocated to our Marcellus program, which includes the drilling of 39 wells in Noble-operated white gas area and 60 wells in the CONSOL-operated areas. The capital program also provides for additional infrastructure development in the wet gas area to support the 2013 drilling schedule.","Last month, Noble Energy took over operatorship of our first rig in the wet gas area, and we intend to add 2 more rigs in the wet gas area in the second half of 2012. By the end of the year, we expect to operate 3 rigs in the wet gas area, while CONSOL operates 3 rigs in the dry gas areas. We have opened our office in Canonsburg and have allocated staff to this important project. Initial production from the wet gas area should begin in the second quarter of 2012.","Moving offshore to our operations in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We expect production from South Raton to begin before the end of the first quarter and from Galapagos by the end of the second quarter. Our operated portion of the Galapagos project is essentially complete. However, the host platform operator has indicated that concurrent maintenance activities will delay the completion of final topsides work into the second quarter. Following the completion of the third-party maintenance on the platform, we'll have access to finish the work necessary to commission the project. All other significant subsea development and topsides work has been completed, and production will begin following the commissioning of the topsides facilities.","We have allocated $250 million to the Gulf of Mexico for 2012, with approximately 80% supporting our exploration and appraisal work. The first Gunflint appraisal well is drilling ahead with the ENSCO 8501 rig, and we expect to reach total depth in the second quarter. As we look forward in 2012, we're evaluating several exploration and appraisal opportunities for our remaining time on the ENSCO 8501 and our 4-month slot with the ENSCO 8505 rig during the second half of the year. We have filed permits -- We have filed for the permits for our 2012 program and anticipate obtaining these permits in a timely manner.","Moving from the U.S. to international, I'll begin with West Africa. Our Aseng project offshore Equatorial Guinea began producing in November, 7 months ahead of original schedule and 13% under our budget. According to a review by an independent consulting firm, this overall performance was near top quartile in schedule and near top decile in subsea scope costs when compared to a data set of major West Africa project performance.","Before the end of the year, we lifted 3 cargoes each, between 600,000 and 900,000 barrels of oil gross, at a price essentially equal to Brent, which was better than we initially expected. The strong reservoir performance has allowed us to increase the production rate from 50,000 to 55,000 barrels of oil per day, with 99% run time. The FPSO has available capacity, and we're evaluating a further increase in production to 60,000 barrels of oil per day by the end of the first quarter.","We intend to invest $500 million this year in West Africa, with 80% dedicated to development activities. Our development focus has shifted to the Alen project, which remains on budget and on schedule for first production in the fourth quarter of 2013. All subsea trees have been installed, and subsea fabrication is ahead of schedule. The production and injection wells are on schedule to be completed in the first half of 2012 by the Atwood Aurora jack-up rig and the Atwood Hunter rig, respectively.","Carla, our recent oil discovery below the Alen field in Block O, is being integrated into our development plans alongside Diega. Finally, we plan to drill at least one exploration well offshore Cameroon in the Tilapia PSC.","In the Eastern Mediterranean, we had an exceptional quarter. We announced the natural gas discovery offshore Cyprus, with an estimated gross mean resource of 7 trillion cubic feet. The appraisal well at Leviathan, drilled more than 6 miles from the initial discovery well, confirmed the continuous reservoir and increased the gross mean resource estimate to 17 trillion cubic feet. The gross mean resource estimate of Tamar was also increased after successful appraisal. Overall, including the Tanin results announced this week, we now have discovered approximately 35 trillion cubic feet gross of new gas resource -- reserves resources from this region.","The Mari-B field has produced since 2004. And in 2011, it produced at historically high rates to satisfy Israel's natural gas demand while Egyptian imports remained offline. The field has performed well as we accelerated production but, as Chuck mentioned, is experiencing some advanced depletion as a result. Going forward, we will be decreasing Mari-B production over the rest of the first quarter and the second quarter to conserve deliverability for the upcoming summer peak demand period and to maximize gas recovery from the reservoir.","In addition, we're actively pursuing 2 initiatives to enhance deliverability of natural gas from the Mari-B facility until Tamar production comes online. The first is the ongoing development of the nearby Noa field, which is expected to add 100 million cubic feet per day of deliverability in the third quarter of this year. We have drilled 2 wells, which will be completed early in the summer, with the Sedco Express rig. The second initiative is an evaluation of an additional untested area near Mari-B, called Pinnacles, which may be able to contribute additional deliverability. Pending partner approval, the ENSCO 5006 rig is available to begin drilling at Pinnacles well this quarter. ","Noble Energy is a long-term partner of the State of Israel, and we remain committed to working with them to provide as much gas as possible until Tamar is brought online. I've referred to our Tanin discovery, which we announced this week. With the gross mean resource of 1.2 trillion cubic feet, this is our fourth Eastern Mediterranean discovery over 1 trillion cubic feet gross in the last 3 years. ","We are now 6 for 6 with our exploration program in the Levant Basin and continue to diversify the area's gas supply base. The deep oil test at Leviathan is under way with the Noble Corporation Homer Ferrington rig. As we indicated in November, the deep oil gross mean potential on our acreage in the basin is estimated at 3.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent spread over multiple prospects. We expect results from this 15% chance factor Leviathan deep oil test in the second quarter.","Development drilling will continue at Tamar with the Transocean Sedco Express rig, and final well completions are scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2012. Pipeline installation is essentially complete, and the project is on budget and on schedule to begin commissioning late this year and start up early in the second quarter of 2013. The expansion of the Ashdod onshore receiving terminal is also under way. The capital program supporting our activity in the Eastern Mediterranean is around $750 million.","The negotiation of a Tamar gas contract with Israel Electric Corporation continues to progress. In the past month, we have signed 4 contracts for the delivery of over 1.1 trillion cubic feet of natural grass gross with other gas purchasers in Israel and expect to sign more as we move closer to first production. Pre-FEED studies have been initiated to analyze floating LNG as an export option for Tamar and Dalit and to evaluate LNG plant locations for potential exports from the massive Leviathan field. Additionally, we're working with our advisers to help us identify and select a strategic partner or partners for the development of Leviathan gas.","Now let me touch upon the guidance we issued this morning for 2012. We presented a full-year sales range of 244,000 to 256,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with volumes in the first quarter expected to range from 228,000 to 238,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Although the midpoint of first quarter 2012 volumes is expected to be fairly flat with the fourth quarter 2011, the production this quarter should be a higher value mix than we had in the fourth quarter.","Compared to fourth quarter 2011, crude and condensate production is expected to increase around 17%, and gas production is expected to decrease about 8% as we start ramping down Mari-B to conserve for the summer months and the Alba field experiences the first 2 of 4 weeks' planned maintenance. For the year, I anticipate the volume profile to stay fairly flat through the first half and grow significantly in the third quarter as we increase production through the Mari-B facility, complete maintenance at Alba, see the full benefit of new projects in the Gulf of Mexico and continue to grow our horizontal Niobrara and Marcellus volumes.","Lease operating expense will follow the inverse trend of volumes, with LOE per barrel equivalent closer to the higher end of guidance during the first half of the year and near the bottom end of guidance the second half of the year.","When you compare 2012 to 2011, you can see the impact of focusing on our 5 core areas. Our overall gas production is expected to stay fairly flat, as our Marcellus increase will more than offset the reduced volumes from Israel and Equatorial Guinea. This means our total company volume growth will be driven by an expected 40% increase in crude and condensate sales for 2012 compared to 2011. This high-value gross will be contributed 60% from a full year at Aseng, 25% from our horizontal Niobrara program and 15% from our new Deepwater Gulf of Mexico production.","With Aseng now online, a couple of new Deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects starting up the first half of this year, our 2 core onshore U.S. programs ramping up and continued significant exploration success in the Eastern Mediterranean, we are right on track for delivering the 5-year outlook we reviewed at our November Analyst Day. Our current appraisal well at Gunflint and our deep Leviathan oil test provide additional excitement for the coming months. ","With that, Celia, let's open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly, in Israel, given kind of the vast resource potential that you have discovered there, or really Eastern Mediterranean, do you think about maybe entering into a joint venture or monetizing a piece of it is to accelerate the present value of those assets?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think right now, as Dave mentioned, we've -- we're beginning to look at the options there and part of it is the exploring how we might bring in another partner into the development that can provide some additional capabilities. And clearly, the thinking is, is by doing that, we can accelerate the development of these big assets. We have, as you know, a fairly high working interest on the Cyprus opportunity at 70%, which is well about what we have of the Israel side. So there's certainly maybe some opportunities for us to accommodate, along with our partners, an additional partner that would probably have an interest in obtaining some of the upstream interest, as well as participating in a midstream project as well. So I guess, the answer to the question is, is we're open to all options to try to accelerate value here.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate it. And then maybe just one more in Israel. Can you talk a little bit about the contracts you signed? What that means from more of a daily production value and when those kind of start and the prices around those contracts?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think right now, we -- the safest things is for us to stick with the original script, which gave the overall gross amount that was committed under the contract and the dollar value on it. They -- all of them do have some various mechanisms for escalation. The ones that we have entered into already have formulas that are tied to the public utilities' tariffs that's there in Israel. And of course, that will adjust as we go forward. That's -- we've made some estimates of how that might move. But that's kind of a guess at this point. But there -- again, we're continuing to contract volumes out of Tamar. The big contract with IEC, I think, we continue to make progress and we're waiting on just the final approval from our customer there.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","With the better rates that you're seeing or expecting out of Aseng in Equatorial Guinea, do you attribute this to achieving a greater recovery rate of oil in place or depleting the reservoir more quickly? And are there any implications for how you\u2019re thinking about Alen?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think, number one, the better production rates are clearly due to the -- we've got a very high-quality reservoir there, and we've got very good completions. It's far too early to say what any implications might be on recovery. Although in the past, we have said that on our reserve bookings, there is some possibility that because we saw some positive things as we develop the field, that we'll monitor for performance and there's certainly a reasonable chance that we'll be able to increase our proven reserves estimate in the field later this year. So too early to tell, but everything is working very well. And maybe Dave wants to add a couple of more things on that.","David L. Stover","Yes, if you recall, Brian, these producers are all horizontal wells. So that the plan from the beginning was to start them at 50 and then slowly increase them up to probably holding them no greater than 60,000 barrels a per day. And that will allow us to still hold a fairly flat production profile at that rate for over one year or so. And then, as Chuck mentioned, we'll look back at the end of the year and see how performance has gone and reevaluate reserves at that time.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And in the U.S., in the Wattenberg field, do you anticipate any midstream or downstream bottlenecks at all, or should we expect that the trajectory of your growth be pretty consistent over the course of the year?","Charles D. Davidson","No, I think the key up there is continuing to plan ahead for that, make sure you've got your plans in place a couple of years out. I think Ted talked in November and we mentioned, I think, even at the last call some of the expansion plans up there with DCP on their facilities and how they're working with us to stay up with us, especially with the increased activity levels. I know there's some new plans for some NGL lines out of the area too that we're in discussions with. So when we look at the outlook, we look at the whole midstream piece that's seasoned up with what we've got planned there. The other component is we're continuing to move more and more into the oil portion but which alleviates any timing pressures on the gas part of it, and that matches up well with our plans with the downstream, midstream companies.","David L. Stover","I think I'd also add, Brian, that on the oil side, we've continued to expand the markets that we go to. So in the past, we were perhaps going to 2 markets. I think now we're touching on maybe 5 different customer outlets in the area, so that's helping on the oil side as well. Because, as Dave pointed out, while we've managed around any gas bottlenecks by moving into the oil part of the field, we've got a -- we're starting to move a tremendous amount of oil out of Wattenberg. So it's a -- we've got everyone working on every piece of the logistics.","Operator","And we'll go next to Amir Arif with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","First, a quick question on the Marcellus. The 630,000-acre position, how much of that is in the dry gas? And is there any concerns of acreage explorations as you slow that portion of the drilling down?","David L. Stover","I mean, the beauty of the position out there is how much of this is held by production. There's a large component too that will essentially feed acreage, which contributes to the high interest, that net revenue. Again, I mean, it's highly unusual to have areas where you can drill with 95% net revenue interest like we're focusing on right now in the dry gas area. So we don't see issues with anything as far as any concern of acreage loss or anything like that with any adjustment in the program.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And the carry, I know it comes back after gas goes over 4. But is there any time frame over which the carry would expire regardless of the gas place or did it simply get carried forward?","David L. Stover","It just keeps moving out in time.","Operator","And we'll go next to Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You talked about your Mari-B production in the first half of '12 being curtailed in order to leave some more room for kind of peak summer season. Could you guys quantify that at all in terms of where you think it could be in the first half of '12 versus the second half of '12?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think, we look at it on a gross basis. I'll tell you what, I'm going to let Dave go through it because we can get a lot of moving pieces here, because we're going to be adding a Noa project in the third quarter.","David L. Stover","Yes, and essentially what we're doing is we're ramping down through the first quarter, which we talked about. So we're ramping down probably about 50 million a day per month for a few months until we get into a number we're comfortable with for the second quarter, and then we'll ramp back up starting in the third quarter to meet some of the summer season, along with bringing on something like Noa. But I think when you look out in the summer period, you're looking at numbers probably closer in that 400 million to 450 million a day total Israel gas production that we're delivering. And then I would expect it would fall back off in the fourth quarter.","Charles D. Davidson","And that's reflected in our guidance. But we just want to make sure that everyone understands that we just don't have the ability to go back up to that 600 million that we saw in 2011. That really pulled a lot of volume out of the reservoir. So we're trying to provide as much deliverability as we can for our customers in the summer months, knowing that Mari-B and even with Noa is not likely to come anywhere close to the deliverability we had last year.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's very helpful. Just jumping over to the Niobrara here. Obviously, you guys had a -- it sounds like a very stout well in your first long lateral well there. Just trying to get a sense of what the well cost there is on the long lateral compared to your normal wells. I guess, you said your last 18 horizontals were from more of a normalized lateral were sort of 350 Mboe wells. Just wanted to get a well cost comparison and whether or not you guys think you're seeing a huge benefit in terms of added value from that program?","David L. Stover","Yes, when you looked at our average and what we've been running on our normal horizontal wells, they're right about that 4.7 million drilling complete. I think what we showed in November for that long lateral was around 7.5 million. So you see that there's potential efficiency improvements and optimization with the long laterals. And really, the effort on that, I think, we even indicated potentially with those type numbers 20% improvement in F&D and just take that straight up at least. What we're really focusing, the next tests on the long lateral really in the more oil-prone windows up in those northeastern part of the field and so forth where you don't have quite as many vertical wells. It gives us more ability to maneuver those to start with.","Operator","And we'll go next to Bob Morris with Citi.","Robert S. Morris - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Dave, on the reserve write-down that you took up in the Rockies for the vertical wells, knowing that those were PUDs with associated hydrocarbons. Why didn't  you just swap those out for horizontal PUDs, just to keep the reserves the same?","David L. Stover","Well, if you remember, a large portion of our vertical reserve component is Codell and in some cases, even J-Sand. So the big portion of that is really taking that -- those vertical well, Codell and J PUDs, off the books and not assuming that we're going to re-drill those on a vertical basis within the 5 years. We've not allocated any horizontal reserves to Codell at this point. As I mentioned earlier, we're just starting to test and drill our first true Codell horizontal well. And so we'll revisit Codell horizontal at the end of this year.","Robert S. Morris - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I think, it's not really price related, it's just the fact that you're not going to drill those in the next 5 years now?","David L. Stover","Yes, we're are just not assuming we're going to really drill those in the next 5 years.","Charles D. Davidson","And just to re-emphasize a point that Dave made on our horizontal bookings, both in the Niobrara and the Marcellus, we're just looking those that the teams are working right now, which really only works to about a 2-year inventory. So we're not pressing the envelope at all on our horizontal bookings. So I think when you take a look at the combination of those factors is why it's prudent to put those Codell resources into the unproven category for now until we firm up the plans for the future for either for horizontal drilling in the Codell or the drilling of vertical Codell wells later.","Robert S. Morris - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So you would expect that perhaps next year, book a lot of offsets on the horizontal side?","Charles D. Davidson","I think we will. We do expect to continue to book offsets on the horizontal, but I think we're going to be very careful and manage a plan that's based on location our teams are working on.","David L. Stover","I mean, activity level, we're drilling twice as many this year.","Operator","We'll go next the John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Could you give a postmortem on the well in Cameroon, what happened?","David L. Stover","Basically, that prospect we didn't see reservoir. And I mean, that was one of the primary risks that we identified pre-drill.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. Next one for me is just on the DJ. They had a lot of snow recently. Should we expect any sort of weather-related delays? Did you have any freeze-offs, anything like that?","David L. Stover","I mean, there's always a little bit of impact. But we haven't seen a big impact from that. I mean, the team has done a good job of preparing for winter and we haven't had big long sustained. If you remember a couple of years ago, we had  probably 3 storms one week after another that had a big impact. And hopefully, we won't see that type of thing. But a short storm, they're able to weather most of that impact.","Charles D. Davidson","I would say that when we look at our January performance, it was outstanding in terms of the amount of oil that we moved there in the field. So there will be some -- there will always be some little winter upsets, but we certainly -- we think, we've factored that into how we've outlined and guided for the first quarter.","Operator","We'll go next to Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I had a question on the Leviathan appraisal program. How many wells do you think you'll ultimately need, and what's your timeline for certainty on the results? And specifically, if you get a negative result in the deep oil test, does that condemn the concept or would you then go back and find a different prospect to test that oil concept?","Charles D. Davidson","Between Dave and I, we'll try to cover that. I think in terms of the Leviathan appraisal, we've now -- we have 2 wells. Certainly, there will be probably 1 to 2 more over time. And that will continue to narrow it down although this a very big resource, so it will never get down to a perfect number. I guess, what we'll do is just narrow the range. But certainly, the appraisal that we had last year helped a lot. And as you know, it actually allowed us to move the discovered gross mean resources up a bit. As far as the deep test, we see a number of structures in this basin. Not all of them may have been formed the same way, and so there is some differences in the prospects. So this is very low chance of success to start with. But I would say that there's still a possibility that if we did not find something at Leviathan, depending on what we found there, we could be encouraged to test one of those other prospects in the basin as well.","Operator","We'll go next to Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","The Marcellus, wondering sort of you working the wet gas portion, and can you update me on which county you're working on and also, sort of your longer term plan infrastructure and such? I know you guys always think ahead. And then secondarily, what's your view on U.S. dry gas? How long can you and your partners sort of kind of stay back and wait for recovery?","David L. Stover","Yes, Irene, let me take the first part of that. We're operating in Marshall County, West Virginia, and we anticipate we'll stay in West Virginia all year this year. And as I mentioned earlier, we have additional money in there or some money in the program this year for preparing for additional acceleration as we get the other couple rigs in, and then that will lead into a potentially larger program in the wet gas area next year. But all of that right now for this year, and I would anticipate beginning of next year, will be in the West Virginia portion.","Charles D. Davidson","And I think as far as how long can we wait it out. Again, because this is not a situation where we have to hold acreage, it's all basically held by production, mostly held by production, that I think we have a lot of patience here. We've got a particular area that Dave talked about that's got some very high net revenue interest, and we've seen some very high quality there in Southwestern Pennsylvania. We still see some good returns to drill there. But as far as the other areas, we'll just plan with our partner to continue to monitor the gas market and see if it turns around. It just doesn't make sense in those other areas to be drilling there right now.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","What's your internal view? How long would this sort of gas surplus last?","Charles D. Davidson","Ah, the crystal ball. I can't tell. And quite honestly, I, like all of you, are waiting to see what the gas production is in the U.S. and how it matches up with demand and how the weather evolves. My sense is that we have to go through a full season here. And we're basically looking at trying to guess at where we'll end up with gas and storage in the fall and look at what the actual production volumes are in the country. So it's -- I don't see it as something that will turn around immediately. I think we're going to have to go through several months in a season to see where both demand and supply go.","Operator","We'll go next to John Malone with Global Hunter Securities.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just taking a little bit more in Mari-B, just to be clear. So you're talking about 2 options, Noa, obviously, you're going to have with and then an evaluation of Pinnacles. Are those mutually exclusive? And when you talked about getting up to, I think you quoted a 400 to 450 number later in the year for the Israel summer demand, is that -- that's including Noa but not including for Pinnacles, correct?","David L. Stover","It would include the possibility of gas from both of those, John.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So all right, fair enough. And then just quickly, Cyprus. Can you give any guidance on what you think fiscal terms are going to like there? Are they going to be similar to Israel?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, it's basically a production sharing agreement, and we're under a confidentiality with the government on disclosure.","Operator","We'll go next to David Heikkinen with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Can you give us the status of asset sales or timing or any thoughts around them?","Charles D. Davidson","Yes, we kicked that process off, David, and we should be opening up some data here to folks in the next month or so. We'll start with probably some oil production in Permian and some oil production in Kansas and also some of our Granite Wash production. Those would probably be the first components that we'll have out the door. So I think we'll just be kicking that process off here in earnest over the next couple of months here, by the end of the quarter or so.","David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then results at Aseng sound encouraging. What drives the wide range of crude and condensate volume guidance for '12?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think what we just look at -- we put in a number of factors and we've got -- you have to keep in mind, we've got a downtime factored in at Alba. And anytime you take facilities down, that can swing the liquid volumes. And we try to look at variances on our growth of the Niobrara. And so we just try to -- in the end, try to put a reasonable range and try to accommodate things like if you've got any type of unusual downtime or weather.","David L. Stover","Especially in the Deepwater Gulf.","Charles D. Davidson","I think also, the other point is that we noted that Galapagos was a little later than we originally expected. And any time you don't have a project that hasn't started up, you need to put a range around that, a sensitivity around it because of issues on start-ups. So those are the big drivers.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Hall with Robert W. Baird.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just curious, can you remind me, I guess, where are your NGL volumes out of the DJ Index, too, from a pricing standpoint? Are you guys getting Conway or MBOE [ph] type prices?","Charles D. Davidson","Yes, we're -- right now, the NGLs out of the Wattenberg area are going to Conway.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then how much of the -- I don't know if you have this, but how much of the NGL barrel is ethane?","Charles D. Davidson","Yes, we actually...","David L. Stover","About 1\/3, I think.","Charles D. Davidson","Yes, it's about -- about 1\/3 of it is ethane, and then the rest is in heavier liquids.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then last one for me on the Niobrara. How much of the acreage position there do you think has potentially perspective for the long lateral development? I'm just trying to get a sense for, is there any constraints from leasehold and land ownership or legacy wells?","David L. Stover","I don't have a number at my fingertip. I'd say, we'll probably have a better idea later in the year after we finish these next 10 to 12. I will say, we are going to start more in that. If you go back to those areas, we had high GLR and then the core that was a much larger picture than the higher GLR. It's kind of a core with low GLR and then an extension area. It would be those latter 2 areas that we'll really concentrate the long laterals first.","Charles D. Davidson","I think also is that if they continue to be very successful, there could be opportunities to go beyond just where we have contiguous acreage but actually start forming partnerships where you either trade acreage or you bring others in so that you can form adjacent sections. So that's a lot of land work that it takes to do something like that, but that's some other options as well.","Operator","And our final question comes from Paul Crovo with PNC Capital Advisors.","Paul Crovo","Quick question about Aseng. You had indicated that you could possibly be bumping production up to 60,000 by the end of the first quarter, and I was wondering whether or not that was built into your full year 2012 production guidance?","Charles D. Davidson","Yes. That assumption is built into our overall guidance, yes. It's part of the range that we provided for production and for oil.","David R. Larson","So this is David Larson again. We've reached our one-hour limit here on the phone call, and I want to be -- stay on schedule for us, as well as you guys out there in the market. So I just want to end by saying, I want to thank everyone for their interest in Noble Energy.

Please go ahead.","Brad Whitmarsh","Thank you, Allison, and appreciate all of you joining us for our second quarter conference call. I hope you've had a chance to review the news release and presentation deck that we published this morning. These materials are available on the Investors page of our website and they highlight continued strong operational performance for the business. Later today, we plan to file our Form 10-Q with the SEC.","I want to remind everyone that today's discussion contains projections and forward-looking statements as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures in our latest news releases and SEC filings for a discussion of those items. Following our prepared remarks, we'll hold a question-and-answer session.

Our planned comments this morning will come from; Dave Stover, Chairman and CEO; as well as Brent Smolik President and COO; Ken Fisher, EVP and CFO; Hodge Walker, SVP of Onshore; and Keith Elliott SVP of Offshore are here to participate in the Q&A session.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.","Dave Stover","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. It had started out as a volatile earnings season for the industry, but we are glad to have the time this morning to share Noble's accomplishments and why we are excited about our future.","For us, the summer days have been very active. We are close to bringing Leviathan online and realizing the transformational impact, we've been pointed to for several years. It's thrilling to be just a few months away from start-up.","Across our portfolio, we've created more certainty and visibility throughout our business this year. The Alen sanction, DJ inventory of permits and our development mode in the Delaware all contribute to a sustainable future for Noble Energy.","Onshore execution in Leviathan startup established the foundation for performance in 2020 and beyond. Noble is positioned to distinguish itself through three key factors: one, the positive rate of change heading into 2020 from decreasing capital and significantly increasing cash flow and volume; two, the move to an even lower annual corporate volume decline rate in the low 20% range; and three, a global inventory that includes substantial discovered resources that can use existing infrastructure to generate significant returns.","As the market continues to experience volatility, we remain intensely focused on generating free cash flow, improving corporate returns, protecting the balance sheet and returning significant amounts of capital to investors. Through the first half of the year, our organization has made tremendous progress and I'm proud to share our accomplishments.","For the fourth quarter in a row, our total capital came in below expectations. This was driven by onshore U.S. well cost and facility savings and offshore activity timing. Brent will highlight how we are exceeding our original capital reduction targets year-to-date and this is a step change that provides the framework for a long-term sustainable decrease in our capital intensity. With our accomplishments to-date and our confidence in our outlook through the remainder of the year, we are lowering our full year 2019 capital guidance by $100 million.","We delivered a strong operational second quarter. Some specific results that really stood out included; capital expenditures and operating cash cost per barrel were more than 10% below plan for the quarter, and sales volumes were 10,000 barrels equivalent per day above the midpoint of expectation with oil volumes toward the high-end of guidance. These factors contributed to an improvement in cash flow per share versus consensus. It also highlighted the organization's success in managing controllable items.","During the quarter, we actively managed our commodity price exposure through market diversification and hedging. We added some new oil hedges and are now approximately two-thirds covered for 2019 and above 40% for 2020 with a floor of at least $58. Earlier this year, we also proactively hedged 70% to 75% of our Waha basis exposure through 2020.","Our operational performance and efficiencies accelerated a number of wells to first production through faster drilling and completion timing. In our onshore activity in the second quarter, we'll drive a pronounced third quarter volume increase while onshore capital spending trends lower in the back half of the year.","Along with the high demand season in Israel and strong performance in West Africa, the entire company is undergoing a material uplift this quarter. Our third quarter volume guidance reflects 8% total company sequential growth at the midpoint of our range with oil up over 10%.","We are well on our way to delivering the outlook -- this outlook with strong performance in July. Year-to-date results along with our outlook for the second half provides confidence that our full year volumes will be towards the upper half of our original guidance range.","In the DJ Basin, our performance continues to deliver to the upside led by development of the Mustang asset. It's amazing to think of the progress the team has made to efficiently design and set up the asset for long-term development and the results are proving the success.","Looking to the future, I'm poised to announce that we have submitted the application for an additional comprehensive drilling plan or CDP for the North Wells Ranch area where we can build upon the accomplishments seen at our Mustang position.","Through our long-term strategic planning, we have years of high-return activity in the DJ giving the company line of sight to execute on its multiyear plan and to build upon our industry-leading returns in the basin.","In the Delaware, we've delivered significant well cost reductions, operating cost improvements, and increased production meaningfully. The team has executed well this year and brought online our first row developments during the second quarter.","In support of these basins, Noble Midstream Partners has continued to ensure efficient in-basin gathering as we bring wells online ahead of schedule and plan. Our strategic review of the Midstream business is ongoing and we will update the market when appropriate.","Providing diversification to our U.S. business, the international assets are comprised of material low-cost low-decline discovered resources. These resources have the economic benefit of taking advantage of existing infrastructure to develop them efficiently.","The first half of the year has brought Leviathan closer to production and saw the sanction of our Alen gas monetization project in West Africa. These projects provide a unique opportunity to access global natural gas markets with premium pricing.","Noble's rate of change story is really exemplified by our Leviathan project which creates a huge net cash flow swing from completing the project in 2019 to the first full year of production in 2020.","Leviathan represents the largest discovery in our company's history and one of the largest-ever infrastructure projects in Israel. With 33 trillion cubic feet of gas in place and 22 trillion cubic feet recoverable, the project will continue to provide energy independence for Israel and transform the country into a significant energy exporter for the first time in its history.","The construction of the Leviathan production decks has finished and the project is now nearly 90% complete. The production deck set sailed for Israel on early July and you can see a video of the launch on our website. We eagerly look forward to their arrival later this quarter before final commissioning the first gas sales by year-end.","Additionally, we continue to progress marketing and transport discussions. Technical work on the EMG pipeline was performed during the quarter to test its integrity. Our teams are extremely pleased with the condition of the pipe and we anticipate closing on the acquisition in the third quarter.","With Leviathan starting up at the end of this year and Alen in the first half of 2021, I'm really excited about the cash flow impact and sustainability of cash flows that we are adding from our offshore major projects over the next couple of years.","In addition to our robust discovered resource base, we have some material exploration opportunities that we are looking forward to testing in 2020. Our plan includes a handful of onshore unconventional wells in Wyoming along with an offshore Colombia prospect test next year.","Overall, I am extremely pleased with our progress and how we are executing for the future. To be clear, next year's capital program is expected to be significantly lower than this year's. At the same time, cash flow and volumes will grow substantially.","As we move into this transformational 2020, we will be managing our capital expenditures to ensure we generate organic free cash flow that can be returned to shareholders, while strengthening our balance sheet and improving corporate returns.","We have set ambitious goals to recalibrate our business through a laser focus on cost efficiencies and a moderate growth profile. Along with a lower capital intensity, we're focused on improving our overall cost structure through reductions in operating, G&A, and non-cash costs.","Now, I will turn the call over to Brent Smolik, our President and COO to talk about how we are lowering the long-term capital needs for the company and generating high margin growth and returns through innovation and continuous improvement.","Brent Smolik","Morning, everyone. Thanks, Dave. I echo your comments on the dramatic rate of change and significant inflection point that we are experiencing. As evidenced, the U.S. onshore business delivered a very strong second quarter as highlighted on Slide 4. Production was above plan and capital and operating costs were lower than forecast.","For Q3, we expect total U.S. oil production to be up nearly 10% for both oil and equivalents and capital to be down about $75 million sequentially. This is a reflection of the good work our teams have done to improve capital efficiencies and reduce cost coupled with the acceleration of our turn in line schedule all positive for improving cash flows.","In Q2, USO well costs were down nearly 20% from fourth quarter 2018 levels. On Slide 5, you can see that we are exceeding the planned cost reductions of $500,000 to $1 million per well in the DJ Basin and $1 million to $1.5 million per well in the Delaware. Currently, all costs are about $0.5 million lower than the budgeted cost through a combination of improved well designs, better execution efficiencies and supply chain savings. Some examples of the Q2 -- of Q2 execution included record drilling times in both the DJ and Delaware Basins.","Several of our 9500-foot laterals in DJ were drilled in less than five days. Our recent well in the Delaware with about 10,000-foot lateral was drilled in less than 17 days and it wasn't that long ago that we were averaging over 22 days for the long lateral wells in the Permian, so I'm very pleased with the progress made by our drilling teams.","On the completions side, pump hours per day continue to trend higher through the row development and execution improvements.","We've also worked with our service providers to incentivize even higher pumping hours per day which benefits both us and them. We've continued to refine our completion designs including in some cases lower proppant concentrations and fluid volumes. Reducing those frac fluid volumes creates benefits on multiples fronts including lower capital cost, reduction in source water and water disposal and acceleration of first production.","We've also continued to attack operating expenses. Unit production costs were down significantly in the quarter as we focused on work over optimization, streamlining chemical programs and fuel cost savings and we're certainly not done. We've got continuous improvement initiatives underway for further expense reductions.","Before jumping into some of the asset specifics, I also want to highlight a couple of new oil marketing arrangements that should improve netback pricing. In the Delaware, initial flows from the EPIC pipeline will commence shortly and we'll be moving barrels to the Gulf Coast at very attractive tariff rates.","Reported GTP will increase with the transaction however, increased realizations will more than offset the cost as we migrate our Permian oil sales to Gulf Coast pricing arrangements. Here in Q2, we also finalized an agreement with the existing Saddlehorn pipeline to transport additional quantities of crude from the DJ Basin to Cushing at lower tariff rates.","The Noble marketing team and Noble Midstream have done a very nice job of improving the value of our equity barrels and both arrangements will contribute to further margin growth.","Let's take a little closer look at the DJ Basin. We delivered a strong quarter of execution in the asset continued to fund growth while generating free cash flow. In the quarter, we initiated production on 36 wells in the basin with 20 from Mustang Row 2. The Mustang area continues to perform very well. The gross production from rows one and two has grown from zero to over 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in less than a year. That performance is highlighted on slide 8 along with DP 408, which is one of the development plans on Row 2.","The Mustang 408 DP has 24 wells, 12 of which were pumped with lower fluid design and 12 with our previous design. Reducing fluid volumes sustainably reduces cycle time and well cost. The DJ efficiency gains will result in a few more wells this year than planned. In the second half of the year, we expect the TIL over 50 more wells, primarily in Mustang in Q3 and Wells Ranch in Q4.","Before leaving the DJ, it's important to mention the gas processing expansion that's underway. DCP's O'Connor two plant is expected to restart shortly and ramp up through the third quarter. As a reminder, we utilized several gas processing alternatives as needed which has helped position Noble differentially in the basin.","Turning to the Permian. The Delaware Basin production reached a quarterly record of 64,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The production benefited from strong base and new well performance including the acceleration of seven TILs into the quarter. As explained on slide 9, we initiated production on wells across our acreage position in Q2 including our first real row developments. Well costs were significantly lower than we budgeted and well performance was in line with our expectations.","The Calamity Jane development in the northeast portion of the acreage showcases our initial full section row development. These two new wells peaked at approximately 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with all percentages in the 50% to 60% range as expected in this part of the field. The benefits of row development include reduction in parent-child interactions, improvement in the constancy of well performance and significant operational gains.","The Calamity well -- the Jane well has realized an improvement of 15% in drilling and completion cycle time and through our continued focus on capital efficiencies, we've been able to further improve upon this success. This quarter we expect the TIL an incremental 15 wells and expect our Delaware Basin production to continue to grow in the second half of the year.","We've also meaningfully reduced lease operating expenses in the Permian. Unit LOE costs were down approximately 20% sequentially and are expected to trend lower as we move through the year. The Eagle Ford asset continues to perform very well providing cash flow to the business. We brought online 16 DUCs in the quarter. Many of those TILs were late in Q2, so we expect to see a big production step up in the third quarter and then decline in Q4.","We won't be adding any new wells in the second half of the year in Eagle Ford. Therefore, our teams will be heavily focused on base production management including testing a refrac concept in Q3. Our offshore focus is really three-pronged. Our teams continue to be very focused on reservoir management and base production optimization. We're advancing near-term development projects primarily Leviathan and Alen, while planning for future monetization of world-class low-cost discovered resources in the Eastern Med and West Africa.","So I'll begin with Israel. Tamar produced 950 million cubic feet equivalent per day in Q2, which was better than expected. In the third quarter, remember it was typically the highest quarter of the year based on seasonal demand, and we expect the asset to average over a Bcf per day in Q3. As Dave mentioned, the Leviathan project is now nearly 90% complete and I commend our project and our operational teams and our many partners around the world that are supporting the project and delivering an exceptionally well-managed major project.","We also discussed the competitive advantages Leviathan will deliver to the company, but it bears repeating. Our total company production decline rate pre-Leviathan is in the low 30% per year range. As Leviathan comes online that annual decline rate improves to the low 20s. Leviathan itself remember has essentially no decline and we expect production at Leviathan to grow with market demand over the first couple of years without any additional capital.","This kind of high-quality asset reduces volatility, it provides more cash flow certainty, it creates more capital-allocation flexibility across the portfolio since it requires less capital to maintain the base production and that's an important differentiator for us. As Leviathan commences production we'll begin moving significant quantities of gas to Jordan and Egypt, representing a new era of energy exports for Israel.","Leviathan gas sales have received some positive press in the last few weeks. We're in conversations with our primary Egyptian customer to firm up quantities from Leviathan and Tamar. You may have seen in the news. We'll keep you updated as negotiation progresses and we contract for increasing gas sales into the growing regional market. Our view for Leviathan in 2020 hasn't changed. We are expecting gross production to average about 800 million cubic feet per day, below that average in the first half of the year and closer to a Bcf per day at the end of 2020.","As Dave mentioned, the highlight for the quarter was the completion of the technical due diligence on the EMG pipeline. We have now confirmed the physical integrity of the pipe with an in-line inspection and pressure test and we've demonstrated the ability to transport natural gas into Egypt. Over the next few weeks, we'll be working with partners to verify the integrity of the downstream pipelines and complete a sustained flows test of gas into the Egyptian grid.","The flow test is the final critical path item to closing the EMG pipeline acquisition, which we expect by the end of the third quarter. We also remain focused on longer-term market and transport options to monetize additional gas, including the expansion of the regional pipeline infrastructure. You may have also seen this week that we are evaluating a floating LNG project, which has the potential to deliver gas in the global markets at a competitive supply cost. That project would require minimal near-term capital as it would be required in the concepts that we're reviewing.","For our West Africa assets, continue to be a stable supply of cash flow from existing developments and additional hybrid-term projects. We're currently drilling the horizontal portion of the Aseng 6P well and will be moving to the completion phase within the next few weeks. The well is expected to be online early in the fourth quarter. Gross production is expected to be approximately 10,000 barrels of oil per day, which will result in about a 60% increase in current field production. The well returns clearly benefit from the use of the Aseng infrastructure.","Our Alen team has done an exceptional job of identifying opportunities to increase condensate rates in the field and as a result Q2 production was above budget. The gas monetization project at Alen that we announced in Q2 represents another opportunity to add production and cash flow in 2021. Like Leviathan, Alen will have a growing production profile for several years without the need for additional capital. We've updated guidance on slide 18. Our capital expenditures for the third quarter estimated to be in the range of $600 million to $675 million with the majority of the capital spend in the U.S. onshore and Eastern Med regions. Onshore will be down sequentially and offshore will be up largely due to Leviathan installation in the Aseng well.","We've lowered our full year capital range by $100 million and we anticipate meaningfully lower capital in the fourth quarter with lower onshore completion activity and lower Leviathan capital as the project starts up by the end of the year. We've also lowered our full year unit production expenses and DD&A ranges and raised our full year production outlook. Q3 will be our largest volume quarter for the year as all business units are expected to be up. Within the U.S. oil should be up about 10,000 barrels of oil per day in the third quarter with moderate oil growth in the fourth quarter.","At this point everything we can control is moving in the right direction. As we move to the Q&A, I want to leave with three thoughts: One, we're delivering on expectations across the company and are ahead of plan. Our strong execution in the first half of 2019 positions us well for the second half of the year for 2020 and for the longer-term planning horizon. Two, we're nearing a huge infection point for the company. The rate of change is being led by the capital efficiency improvements in our U.S. onshore business and the massive swing in net cash flows from Leviathan, which is now just a few months away. And three, we have a sustainable long-term outlook. Our portfolio quality and reduced maintenance capital requirements position us extremely well for long-term sustainable free cash flow, increasing corporate returns, and the ability to return more capital to our investors.","Operator, that completes our prepared remarks, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram","Yeah. Good morning. Brent, maybe this one is for you. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, the sustainability of the well cost savings that you outlined in slide 5. And how the row development strategy is helping you achieve some of those well cost savings.","Brent Smolik","Yeah. Thanks Arun. Great, question. The things that we're doing that are most sustainable are on the completion side of the business. We've been able to fairly significantly improve the pumping hours per day, and the number of stages that we're able to get done per day.","And we've actually added some incentives into the contracts with our service providers, to push those numbers up even further. And a lot of it is just better day-to-day execution and taking out waste and the downtime, in the operations. That part's very sticky and very sustainable.","The other parts of it that are, design related are changing how we do our business. And so the best example to point to is the lower fluid frac designs in the DJ. Those have a lot of benefits, because we get lower cost for the frac fluid -- the freshwater fluid to start with.","We shorten the pump times. And get more stages done per day. We increase the -- decrease the cycle time. And get well on production quicker. And we have less disposal costs on the backside.","And those kinds of design changes along with a lot of others are, sticky even if we get back into an inflationary environment. And then, we have a number of things that we're working on, then to continue to manage the supply chain side of our business.","But I think most of what we're doing -- and to your row development point is, row development only improves the probability of being able to get all those efficiency gains. So I'm really happy with the progress we've made so far on getting faster.","Arun Jayaram","And then, those lower fluid designs, what can you speak to in terms of productivity there?","Brent Smolik","So far so good, remember, that we've got some of the highest productive wells up in the DJ. And we continue to see high productivity per well. Returns are better, because of lower capital cost and higher efficiencies. So hopefully, we'll get the benefit of both top numerator and denominator.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And my follow-up, Dave, perhaps for you, the NBLX strategic alternatives process. We've gotten some questions given the departure of NBLX' CFO quite recently. Our analysis suggests that, it's a relatively shortcut to well over $2.5 billion in total value kind of net to Noble.","But could you provide us an update on the process? And maybe, some of the pros and cons of potentially monetizing a portion of your interest here?","Dave Stover","Yeah. Not really anything to elaborate on. I'd go back to my prepared comments, Arun that when there is something, we'll tell you. I think you did bring up a good point though, and that's the value of the NBLX business itself. I mean you look at their release they sent out this morning.","They're hitting on all cylinders. Also in the second quarter they've got some transformative things coming up like the EPIC pipelines coming up. Their focus just as Brent's talked about on, decreasing costs in their overall business. So, it's just a very valuable business.","Arun Jayaram","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question today will come from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning. Hi.","Dave Stover","Hi, Brian.","Brian Singer","You highlighted on Leviathan expectations for growth volume is in 2020 to average about 800 million a day. Can you talk more about, how that ramp-up looks over the course of the year, or if it is consistent for the year, how much do you expect just to go to domestic versus international markets? And then whether you see Tamar cycling down, or whether the 800 million is still the incremental?","Dave Stover","Yeah. I think what we're saying is, we'll have truly incremental volume here. And what Brent I think alluded to in his comments, was that you ought to expect the first half of the year will be under that average. In the second half of the year it'll be over and centers itself up nicely to exit the year around that, Bcf a day or so.","So, the whole outlook I think is similar to what we've been saying. But we're continuing to firm up contracts. We're seeing the demand continue to increase, folks wanting to firm up more demand. You're seeing in Israel, the discussion around accelerating coal conversion.","So, I think it's just that somewhat we expected. As Leviathan is coming close -- closer to coming online it's becoming more real for folks. And it's firming up what our outlook can be. And then what even the potential upside could be when you look beyond 2020.","Brian Singer","Great. So the Bcf a day by the end of the year is fully incremental. No cycling down at -- or declines at Tamar?","Dave Stover","Right. I think there's going to be enough when you look at internally in Israel and the regional capacity that they'll be wanting everything being delivered from phase one of Leviathan and everything we can deliver from Tamar especially as you get towards the end of 2020 and beyond.","Brian Singer","Great. And then the second question is with regards to the Delaware Basin and well productivity. Can you just talk to as you continue to bring on more of the row developments what your expectations are for the \u2013 for how productivity goes from here? And then how you see if at all oil rates evolving relative to the kind of 50% to 60%?","Brent Smolik","Yeah. The primary thing we're seeing from the row developments is we have less between well interference and more consistency in the well performance. So we get less of the parent-child kind of interference. It causes a lot of scatter in the results, and I think that's a positive and it averages up of our total returns. In the field our best performance is still Wolfcamp A in the Third Bone which were \u2013 it's been in most of our program and most of the capital on this year. And those results are good and you can see that even in the 25 test rates that we released. So I think that all feels like its on track to us. We're -- we've been admittedly spending a lot of time on our capital efficiency and we talked a lot about it in the first half of the year and the results are compelling. But we've also continued in the background to work on improving well productivity, and hopefully over time we'll be talking to you more about those improvements.","Brian Singer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Guys, I wonder if I could circle back to Israel for a second. And as you pointed out there's been some noise in the press around the Egyptian contracts in particular. But I'm just curious about when you talk about little capital required for material growth, can you just walk us through what the current redundant \u2013 what the redundant capacity would be at both Tamar and Leviathan, let's say once both are online? And any kind of reasonable guide that you think or idea that you think as to how quickly you could see that capacity utilized with no material incremental capital? And I've got a follow-up please.","Brent Smolik","I think the simplest way to think about it is that we've guided to about 800 million a day average gross production from Leviathan for 2020. And without additional capital the facility and wells will be capable of about 1.2 Bcf a day and we can ramp that up over that first two to three year period depending on market with no additional capital. So it's kind of inclining base production from 800 to 1.2.","Dave Stover","And then I think Doug what you're alluding to then beyond filling up the first phase of Leviathan that's when you start getting into the incremental capital when you get above that 1.2 Bcf a day and we can do that very efficiently. As you well know, we've set up the production facility to be able to incrementalize with modules up there in 200 million, 400 million a day increments and then you're looking at each well can deliver 300 million a day. So the real piece will be how it evolves from where you're going to flow the gas to on your phases beyond Phase 1.","Doug Leggate","I guess what was behind my question was I seem to recall you had pre-built a couple hundred million dollars of expansion capacity in your Leviathan budget plus you've got a 600 million a day platform producing a tenth of that in Mari-B. I'm just kind of trying to understand how you optimize a lot of redundancy. It's kind of like if you build it, it will come. I'm wondering, if having all that capacity available and more reliable operations if you like if there's a latent customer base that is looking out late to ramp quicker. That's kind of really what I was trying to get at.","Dave Stover","Yeah. And that'll play itself out especially as we get into 2020 and everything is up and running and you start to get this ramped up \u2013 Leviathan ramped up. And you see what that demand is and folks start to see as we talked earlier that it's more and more real. It's here, it's now you've got both Leviathan and Tamar and they're very low-cost sources of supply. And go back to how Tamar ramped up and how it \u2013 quickly it ramped up through demand once it came online and I think that's a good precursor, if you will for how we could see 2020 and 2021 playing out. Your point is exactly right.","Taking advantage of existing infrastructure is going to be an incremental benefit as we move forward here in the basin. And the way Keith and his team have laid this out with their preplanning that we can take this platform from 1.2 Bcf a day to 2.1 Bcf a day and we can do it now in increments, as its demand dictates it's going to be a benefit. So all of this \u2013 infrastructure in place just continues to build on that and that's the importance of also having multiple outlets and multiple pipeline takeaways.","Doug Leggate","We think it's almost the entire value of company right now where your share price is trading. But anyway, my follow-up is really a quick one. Just on the capital guide for next year obviously you're talking about material reductions. I assume the 5% to 10% ex major projects is still a good number on a go-forward basis associated with that decline in spending. But I'm wondering if you could just give us an idea of what you're sustaining capital is in the event the oil prices did come under pressure given all the macro micro stuff going on. What is the sustaining capital when Leviathan is online to hold your exit rate this year flat? I don't know if you've got something like that to hand, but some kind of ballpark would be helpful.","Dave Stover","Yes. I think, when we talked about it last year we kind of -- or earlier this year, we laid out a maintenance capital. If you go back to that one slide where we laid out the maintenance capital and then we had two tranches above that. And that was then probably...","Doug Leggate","1.6, right?","Dave Stover","Yes. 1.5, 1.6 type range. And I think the nice part of what Brent and his team's working on -- what the whole organization is working on is improving the capital efficiency, lowering our capital intensity and we'll see where we get to at the end of the year. But it's -- I don't see it being higher than that.","Doug Leggate","Great stuff. Thanks for taking my questions, guys, and congrats.","Dave Stover","Thank you, Doug.","Operator","The next question will come from Scott Hanold of RBC. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold","Yeah. Thank you. If I could just add on to that last question. And as you look at these well cost reductions, they were fairly significant so far this year, especially in the onshore and you're seeing a lot of inefficiencies. And how does this help craft your thoughts about U.S. onshore spending as you go into 2020, 2021 where you've got large projects really supporting some pretty solid growth?","Dave Stover","Well the focus in 2020, 2021 will be delivering that free cash flow. So the spending will fall out of that. But all of this work that the team's been doing and all of the progress we've been making on lowering and improving those efficiencies is just going to help in that regard. But I don't know, Brent, anything else to add there?","Brent Smolik","Yes. I would just say, notionally, we're not thinking of higher activity levels, Scott, we're thinking of similar activity levels without finalizing a budget which would imply lower than we previously had planned capital, because of the efficiencies.","Scott Hanold","Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then, as my follow-up. If I can refer to page five, a little bit more on the well cost in the DJ and Delaware and what really stands out is the marked shift in the cost savings on well design in the DJ Basin. And correct me if I'm wrong, if that's doing the lower fluid fracs, is that something that you're going to test soon in the Delaware? Is that something that could actually be another incremental saving for the Delaware wells?","Brent Smolik","Yes. It's possible. We don't have any of them to report on yet. But if we convince ourselves that we can get the same productivities and EURs in the DJ, then it'd be something that'll be transportable elsewhere.","Scott Hanold","Okay. Like, how long, though, do you need on DJ data to make that determination? Is that something that could be a 2020 initiative?","Brent Smolik","Yes. Even late this year, we might try to put some in the ground. But, I think, of it as longer term in the Delaware. And then, I want to point out too, that's not the only thing that's included in that design change bucket. We talk about it, because it's a big and noteworthy accomplishment, but we've changed the design on how we go about executing on the frac jobs in a lot of ways. We're pumping down perforating guns faster, we're pumping down plugs faster, we're getting -- we're changing chemistries along with the fluid volumes. There's just a lot of things that we're doing and the design changes that add up to a big number.","Scott Hanold","Okay. And so, is it more advanced right now in the DJ? Is that why you're seeing a bigger step change in the DJ versus the Delaware?","Brent Smolik","I think we're seeing a bigger step change, because we've made more design changes and they're more advanced. In the Permian, we saw bigger supply chain reductions, because there have been so much inflation that we've clawed some of that back.","Scott Hanold","Understood. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question today will come from Welles Fitzpatrick of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Welles Fitzpatrick","Hey, good morning.","Dave Stover","Good morning, Welles.","Welles Fitzpatrick","You guys talked about Saddlehorn and that detail is great. But can you point us to where you're looking for relief on the gas in the NGL side and the DJ, whether that's Cheyenne or some other project coming up?","Brent Smolik","Yes. I think, on the gas side, I think, we'll see some relief as soon as DCP works through the current restart of the plant, the O'Connor plant two or DCP Plant 11. And that'll happen we think in -- next week it'll start to ramp back up again. And so, the gas is going to debottleneck itself. I think, by the third and fourth quarter we'll see enough NGL capacity where the constraints in the basin will get relieved. I think that will clear itself up in the near term and we've factored that into our updated guidance.","Dave Stover","I think you're also seeing some conversion going in place on NGL line with white cliffs up there too, that should be helpful. I think it's finished up here.","Welles Fitzpatrick","Okay. Okay. Perfect. And then, for my follow-up. On the new proposed Colorado AQCC emissions rules, I know you guys stayed pretty far ahead of that. Is it fair to say that there won't be significant incremental costs? And also, could that open up any opportunistic A&D as maybe smaller companies exit?","Dave Stover","Yes. No telling on A&D. That's just not something we're focusing on up there. I think that the main focus for us, as we talked about earlier is getting this next Comprehensive Development Plan in place, the CDP. And I think that's one of the things that will enable us to stay ahead of the game up there, just as the original one has.","Brent Smolik","Yes. And on the emissions side, I mean, we already enjoy low emissions, because we've been focused on it for some time. The biggest advantages we have is a lot of the operation -- a lot of the surface facilities are nearly tankless. And we've -- we're looking at designs that both reduce emissions further and reduce cost which is the best of both worlds.","Welles Fitzpatrick","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question today will come from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","Michael Hall","Excuse me. Thanks. Good morning and solid work this quarter. I was just curious on the -- some near-term stuff, the July volumes you posted for the U.S. onshore are already tracking pretty darn close to the full 3Q U.S. onshore guide. How should we think about the rest of the quarter from an activity standpoint? Is there some sort of lull in August that we should expect or backloading in the quarter? Have you really just curious the third quarter already pretty substantially with the July result?","Dave Stover","Yes. It's a little unusual for us to give you an estimate for the next quarter. But we thought it was important because enough of those TILs came on late in the second quarter across the company, really in all areas. It has meaningful impact on the third quarter growth and we're seeing it. It's showing up. And so that was the key message.","If you go forward, I pointed out in the comments that in the Eagle Ford, we're done with drilling and completing wells this year. We do have a refrac pilot that'll happen later in the year, but it won't be meaningful in terms of the production profile. So we'll see Eagle Ford decline. It'll grow significantly from second to third and then decline significantly from third to fourth. The other parts of the business DJ and Delaware will see the step up to third quarter and then a little bit of growth in the Q4.","Michael Hall","Okay. Make sense. And then I was just curious on the -- kind of bigger picture on the 2019 capital program you know taking down the CapEx, obviously a positive. You had TILs a bit ahead of schedule in the first half, efficiencies have been outpacing expectations.","How are you guys thinking about the potential for efficiencies to continue improving in the back half? And then putting it in a position where you're kind of continuing to put on more wells than originally planned? Would you do -- would you bias towards a frac holiday in the back half of the year, or how would you manage capital, I guess is what I'm trying to get out of here?","Brent Smolik","Let me kind of take it in bite-size pieces. If you go back to our original plan, we had always planned to be a little bit front half loaded on our completion activity in TILs and back half loaded on production because of the lag when it shows up.","We have accelerated some of the TILs into the second quarter due to efficiency gains. We'll add a few at the end of the year. So our profile front half to second half looks a lot like, we budgeted and we're kind of on plan with it.","To the efficiency gain part of it you're talking about is the reason, I signal that we've set some records recently in drilling and completions is because if we can do that once we can replicate it and we are replicating it in the programs in the second half of the year. So we do expect to continue to drive efficiencies into Q2 that could accelerate production a little more.","But in regards to the way we think about the end of the year, we're not targeting a number of completions. It's more about designing a smooth glide path into the year as we idle equipment that we had already -- we've always had plan to have some holidays at the end of the year.","And so you just want to make sure you do that as efficiently as possible where we don't stop in the middle of the pad, disrupt any of our supply chain, stop when we don't have facilities full right in the immediate area. There's a lot of things that are important to think about as you ramp down and ramp back up again later.","And so that's how we're \u2013 we are trying to design it to be as efficient as possible both in how we take out cost as we're doing it and as that we slow it down.","Michael Hall","Great. That makes a lot of sense. And then in that glide path it seems to kind of suggest the 2020 rate U.S. onshore capital spend is probably hitting lower relative to prior expectations. Is that a fair comment? And does that bias free cash flow higher in terms of relative to prior expectations on 2020?","Brent Smolik","We haven't fully baked 2020 yet. But all things being equal, we would expect the efficiencies to carry into 2020 and it would be positive to free cash flow.","Michael Hall","Great. Thanks guys. Okay, and congrats.","Brent Smolik","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Irene Haas of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.","Irene Haas","Congratulations, firstly, on Leviathan's process, it's been a long haul. And my question is related to East Med. And I think at one point you guys talk about a floating LNG and why is this coming back into the picture?","And what would be the incremental production you're thinking of monetizing using this sort of facility? And then also, how much lead time do you need and how would you finance it?","Dave Stover","Well, I can just tell you why we're even looking at it Irene and then Keith can talk to some of the other logistics of things. But the reason we're looking at it is for a longer term, say a, second and third phase of Leviathan potential and it just creates more optionality for us.","And we would view it and we would only do it as a low-cost option to create more optionality and broaden our marketing reach if you will. So those would be the reasons you look at it far from doing it at this point, but how we'd look at it, and as far as timing of how that would play out Keith any thoughts?","Keith Elliott","Yeah. I mean, I think just to build on Dave's points Irene, as you know, we've looked at FLNG before. I think the thing that's different now is we see the ability to connect with a proven vendor who's got systems up and running in other parts of the world. And they've come forth with an idea of taking processed gas stream off Leviathan and it becomes a very cost-competitive solution at least in the initial looks at it.","As far as timing, we're early days, we're into the feed now. And so it's something as Dave said, it's a second phase project that's a few years down the road.","Dave Stover","Yes. And this would need to compete with the other things that would be in our plan that were laid out there. So it's not a capital change, it's nothing different from that standpoint. It's just creating optionality and potentially broadening our market reach for long-term value.","Irene Haas","If I may have a follow-up? Does it sound like -- does this vendor will actually -- is it going to be a leasing, or do you have to -- how much money do you think you need to put in? Then, lastly, any action in Cyprus?","Dave Stover","Yeah. I think I'd go back to my original comment. The only way we would do it if it's a very low-cost option for us compared to other things we'd be looking at. That's what it would take to compete. So far from firming anything up there, but that would be the gist of it. Cyprus those discussions are ongoing there's been a lot of progress towards that. That's something that's still can have tremendous value longer-term, but it's probably a step behind Leviathan obviously in the queue right now.","Irene Haas","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Deckelbaum of Cowen. Please go ahead.","David Deckelbaum","Good morning guys. Thanks for the time.","Dave Stover","Sure. Hi, Dave.","David Deckelbaum","I just -- when you guys lowered your capital budget for the year this $100 million delta, I guess, is that entirely coming out of U.S. onshore, I guess, because I know other people have asked around Eastern Med spending. But relative to the $550 million to $600 million budget that you laid out, I know you're trending a bit below that at this point. What kind of visibility do you have for the rest of the year in terms of the Leviathan budget particularly as U.S. onshore comes down for the rest of the year?","Brent Smolik ","Yeah. I think you should think of it right now as primarily U.S. onshore the $100 million. But you're right in pointing out that we're 90% complete and we've effectively derisked some of the important phrases. We've derisked the subsea wells, the subsea tie-insurance, the umbilicals pipelines and most of the fabrication. And so now we're down to install and commissioning -- final commissioning.","So we are getting -- we are the project is trending well. So we are optimistic that there'll be some room, but think primarily of it as the U.S. onshore realized savings that we have dialed in.","Dave Stover","Probably have a better line of sight to how the final Leviathan capital turn out as we get the platform set and we get through the third quarter, and then we'll be able to get more expectation around that. But to Brent's point it's been a well-managed, well-run project and I'm extremely pleased with where we are.","David Deckelbaum","Appreciate that. Could you just add a little bit more color around the exploration targets for next year? I guess, namely in Colombia. Have you identified targets already? At what point in the calendar is -- endeavor is going to start taking place? And do you sort of have a loose budget in mind for exploratory and diverse next year?","Dave Stover","Yeah. I think when you go back to what we've talked about on total exploration capital, which would be the drilling and the other components we've talked about $100 million to $130 million or so. I think Colombia itself would be of one well probably the second half of the year most likely. We've -- us and a partner is working with the government or finalizing the targets it's pretty much set.","Again, the target to be hopefully an oil play. That's probably some of the real remaining question there. It's got fairly high for an exploration project piece of G or chance of finding hydrocarbons, but our team is really focused on a liquid oil play potential there. And that'll be exciting to get drilled and tested there in the second half of next year.","David Deckelbaum","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","The next question will come from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles Meade ","Good morning, Dave and Brent and the rest of your team there.","Dave Stover","Hi, Charles.","Charles Meade ","Dave I wanted to go back -- this has been touched on a few times in the Q&A, but I want to go back to your comments in your prepared remarks about the 2020 CapEx outlook. And I'm not trying to pin you guys down on anything, but I more want to get a sense of what are some of the big pieces that are on play? And I think the one biggest piece looking at 2020 over 2019 would be Eastern Med CapEx. And you guys guided to $550 million to $600 million this year and it's not going to go to zero, but there's going to be a big chunk that comes out there. What are the other pieces that we should be thinking about as we try to think about how 2020 might look?","Dave Stover","Well, to your point it's still early. We'll be pouring the budget later this year. And some of the things that we know about already though obviously you've got Alen capital that will be higher next year obviously than this year. So that would be the one increasing piece.","There'll still be some capital as you mentioned in the Eastern Med and some of the feed work, some of the planning that we've talked about for some of the things to stay ahead of market moving forward.","And then the other big pieces will be the year-on-year movement in onshore and we'll just have to see how that plays out, how the efficiencies and the continued momentum play out.","I think the other piece we just touched on is exploration will be a little bit higher next year as we go back to drilling at least as it's laid out now. I mean those are just some of the components and obviously we'll have more color as we get into the end of the year.","Charles Meade","Got it. Thank you for that, Dave. And then if I could ask a question about the Delaware Basin and less about what happened with laurel, but more kind of your -- the longer trajectory there. Where -- you guys have a graphic in your presentation. It shows I guess the gun barrel view on your spacing there. Can you talk about how much you've iterated? And maybe how close you are to being comfortable with the final decision on what well spacing is at least in the $55 or $60 world? And if you think you provided the right development concept for the current set of conditions or if there's still more to learn and you have to do?","Brent Smolik","Charles, I think the high level answer is yes. We've been pretty consistent in three wells in the Third Bone per section and six in the Wolfcamp A. So I think we're happy with the spacing. I think what you hear and spend more time talking about is landing zone, getting very specific about landing zones and then optimize completion designs, the frac designs. And that's something we've got to be really mindful of even as we move north, south, east, west in the field. So those -- I think the spacing we're pretty comfortable with and we're happy with that and one example of the Calamity Jane that we've got in the deck there.","Charles Meade","Thanks for that. Have a good day, Brent.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jeanine Wai of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jeanine Wai","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Brent Smolik","Good morning, Jeanine.","Jeanine Wai","Morning. My first question is on the Delaware. You continue to just have more activity in the northern part of your acreage and the results are really good. And it looks like the south has been trending around 25% of completions in Q1 and Q2 of this year. So just wanted to understand, how you think north versus south will be trending in activity in 2020 and if you have any HBP requirements in the south that may be coming up? And just overall how much activity can the southern central gathering facility handle?","Brent Smolik","We haven't guided yet to the specifics on 2020. But I think you should assume that we're in a similar frame of mind that we're going to fill up the CGS, we've got three very large ones in the north. We've built the superstructure infrastructure to be able to connect them all this year, so we have a lot more operational or at least the midstream company has done that to give us operational flexibility to move volumes around.","We've got capacity in the facility to the south. There we have seen some fairly high rate wells delivered in the south and we think that's a function of completion design and landing zone again. So we're going to continue to do some activity down there. And so I think you can think of it as similar in our strategy and approach.","Jeanine Wai","Okay, great. And then my follow-up question. I wanted to circle back on Michael's earlier question. Efficiencies are clearly going better than expected, which is good. And we noticed that the prior 2019 completions guidance implied only eight in the DJ and four completions in the Delaware in the fourth quarter. But I think I heard you say in your prepared comments that you're now planning on doing more than that with overall less CapEx. So just wanted to clarify that to make sure we got that?","And I'm asking because we just want to understand how you're thinking about kind of the double-edge sword at this point given the space with activity and growth with better than expected efficiencies. And we know that you had the commentary out there that in 2020 you've expected to have the same activity that you laid out in the prior two-year plan but potentially on lower CapEx. And just wanted to square your thoughts on how things are heading into 2020 given the overall focus on free cash flow and the inflection next year?","Brent Smolik","I mean there's a lot in there. I think the way to summarize it is that our thinking is really unchanged. We're delivering on what we said we were going to do this year and we're doing it more cost effectively. And that's going to allow us to do a few more completions in primarily the DJ, but a couple more in Delaware but it's really not a big change. And then those efficiencies will be -- we think or the kind of the things that are sticky and so we'll carry them over into our activity for 2020.","Dave Stover","And I guess, Jeanine the main point there as we look to 2020 we're not fixated on an activity level. What we're focused on is delivering the free cash flow.","Jeanine Wai","Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Leo Mariani of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Leo Mariani","Hi guys. A question on the DJ. Just wanted to get a sense if you guys are seeing anything incrementally on the regulatory cost side, starting to flow through to all year, past the recent energy bill there. What are you guys seeing on the ground there?","Dave Stover","It's probably too early to really seen anything. By that I mean, they're still working through some of that rulemaking. And I think again, I'll go back to our big benefit instead of having to go for one-off permit. We are getting a lot of them done at the same time to be efficient whether it was that regional CDP or the one that's in the system now. So that will be a thing that will make us the most cost-efficient operator in the basin.","Leo Mariani","Okay. And I guess on the midstream side they're on the DJ. Obviously, it sounds like it's debottlenecking nicely here over the next several months. Do you guys have any significant shut-in volumes you think might be returning? And is there any way to kind of quantify that?","Brent Smolik","The only place I would point you -- this is Brent again. The only place I would point you to is in that July estimate that we gave you. That includes say 7 to 10 days of some of this interruption that we've seen on the DCP system and we were still able to deliver the numbers that we released in July.","Dave Stover","And I think to Brent's point that highlights the work that's been done over the last year or two to provide multiple outlets and give us more flexibility in the basin and that's always the key.","Leo Mariani","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from Michael Scialla of Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.","Michael Scialla","Hey, good morning. I think this year's plan originally included $500 million to $1 billion of divestitures. Just want to see if you could talk about where that process stands?","Dave Stover","Yes. We're on track with that. We've got multiple ways to deliver that and as those get firmed up, we'll talk about them, but feel good about being on track with the whole program.","Michael Scialla","Great. And Brent, you talked about it quite a bit in terms of the design changes you are making with the lower fluid and proppant and obviously seen lower cost of benefit there and early rate benefit. Just wondering if there's -- are you thinking in terms of maybe at the trade-off with longer-term REITs? And do you have enough data there to show that the economics are superior with the lower-intensity frac?","Brent Smolik","I think we have confidence that the returns will be higher, which is the biggest driver. We don't have proved yet long term that the EURs will be the same or higher. But when we run sensitivity is we're still better off even if we saw a modest reduction in EUR because the cost benefit and accelerated production offset any other loss in the EUR. So we're happy with the returns that we're seeing from it.","Michael Scialla","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Gail Nicholson of Stephens. Please go ahead.","Gail Nicholson","Good morning everyone. Brent, in one of the answers to a question you talked about the importance going forward of kind of landing in the optimal landing zone in the Delaware. When you kind of look at the programs to ,date what do you think the percent of current execution has been landed in the optimal zone? And kind of how much improvement do you think that you guys can achieve kind of over the next 18 months?","Brent Smolik","I don't had answered the percentage of wells. But we have varied landing zones even like within the Wolfcamp A. If you go back and look in time, you'll hear us talk about Wolfcamp A up or Wolfcamp A lower. Inside of that, there's various spaces that we're moving around in. And so part of what we are doing in addition to the capital-efficiency improvements is looking at all data in the basin and all operators and taking additional core data and doing some analysis of the core. It's all designed toward optimizing landing zones and completion designs. So it's all work under -- in progress. So I think that's a long way of saying there's additional room -- additional improvement to be had by narrowing down and locking in on landing zones.","Gail Nicholson","Okay. Great. And then my follow-up is going back to the nonproductive time, you mentioned you've seen a good improvement there. Can you quantify where the nonproductive time is today? And where it was in 4Q? And how it differs in the DJ versus Delaware?","Brent Smolik","DJ versus Delaware, they were similar. In our DJ Basin, we had as much as three hours between stages in the worst case and we've been able to get that down to 30 minutes or so. And so we had similar kinds of inefficiencies in the Delaware program. Those were the same kinds of things we've been chasing out in both places.","Gail Nicholson","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Brad Whitmarsh for any closing remarks.","Brad Whitmarsh","Thanks, Allison again and appreciate everybody joining us today. Should you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Park, Kim or myself. Hope everybody has a great weekend.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."],"15221":["Noble Energy (NASDAQ:NBL) Q1 2013 Earnings Call April 25, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","David R.

Welcome to the Noble Energy's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. I would now like to turn the call over to David Larson. Please go ahead.","David R. Larson","Thanks, Camille. Good morning,everyone. Welcome to Noble Energy's first quarter 2013 earnings call and webcast. On the call today, we have Chuck Davidson, Chairman and CEO; Dave Stover, President and COO; and Ken Fisher, CFO.","This morning, we issued our earnings release for the first quarter, and it is available on our website. Later today, we expect to be filing our 10-Q with the SEC, and it will also be available on our website.","The agenda for today will begin with Chuck discussing the quarter and followed by an update of our Eastern Mediterranean business and highlights of our ongoing Exploration program. Dave will then give a detailed overview of our operational programs and near-term plans. We'll leave time for Q&A at the end and plan to wrap up the call in less than an hour. [Operator Instructions]","I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains projections and forward-looking statements based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. We provide no assurances on these statements as a number of factors and uncertainties could cause actual results in the future periods to differ materially from what we discuss here. You should read our full disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that influence our business.","We'll also be referencing certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted net income or discretionary cash flow on the call today. When we refer to these items, it's because we believe they are good metrics to use in evaluating the company's performance. Be sure to see the reconciliation in our earnings release tables.","With that, let me turn the call over to Chuck.","Charles D. Davidson","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I have to say right upfront that it looks like we're off to a great start for the year. As we go over our results and outlook during this call, I'm sure you'll reach the same conclusion.","My list of highlights for the quarter include strong earnings and strong cash flow, as well as solid production, all of which came in a bit higher than we expected. But certainly surpassing all of these was a surprise of experiencing the Tamar startup late in the quarter. Not only did Tamar start up a few weeks early, it then almost immediately began setting records for gas sales to Israel. A smooth and successful start up of Tamar really sets the stage for us for a great 2013.","The projects of the scale and complexity of Tamar are not easy to execute, much less execute under a compressed schedule that resulted in going from discovery to production in just 4 years. The project performance we've delivered at Aseng in West Africa and now Tamar in Israel are showcasing an emerging Noble competitive advantage, and that is the ability to consistently deliver major projects on schedule and on budget.","So this morning, I'll highlight what I believe has been an excellent quarter. I'll review the financial results, and then I'll touch upon the outlook for the upcoming quarters before turning the call over to Dave, who will provide a more detailed operational outlook.","So let's look at our performance for the quarter. Adjusted net income from continuing operations for the first quarter was $269 million or $1.48 per share diluted. Excluded from adjusted net income were unrealized losses from commodity hedges and gains on some non-core asset divestments in the first quarter. Revenues were $1.1 billion for the quarter, supported by another quarter of strong crude realizations.","Our sales volumes for the quarter were 245,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 39% were crude and condensate volumes. Volumes for the quarter were significantly above the high end of our guidance due to stronger-than-expected performance in Israel, the Gulf of Mexico and the DJ Basin.","Adjusting for divestments, our year-over-year volume growth was 9%, and the growth was almost entirely due to increased crude oil volumes from the DJ Basin. Domestic sales totaled 146,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 23% from the first quarter of 2012, excluding volumes from divested assets. Domestic results for the quarter exceeded our expectations as a result of the horizontal program in the DJ Basin and the faster return to production of Swordfish in the Gulf of Mexico.","Internationally, sales volumes were 99,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 6% from the first quarter of 2012, but above our expectations due to stronger-than-expected volumes from Noa and Pinnacles in Israel, which delivered net production of 110 million cubic feet equivalent per day. As expected, West Africa sales volumes were down due to scheduled underliftings.","Our discretionary cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was $761 million, up 10% from the first quarter of 2012. Our liquidity position remains extremely strong at more than $5.3 billion, with $1.3 billion of cash on hand.","Also in the quarter, we made progress on our non-core asset divestment program. We closed 2 divestment packages, one in the North Sea and one consisting of some Gulf Coast assets and received proceeds of approximately $90 million. We also signed a sales agreement on a package of Mid-Continent gas assets that is expected to close in the second quarter. We expect to divest of some additional non-core assets later this year as well.","As I look forward to the rest of the year, I'm excited about the operational successes that we're experiencing. Onshore, we're on track to drill 300 wells this year in the DJ Basin, and we're testing various horizontal lateral patterns across several target zones to increase our recovery per section. We're drilling longer laterals than we have ever had done before, and we're seeing some extended-reach lateral well production curves that now appear to be tracking an estimated ultimate recovery curve of 1 million barrels of oil equivalent.","In the Marcellus, we plan to drill 120 wells this year in cooperation with our joint venture partner, CONSOL. Our emphasis remains in the wet gas area where we anticipate adding rigs this year to support the program. In our offshore business units, our appraisal program support scheduled sanctions for later this year. I believe that one of the reasons we have been so successful in bringing our major projects to production on schedule is that our appraisal programs have allowed us to design a properly sized and effective development scenarios.","In the Gulf of Mexico, we expect to complete our appraisal well at Gunflint during the second quarter. We do expect that in the coming weeks, we'll be penetrating a deeper exploration target previously untested on the Gunflint structure, which, if successful, provides significant upside. Following our drilling and analysis there, we would expect the sanction a development at Gunflint later this year. Following Gunflint, we plan to spud exploration wells at Troubadour and another prospect before the end of the year. We also plan to sanction a second development in the Gulf of Mexico in our Big Bend discovery by year-end.","In West Africa, our land project continues to follow an accelerated plan, targeting a third quarter startup, and Dave will provide you an update on our progress there. We're drilling a second appraisal well at Carla and working towards a sanction of a project there later this year. Following Carla, we plan to begin an appraisal at Diega.","Looking more closely at the Eastern Mediterranean programs, I was in Israel recently and can really see the impact of our efforts there. We're supplying natural gas to Israel at a higher rate than we ever have before. In fact, we tested the field that delivery is equivalent to over 950 million cubic feet per day. We expect the facility to deliver at full capacity during the peak summer demand period in the third quarter, and Dave will fill you in on some of the details on our operations at Tamar later in the call.","Israel Electric Corporation recently exercised its option to increase the amount of natural gas it will purchase from Tamar. This further supports the need to initiate a second phase of Tamar soon. The new coalition government was recently formed in Israel, and the new leaders are becoming familiar with the items on their country's energy policy agenda, which includes energy exports. Our expectation is that the export policy is one of the early issues that the new government will be addressing. Clarity on an export policy is essential as we finalize the farmout agreement with Woodside, which in turn will bring us closer to sanctioning the first phase at Leviathan.","On the exploration front, we finished an appraisal well during the quarter at Leviathan, which increased our gross mean resource estimate there at the field to 18 trillion cubic feet. Coupled with the announced increase and resource estimates at Tamar, these 2 fields gross mean resources now total 28 trillion cubic feet. With necessary government support, we anticipate sanctioning Leviathan later this year.","We're currently drilling our Karish prospect offshore Israel, which is a 3 Tcf prospect. Our analysis and modeling has verified through our earlier successes, and we believe this well has a very high chance of success. Following Karish, we plan to move over to Cyprus and spud an appraisal well at our 7 Tcf Cyprus discovery.","With respect to our new ventures exploration programs, we completed 3D seismic surveys in 2 different sections of our tight oil play in Northeast Nevada late last year. We're finishing our analysis and plan to initiate our vertical test program in the third quarter. Bear in mind, this is exploration drilling, not factory drilling, like we're accustomed to in the DJ Basin. This will be slower drilling, especially initially, but we expect to have some preliminary results later this year. We have a 100% working interest in our 350,000 net acre position.","We're on track to spud our first exploration well, an appraisal prospect offshore Nicaragua in the third quarter. We secured a drilling rig and are actively evaluating bid proposals on this world-class exploration opportunity and anticipate farming down our ownership before spudding the well. We expect the farm-down to include our entire acreage position, which has multiple prospects identified. Appraisal alone may contain 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We estimate the entire acreage position has a gross unrisked resource of nearly 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent.","We personally hold a 100% working interest and expect the farm-down to a level of 40% to 50% interest. In the Falkland Islands, we've acquired almost 1.5 million acres of 3D seismic. In Sierra Leone, we're completing an initial 2D seismic survey of our acreage, which will direct the future 3D program. And finally, our new build drillship should arrive on location in the Eastern Mediterranean around year-end, with a spud of our deep Mesozoic oil prospect below the Leviathan field.","In closing, the first quarter served as an excellent start to the year, and we really remain well-positioned to deliver on our expectations for the year and beyond as we continue with this period of very significant growth.","Earlier this week, we announced that we have increased our quarterly dividend by 12%, as well as announcing a 2-for-1 stock split. These actions reflect our confidence in our ability to execute on the plans we've previously communicated to you.","Now I'll turn the call over to Dave, who will provide some more details on our ongoing operations.","David L. Stover","Thank you, Chuck. As you mentioned, we had an exciting quarter in the Eastern Mediterranean as we began production at Tamar. Late last month, we initiated flow from the Tamar field through the world's longest subsea tied back to the platform and then to the Ashdod Onshore Terminal. It took less than a week to bring on all 5 subsea wells and stabilize flow, which was a remarkable feat by our project team. Each of the 5 wells has been cycled up to the design capacity of 250 million cubic feet per day. With the startup, we shifted over 300 million barrels of oil equivalent of proved undeveloped reserves -- with proved developed reserves, and we increased the gross mean resource estimate of Tamar by 1 trillion cubic feet to 10 trillion cubic feet total.","Looking forward, we plan to continue producing from our fields at Mari-B, Noa and Pinnacles until they are depleted. As they continue to deplete, we will ramp up Tamar volumes as necessary to support the Israel demand. We've seen strong demand and expect it to increase as we enter the peak summer season.","At times in the third quarter, it seems likely that we will deliver up to the maximum capacity of the development, which is approximately 1 billion cubic feet per day. We're working to sanction the second phase of Tamar, which will increase the system capacity to 1.5 billion cubic feet per day by 2015. The capacity increase will be through a combination of increased compression, system optimization and the use of storage at the existing Mari-B reservoir.","As Chuck commented, Israel Electric Corporation exercised its option to purchase additional natural gas beginning in 2015. The second phase will support the additional sales.","With respect to exploration, we're drilling the Karish prospect in Israel followed by our first appraisal well in Cyprus. The drillship, Atwood Advantage, will be mobilizing to the Eastern Mediterranean late in the year, and is targeted to spud the Mesozoic oil prospect beneath Leviathan. As I've mentioned a number of times, I can't wait to test this breakout play concept and look forward to having the capability of this new drillship.","In West Africa, Aseng production was nearly 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day gross, with decline expected to start this quarter. At our non-operated asset, Elba, we expect some planned maintenance downtime this quarter. Our next big operated project, Alen, is progressing very well. I'm confident this will be our fourth major project in a row with outstanding execution. Platform installation was completed by the same vessel that installed the Tamar platform, the [indiscernible]. Subsea installation and commissioning is complete. Major hookups are approximately 80% complete, and facilities commissioning is approximately 40% complete.","The Alen development is now scheduled for first production in the third quarter, with production ramping up to 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net. The condensate volumes at Alen will be transported via a pipeline to the Aseng FPSO for offloading. In Carla, we completed appraisal of a well in Block O. Following a planned sidetrack, we flow-tested 2 separate zones. The test confirmed that both zones are productive, one with oil, the other with condensate.","Earlier this month, we spud another well to test similar objectives to the south in Block I. Results are expected near the end of the quarter, and we will be analyzing development options for a potential sanction later in the year. One scenario is to flow Carla to the Aseng FPSO via subsea tiebacks. Shifting over to the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we restored production of Swordfish following some unplanned downtime. We will be replacing an umbilical there next month resulting in 2 weeks of downtime, and we'll also be impacted by about a month of downtime at Galapagos for planned maintenance at the host platform.","We recently increased our working interest in Gunflint to 31% from 26%, and are currently drilling our second appraisal well. This well should complete our appraisal drilling and will help determine our development plan. There is a deep exploration zone to this well, which if successful can result in a standalone development. We expect results late second quarter or early third quarter, with a possible sanction to follow later in the year.","Following the Gunflint appraisal, we plan to drill the offset to our Big Bend discovery at Troubadour. If successful, Troubadour would likely be another subsea tieback similar to Big Bend. We expect to sanction Big Bend this year, and is possible that Troubadour could be sanctioned at the same time and codeveloped with Big Bend.","Following Troubadour, we plan to spud another exploration well. We have a number of potential candidates. We'll be maintaining a one-rig program in the Gulf of Mexico through the end of the year.","Moving onshore, our domestic production continues to be led by our growing DJ Basin program, as shown in Slide 5 of the packet. For the quarter, sales from the DJ Basin averaged 92,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 7% over the fourth quarter and 25% over the first quarter last year.","This month, we have been impacted by a series of spring snowstorms, which has affected our ability to move volumes and bring on new production. We've taken that into account in our second quarter guidance.","The horizontal program contributed 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 49% of the first quarter DJ production. This progress is amazing when you consider first quarter last year, we averaged 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the horizontal activity. We continue to see the impact of the increased oil production from this program as crude oil accounted for 49% of the production for the quarter.","Total liquids volumes were 63% of production, with natural gas accounting for the remaining 37%. We continue to expand our drilling activity as we recently added our ninth horizontal rig in March and plan to add our tenth rig later this quarter. We spud 56 horizontal wells in the first quarter, of which 10 were extended-reach laterals.","Our extended-reach lateral wells continue to perform extremely well. We'll drill approximately 60 wells this year with lateral lengths generally between 6,500 and 9,500 feet.","As shown on Slide 6, we now have substantial production history on 4 wells that averaged 9,100 feet, and the average production is tracking well above the 750,000-barrel of oil equivalent type curve. It's interesting to point out that 2 of the wells are tracking at a 1 million-barrel type curve. This highlights how far the transformation this field has come when you think back just 3 years ago, and the average new vertical well was started getting 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per well.","Slide 7 shows production curves of 5 wells with an average lateral length approaching 7,000 feet. These production curves are tracking above a 540,000-barrel of oil equivalent type curve. We recently finished drilling 8 extended-reach lateral wells in one section with 7 of the 8 laterals extending beyond 7,000 feet. The wells are currently being completed, and we expect initial production from all 8 late in the second quarter. We continue to push this program, and a fact we believe we have drilled the longest lateral in the State of Colorado at 9,978 feet.","With respect to our ongoing pilot programs, we're testing recoveries for multiple zones in various lateral patterns, as shown on Slide 8. What we have learned up to this point is that we need a minimum of 16 wells per section in the oil window to drain the B Bench of the Niobrara. We've also learned that the entire 300-foot section from the Niobrara A through the Codell is productive, and it is apparent that more than one well is required to vertically drain the 300-foot section.","It also appears that the B Bench performs as expected even with tightly spaced wells in the A Bench, C Bench and the Codell. We continue to focus on additional pilot testing in an effort to understand the optimum recovery plan with respect to density, lateral length, multiple zones and zone patterns.","We're testing a handful of different patterns across the oil window, and we have several more on the drawing board. We're doing this while drilling our crude oil production significantly and continuing to accelerate the pace of our horizontal development.","We see significant upside to our recoverable resource numbers, which are currently based on an average of approximately 10 wells per section. Further north, we're actively developing our 45,000 net acre East Pony area, as shown on Slide 9. We now have 27 wells on production, and we'll be drilling between 50 and 60 wells there this year. These wells continue to generate 80% crude oil, and are among the highest returning assets in our portfolio.","Outside of East Pony, we're working to delineate our remaining 185,000 net acre position in Northern Colorado. With respect to crude oil infrastructure, infield oil gathering trunk line is scheduled to begin service with an initial capacity of 50,000 barrels per day in September. This line will help us deliver crude oil efficiently to the White Cliffs Pipeline and the plain's rail facility. The rail facility is scheduled to begin service in the third quarter of this year with a capacity of 68,000 barrels per day.","The rail facility diversifies our sales portfolio and gives us market options to the Gulf Coast, the West Coast or the East Coast. The White Cliffs pipeline capacity will essentially be doubled when the loop of the existing line is completed in the second quarter of next year.","On the gas side, DCP is bringing on the LaSalle plant in September of this year, which will initially add 110 million cubic feet per day, and then will be expanded in the fourth quarter to 160 million cubic feet per day of total processing capacity of that facility. The 230 million cubic feet per day Lucerne [ph] 2 plants that's scheduled for service in 2014 followed by another 230 million cubic feet per day plant in 2015.","Also, our Kyoto gas plant is scheduled for startup in the third quarter of 2014, with a processing capacity of 30 million cubic feet per day. This plant alongside the Lilli Plant will support our growth in Northern Colorado. Next to our Kyoto plant, we'll be building the state's first LNG facility, and we'll be supplying our rigs and frac fleets with a clean fuel source from our own operated facility.","These efforts give us confidence on our ability to continue to bring our production to market, and we expect another year of significant growth from the DJ Basin.","Moving over to the Marcellus, we're operating 3 rigs in the wet gas area. Currently, we have 2 rigs operating in Majorsville and 1 rig operating in the Normantown area of West Virginia.","In Majorsville, we have 20 wells on production from 3 pads. Completion operations are finishing up at our fourth pad, the 11-well WEB 4 pad, which we'll bring into production in late June. Our fifth and sixth pads, the 10-well SHL 8 and the 7-well WFN 1 are finishing drilling operations soon, and are scheduled to begin completion operations in June.","In Normantown, we're breaking out a new development area. We've taken a core, and our analysis will guide our development going forward. We'll be completing drilling operations at our first Normantown pad, a 6-well pad, around mid-May. We'll begin completion operations there in late June.","We'll be adding a fourth rig to our wet gas operations in the second quarter. This rig will be utilized to break out another development area in Pennsboro, West Virginia. We also intend to add 2 more rigs to the wet gas area later in the year to support drilling a total of 85 to 90 wet gas wells this year. The current plan for 2013 has our partner, CONSOL, drilling 35 dry gas wells. The second order -- in the second quarter, CONSOL intends to bring 2 pads to production.","Let me talk about our volume guidance before we open the call for questions. Our full-year volume guidance remains unchanged at 270,000 to 282,000 barrels per day, and we expect second-quarter volumes to be 254,000 to 260,000 barrels per day. Second-quarter volumes will be up over the first quarter, primarily due to production from Tamar. Offsetting some of the increase are about 2,000 barrels per day impact from divestments of non-core onshore assets and another 10,000 barrels per day from items I mentioned earlier, including planned downtime in Equatorial Guinea and the Gulf of Mexico, along with the early quarter weather in the DJ Basin.","The second half of the year is expected to average around 300,000 barrels per day sales with increased demand at Israel, startup of Alen and accelerated ramp up in the DJ and the Marcellus wet gas programs. This mix of catalysts will allow us to deliver on our full-year volume guidance while absorbing some ongoing non-core asset sales.","In summary, both Chuck and I have discussed the activity that underpins our confidence in delivering the exceptional growth we've outlined late last year. The execution of the Tamar project and the progress on Alen continues to highlight the organization's ability to execute major projects and deliver on our promises.","Our appraisal activity this year at Leviathan, Gunflint, Carla and Cyprus, along with significant exploration wells in the Gulf of Mexico, Nicaragua, Eastern Mediterranean and Nevada, provide additional catalyst. All combined with expanding and growing programs in our onshore core areas provides an exciting year and a tremendous future.","Camille, it is now time to go ahead and open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A question, in the Niobrara, I know you completed 44 wells versus a 300 annual target. Should we expect the completions to be back-end loaded? And can you help me understand the pace on the completion side? And I have a follow-up.","David L. Stover","Well, the completions, as somewhat has expected, were a little less than average in the first quarter with some of the weather. But with -- as we mentioned, we're bringing in -- we've actually brought another rig in March, and we've got another rig coming in this quarter. So that activity will continue to ramp up through the year. And it won't be so much back-end loaded, they will be continual, I'd say, from this point forward.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And my follow-up or second question is I know you gave us a lot of data on Slide 9 on Northern Colorado. Do you have any color on the wells drilled outside of East Pony? And kind of what were the number of wells drilled outside that area within the quarter? I'll leave with that.","David L. Stover","No. I'd say still too early for that. We're just starting on some of that delineation up there. So that'll be towards the end of the year before we really have a lot of new insight on some of these, what I call, appraisal areas.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dave, could I just ask you to elaborate a little bit on your plans for the Phase 2 at Tamar? And I guess what's behind my question is I think in Chuck's prepared remarks, he talked about the sort of greater urgency to get that onstream quicker perhaps. Could you maybe just give us an update as to how you see the timeline there? And if you could perhaps clarify some of the government noise around gas prices as it relates to future expansions for both that and Leviathan, please? And I have a quick follow-up.","Charles D. Davidson","Sure, Doug. First, on the second phase of Tamar, Tamar is -- that phase is a combination of utilizing compression that we would install onshore, as well as the utilization of Mari-B for storage. And that's why it gives us that big uplift in capacity. I think Dave noted that it would raise the capacity to about 1.5 billion although we, again just like at Tamar right now, we wouldn't expect to be able to average at that level, but it raises the peak capacity. Again, the key is well storage, as well as compression to get there. And again, that project is expected to be ready to come onstream in 2015, and is actually needed to support the Israel Electric exercise of their option to expand their gas take. So all of that is tied together. Our contract with Israel Electric provided for that option to expand, and the pricing has already been set in that. So when it gets to pricing in Israel, really we've got multiple contracts that have already gone through the government review and approval. So it's hard for me to really comment on any other things that are maybe just more speculative in the media. We're very confident in terms of what our pricing is for our Tamar project.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. My follow-up hopefully quite quick. Are you now back funding the carry in the Marcellus? And if not, can you give us an idea when you might be starting to pay for that? And I'll leave it there.","David L. Stover","Well, just -- it's always hard to speculate on the forward curve, but again the contract provides that once Henry Hub prices average above $4 for 3 months, then our carry would come back on. So if we look at the forward curve, we would expect that perhaps sometime in the third quarter, the carry would begin again. So it's -- we're enjoying the benefits of the increased gas prices, and I would just say once again is we really like that structure in the contract and really protected us and aligned our partnership when we went through this period of very low gas prices.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Two questions for me on the Wattenberg. First, I know on the graphs you guys have put out showing the -- your well results versus type curve. I know in the past you have shown those as a rolling 3-day average, but I guess I'm just -- it struck me little more this time that given the volatility in that line and recognizes that rolling 3-day average that there's a lot a volatility that's hidden in there. And I'm wondering if you could kind of explain that. Is that, and I'm thinking maybe one possible explanation, is that sales rather than production?","David L. Stover","Yes, that's exactly what it is, Charles. That sale that has loads are being lifted from the tank.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. That's very good and easy and comforting explanation. And then the next point, which follows that or the next question rather, I think it's clear to most people who are following your story that you guys have a huge amount of inventory, drilling inventory here. 16 wells in a section just in the Niobrara B. But where do you think you are -- I imagine, first you have to identify the resource, then you have some idea of ranking the opportunities on a present value to cap and then at some point you're driving efficiencies to bring value forward. Where is most of your focus falling now on those kind of 3 areas, if you agree of looking at that way?","David L. Stover","Charles, we're approaching it on, let's call it, at least 3 fronts. I mean, this is outside of the other appraisal effort going on in Northern Colorado. But if you think about it, you go back to what we're looking at the aerial recovery, which is that number of wells per section in just the B interval alone, if you start with that, and optimizing that on different parts of the field from Northern Colorado to the Greater Wattenberg oil portion. We're testing this vertical recovery. In other words, the impact of the A, the C and the Codell relative to the B, and then the other piece is this long lateral. If you start and you look at it, these long laterals seem to improve efficiency as we go with the 7,000 type or the 9,000. So it kind of starts with where can we fit in the long laterals and how do we do that in a way that we can improve our vertical recovery on some of this? So those are the things we're continuing to test as we develop this field out and evaluate these different patterns, if you will. If you noticed on that one slide, we showed some of the different pattern possibilities we're looking at. That's not all of them. That's an example of some that we're continuing to test and we'll be testing this year as we move through that answer to answer that specific question that you posed.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","And which of the -- I'm sorry to interrupt, but which of those 3, between the C, the B, the vertical -- or vertically in the column and the long laterals do you think is most important to you, Dave?","David L. Stover","Well, I think the real next breakthrough out here, if you will, will be the improved vertical recovery. In other words, how do you tie in the A and the C and the Codell with what you knows there in the B.","Charles D. Davidson","I think the key is that clearly, some patterns work better than others. And that is, I mean, that's -- that could be the key to really unlocking the optimal development. And we have to recognize there's geology at work here so that what works in one area, we might change in another area. So this is not just poking holes in the ground. It's a really good problem to work, and we're excited on it. And like you'd say, we've got a huge inventory there and we're going down a path of really trying to make it as efficient as possible while improving the recovery. But all of those pieces are important.","David L. Stover","And that's we're tying in the 3D seismic and everything is important here, too, as you do optimize different patterns across the field. It won't be one-size-fits-all as Chuck says.","Operator","Our next -- take our question, from Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question for any super extended laterals that you've got here in the DJ. Wanted to get a sense of where you have tested those, what sort of coverage on your acreage have you seen with the SXL test. And additionally, just wanted to get a sense of the progression of the EURs. Obviously, you kind of look like you've stepped these numbers up a little bit with some of your recent wells. Are these wells kind of continuing to get better as you drill more and more of these, and you guys are hopefully kind of optimizing or refining your techniques, sir?","David L. Stover","I think we have. I mean, to your point Leo, I think we've definitely seen improvement over the last year or 2 in how we bring wells on, how we maintain kind of a steady production, if you will, as we've seen on these -- especially the super long laterals as we've seen on these. Most of these so far have been up in that wells ranch type area, that Greater Wattenberg oil portion up there. But it was about 50 or 60 of these to drill this year, we're going to start to test some of this in some other areas. And again, a lot of it gets back to the geology on this, and especially tying in some of this 3D and making sure that we stay in zone and not crossing fault and things. And that's where that becomes really important in helping to direct and lay out your well pattern well plan.","So I'd say what we have been encouraged, especially when you look at the decline or the slow rate of decline on some of these extended laterals as you get further out in time. So the more information we've gotten, I'd say, as we started to see that, we got beyond those 90 days and gotten into 180 days and beyond, that was real encouraging on these extended reach.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess obviously, you mentioned some of your best wells could be approaching upwards of 1 million Boe per well, you guys could achieve results in that neighborhood. I mean, what kind of improvement you think you'd see in economics versus 5,000-foot laterals out here?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think just given indicative numbers. We already showed that our extended reach laterals at about the 750 were 100% rates of return. And even the normal lateral wells were very good rates of return as well. So looking at a 9,000-foot where maybe guessing well north of 100%, 125%, 130% rates of return. That's just all numbers. I back off from this whole development and think about it a different way, and that is an area where we have an opportunity and a plan to invest 10 -- a billions of dollars. As we announced last year, over 5 years perhaps $10 billion in this area at rates of return of 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. That is going to create huge value and growth for our company because it's rare that you can invest that amount of capital at these higher rates of return. But it's all about improving it, and that's really what your question was directed at I'm sure.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's exactly right. And just one brief follow-up here. I think, Dave, you mentioned impacting 2Q production by 2,000 barrels a day as a result of the asset sale. I think you also said that some of the sales are going to close in the second quarter. So I was just trying to get a sense of what the impact could be maybe in 3Q if you're going to lose a little bit of initial production as a result of those asset sales that you've already announced here.","David L. Stover","Yes. I think when we're looking at it on a full year basis, and I said we're going to absorb some of these onshore, non-core asset sales, I mean, you're looking at absorbing a couple of thousand barrels for full year type of piece.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Joe Magner with Macquarie Capital.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Just, I wanted to clarify the 10-well current spacing, I guess, assumptions that support your resource. Is there a breakdown on which zones or which types of wells are included in that 10 wells or is that all assumed to be in the B Bench? I'm just trying to clarify where...","David L. Stover","Yes, that goes back to what we showed in December, that presentation. So that was for that full acreage position up there and we -- if you go back to that, I think we broke it down where on average, that came up to what, 67 acres per well. And that included what we had looked at, at that time. In the Greater Wattenberg oil, we were on a little bit less than 50-acre spacing assumption for probably 6,400 locations, over -- almost 2\/3 of our locations and about 80-acre assumption down in the gas portion. And then in Northern Colorado, at that time, we were using the assumption of a little over 80-acre spacing up there for the location. So we had broke that down in December, and that's where that comes from.","Charles D. Davidson","I think when you start looking at trying to differentiate between the A, the B and the C and Codell, at that point, we were just looking at recoveries per section. And I think what Dave pointed to is now that we're really working the patterns and looking at the different pattern developments, that's what's causing us to focus in, and in some areas will probably give us an idea of how many would be in the B and how many would be in the A and how many would be in the C. I just keep focusing on is how many wells a section because if you can -- if you're looking at a minimum of 16 per section in some of these areas versus 10 to 4, that gives you an idea of directionally where this is going from a resource standpoint, from a recovery standpoint.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay. So truly the step up from, it was 10, it's gone to at least 16, and you're testing things that might -- testing other ideas that might take it to 32, that sort of the progression.","David L. Stover","Yes, when you start to roll in potential for staggered or multiple laterals at different intervals through this thing.","Charles D. Davidson","But keep in mind that we've got areas in Northeastern Colorado, they're still in appraisal and those would be outside of the scope of that. This is more talking about the more concentrated developed area of Wattenberg, extended Wattenberg that we really defined here.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay. And not to overplay, just to clarify one more thing. On this Wells Ranch pad, there were 3 different spacing concepts that were being targeted. The support today for the 16 per section, is that based on that center pad, the B that was being tested on 40-acre spacing or was it the results of all that work that was being done there just trying to...","David L. Stover","Yes, I mean really if you go back to what was rolled into that scenario at that point in time when we built that resource space, it was, for all intents and purposes, it was a B development for 16 wells per section. So all the rest of this is testing upsides to that.","Charles D. Davidson","And I think that just is reflected also as we've looked at those closely spaced wells in the B Bench, that's where we're really seeing the performance, and that's what supports it. So your point is correct. But then there have also other patterns that have given us encouragement and support as well. So.","David L. Stover","I guess, I think it's the big point there, Joe, is that anything we've seen on the production from the A, the C or the Codell hasn't detracted from our original expectations of the B pattern we've looked at there.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay. And just one last question. Any progress made on determining LNG scope or development plans offshore -- Israel onshore versus floating LNG or still more to come on that?","Charles D. Davidson","We're working in parallel, both options both floating, as well as onshore as, of course, we're also looking at Cyprus as well. So that work from an engineering standpoint is moving forward. The key will be in Israel hopefully obtaining a final policy decision by the government shortly. We do believe that it is pending on the export policy and that will help us move some of those projects forward. But we're keeping every option open right now. There's a lot of possibilities there.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly, maybe tying a bunch of these Niobrara questions together. I believe in December you talked about a net resource of about 2.1 billion barrels. Obviously, we didn't have a lot of the results that you've come up with subsequently. Where do we stand now in terms of thinking about net resource potential out of the Niobrara and that general area, Eastern Colorado, et cetera?","David L. Stover","Well, I'd say, David, it's fair to say we believe it'll increase. Just from all the things we've described. But I'd say we're probably not ready to just focus on a particular number yet. We've still got a lot of drilling, a lot of wells to complete and a lot more production history on some of these different patterns we're testing. And I would imagine we want to get that information in, get some extended production history and then revisit that number toward the end of the year.","Charles D. Davidson","Yes. We've -- and believe me, we ask that question all the time. But yes, our history has been -- is to base our resource estimates on solid results, and we don't speculate on where it's going. So this is what we're doing right now is we're gathering all the data from these compressed patterns, increased density drilling, looking at it through the various areas, and that's allowing the teams to start working on improved resource estimates. There's no doubt directionally where it's going because you've heard what the basis was on our prior estimates and what we're thinking now. But it's understanding how that applies in the various areas and making sure we got good solid estimates on recoveries. That's all part of the process. So sorry for the dodge on that, but we're still getting the answer ourself.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","No problem, I completely understood. Maybe switching over to the Marcellus just for a second. As you highlighted perhaps as early as 3Q, your partner could decide to push the drill bit a little harder in the dry gas window. Just trying to think about it from a cash flow impact in terms of potential uptick in CapEx versus rising gas prices and the potential impact in cash flow to you guys. Should we just look at that as a wash and not be worried that any kind of upward movement in CapEx that previously was unplanned will be self funded by the gas additional benefit of higher gas prices across your gas production in North America?","David L. Stover","Yes, Dave. When you look at it, as Chuck mentioned, that there's a potential lift. If price stayed up for the next 3 months, let's say, April and then the next 2 months above that $4, then the carry would kick in what, July, August type time frame. But -- and then the actual impact of that carry kicking in offset by the additional revenue from the gas price above $4 versus below $4, that's pretty close to a wash when you look at that. As far as the drilling part, additional drilling, and the discussions we've had with our partner and actually when you think about the realistic time frame it would take to ramp up a program, again I don't see a big increase this year in gas drilling. I think that discussion will really be as we start to look at how we lay the plans out for next year and how consistent in the outlook for gas price is.","Dan Kelly","I think also our -- while the industry has experienced a little bit of an uptick in gas prices, we still see in our program that there's -- our oil projects have much superior economics. And so there's not a desire on our part to ramp up dry gas drilling. Now we'll work with our partner on the 2014 budget and we'll work through that. But this is not a time to get, in my view, to get overly optimistic. It's a time to enjoy the fact that we've had a nice increase in gas prices and we need to stick with our plan, and that's what we're doing this year is staying with our plans.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Dave, I was wondering if you could maybe comment a little bit more on some of the well results you saw in the A and C Bench, as well as the Codell? And maybe I don't know if you could walk us through how these compare. I think in the oil window, you've talked about a 335 MMBoe type of EUR. Are you seeing well results in any of the benches similar to what you've seen in the B?","David L. Stover","I think we are in cases and it varies, and it varies with the geology out there in the different patterns. I'd say each pattern, and it's -- I'll couch this with but it's still very early. As Chuck mentioned, we like to get some extended production data. But from what we've seen in the first 90 days or so, each pattern looks economic. And one of the things we've really kept a close eye on is just how does any one interval's performance affect the B interval and compare to the B. So we've been very pleased with what we've seen there, and so we're going to do a lot more of this type testing as part of the drilling program this year.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Fair enough. It sounds like 16 wells per pad has got money in the bank with upside here. The second question, Chuck, is you guys have talked about a 9,500 kind of well inventory for the horizontal program, clearly upside to that number. How do you accelerate -- how does that come into your plans to accelerate activity even more? I know you plan to drill 500 wells in 2016, but based on these initial positive well results from wells 24, do we even go even faster than that pace, Chuck?","Charles D. Davidson","No, they don't want to answer my phone calls. So all I could say is we looked at -- we have been on a pace of growing this program. When we looked at our prior 5-year plan versus the 5-year plan that you just mentioned that we put out last December, that had added 1,100 wells over that 5-year period, and so that was a tremendous growth rate there. So it's all about making sure that we understand what the optimum development because you don't want to race in, in an area and prematurely develop it in a way that's not optimal. That's what we're trying to do here. But as soon as we see where there's -- we're getting -- continuing to get more and more clarity on how to move forward. Yes, the idea is to grow the production. Kind of my constant speech is that 9,000 drilling opportunities is nice. But if some of them are 20 and 30 years out, it doesn't add value. So we've got to move that forward, but we have to do it in a very deliberate fashion. So it's all about continuing to press forward, making sure that we're working everything, all the pieces of this, not just the fact that we've got locations, but this is a huge business. This is a big manufacturing business. So we've got to work all those supply chain logistics that go along with it. But that's what we're doing because we know it's going to create value to accelerate it even more.","David L. Stover","Well, and part of the thinking there too as we're going forward is you're evolving more and more to more pad drilling. And then the more wells that you can actually put on these pads as you go to a larger density of wells per section, I think optimally it will continue to evolve into an increased activity rate at some point.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Final question, Chuck, can you just give us an update on where you stand in terms of trying to close the Woodside transaction?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, the -- I mean, we -- all the parties are committed to close it. But quite honestly, with so much of that transaction focused on Leviathan and potential and export project down the road that we're really, at this point, waiting on the government to issue its export policy. And again we've gotten certainly the recent trip that I was over there. I got a lot of comfort that, that was a high priority with the new government in Israel. So that's a key piece. That's a key part of it. And certainly, our structure that we announced as part of that is tied to an export policy. So I think both the Woodside CEO and myself have made comments that it's important that the government make some decisions so that we can move on and because we really can't make good decisions on how to develop Leviathan without having fully defined what the rules will be for export. I'm comfort -- I'm confident that they will issue those, but that's what is really key to getting everything closed.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Back to DJ Basin. Can you just talk to the cost trends that you're seeing on a per well basis and then relative to lateral length.","David L. Stover","I think the costs are staying fairly constant right now, Brian. I'd say they've kind of leveled off as we've talked, actually come down a little bit over the last year as we've started to get more in the development phase on a lot of these areas, but they've somewhat leveled off. You're still in that range plus or minus 4.5 million for that 4,000-foot type lateral. And then you're up closer to 7,500 and 8,000 for the 9,000 footers. But you see increased efficiency when you look at the increased lateral links on a kind of an F&D per well, if you will, as you move from the 4 to the 7 to the 9. So that's part of the economic improvement that you see us to continue to be able to step out lateral lengths.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Are you seeing any service cost pressures there? It seems there's more companies talking and trying potentially accelerating activity around based in part on your success.","David L. Stover","Haven't really seen it yet. I mean, as we get into the third quarter and get in more discussions on next year pricing and so forth, we'll see where the industry's at and where the activity is. But I haven't picked up anything on increasing pressure on the cost side over there right now.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And lastly, for the second quarter in Israel, what should our gas price expectations or what do you expect in terms of gas price expectations for production -- or gas production expectations and do you see the constraints to your production demand ahead of summer or do you see the constraints being the ramp up of capacity at Tamar?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think on pricing when we laid out our guidance for that, that's the best place to go on that because it is -- that's a blend of -- we'll have a blend of Mari-B that satisfies some old contracts on the Tamar. So I wouldn't -- so it's just a little north of $5, and so I wouldn't deviate from that. I think on the production side of it, I mean, second quarter is a -- I mean, we rolled it into the guidance and it tends to be a shoulder month for Israel, and we're kind of making a guess on what the demand will be.","David L. Stover","Yes, I mean, when you think about it second quarter's going to bounce between that 600 to 700 gross type numbers, Scott, and what we're expecting right now. And then third quarter as we've mentioned, we ought to start to see some periods where you get up in that 900 range depending on whether seasonal demands kick in.","Charles D. Davidson","We've actually, if you go back a couple of years when Egypt was supplying gas, we actually saw combined with those imports plus our own deliveries, we were seeing production in one third quarter of 800-plus million of total country demand, and that was a couple of years ago. So we know the demand is there. Guessing weather is just like guessing weather here in the U.S. So I think right now, we've got delivery capacity, and we'll see what the demand is.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. The demand is in a constraint in the second quarter, you're fully ramped up in terms of Tamar and second quarter to meet whatever demand there may be?","Charles D. Davidson","As we say, we test the facility over 900 million. So it's just a matter of what the demand is. We are all set to deliver whatever they need right now.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Irene Hoff [ph] with Wunderlich Securities.","Unknown Analyst","My question has to do with your extended lateral curve. Can you explain to me why you have a little plateau there on the 1 million-barrel type curve? Are those later wells that you do something different? Are there Artificial Lift involved? Just kind of curious as to why it kind of normally go from hyperbolic to now you have low plateau, which is fantastic for cash flow. So little color, please.","David L. Stover","Okay. You're talking about the initial period or the early stage period I think where yes, it kind of ramps up. And then what we saw is that actually leveled off a little bit for that 30- to 90-day or 30 almost up to 120-day period. And that just seems to be the way these long laterals are performing, where now as you get further away from the vertical part of the wellbore, you get less drawdown. And it's almost like you've got a gravity feed into there from this long period for some period of time, but it just kind of replenishes itself is just what it appears to be doing on these longer laterals until you start to get a little bit of a decline in there. But overall, that's one of the things that really caught our eye when we're starting to see some of the performance of these that's how well these held up for an extended period of time, especially early here. And part of that is just bringing these things on pretty slow, you see that initial ramp up first 0 to 30 to 45 days. We're not pulling on these very hard. We're trying to let them come on naturally and then just feed into the system","Unknown Analyst","And should that be the kind of curve that we would expect as you get more like 300-day data on these extended laterals?","David L. Stover","I don't know. That's what we want to see is how this thing duplicates itself or repeats itself as we get a much wider database here to look at, but we'd like to see that. That's for sure.","Operator","That does conclude the today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back over to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Charles D. Davidson","Thanks again for everybody participating in the call today, as well as your interest in Noble Energy. Just have a good day.","Operator","That does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation."],"15694":["Noble Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:NBL) Q2 2018 Earnings Call August  3, 2018  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Brad Whitmarsh - Noble Energy, Inc.","David L.

Following today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Whitmarsh. Please go ahead.","Brad Whitmarsh - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Jenny, and thank you all for joining us today. I hope you've had a chance to review the earnings release and supplement that we published this morning. The press release and slides are available on the Investors page of our website and later today we plan to file our 10-Q with the SEC.","I want to remind everyone that today's discussion contains projections and forward-looking statements, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures in our latest news releases and SEC filings for a discussion of those items. Following prepared remarks, we will hold a question-and-answer session and will try to wrap up within the hour. I would ask that analysts limit themselves to one primary question and one follow-up. Dave Stover, Chairman and CEO; and Gary Willingham, EVP of Operations, will start us off with some prepared remarks.","With that, I'll turn the call to Dave.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. As we've transformed our company, we're focused on putting the company in the best position today to generate consistent and growing cash flows over time, a cash flow profile that is competitive across all investment sectors, not just E&P.","To that end, this past quarter, we delivered a number of key achievements that will drive increasing shareholder value. We redeployed proceeds from our Gulf of Mexico divestment and CNX Midstream units, as we continued our share buyback program, increased our dividend and completed our debt reduction plan. We will continue to prioritize the share repurchase program as we move forward.","Operationally, we set production records, enhanced our exploration portfolio and advanced our onshore and offshore development programs, including infrastructure additions and takeaway agreements. We are taking advantage of our flexibility to adapt to changing conditions and are adjusting our Delaware and DJ programs to put them in an even stronger position to deliver our long-term objectives.","In both of these key basins, we installed critical gathering infrastructure to achieve the long-term capital efficiency of these high-quality contiguous acreage positions. We've also increased our exposure to higher priced export and global markets, executing on our strategy to diversify end markets for our U.S. onshore crude oil sales.","Offshore, the development of our world-class Leviathan asset is rapidly moving forward. We have agreements for over 900 million cubic feet per day, including the natural gas contracts announced earlier this year. And we continue to negotiate additional volumes that could quickly fill up the first phase. I'm also pleased that we're making excellent progress on commercial agreements to deliver our gas from Tamar and Leviathan into Egypt to help supply the growing regional demand.","Another substantial second quarter accomplishment is the Heads of Agreement supporting development of natural gas from the Alen field, offshore Equatorial Guinea. This represents the first step towards regional gas monetization, utilizing the existing infrastructure in place at both the Alen field and the onshore LNG facilities. With linkage to global LNG markets and gross resources of 3 trillion cubic feet from our multiple discoveries in the immediate area, this represents a huge value opportunity for our shareholders.","As I mentioned earlier this year, our priority has been to continue to enhance our exploration portfolio. We've taken significant steps in that direction. Onshore U.S., we've been successful in capturing substantial new resource potential. Offshore, we signed an agreement to operate over 2 million gross acres in a new country. We will provide more information in the coming months as we build out our onshore position and receive necessary government approvals for our new offshore opportunity.","And looking at the global influences on commodities, it is clearly a dynamic environment. With our portfolio, we are in an advantaged position to capitalize as long as we stay disciplined. And we do that by continually reviewing and adjusting specific activities to maximize value.","Our plan is not to increase projected activity, but to continue to focus on cash flow growth and shareholder return objectives. Near term, we are making some changes to capital allocation to optimize returns and cash flow growth. Given the industry pressures in the Permian due to widening basin differentials and service cost inflation, we plan to moderate our activity in the Delaware Basin.","We will be reducing planned completions later this quarter and into 2019 to better align our activity with expected timing of pipeline additions. We will reallocate activity into our other onshore areas, primarily the DJ Basin. The diversity of our U.S. onshore portfolio provides a competitive advantage, enabling us to modify activity near term, while remaining committed to the objectives we outlined in our multiyear plan earlier this year.","Our long-term focus can be summarized in the following five objectives: driving peer-leading debt-adjusted cash flow growth, which we are on track to deliver through our unique combination of Eastern Med cash flows and onshore U.S. growth. A relentless focus on capital efficiency and corporate returns, and we are on pace to deliver double-digit corporate returns within two years. Ensuring our incentive plans are aligned with shareholders, as we have demonstrated with the focus on cash flow, costs and returns in our plans. Maintaining robust financial strength, which is shown through the completion of our debt reduction plans already. And commitment to our stakeholders and the environment.","Pertaining to this objective, we recently published our seventh annual Sustainability Report on our website. This report highlights continued progress in safety, environmental and corporate social responsibility. And to strengthen our commitment to these values, the Board EH&S Committee Charter was expanded and the committee was renamed. It is now known as the Safety, Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee.","These five long term objectives remain fundamental to informing our decision-making process. Coupled with our high-quality asset base, proven execution capabilities and agility, I am confident that we will continue to deliver superior value to our shareholders.","Now I'll turn the call over to Gary to review our operational execution and plans.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Dave. In the second quarter, our teams executed in line with our plans with several significant operational achievements, both onshore and offshore. Within our U.S. onshore business, we delivered record oil volumes of 105,000 barrels per day, an increase of 22% from the second quarter of last year adjusted for transactions.","In the Delaware Basin, we doubled sales volumes over the last year to 47,000 barrels of oil a day equivalent, quite an accomplishment. We also progressed the midstream build-out in both the Mustang area of the DJ Basin and the Delaware Basin to support the multiyear growth from both of these areas. Offshore Israel, we produced an all-time record gross sales volume averaging over 1 Bcf a day for the quarter for the first time.","We also progressed the Leviathan development and remain on track to deliver the substantial cash flow generation from this asset beginning late next year. This was certainly a strong way to finish the first half of 2018 and I want to thank all of our dedicated employees who have helped us deliver our objectives safely and efficiently.","In the DJ Basin, strong well performance in the second quarter drove sales volumes of 121,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, coming in above our expectations. A significant contributor to this were the Kona pads and Wells Ranch, which continue to outperform. On slide 5, we provided an update on these seven wells. After 150 days online, the wells are flowing over 10,000 barrels a day equivalent, of which 6,000 barrels a day is oil, and have already cumed 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent.","We're also progressing Mustang, our newest integrated development plan area. Recently, we brought online our first 2018 wells in Mustang, which are located in the southern part of the IDP. These wells tie into our new modular facility design, which delivers spec oil to the pipeline without a centralized gathering facility. While still early, I'm encouraged by the strong tubing pressures, which are exceeding recent wells with a similar GOR in Wells Ranch.","On the takeaway side, we have secured multiple outlets for Mustang across three gas processing providers, maximizing our flexibility and reducing potential impacts from bottlenecks as shown on slide 6. And the significant in-basin gas processing expansions that we have been looking forward to are now underway.","Mewborne 3, also known as DCP Plant 10, recently started up and will provide 200 million cubic feet a day of capacity. Additionally, DCP Plant 11 is expected to be placed in service in the second quarter of 2019, providing an additional 300 million a day between plant and bypass capacity.","Discovery midstream is expected to bring online a 200 million a day plant in the fourth quarter of this year, which will process some of our Mustang gas. And in addition, we continue working other compression and offload options. Overall, we're well positioned to benefit from gas processing expansions over the next few years, which provides support for our growth profile.","We had a busy quarter in the Delaware Basin with the completion of our fourth and fifth central gathering facilities, along with bringing online 23 wells. And I continue to be encouraged by the results we are seeing across our position.","On slide 8, we highlight strong second quarter well results in the southern portion of our acreage. These wells are outperforming our initial completions in this area. In addition, the wells are flowing through our central gathering facilities, which has been a significant step in optimizing our development.","Another area I've been particularly excited about is the progress our marketing teams have made securing near-term flow assurance and long-term out-of-basin takeaway to the Gulf Coast with access to exports. This includes the EPIC firm transport agreement that will provide 100,000 barrels a day of gross oil takeaway to the Gulf Coast beginning in late 2019.","Our decision to moderate some of our completion activity in the near term aligns with the timing of additional takeaway capacity later next year. This deferral of activity also provides the opportunity to transition our development utilizing the row concept, slightly earlier than we'd originally planned. Our row style development mitigates the potential for interference that has been faced by multiple operators across multiple basins. And we're well positioned to execute this row style development design in the Delaware, just as we have in both the DJ Basin and the Eagle Ford.","We remain advantaged by our contiguous acreage position and key midstream infrastructure in the basin. And transitioning to row style development now will contribute to efficiencies in the long term.","The industry is seeing cost pressures given the higher price environment, particularly for drilling rigs, completion crews, steel and other services. And to help offset this, our teams continue to be focused on capital efficiency in our well designs.","In the second quarter, we brought online our first wells that utilized only 100 mesh sand and our first completion with 100% recycled produced water, and these wells are exhibiting strong early results. In addition, we continue to drive efficiencies on the drilling side, cutting an average of two days per well in the first half of 2018 compared to 2017.","Over this time period, our efficiency gains have increased our average drilling rate by 13%. In fact, in the second quarter, we achieved a record drilling time for a 7500-foot lateral well of less than 16 days.","Moving over to the offshore, we continue to progress the Leviathan development with the project currently nearly 60% complete. We finished our drilling program and are progressing the completions of the four wells that will deliver up to 1.2 Bcf a day. We've also installed all the large diameter flow lines \u2013 pipelines from the field to the platform location and then from the platform to the onshore tie-in points.","And by year end, we expect to finish the planned well completions, finalize fabrication of subsea equipment and complete and sale the jacket from the U.S. fabrication site. Overall, the project remains on track and on budget with startup expected late next year.","Our operations in West Africa continue to produce reliably with strong run times and equally strong safety performance. Cumulative production from Alen now totals 35 million barrels and we've achieved over four years without a recordable safety incident. At Aseng, we've now produced more than 90 million barrels and the FPSO received SBM's consistent top operational performance award for the third year in a row.","In May, we announced we had executed the Heads of Agreement, outlining the high-level commercial terms to process Alen gas through the Alba Plant and the EGLNG facility. And this is certainly a significant milestone for our West Africa business, establishing the framework to monetize our gas in the global LNG market.","The Alen facility was initially designed to be a gas hub, making this project capital efficient requiring only minor modifications at the Alen platform and the construction of a 40-mile pipeline. Our team has begun the pre-FEED and marketing activities, and I would anticipate a project sanction early next year with first production approximately two years later.","Before turning the call over to Dave, I wanted to take a few minutes to discuss guidance for the rest of 2018. We've increased our full year capital budget to $3 billion, slightly above our prior range. A portion of higher capital is a result of scope changes on some onshore facility projects that enhance reliability and takeaway optionality. The remainder is due to cost inflation in the U.S. onshore as a result of the higher commodity price environment.","Given the temporary deferral of completions in the Permian mentioned earlier, we are planning to reallocate some 2018 and 2019 capital to the DJ Basin. This will provide additional DJ volumes in 2019, partially offsetting more moderate Permian growth.","We now expect our full year 2018 sales volumes to trend towards the low end of previously guided range. Eastern Mediterranean demand and West Africa production are outperforming. This partially offsets U.S. onshore volumes, which reflect higher declines in the Eagle Ford in the second half and the deferral of some Permian completion activity.","Overall, we remain on track to deliver 12% total company volume growth pro forma in 2018 compared to 2017. Sales volumes in the third quarter are expected to be between 335,000 and 345,000 barrels a day equivalent.","Offshore, our West Africa volumes are anticipated to be lower in the third quarter compared to the second quarter due to lifting schedules and gas declines. We anticipate strong U.S. onshore oil growth of nearly 10,000 barrels a day from 2Q to 3Q with a further increase of approximately 5,000 barrels a day from 3Q to 4Q. This represents a 25% increase in full year U.S. onshore oil compared to 2017. And we remain well positioned for continued multiyear growth.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Dave.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Gary. In summary, we will stay flexible and adjust to changing conditions, remain committed to our strategic objectives and continue to exercise discipline in our approach. 2018 is an exciting year of transition, and with our onshore U.S. growth and Leviathan startup, 2019 will establish Noble Energy as an engine of accelerating cash flow and shareholder returns.","With that, Jenny, let's go ahead and open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-session. And the first question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brad Whitmarsh - Noble Energy, Inc.","Brian?","Operator","Please go ahead, Sir. Your line is open.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Hey, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Wanted to see if you could follow-up on some of the drivers of the CapEx changes here. You talked about scope changes in onshore facility projects, enhancing reliability, optionality. Can you go into a little bit more of what you were seeing there, what caused the change? And when we see the benefit from that? And then could you also talk a little bit more about, on the inflationary side, where you're seeing that, specifically?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Sure, Brian. This is Gary. I think when you think about onshore facility scope changes, there has been a number of things. I guess I'll highlight a couple of them. We mentioned in the prepared comments that we have takeaway options to three different gas processors in Mustang, in the DJ. So, that's a bit different than how we've typically set up the DJ in the past. That obviously required a few more facility and pipeline dollars to give us that optionality. But we think given our history in the DJ and the history of constraints that we've experienced over the last few years, we think it's prudent to make sure that we've got multiple ways to get gas out of that IDP. So, that's part of it.","I'd say in the Permian, a couple of examples there would be, we've had some electrification projects going on in the Permian that would increase the reliability. I'm sure you've heard from others that some of the supply of electricity is not that reliable in the southern Delaware Basin. And so, we've got some dollars going towards an electrification project that will help improve reliability there. I think when you think about inflation, we've said all along that we expected to see about 10% to 15% inflation this year. We built some of that into the budget, but we also assumed that given our track record and where we were in the development, especially in the Permian, that we'd be able to offset a large part of that with efficiencies.","I'd say we continue to see quite a bit of efficiencies throughout the year, both in the Delaware and the DJ, and we certainly have offset some of the inflation that we've seen. But at the same, we've definitely trended towards the high end of that range and we've got a bit more coming in. So when you think about the capital increase that we've raised the range to, I'd say a third to a half of it is the facility, scope changes, and the rest is the inflation.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. My follow-up is with regards to the Permian, as you defer completions there, when do you bring that backlog down? And what would you need to see to allocate either more or less capital out of the Permian, into the Permian, and out of and into the DJ?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I mean, as far as allocating more back into the Permian again, obviously, it's going to be tied to that export capacity coming on. That's why we are shifting it out, to give the system time to grow the capacity to be able to deliver the wells that we'd actually be drilling and completing. So, assuming the projects stay on track, those capacity expansions stay on track, then we would expect to start adding frac crews back into the Permian relatively early next year. I think, I'm sorry, what was the first part of the question, Brian?","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Well, I think you got the first part, but what would you allocate more capital to, to the DJ as well?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I think as we've mentioned, the capital that we're \u2013 or the activity that we're taking out of the Permian this year is going to the DJ. We've obviously ramped up in the Mustang IDP. Again having those three gas outlets gives us the confidence that we'll be able to move the gas. The early results we're seeing on those Mustang wells are very encouraging. We've seen tubing pressures that are significantly above similar GOR areas in Wells Ranch. And so, it's very early days. We just brought them on here in the last few weeks, but everything we're seeing is very encouraging.","So, the projects are there. The economics are certainly there in the DJ. We believe the takeaway constraints in the DJ on the processing side are finally being addressed. And so, there is not a lack of opportunity in the DJ. It's going to go back to, again, the overall mix of the portfolio, the economics of the portfolio and how much capital we're going to be deploying at any one time.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I hope you can hear me.","Brad Whitmarsh - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, we can hear you, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","The line seems to be cutting in and out a little bit. Great. So, Dave, I've got two questions; one onshore, one Israel, if I may. So the first one is, obviously, your focus is on cash flow, but the lower ramp in the fourth quarter now, can you give us some color as to how that impacts the 2019 outlook, the 400,000 barrels a day? I guess, what I'm really trying to understand is whether adding the activity in the DJ is enough to compensate for the slower growth in the Delaware while you do that transition, obviously, the timing of the rig. And I've got a follow-up, please.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Well, it's too early to update or change anything in 2019 and lay that out. We'll get into that as we move through the year and, as Gary said, finalize what our capital plans will be for 2019. But I'd say, we are excited in the DJ about where we are, just to play off a little bit of what Gary said. What we've seen so far with Mustang, the timing of that, which was on purpose, setting the timing of that development up to coincide with the capacity increase up there. So, we'll see how that plays out the rest of this year with the new facilities, new plants coming online. I think the Discovery plant will be online by the end of this year also. So as we lay out the budget for next year, we'll have the insight of the new facilities coming online there. And then, we'll have a better position understanding as we see when we're timing to increase our activity or ramp-up our completion activity in the Delaware also. So, let's see how those play out a little bit through second half of this year and then we'll be able to give more insight into 2019.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you. My follow up is a little in the weeks. I think you've been expecting this one from me, but it's regarding Egypt and the prospect to execute your (25:04). But I want to be quite specific what I'm asking, because Delek recently had a shareholder vote to acquire \u2013 move forward with trying to acquire an interest in the East Med gas pipeline. They are telling us that you will participate in that also, but that there is a real possibility this could move very quickly and lead to a significant increase in Tamar production as early as next year. Can you just give us a general thought as to whether that's realistic and how you see the whole process playing out?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think \u2013 yeah, a couple of things, Doug, and I appreciate you asking about that, because I alluded to it in my comments, but we are making excellent progress and very fast progress on solidifying some of this infrastructure into Egypt and the delivery into Egypt. I think that could come to together really quick here, just as we've been talking about. And I think it's a big step. What we continue to see is a pull in the region \u2013 actually, in all three countries in the region for additional gas demand.","And that's probably pulling harder and faster than I would've even projected a year ago on all cases. So, I'm looking forward to be able to give you a lot more clarity on that as that comes together. I know Keith was just oversees here recently. He can expand on that a little bit, but especially on the comment on the regional demand and how hard they're pulling to get Leviathan gas as quick as they can.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Maybe Keith, as you answer, if I may, Delek's suggesting Tamar could up 50% next year on the back of this. So, if you could just frame whether that's realistic or not, I'd appreciate it. Thanks.","J. Keith Elliott - Noble Energy, Inc.","Sure, Doug. Yes, first of all, to your question about Tamar. Tamar is essentially running at capacity right now. The demand growth that we've seen in Israel from coal displacement, from just the growth there, in the electricity demand, for us to go substantially higher on Tamar would require the expansion project. Saying that I mean certainly there is capacity for gas to move into Egypt in the near term, primarily during the swing months.","The swing months haven't been as big a swing as they've been in the past years as we've seen the IEC displacing coal, but it does still exists, to a degree. I think to Dave's point, certainly, I was in Cairo earlier this week and the demand pool for Mediterranean gas into that Egyptian market is very strong, both from a private sector and then validated by the government there.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","I think, Doug, what \u2013 to add on to Keith's point a minute, I think two things. What you're seeing is the potential for next year or very soon as some of this comes together is for Tamar to be essentially running full out most all the time here. As I said, it's been doing that on a large part already and I think it has an opportunity to solidify that almost year-around coming up pretty soon.","The other part of it is, I think, you see an opportunity to essentially fill up the volume and contract for the full volume of Phase 1 at Leviathan over the next year or so, when you just look at this regional demand. So, a lot of these things are really coming together nicely in that region and it gives a lot of excitement, enthusiasm and momentum as we head into next year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, fellows.","Operator","And we'll go to our next question from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning, David, you and your team.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Hi, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","I wanted to go back to the DJ and you touched on a little bit in your \u2013 both your prepared comments and some of this Q&A, and talked about what you guys are seeing in that Mustang IDP area. It sounds like you have seen some pleasant surprises, which is definitely a positive, but this isn't the first time you guys have drilled there. And so, I'm wondering if you could just go in a little more detail on what you're seeing and how it's different from what you guys have seen in Wells Ranch and perhaps touch on these different proppant tests, because you guys have learned a lot in Wells Ranch?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Charles. This is Gary. It is pretty exciting early results. First off, I'd say, it's great. We expected it to be good. If you go back and look at what we rolled out back in February, we actually have a slightly higher type curve in Mustang than we do in Wells Ranch. So, we expect performance to be strong there. To your question of, it's not the first time we've drilled in Mustang, that's absolutely true. I would say, it's been a while and we haven't drilled that many horizontal wells in Mustang over the years. And certainly, the last ones that we did drilled a few years ago did not have the benefit of our latest enhanced completion design.","So with all that, we certainly had high hopes as to what we could bring to an area that was already a strong performer with the additional benefit of the enhanced completions that we've been developing over the years in the Wells Ranch area. We're certainly seeing that, I believe, in the early days of these first 10 wells that we brought online. We've got a lot of wells still to bring online, but I expect to see strong performance from those as well. So, it's an exciting area that we'll be moving into.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thanks for that, Gary. And then just one quick follow-up. The constraints, the processing constraints in the DJ, in 2Q, did 2Q come in about like you thought it was going to in the DJ? Or were there any surprises as far as the volume? Go ahead.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","We were up slightly from what we expected. I would remind you that we had reduced our activity from historical levels in the DJ a while back, knowing that these processing constraints were going to be there, and choosing to deploy capital in areas where we could actually drill wells and bring them online. So, we did reduce our capital. We haven't had the level of activity that we have had historically. 2Q, though, was a little bit better. And now that Mewborne 3 has started up and is providing another 200 million a day of capacity to the basin, we expect to see the beginning of this growth curve that we've been waiting on as we've been waiting on the midstream constraints to be removed.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thanks, Gary.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Leo Mariani of NatAlliance Securities.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Hey, guys. I was hoping to drill a little bit further into the Permian here. Clearly, you guys are pulling back activity. Is that going to be both drilling and frac related? Do you really plan back on completions in the fourth quarter here. Just trying to get a sense, though of how that impacts the production ramp. Is Permian still going to be growing despite the activity pullbacks? Is it just growing in a lower rate or is it more (32:57)?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Leo, this is Gary. Permian will still be growing. It will be growing at a little bit lower rate here in the near term, given the deferral of completions, while we are waiting for the export capacity to come up. I think when you look at it, the way we're thinking about it right now is we probably lay down two of our three frac crews late in the third quarter. And assuming that the capacity build-out continues as expected, we would start adding those back pretty early next year.","Right now, we're planning on maintaining the six rigs. We'll continue to take a look at that as we go through the year. But maintaining that level of drilling and building the inventory of completions and building the buffers that you need as far as the row style development goes, we think maintaining the six rigs is the right way to go. That will result in a slight increase in DUC inventory near term until the completion crews come back. But we've modeled it and looked at it economically, and we believe that's the right thing to do.","Operator","And did you have anything further, Mr. Mariani? So at this time, we will move to Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Brad Whitmarsh - Noble Energy, Inc.","Michael?","Operator","Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now open. If you're muted, please depress your mute function so that we can hear you.","Brad Whitmarsh - Noble Energy, Inc.","Go on.","Operator","Mr. Hall, are you with us?","Brad Whitmarsh - Noble Energy, Inc.","Operator, let's go to the next question.","Operator","All right. Well, let's go to that next question then. We'll hear from Irene Haas of Imperial Capital.","Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC","Hey. Good morning, everybody. My question has to do with DJ Basin, it's very encouraging to see DCPs debottlenecking. Any thoughts on how we're going to handle the gas that comes along with the oil? Regionally speaking, we get a review for the regional gas price. Then secondarily, is ethane recovery working at this particular time? Are you guys seeing that? That's all I have.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Irene, it's certainly encouraging to see the capacity start to come up. There has been a little softness in CIG pricing here in the last couple of months and we're certainly keeping our eye on that, and evaluating options there. But we expect it to get better. I think when you look at ethane, actually we're extracting ethane right now. And so, we've got nice NGL volumes right now. That obviously does impact our average NGL realization, bringing it down a bit.","And then, obviously our NGL realizations have also been impacted in the DJ from what you've been seeing going on at Conway. About half of our NGLs in the DJ go to Conway, about half to Mont Belvieu. Conway's pressured right now for a number of reasons, increasing production in the Rockies and the Mid-Continent area as well as the some volumes coming in from the Marcellus until some of their pipeline issues back East gets straightened out, and then the purity takeaway from Conway is pretty well maxed out as well. So, there has been pressure on Conway and that's been flowing back into the DJ and pressuring our netbacks there as well.","Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Gail Nicholson of KLR Group. Please go ahead, your line is open. Gail, if you're muted, please the depress your mute function so that we can hear you, please. I'm not sure if you're still on the line with us, Gail?","Brad Whitmarsh - Noble Energy, Inc.","Operator, you can just hand it back to me.","Operator","Okay. And at this time, I will now go and hand the call back over to Brad Whitmarsh for any closing remarks.","Brad Whitmarsh - Noble Energy, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. I know a couple of questions there at the end, we didn't get to. Sounded like we had a little bit of phone line issues. So, give Megan and I a call.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. David Larson. Please go ahead, sir.","David R. Larson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Joshua. Good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us today for Noble Energy's first quarter 2015 earnings call and webcast. This morning, we issued our earnings release and also posted to our website a few supplement slides for this call. Later this morning, our 10-Q will be available.","Following the remarks by Dave Stover, we'll open the call for Q&A with the executive team and wrap things up in less than an hour. Finally, I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains projections and forward-looking statements as well as references non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dave.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm extremely pleased with how Noble Energy has performed in the early part of 2015. This is highlighted by our production, which has been strong across the board. And while still early, we're confident enough to raise our full-year volume outlook. Our successes also include improving capital efficiency and reducing operating costs. The results so far this year are right where we expected, if not a little better.","Another major accomplishment was gaining alignment with our partner in the Marcellus to reduce our activity levels. And in the DJ Basin, strong results and continued operational efficiencies are driving additional capital allocation in the second half of the year.","Starting off with sales volumes, we sold a record 318,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter, an increase of 17% over the same period last year after adjusting for asset sales. Full year sales are now expected to average between 300,000 and 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, as we have raised the bottom end of our range by 5,000 barrels equivalent per day. This updated range now reflects the first quarter outperformance while maintaining our prior expectations for remaining quarters of the year.","Compared to the first quarter of last year, core U.S. onshore sales volumes increased more than 35% driven by record production in both the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale. Horizontal production in these two plays was up a combined 60% versus the same time period. Offshore including the Gulf of Mexico and our international businesses, volumes were relatively flat with the first quarter of last year after adjusting for asset sales. Our offshore assets continue to perform very well with world-class runtime and lower than expected decline rate.","Highlighting this performance is nearly 100% runtime at both Tamar, offshore Israel, and Aseng in Equatorial Guinea. It's the combination of these high quality, low cost assets, and managing a diversified portfolio that continues to provide Noble a competitive advantage. Our U.S. onshore development, major project execution and exploration capabilities provide material resource opportunities and tremendous investment optionality.","As mentioned earlier, we've made substantial progress towards lowering both our capital and operating costs. We've worked closely with our suppliers to achieve an average of 20% savings, seen most prominently in our U.S. onshore business. Our suppliers have moved quickly to assist in adjusting our cost structure, and we continue to work with them in partnership to ensure these early achievements are turned into sustainable cost improvements. Highlighting our production cost reduction was lease operating expense, which is already down $0.50 per barrel from the fourth quarter, a material change in such a short period of time and putting us on track to meet our full-year average expectation.","General and administrative costs are down from previous quarters as well. We've also recently completed an organizational realignment which better positions our workforce for this current environment. Capital expenditures for the quarter were a little over $900 million, slightly below our internal expectations and trending lower as we move through the year.","Total capital for 2015 remains $2.9 billion with $1.8 billion allocated to the onshore U.S. business. The DJ Basin has increased to more than 60% of the onshore U.S. amount, with Marcellus now representing slightly less than 40%.","Focusing on our DJ operations, growth in the first quarter exhibited our strong operating capacity. Total volumes were a record 116,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 22% versus the first quarter last year. Growth in the horizontal program is even more impressive, up more than 50% over the last year, and more than 110% in the last two years.","Slide four highlights continued drilling efficiencies being delivered by our teams. And as you can see, we're now averaging seven days from spud to rig release for a standard lateral length well, almost as fast as we used to drill vertical wells. In fact, we recently drilled a 9,300-foot horizontal well in Wells Ranch in just seven days. Compared to last year, we're drilling 70% of the total footage while utilizing 40% of the rig count. This is a result of our focus on drilling execution, utilizing the best rigs and crews in the Basin and continuing to increase our average lateral lengths per well.","Reduced drilling times are resulting in an increased number of wells that can be completed this year, and we're reallocating some capital here to keep up with the drilling pace, supplementing our one full-time completion crew with a second completion crew in the second half of the year. These efficiencies, along with supplier cost reductions, are driving a downward trend in our well costs. Based on today's drilling and completion costs, we're already meeting our budgeted well cost expectations for the year.","We have highlighted on slide five a $3.8 million Wells Ranch well. Our overall cost reductions from 2014 include 5% to 15% sustainable cost savings from continuing to reduce drilling times and optimizing equipment usage and a range of 15% to 25% savings from our major suppliers. It is worth noting that these well costs are all-in and include items such as pad construction and associated facilities cost.","And we have opportunities to continue to drive costs down further. Using slickwater for fracs in certain parts of the Basin may allow us to save an additional $100,000 to $200,000 per well on a standard length lateral. We recently brought online 11 wells in East Pony that were completed with slickwater, and these wells are performing at or above expectations.","Third-party infrastructure uptime improved at the start of the year, and I am pleased with the progress of the expansion projects that are currently underway. The Lucerne-2 plant and additional compressor stations are on track for startup in late second quarter, providing a material increase in processing and compression capacity on the DCP system. The Grand Parkway low-pressure loop has been approved and is expected to start up by the end of the year, which will have a positive impact on the performance of legacy vertical wells and earlier horizontal wells.","Operating performance in the Marcellus Shale remains exceptional as well. And our production grew 73% versus the first quarter of last year to nearly 400 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Similar to the DJ Basin, we're seeing substantial reduction in drilling times and lower well costs through a combination of utilizing top hole rigs, drilling longer laterals and supplier cost reductions.","Improvements in drilling times have resulted in a larger inventory of uncompleted wells than we had originally anticipated in both the operated and non-operated areas of the Marcellus. This affords us the opportunity to reduce rig count in the second half of the year to one operated rig and two non-operated rigs while still meeting our planned completion and production goals. Overall, this is a $200 million net reduction to our prior Marcellus expectations. We continue to diversify our natural gas markets and recently began transporting approximately 100 million cubic feet per day of gas out of the Basin, including our first sales into Gulf Coast markets. This firm transportation has a relatively low overall cost and gives us further access to better-priced markets.","Moving offshore, we achieved a number of key milestones on our major projects in the Gulf of Mexico during the first quarter. At Rio Grande, all drilling and completion operations are now complete and pipeline installation is scheduled to begin in the second quarter. Rio Grande remains on schedule for first production in the fourth quarter. Development drilling operations at Gunflint are underway and are expected to continue throughout the remainder of 2015. Pipeline installation will commence following the Rio Grande installation, and first production from Gunflint remains on schedule for mid-2016.","Our Gulf of Mexico projects highlight the benefits of our diverse portfolio by providing strong oil growth exiting 2015, with another step-up in 2016. The cash margins for these projects are very competitive with U.S. onshore resource plays, evidenced by nearly all of the production being oil and priced at a premium to WTI combined with attractive production costs.","Moving to the Eastern Mediterranean, Tamar continues to exhibit exceptional reliability and set new milestones for delivery, achieving a record weekly gross sales average of over 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day, driven by seasonal demand and coal plant maintenance. Our recently signed agreement to supply interruptible sales of up to 250 million cubic feet per day gross from Tamar to Egypt's domestic market is another example of the strong regional demand for our natural gas. We and our customer are now working to finalize regulatory approvals and transportation agreements needed to start sales. We believe these can be concluded in the next few months, setting us up for initial sales later in 2015 by utilizing existing infrastructure. Once we have those approvals, we will provide an outlook for sales and adjust our production guidance at that time.","During the first quarter, we received regulatory approval for export sales to the Arab Potash Company and Jordan Bromine Company in Jordan. While relatively small volume, this does represent the first formally approved regional export of natural gas from Israel and sets forward a path for additional agreements to follow.","Meanwhile, we continue to work very intently to establish a comprehensive framework for energy development. Our teams are meeting regularly with the inter-ministerial group established by the Prime Minister's office for this purpose, and we're encouraged by their efforts to create a sustainable investment climate for energy development in Israel.","Early progress has been made and we look forward to working with the new government. Resolution about standing regulatory matters, including anti-trust concerns and export taxation along with a comprehensive framework for energy development is still necessary to enable additional project development. We believe the inter-ministerial working group is on track to achieve this objective over the next few months following the seating of the new government.","In Cyprus, we're working closely with the government and plan to submit a preliminary field development plan in the near future. Our Cyprus discovery can be another important contributor toward meeting regional gas demand.","We've begun export marketing activities and are greatly encouraged by the level of interest expressed by potential counterparties, not only for gas purchases, but also regarding participating in export infrastructure investment.","Also, within our offshore business, you can certainly feel the exploration excitement around our office as we're nearing a very impactful 2015 drilling program.","In West Africa, we recently signed a rig contract for the Cheetah exploration prospect in Cameroon, and expect this low cost well to spud early in the third quarter. Cheetah represents our first Cretaceous test in the Douala Basin and has a mean resource size in excess of 100 million barrels of oil equivalent gross. A sizeable discovery at Cheetah would deliver a very attractive development in less than 100 feet of water depth where we can move very quickly to first production.","By the end of the second quarter, we anticipate commencing drilling offshore in the Falkland Islands where we plan to drill two exploration wells this year. Our first prospect, Humpback, which we operate with a 35% interest has a gross mean resource size of over 250 million barrels of oil.","If successful, Humpback would de-risk other large prospects, shown on slide 10, that have cumulative gross resource potential in excess of 1 billion barrels of oil. We recently farmed into the Rhea prospect also with 250 million barrels of oil potential which will be our second exploration well in the Falkland Islands. Adding the Rhea opportunity further diversifies our exploration inventory and enhances our overall chance of success as it offsets other oil discoveries in the Basin. The prospect is anticipated to spud by year-end. We operate Rhea and currently have a 75% working interest.","Let me now provide some insight into our volume profile throughout the year. As mentioned earlier, we have not made any production guidance changes to the remaining quarters. Second quarter sales volumes are anticipated to range between 290,000 and 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, impacted by planned facility maintenance and turnarounds in West Africa and the Gulf of Mexico, along with the usual seasonal demand softness for Israel volumes. From there, sales are expected to build in the second half of the year with strong seasonal demand in Israel in the third quarter followed by new oil volumes from the start-up of our major projects in the Gulf of Mexico in the fourth quarter. Our diversified portfolio is setting us up to exit 2015 on a nice trajectory.","So in summary, we're off to a strong start this year. Performance on volumes, capital efficiency and costs is where we expected if not a little better \u2013 not a little bit better at this point. And we're on a path approaching cash flow neutrality around mid-year as we anticipated.","So, Joshua, at this time, we'd like to go ahead and open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you so much, sir. We'll take our first question from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","You guys delivered impressive efficiencies \u2013 drilling efficiencies in Wattenberg and Eagle Ford in the first quarter. I guess two questions. What do you see is the scope there to improve efficiencies further?","And secondly, how are you planning to preserve those efficiencies as activity increases in their off-cycle? It would appear that's more of a secular benefit than cyclical, like service cost benefits you're enjoying today.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Evan, it's good to point out that the efficiencies are continuing to improve and I don't think we're done there. I'll have Gary Willingham talk a little bit about his view up there. But I've been extremely impressed and pleased with what the team has done by concentrating on each aspect of the drilling cycle, if you will. I mean, if you think about it now, we've actually drilled long laterals in the same time that we used to drill vertical wells four to five years ago. So it's been a remarkable improvement.","But I'll let Gary talk about what he sees as far as trajectory this year.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President, Operations","Yeah, Evan, when you look at the slide on page four, you can see the improvement over time and especially focusing on that spud to rig release curve, how that's continued to come down over time. So, we were able to do that even in a much higher commodity price environment, obviously.","I think some of the recent performance improvement we've seen, to be fair, is we're running four rigs and we tended to keep the four best rigs out of the 10, but I think that's a fairly small part of the improvement that we've seen. Most of it comes from just a continuing focus on how can we make each little part of the drilling process better? And as Dave mentioned, while we average seven days for normal length laterals in the first quarter in the DJ, we also drilled a 9,300-foot well in seven days. And we also drilled a normal length lateral well in five days in East Pony, so that gives us confidence that there's still more improvement to come and that's what we'll be chasing over the next quarters.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And my second question, given you and CNX have reduced activity in the Marcellus, how do you consider reallocating capital in the Niobrara beyond the completion crew added? And just maybe more broadly, many companies have cited various approaches into a commodity price recovery with some looking to balance sheet repair earlier adding rigs in the back half of the year. How do you anticipate responding in an improved commodity price environment? I'll leave it there.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President, Operations","I mean, for now, for 2015, we're really still looking at just four rigs. So, the capital that we're shifting from the Marcellus to the DJ, we're using that to kind of back-end load those four rigs that we've already got because again we're drilling wells a lot faster. So, that kind of back-end loads those rigs and provides for a few more completions this year. Most of those completions, incremental completions will be in 2016.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then that's regardless of what the commodity looks like in the back half of the year, so you're pretty set for this year or is it responsive or reflective of that environment?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'd say at this point it's too early to change anything for the year. I mean, the one change that you've noted is that we brought down the capital spending working with our partner in the Marcellus. And then, as Gary pointed out with the efficiencies of these four rigs and just assuming we stay at four rigs this year in the DJ, we're going to drill more wells and now we're going to allocate more money to completion, so we'll come out of the year putting ourselves in I'd say even a better position heading into 2016 there.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. I appreciate the color, guys. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, David.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","A couple of questions if I may. There's a comment in the press release about the efficiency gains in the DJ will result in more wells this year than perhaps you originally planned. So, I guess I've got two questions around that. One is, why continue to drill in this \u2013 I guess it's an improving environment we're in, but why continue to drill when some of your peers have been starting completions? So what's your take on that?","And secondly, how does it change the mix of those incremental wells between long laterals and I guess your standard length wells? And I've got a quick follow-up, please.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And I'll start with that. But I'd say, where we are right now and as Gary has pointed out, we continue to get more and more efficient with these four rigs than I would expect. We continue to see that trend this year, so we've kind of got a base load of operation now between what we're focusing on at East Pony and Wells Ranch with this rig activity, with this four-rig activity.","And what it's enabling us to do now is to bring more wells ready for \u2013 more wells that we'll have drilled by the end of the year is more wells ready to complete by the end of the year which I think will give us some very nice momentum as we exit this year and look towards 2016. So, it just gives us a lot more capacity of what we can do there as we continue to gain efficiency. And I think that part of that efficiency is driven by focusing on this continued improvement with these four rigs and with these dedicated crews that we have up there.","Gary, another view?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President, Operations","Yeah. And I think the only thing I would add to your point on how does it change the mix of ERLs. We've been looking at increasing our spud count this year by probably about 15% in the DJ. I think those incremental wells that will be targeted towards year-end will be roughly the same 50% ERLs that we've got in the budget. But if it's off from that much, it's not going to change the annual average that much either way.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Okay. I appreciate the answer. Dave, my follow-up I guess, is a pretty standard question around the regulatory situation in Israel. I think you'd suggested that post the election, things were perhaps looking a little bit more promising in terms of getting going again on Leviathan forward sales and so on. Any update you can share to the extent you can, and I'll leave it at that. Thank you.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think the main thing, while they've been going through their election cycle and pulling the new government together, the work has continued behind the scenes with this inter-ministerial committee, and I think we've been very pleased with the progress we've seen, especially the focus on coming up with what we've talked about this comprehensive solution, this kind of roadmap, the sanction, if you will. And so I've been very pleased with the progress we've seen and the commitment to getting this thing ready so that we can start back up as things develop here.","And part of the reality of it is the new government is going to have to get in place, going to have to get seated, but the real positive part of that is nobody is waiting or has been waiting for that. Everybody has been working diligently to address the things that need to be addressed so you can put this comprehensive framework together. I can ask Keith. Keith has been the one here, Keith Elliott here that's been more intimately involved with it than me and he can give you his feel for his outlook on that.","J. Keith Elliott - Senior VP-Eastern Mediterranean Region","Yeah. I think, Doug, that the \u2013 my sense is that the government through the formation of the inter-ministerial committee is really reflecting the recognition that the establishment of this investment framework that blends itself to companies, ourselves and other players, new entrants into the Basin providing that sort of stable and attractive investment climate, just leads us to be optimistic that they're going to deliver a solution in a reasonable timeframe here.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Guys, the sales contracts that you had already, are they (24:29) I guess that you'd already signed, are they still good and obviously, they're on hold, but would you be able to go back to those in fairly quick order or have they been completely shelved until you get clarity?","J. Keith Elliott - Senior VP-Eastern Mediterranean Region","We've continued to be engaged with all of those potential customers. We're engaged with them on an ongoing basis. The LOIs are either in place or extensions have been agreed. And all parties really continue to be very prepared to move toward consummation of these contracts once we can get the regulatory framework in place.","I mean, I think the thing is that \u2013 and Dave alluded to it in his comments, the thing that I would just call out is there really is a fundamental supply\/demand imbalance that the resources in Israel and Cyprus are \u2013 can really lend themselves to help them to address and I think that hasn't been lost on any of the potential buyers.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","I appreciate it, fellas. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Good morning, guys.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Dave.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Real quickly, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you thought the decrease in service costs could be sustained over time. Can you give us some more color on that, specifically to the cost reductions? Not necessarily the efficiency gains. And are you looking at locking down some of the service costs going forward in the form of contracts or anything like that?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that gets all back to how we're working with our major service providers. And I think the way we look at it is \u2013 this is a partnership. It's not about just beating costs down, but it's a partnership on how we do we do business, not only for now, but going forward in a way that we can make this more economical for all of us. And so a lot of discussion, when you look at actually the contracting and a lot of that is on an annual basis on some of our major suppliers. It can be a little longer than that on some of this. So we'll put in place some of that, but we're looking at the combination of service costs and what else can we do just from improved efficiency on some of this and the combination of those to lock in a lower cost profile, if you will, for longer term here. But it's \u2013 back to Gary's point earlier, it's working on all aspects of that.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Okay. I appreciate that. And then, one of the things I know I've talked to you guys about in the past, but service companies are highlighting, and that's the ability to go back and refrac wells, which at this juncture some people are posing that that could be a significant driver to higher rates of return, obviously for lower capital spending. How are you guys thinking about that in the Wattenberg at this juncture, and how are you studying that currently?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, as you would expect, especially up in Wattenberg and the DJ Basin, we've had a long history and our predecessors had a long history of utilizing existing wellbores, especially in the vertical world where they were \u2013 we had been in the mode of refracs and even trifracs. So, there's a lot of history there.","I think in the horizontal world, obviously, it poses some other complexities, if you will, with using the long lateral, especially on long lateral lengths. But we did a few up there previously, and we've also done a few in the Marcellus. And I think it's probably going to take a little more time. The ones we initially did were probably in areas that hadn't performed as well initially, though we saw some benefit from that.","The real test will be when we start at some point trying to do this in areas that have had very good results, but after three of four years or so like we did in the vertical program, you start to look at, can you go back in and bust open some more rock and get some more incremental recovery.","I think, David, it's just part of what's in the toolbox of things we're looking at as to how we take the percent recovery from single-digit to double-digits up there in the Basin and I don't know \u2013 Gary, anything else on that?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President, Operations","I think, as Dave said, we've done some in both places, the Marcellus, we did some refracs as well as some re-perforating on some older wells. And had some very nice results on those where the production rates came back up to actually the initial rates of the wells. DJ, we've done a number.","Results have been a bit more mixed there, being able to mechanically isolate the fracs has remained the big issue there. You've seen a lot of talk recently around different means of diverting. We've tried some of those. We're not really ready to comment on the results yet. We're also working on a couple of other ideas that haven't seen mentioned too much publicly. So, we'll continue to chase a few things. I think this is something that, eventually, a lot of smart engineers in the industry will figure out how to fix it, and create a whole other wave of opportunity in these fields.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Appreciate that. One last one if I can just sneak it in. How are you guys thinking about hedging in 2016 at this juncture with the movement we've seen in the forward strip?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We've got some volume hedged in 2016, I think, it's, what 25%?.","Kenneth M. Fisher - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It's about 29%, David. I think the way \u2013 our hedging program has been very successful over time in that we don't \u2013 we try to average in, so we'll set up a plan rate and then we'll watch the market, and go slowly. So, that's allowed us to be well hedged in \u2013 through time. And we've had big hedge settlements in 2009, big positive hedge settlements in 2009, and, of course, this year, and if this \u2013 again, 2016, depending on how things play out. At the same time, we haven't given up much headroom or had negative settlements of any note. So, the program has been effective, and we'll continue to do a current year plus two, and, typically, about 50% of the volume and average in.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, we'll continue to look for opportunities and an upswing in commodity market. But as Ken said, the target is 50% on global oil and 50% on U.S. gas is kind of what we hold ourselves to.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Great. Really appreciate the additional color there. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","And next, we'll move onto Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. I wondered if I could ask a question on the DJ. With the 8% sequential production growth there quarter-over-quarter, I think that's the highest we've seen in a while, and I'm wondering if you can comment on whether that's maybe the beginning of a trend we see as you kind of unload the spring and get the midstream debottlenecked or maybe if it's more reflective of kind of a reduced operational pace, and so kind of reduced offset well shut-ins is \u2013 fracs \u2013 and if you can kind of give us a sense of the bigger picture there.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Charles. I appreciate it. I think it was a big quarter in the DJ, obviously. I think we benefited some from coming off the activity levels late last year which we actually dropped or reduced from 10 rigs late last year into starting this year off \u2013 or say starting this year off here in the first quarter, moving down to four rigs on that. So, we'll see that change a little bit. Gary can talk a little bit on how he sees the year playing out as we go through the year, and we still have some of the big processing facility to come on here in the end of the second quarter too which will impact things.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President, Operations","Yeah. I wouldn't attribute any of it really or much of it to lower activity levels and less offset shut-ins with fracs. As you probably remember, a lot of our completions in 2014 were towards the back-end loaded, so a lot of wells came on late in 4Q and we certainly got an uplift from that in the first quarter of this year. We have dropped down from the 10 rigs to the four rigs, so we're working off that completion backlog that we brought into the year as well.","I think when you look at our profile through the year, we expect to \u2013 1Q to be the highest, be fairly flat maybe through first half and then start to decline in the second half as we get back into more of an equilibrium that you would expect with only running the four rigs. Now what remains to be seen on top of that is how much of an uplift we truly get from the startup of the Lucerne-2 gas plant that DCP is bringing on in June. That's 200 million cubic feet a day plant, we would certainly expect to see some recovery from our legacy program, the vertical wells, the older horizontal wells from reduced pressures when that plant comes on. We've got a little bit of that baked into the plan but we could see more than that.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And don't forget, as we talked on the last call, we've kind of level loaded our completions here for the year and so, as we get more completions later in the year, as I mentioned earlier, that actually helps us on next year's volume.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. That makes sense, Dave. And Gary, that's good detail on what you guys have, kind of \u2013 that you have a portion of the Lucerne \u2013 portion of, I guess, I should say, the possible Lucerne uplift baked in.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President, Operations","Right.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Dave, if I could get you to go back to talk about the Eastern Med and I recognize that maybe you guys don't want to go into too much detail, but I'm going to try to see if we can...","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're going to push on that...","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Maybe get a little more out of you. But so, you've got \u2013 I recognize that they haven't seen the new parliament and haven't worked out the new coalition, that sort of thing. But maybe you could talk a bit about how you got this finalized agreement because it seems like \u2013 I know this news came out a little bit earlier. But that to me seems like, while it's not a big deal, it's an important hurdle that you now have exports approved to go out of the country. But how did that come together in the absence of a seated parliament and how should we \u2013 does that have any implications for what the process looks like for your interruptible Egypt agreement?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good connection there, Charles. I'd say that, yeah, even though it is a small volume, it is important from the standpoint that it was the first real export agreement. So, we had a chance to work through the process, if you will, and get some of the kinks out in that process on how you approach that and how you get an approval of that type of thing. So, for that first agreement over there to Jordan. Probably Keith can expand on that a little bit more since he's been closer to it.","J. Keith Elliott - Senior VP-Eastern Mediterranean Region","Yeah, Charles. I think with respect to the Arab Potash-Jordan Bromine agreement that you're referring to, that really is a result of ongoing engagement with the government really over a period of probably a year, year and a half where we've been pursuing the really implementation of the export policy that the government established back in 2012 and 2013 timeframe. So, a number of these things are within the control of specific ministries.","And so, this is the case in point where it's completely within the remit of the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources. Others are more complex that require the alignment across ministries, and that's really been the benefit that we've seen of this inter-ministerial working group. It's caused a number of ministries that typically don't work as closely together as might be needed to create the kind of framework that investors look for. It's caused \u2013 it's provided a venue for those groups to work together, and that's been the real positive thing I think that's come out of this for us.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But I think the second part of your question, does it help with setting a pathway for the interruptible contract approval by the government and actually both governments, Israel and Egypt, for that. And I think it does help with that, and that's one we're continuing to keep our eye on and push because we think that could be another very important milestone if you will in how things are progressing over there.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Right. Because \u2013 and just to sneak this in, David, because that would establish precedent for Israeli exports to Egypt even though it's \u2013 it would be an existing pipeline network, and so, if you get that in place, then presumably you've got one big hurdle down on the idea of getting Leviathan gas through some new offshore pipeline to Egypt?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right, because then you would have had approvals on contracts, precedent contracts, if you will, to both neighboring countries that are also going to be important for Leviathan.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","And next, we'll move on to David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Actually the questions around Israeli exports are what I was aiming for, so thanks a lot, guys.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, David.","Operator","Thank you. Next, let's go onto Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning. Couple of questions on the DJ. The first, you highlighted $3.8 million well costs for the Wells Ranch, 4,500-foot lateral. I just wanted to see where you think that can go based on the trends in service cost deflation and efficiency gains that you're seeing. And whether you think, as you allocate more capital and drill more wells given the rig efficiencies whether you actually see any upward pressure on costs, as more of the operators seem to be willing to allocate or maybe willing to allocate more capital there towards the end of the year.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Yeah. I think, Brian, as you've pointed out, we showed a $3.8 million Wells Ranch cost and case and that's reflective of what we've been experienced or experienced here earlier in the first quarter. Is there room for it to continue to come down? I'd say, probably, as we continue to get more efficient, but probably worth Gary talking a little bit about how sees that playing out.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President, Operations","Yeah. I probably feel a little even stronger about it than Dave. The $3.8 million is what we had in the budget. We essentially have achieved that by the end of the first quarter. And when you look at other wells that we drilled in Wells Ranch since then, by the end of April, we were drilling wells as low as $3.4 million, some in the $3.6 million to $3.7 million range.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","This is drilled and complete?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President, Operations","Drilled and complete, yeah, and continuing to drive that cost down. So, one thing worth noting and I think we had it in the notes, but when we talk drilling complete numbers whether it's the $3.8 million on the slide or the $3.4 million that we've done since then, that really is an all-in cost. That includes all the pad costs allocated to the wells, new facilities allocated to the wells, as well as when we get into areas where there's vertical legacy wells that if any prep work needs to be done on those, that gets allocated back to the wells. So, that truly is an all-in costs.","I think hitting the $3.4 million in April says a lot about our ability to continue to drive it down especially as we continue to drive drilling times down to those five-day records I mentioned on a normal length lateral and seven days on a long length lateral. But the cost savings is really coming across the board. It's coming in drilling efficiencies, it's coming in supply cost reductions, it's coming in greater utilization of consolidated facilities and we're just going to continue to push it. We've got a technical limit case that's actually significantly below the $3.4 million even and we're working towards that.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, I'd say, Brian, where we are and what we've represented is what we've done now on a fairly consistent basis for the first quarter, probably too early to call victory on \u2013 beneath that yet but we've getting that we're getting some very good indications that there's more to come there.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. That's helpful. And then couple of months ago, it seems like there was a level of either optimism or hopefulness that there would be some consolidation opportunities that may come up. I just wanted to see with the oil prices and valuations higher, how you're thinking about that and where you see opportunity?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, I think like everybody, we're continuing to keep our eye open. We probably, with some of our realignment of internal resources, we've dedicated some more folks or business development group to continue to proactively look at what would be of interest to us. I think as far as anything new, it would have to be something that would have the scale to be in a core area or add to a core area and it would have to be something that had an inventory that would compete with the inventory we have from an economic development standpoint. So, as like \u2013 I'm sure like most everybody else, if you've got a position of strength, like a financial position that we have, you'll continue to look for, is there things that would be accretive to your opportunity set. But too early to tell right now.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Rowe with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I just had a quick question on the Marcellus. So, I just want to make sure I understand, the $200 million net reduction in capital, is that just effectively deferring new spuds, because you've reiterated your completion count and production volumes for the region in 2015?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's really a reflection of bringing down that rig activity on both sides, the wet gas and the dry gas for the \u2013 really, the biggest impact of that will be the second half of the year. And with the efficiencies that we've continued to gain out there, too, we've continued to build up the inventory of completions. So, it just didn't make sense to continue drilling a lot of wells and stacking up a lot of completions out there at this point in time.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President, Operations","Yeah. This is Gary. It's primarily on the drilling side. I think we've reduced our new wells online in the Marcellus by about four wells for the year. So, it's pretty immaterial, mostly on the drilling side.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And just one question on the Eastern Mediterranean program with the added capacity from the Ashdod compression project, realistically, how often do you think you'll be able to take advantage of that additional capacity? In other words, do you see foresee enough domestic demand growth to allow for more net sales on top of just seasonal peaking needs for air conditioning in the third quarter?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we saw I think quarter-on-quarter, first quarter versus first quarter last year, it was up about 10%. I think as far as truly using all of that capacity, it will just be during peak periods, and that can be peak hours of the day or it can be more in the summer. Third quarter is usually our highest quarter over there, so that's probably when we'll see it the most.","The other piece of that that it's important for is it provides more capacity for this interruptible volumes once that's worked out and approved and moving forward. So, that will be the knock-on effect of it.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And next, we'll move on to Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. I was hoping you could speak to well costs in the Marcellus. You talked a lot about DJ, but can you give us a sense of what type of costs you're seeing today both on an operated, non-operated basis and the improvements you've seen?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Gary, do you want to provide any color on that?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President, Operations","Yeah. I think our drilling and complete in the Marcellus, it varies obviously across the basin, but the average is probably about $8 million \u2013 $7 million to $8 million for a 7,000-foot lateral, 8,000-foot lateral in that range.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President, Operations","It's pretty much $1 million per 1,000-foot lateral is the way to think about it right now.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, obviously, you guys made a conscious effort, decision here with your partner to reduce activity. I'm imagining that probably part of that was due to weak gas prices that we're experiencing here. Can you talk at all about what type of gas prices you and your partner think you guys would need to see before picking up activity again?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It might not \u2013 I think what you're seeing is reflective now of coming out of winter and where the prices and the outlook for pricing are for the rest of this year coming out of winter. I think we'll continue to meet with them regularly. I mean, we've got monthly reviews with them and more regular discussion on the longer-term outlook. And, yeah, I don't think either of us are prepared to nail down a particular price for a particular activity yet.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. I guess just, I'm going over the second quarter guidance here. You guys obviously are expecting volumes to come down here in terms of sales volumes. Could you kind of give us some granularity in terms of the level of maintenance you're expecting in the second quarter if you had kind of a number you could sort of throw out there?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, the main part of that, I think the vast majority of it is all \u2013 or the largest portion of it is the downtime and planned down time in West Africa between the planned downtime and lifting schedules there. So I think that's kind of approaching 15,000 barrels a day equivalent or so. And then you have some knock-on effects that as you've got some facilities that have some rig moves and so forth that affect our volumes in the Gulf of Mexico.","So, those are the two big things along with the normal seasonal demand decrease as we expect and have seen every year in the second quarter in the Eastern Med. So I mean, that's what it's all attributed to. No different than we expected going into the year.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, you spoke a lot about well costs coming down in the DJ. Have you seen anything in terms of improved well performance in the DJ, other than just faster drilling times and more costs?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President, Operations","Yeah. I think we continue to gather data from all the testing we did last year. You'll remember we tested quite a few different completion techniques last year. And we're starting to zero in on the ones that we are going to implement across the Basin for most of this year.","I think when you look at our performance, really in the last six months to nine months, with everything that we've tried, we're at or above the type curves that we've been expecting to see as we test these downspaced areas. So, I'd say everything is pretty much on track right now. We'll continue to look for ways to improve the completions going forward.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I think I mentioned, Leo, on my call, 11 wells up there in East Pony that we did some different completion on. And those have been a positive improvement, too.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President, Operations","That's a combination, Leo, of really looking for ways where we can continue to drive costs down without impacting the value of the properties. So, those 11 wells in East Pony that are slickwater, that saves $100,000 to $200,000 per well off the D&C cost, and as Dave said, they're performing as expected or better, so...","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Grigel with Macquarie.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Good morning. On the DJ, noting that there was the asset sale during the quarter, are you looking to sell other assets in the Basin outside of the IDPs? And if so, any thoughts on what the use of capital would be if those came to fruition?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think as you saw from what we sold earlier this year, it would be areas that are, for us, would be long-term development. They'd be outside of the IDP areas, things that we wouldn't have plans for for a number of years, and somebody else that may fit into their portfolio sooner. But there's not a whole lot of that up there that we'd be looking at. It'd be around the fringes, I guess. I don't know. Gary, any other comment?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President, Operations","No. That's fair to say. It'd be around the fringes. There might be some other small deals. But I wouldn't expect anything of the magnitude of that one anytime soon.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And on the capital budget for the year, could you just remind us what your assumption was when you set the budget in terms of service cost reductions and then what you've seen to-date? And if your plan is to continue to reinvest those saving in completions in the DJ area or is it to keep it on the balance sheet going forward?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, we'll have the opportunity of \u2013 we'll continue to drive savings down to continue to look at which makes most sense, which creates more value. Or as, I think when you look at it, it was the $2.9 billion was \u2013 and when we were looking at the budget, we were looking at that relative to a $50 to $55 oil price and we were assuming probably, on a full-year basis, around 10% if I remember right on the average savings overall on those.","And you see a little higher savings that we're seeing on some of the completion part, but you have to look at the total cost. So, I think it's too early for us to adjust anything yet, which is why we haven't changed our capital outlook for the year, but we'll continue to look at that as we get another quarter under our belt.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike Scialla with Stifel.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hi. Gary, in response to Leo's question, you addressed this a little bit, but I wanted to follow up on it. You'd said that you're trying different things in the DJ. And so far, pretty much everything has kind of met your expectations. You were doing a lot of testing on downspacing, particularly in Wells Ranch last year, and I'm just wondering with the slowdown in the drilling activity, has that slowed that whole downspacing process or are you comfortable saying what the level of spacing is, at least in Wells Ranch at this point \u2013 I realize that it varies across the field. And if you're not ready to say, do you have a timeline on how much data do you think you need to see before you will be?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President, Operations","Yeah. We're not ready to say yet. I'd say, as far as when, it'll be probably towards the end of this year. I think what I would point out is that we said all through last year that we \u2013 we're devoting a large part of that program to testing downspacing at 24 wells per section, and 32 wells per section, and then we wanted to get the wells on and really gather some longer term data, and we have ramped that downspacing program almost down to nothing this year. That has doesn't really have anything to do with the commodity environment; that was the plan all along until we had gathered the data on the pilots that we did last year.","So, all of the resource numbers, everything we've ever talked about, location counts for the field has always been based on 16 wells per section. We've talked about \u2013 we do expect it to be different spacing in different parts of the field. 16 wells per section as an average is certainly still a very good number, a conservative number I think. We see some areas where we do expect it to be greater spacing than that, more than 16 wells. There may be some areas that end up being less than 16 wells and I still feel very comfortable overall with where we're at.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think the other part of that, too, and Gary alluded to the amount of downspacing of drilling we did last year that we've been bringing wells on now, we'll start to have a sense of that across \u2013 I think it was all of the initial five IDP areas...","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President, Operations","Right.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...that we had some downspacing last year. So it's \u2013 we'll get a much larger database here this year to compare and look at beyond just the Wells Ranch area.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. That's helpful. And to follow up on the slickwater comment, sounds like working nicely in East Pony. Is that potential for the rest of the field as well?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President, Operations","I think we'll just have to see, Mike. I think we're definitely seeing encouraging early results in East Pony. We've done some slickwater tests in the past in other parts of the field, and it's been less conclusive, I'd say, in the other parts of the field. So, we'll just to continue to test things in different areas, and see what's the best application in each area. But East Pony's looking good.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And some of this may evolve too as you're getting down into \u2013 in increased density or tighter density where you're not having to carry your proppant as far away from the wellbore and you're getting that higher concentration near the wellbore, that may drive some changes in how we use fluids then and just concentrations here.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks. And then last one for me, the Rhea prospect in the Falklands, are you comfortable keeping that 75% working interest, or are you looking to sell that down at all?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, we're probably comfortable with that for this first well. I mean, we would be looking at a project where we would get down into that 50% or so range overall, and we're talking to some folks now out there. But whether something changes before we drill the well or not is not dependent on drilling of this well. That's a pretty low-cost well. I mean, it's in \u2013 I mean, relatively, it's in about 1,500 feet of water depth than \u2013 and the TD is 9,000 feet or so. So, it's a very nice prospect offsetting some recent discoveries. So, it was a nice addition to the portfolio and somewhat de-risking some of our play types down in that area.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","And next, we'll move on to Gail Nicholson with the KLR Group.","Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC","Good morning. I was just curious as to the standpoint of the lower service cost environment. Does that accelerate the potential for sanctioning projects in the portfolio still in order to lock in lower costs for long lead items?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think the piece on as far as sanctioning projects would be for those big offshore projects; projects like in the Eastern Med. It will be dependent on how the pricing environment holds up when we're getting closer to sanctioned. I think directionally, it's heading to where you'd potentially have the ability to lock in some lower cost projects than you would have a year or two ago. We might have the opportunity just as a reminder like we did coming out of the 2008, 2009 period when we were able to lock in kind of Tamar, Aseng, Alen, and take advantage of a lower supply cost, service cost environment. So it's going to be dependent on where we are when we're really getting back to truly negotiating the final agreement.","Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC","Okay. Great. And then just on the standpoint of the Falklands. What's the infrastructure like down there? You had mentioned that Cheetah was successful in Cameroon, that you did that on relatively quickly. I was just kind of curious on the \u2013 with the Falklands successful find down there, what type of timeframe to bring the Falklands (58:37)?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It would be a much longer timeframe. You have to have large resources, you have to have probably bring in something like an FPSO facility, a standalone vessel. And so it's a little \u2013 a much different environment than in Cameroon. In Cameroon, what you mentioned, it's in very shallow water. It's like taking a \u2013 putting a \u2013 setting a Gulf of Mexico very shallow water platform and you could do that very fast. Falklands would be a longer time to development.","Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Morning. Just a quick question, acquisitions, can you just give us your latest thought as far as what you're seeing, what you're thinking, et cetera?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think we're still early on this cycle here. I think we'll \u2013 and as I mentioned earlier, we'll continue to focus on what would make sense to add to the portfolio, but it would have to be accretive from the standpoint that it would be an opportunity that had running room and inventory that competes with our current inventory, because we've got a nice inventory already out there. So, I don't know. It's early to say what that market could look like over time.","I think the benefit is and \u2013 that you \u2013 part of the benefit both for looking at new opportunities and being able to accelerate our own when you got a deep portfolio is maintaining that financial strength and that's why we've made sure we're in the position we're in now.","David R.

Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Whitmarsh. Please go ahead.","Brad Whitmarsh - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Levi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we issued our first quarter 2016 operational and financial news release, and we also posted a number of supplemental slides to our website. You will find them helpful as we talk through our prepared comments. Later this morning, our 10-Q will be filed with the SEC.","Following prepared comments from Dave Stover, Chairman, President and CEO; and Gary Willingham, EVP of Operations, we'll open the call for a Q&A session. In order to meet our one hour timeframe, we would ask that participants limit themselves to one primary and one follow-up question. Additional management members available for Q&A are Ken Fisher, EVP and CFO; Susan Cunningham, EVP, Exploration and New Ventures; and Keith Elliott, SVP of our Eastern Mediterranean business.","I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call may contain projections and forward-looking statements, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those items.","With that, I'll turn the call to Dave.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. If you've had a chance to look at our earnings release and conference call slides this morning, I think you'll agree that we had a tremendous operating quarter and a very solid start to 2016. We began the year with these key goals: protect the balance sheet, align cash outflows with cash inflows, leverage the benefits of our diversified portfolio, and optimize returns with enhanced completion. First quarter results show we are delivering on each of these objectives.","Before going into our results, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the current environment. With the U.S. rig count at a record low, significantly lower investment is translating into production declines in the majority of unconventional basins. It is my hope that we will continue to see capital discipline throughout the industry regarding activity levels. Even if we see sustained higher commodity prices, any meaningful U.S. production impact from increased industry activity is likely to take several months from initial investment decisions.","Outside North America, non-OPEC major project deferrals are beginning to add up to at least a few million barrels per day through 2020. While there have been early indications of a potential commodity price turn, I expect commodities will continue to show volatility day-to-day and week-to-week. Regardless, no matter what commodity environment persists, it is clear to me, Noble Energy is well positioned to sustain and create long-term value for its shareholders.","Moving to our results, we continued to lower both our capital and underlying cost structure in the first quarter. This was primarily the result of impressive and sustainable efficiency gains in our U.S. onshore business. Capital expenditures were below the low end of our guidance and decreased for a sixth consecutive quarter as we managed within cash flow. We came in well below guidance on most of our key cost metrics. Total lease operating expense and general and administrative costs in the first quarter of 2016, which included Rosetta, were flat in an absolute amount compared to a Noble-only first quarter of 2015. This is a powerful indication of our cost reduction efforts when you consider the company added almost 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over that same period. Excluding the Isabela workover, unit lease operating expense was down 34% from the first quarter of last year.","At the same time, we exceeded the high end of our volume guidance with 416,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day sold in the first quarter. This is up more than 30% in total and 8% pro forma for the Rosetta merger versus the same quarter last year. Compared to guidance, oil was higher, NGLs was higher and so was gas. This was achieved by impressive productivity improvements in the U.S. with new completions, record first quarter sales volumes in Israel, and reduced downtime at Alba in Equatorial Guinea. In fact, every core area is delivering or exceeding our plans so far in 2016.","Execution stood out in the DJ Basin position, where completion optimization and longer laterals drove 34% growth in Wells Ranch and East Pony production compared to the same quarter of last year. And in the Delaware Basin, where we're just getting started, third party analysis of state data indicates Noble Energy has the highest productivity per lateral foot in the basin this year.","Equally as important, we maintained our robust financial position, ending the quarter with $5 billion in liquidity. Since quarter end, we have executed asset sales transactions totaling nearly $550 million, including the transaction announced yesterday. Combined with first quarter proceeds received, we will have generated total proceeds of over $775 million so far in 2016. The Greeley Crescent transaction significantly accelerates the value of this acreage for Noble Energy. It is an area that would not have been developed for some time as we are currently focused on higher value areas within the DJ Basin. Gary will talk more about this shortly.","Our continuous focus on disciplined capital allocation and prudent balance sheet management did not go unnoticed by the rating agencies. We not only maintained our investment grade rating at Moody's and S&P, but received an initial investment grade rating from Fitch as well. Ken and the treasury team do a great job continuing engagement with the rating agencies, and I believe we are one of only four of our peers with investment grade ratings across the board.","Our strong underlying performance, the recent upward move in commodity prices, and announced proceeds from asset sales position us to generate significant excess cash in 2016, and give us more flexibility for the future. At current prices, we continue to be focused on balance sheet strength and the opportunity to pay down debt. As commodity prices move and sustain above $50 per barrel, we will begin to consider additional capital allocation to the U.S. unconventional business, with initial focus on our low cost and liquid rich assets in the DJ Basin in Texas. We've continued the trend of improving our performance in the first quarter and I'm confident there is much more to come.","I will now turn the call over to Gary Willingham.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, we've continued with very high levels of operating momentum in the early part of the year, particularly in the U.S. onshore business. The level of engagement by our entire organization to continuously drive efficiencies throughout the business is certainly apparent, and realized drilling time reductions and enhanced productivity in all of our basins.","The DJ Basin, once again, delivered production outperformance at lower costs. First quarter production totaled 118,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. During the quarter, we reduced normalized extended-reach lateral well costs to $2.7 million in Wells Ranch, down 35% from the first quarter of 2015 despite utilizing higher proppant concentrations. This decrease is the result of intense focus on drilling and completion execution, and utilizing the best rigs and the best crews in the basin.","We continue to shift our well design to include more monobore drilling, which provides many benefits, particularly for the combination of longer laterals and slickwater fracs. On the first 35 monobore wells we've drilled, we're observing reduced drill times of 1.5 days to 2.5 days or 30%, the ability to eliminate gel and tow stages in the long laterals, and finally, the monobores also provide more options for future well interventions.","Completion design continues to evolve rapidly and is paying off in impressive well productivity. You can see on slide five, the average IP-30 rate per lateral foot was up more than 30% from the same period a year ago. And the liquids content of the well, which came online in 2016, is higher than in prior years. This productivity improvement reflects both a shift to slickwater fluid, as well as enhanced proppant loading. Both Noble Energy's and third party infrastructure have been performing well, keeping line pressures low throughout the field. A planned turnaround at our Wells Ranch Central Processing Facility was completed in April. This was part of routine maintenance and is the first since the facility startup three years ago.","Yesterday, we announced a transaction to sell approximately 33,000 net acres from our Greeley Crescent area, which is located on the western side of our DJ acreage position. Representing about half of our acreage in Greeley Crescent, the transaction accelerates value to Noble Energy from an area which was not in our development plan for many years. Our strategy is to focus on areas with higher oil content, where we have more contiguous acreage and can drive efficiency gains through long lateral development and existing infrastructure. Greeley Crescent is an area with very little production and horizontal drilling history and the transaction highlights the strong value of undeveloped acreage in the DJ Basin. Total proceeds are expected to be $505 million.","In Texas, we continued to deliver results that confirm our high quality positions in both the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin. Drilling times are down 20% from prior performance on these assets, and we announced several exciting well results this morning. Results from our first two Delaware completions in Reeves County are impressive. The average IP-30 rate of over 320 barrels of oil equivalent per thousand lateral feet is nearly 15% better than the prior average on these assets.","I want to turn your attention to slide seven, which provides more details. These first wells validate our Tier 1 Wolfcamp A position across the eastern and western extent of the acreage. The Calamity Jane well in the east is performing significantly above Noble's 700,000 barrel type curve, with oil production in line and gas showing material outperformance. We are also pleased to see our western extension test, the Soapy Smith well, performing consistent with the Tier 1 type curve. These outstanding results right out of the gate demonstrate the transferability of our U.S. onshore completion expertise, and we will continue to delineate the acreage position while further optimizing completions this year.","In the Eagle Ford, we're seeing early success bringing our improved completion designs from South Gates Ranch to new areas, unlocking additional resource potential. As slide eight indicates, the two Briscoe Ranch wells brought on during the quarter are materially outperforming the 400,000 barrel type curve you can see on the chart. In fact, they're actually outperforming even a 1 million barrel type curve.","These wells had an average lateral length of 4,900 feet and were completed with 2,000 pounds of proppant per lateral foot. The better performing well was designed with tighter cluster spacing. In March, we brought online six Gates Ranch wells which tested various spacing and completion concepts. We're just now seeing production post cleanup, and these wells will drive significant volume growth in Texas during the second quarter.","In the Marcellus, exceptional operational performance continues to ensure deliverability of base production. We remain well aligned with our partner to be cash flow neutral in the joint venture in 2016, and we'll continue to be flexible with completion activity for the remainder of the year.","We started the year strongly in the Gulf of Mexico with Big Bend and Dantzler contributing 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net to Noble Energy during the quarter. This drove Gulf of Mexico oil volumes up almost 100% in the first quarter compared to the prior year. In addition, the Isabela workover was completed ahead of schedule, and Gunflint continues to progress toward a midyear 2016 startup. We recently commenced drilling an appraisal well at Katmai. This well will test resource upside to the 40 million to 60 million barrels of oil equivalent already discovered, and we anticipate results early in the fourth quarter.","Sales volumes in West Africa averaged 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Strong underlying performance at Aseng and Alen continued during the quarter, and at Alba, installation of the new B3 compression platform was carried out with fewer downtime days than expected. Commissioning and startup of the compression platform, which will enhance full field recovery, remains on schedule for midyear.","In Israel, natural gas sales volumes averaged 266 million cubic feet of gas per day. This represents an increase of nearly 10% from the same period last year despite mild weather experienced thus far in 2016. With the Israeli government's mandate to reduce coal fire generation by 15% year-over-year, we've seen consistent incremental coal to gas switching on the order of 50 million cubic feet per day gross with potential upside to that number.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Dave.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Gary. Before providing details on our adjusted guidance, I'd like to take a moment to provide a further update on our Israel project. Tamar's production growth, resilient cash flows and access to significantly undersupplied markets make it one of the most attractive assets in the world. Leviathan is the same quality asset on an even larger scale with a total recoverable resource of 22 trillion cubic feet of gas based on multiple appraisal wells drilled and a production test as well.","In late March, Israel's Supreme Court acknowledged the strategic and national importance of these discoveries by upholding all but one of the provisions of the natural gas framework. The court recognized the importance of stabilization, but rejected the specific provision in the framework. We are engaged with the government as it works to timely address the Supreme Court's concern.","In the meantime, we continue to progress the other three critical requirements for Leviathan sanctions: financing, marketing and technical readiness. We are pleased that the Israeli National Planning Committee recently approved the location of the Leviathan platform and pipeline connection in Northern Israel. I am convinced that Leviathan, along with Tamar, will supply much needed gas for both Israel and the neighboring region for decades.","We've provided a full update to our 2016 guidance on slide 11. Normally, I wouldn't change our outlook so early in the year, but this reflects the high level of confidence I have in our strategy, assets, execution and ultimately, our future. Full year sales are now expected to average 405,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 4% from the original guidance with increased expectations for all three commodities. The production raise is based primarily on outperformance in the DJ Basin, Israel and West Africa. And on the capital side, we are trending on a path to come in under $1.5 billion. For the second quarter, capital is expected to be in line with the first quarter.","Sales volumes are anticipated to range between 405,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Volumes are expected to be impacted by seasonality in Israel and facility turnaround in the DJ Basin. This will be partially offset by significant quarter-over-quarter growth in Texas. We also expect higher volumes in West Africa as a result of Alba field production returning to full rate.","In summary, I continue to be pleased with the capital efficiencies generated across the business. Our financial strengths, asset quality, and onshore and offshore expertise give us a unique competitive advantage in any commodity environment.","At this time, Levi, why don't we go ahead and open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Congratulations on the asset sale last night. There's an echo in the line here. How should we think about asset sale targets for the year? Is there a program? And what is it you suppose you \u2013 to further bolster the balance sheet or improve your ability to reaccelerate?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, as far as potential sales, I think this was an opportunity where we saw that it could create more value for somebody else and essentially create more value for us by monetizing the asset. It was something that in our plans, we weren't going to be developing for a while given where it fit in the portfolio. So it made sense to move forward. I'd say when we look at things in general, it goes back to kind of what our philosophy has been as we've always looked at all parts of our portfolio. If we can create more value out of it than somebody else, then we're going to do that. If there's some reason that it can \u2013 we can realize more value from it by moving it to somebody else's hands, we'll look at that.","I think as we look at the year and what we've talked about previously, the one place where Noble continued to look at potential monetization of a portion of our business is over in Israel with Tamar, for example. We've talked about it as part of the framework that over six years, we'll look to bring down our interest from 36% to 25%. I'd say in the current environment, there's still a lot of interest in other folks wanting to get into that field. So there could be a possibility we might bring down some of our interest this year, but it's too early to say.","So, I would say that's the main one we're continuously focused on. Outside of that, we still have a big Midstream business that we've kept that S-1 active. And at some point in time, I think we'll see some real value, additional value, come out of that part of the business. So, that's kind of how I think about the portfolio. Most of it is all cored up. We don't have a lot of fringe pieces. But as in the case of this opportunity, if it makes sense to accelerate value, we'll look at it.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","My second question is similar. Your CapEx is trending well below in 1Q, and you gave a guide that was modestly lower. On the last year, many cycled those savings into higher activity. Are you considering recycling the lower CapEx in the market or you're \u2013 is this just in conjunction with asset sales continuing to improve the balance sheet?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think in this environment, and too early to see a sustained different price outlook at this point, I mentioned in the prepared comments, our initial focus, our primary focus is maintaining the strength of the balance sheet, so it gives us more flexibility and more opportunity there. I think as we see, and we'll see how it progresses through the year as we start to see more of a sustainable higher price environment, then we'll look at activity levels later in the year. But at this point, assuming we keep the same price outlook that we have right now, first priority is probably to continue to maintain the balance sheet. But I'd say one of the things we've done with the way we've looked at even our organization and how we've managed our business, we've maintained the capability to probably adjust relatively quickly as conditions change. So this just gives us more flexibility and optionality to do that over time.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Appreciate it, guys.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Dave, and to the rest of your team there. I had a question on the Delaware Basin wells. Those look like really encouraging results, but I was really surprised by the relatively short length of the laterals. And I wonder if you can talk about your lease geometry there, whether it supports longer laterals and if and when those would become part of your development plan.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'll let Gary dive into that one, Charles, but I'd say I share your enthusiasm for the results, especially when you look at the fact that we tested two wells on \u2013 one on the far eastern side and one on the far western side of our continuous acreage, but let me turn that over to Gary.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah, Charles, I'd say the length of those laterals is definitely tied more to kind of lease issues at the time they were drilled more than an indication of plans going toward. The Soapy Smith, certainly, the well on the west side is less than 2,800-foot lateral. That was actually drilled by Rosetta prior to the transaction and it was drilled to hold that particular lease. So I think as we continue to satisfy the remaining lease obligations in the area and move into more of a development phase going on, you'll see longer and longer laterals in those areas.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for that, Gary. And then the \u2013 my second question falls, I suppose, on the CapEx or use of proceeds of this Greeley Crescent sale. Your new guidance is for less than $1.5 billion. And I think that's probably nonspecific by design. And I'm wondering if you could give us a sense for what the moving pieces are that would get you under $1.5 billion or if that's just simply a reflection of you coming in under in the first quarter. And if that $500 million is just going to kind of sit on the balance sheet or be there for the case where oil goes back over $50 or perhaps, it's used to pay down the term loan?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, Charles, I think when you look at it \u2013 I'll go back to my comment that I usually don't like to change guidance this early in the year. But I think it's pretty obvious from the way our capital efficiency played out in the first quarter, the continued improvements we're seeing, especially in our onshore programs on what we're spending versus what we're getting, that we needed to indicate, at least directionally, where this was going to come. But I think as far as by design, we haven't given a specific number because we're keeping that flexibility as things change through the year. And all I'd say is on the planned activity, we're definitely on trend when you look at it to come in under the $1.5 billion and we'll see how the year plays out. As far as to your point, we've brought in some other proceeds. We're well positioned when it makes sense to increase activity, but we're not going to do that until we're comfortable and we've got a sustainable environment that supports it.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful color. Thank you, Dave.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Good morning, Dave, and thanks for the commentary. One consistent theme that we have heard through earnings season is that $50 a barrel fulcrum point for potentially more activity. What do you forecast or what do you think the industry should forecast for increasing services costs in an accelerating environment?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's a good question, Dave. I think obviously, you would expect it's going to be driven by activity, and it's also going to be driven by the ability of the service sector to get the people back to work. So one of the things we've tried to do is maintain those relationships, especially in the key basins, so that we're kind of on the priority list for returning to work, if you will. Yeah, I don't have a real strong sense as to what's the magic price. I think it's going be more what's the magic amount of activity that starts to put more pressure on the service sector or the supply of available resource, and then we'll just have to see \u2013 it plays from there.","I think the one thing that's been encouraging from some of this is we've really focused on some of the efficiencies, and you've seen this from a number of folks, the other piece of that is that there's still a large piece of this that we're seeing probably 50% or more of our onshore cost reduction that we think is at least sustainable in a much higher price environment just from the way we've changed the way we're doing our business. Then when you look at the other part going forward, and here's where the diversified portfolio plays in, I think there's still a lot of room for offshore projects, especially new project cost to come down and stay down for a while, and not respond real quickly to any change.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Helpful perspective. Thanks, Dave.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore ISI","Great. Good morning. Quick question. David, I appreciate all the comments on capital flexibility. Can you remind us, as we want to think forward to 6 months or 12 months from now and even into 2017, how do you think about your flexibility on capital? So can you just remind us what you think maintenance capital is for U.S. onshore business in this environment? And maybe any major project obligations you think you have, either Gulf of Mexico, West Africa or internationally, again, acknowledging that, that's all dependent on project sanction and everything? But how do you think about the flexibility around the program in 2017?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think we have tremendous flexibility in 2017, probably even more so than we had going into 2016. I think the only places that we're looking at as far as committed capital, if you will, when you start from a bottoms up, we have probably about a half year with our rig in the Gulf of Mexico and we have a few leases in the Texas properties that you'd want to drill to maintain your acreage position. But outside of that, we've got pretty much complete flexibility. So I think we've got a lot of room to make decisions based on whatever the environment turns out to be. I think as far as the maintenance piece, we kind of talked about that last time and I don't think our view on that's changed any.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore ISI","Okay. Appreciate that. And maybe on Israel, one thing that would be interesting is, what are your current thoughts on the potential expansion of Tamar? I appreciate the comments on the potential monetization of that 11% working interest, but how do you think about the potential expansion projects and some of the things that have been discussed in the past, and where they sit in the priority queue particularly relative to Leviathan?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well, I think a lot of the discussion has been, and what you'll see news on, is obviously getting this second big source of supply online. So that's been a lot of what the news focus has been on Leviathan. But if you step back and look at what's happening with Tamar, and I mentioned it or Gary or I both mentioned it, that you're seeing more of this push to move more of the power generation from coal to gas. We actually saw that show up in the first quarter. I think we're still being cautious about what we'll see for the rest of the year, but that's a near term positive impact for Tamar.","You still have the drive and the push from customers in Egypt to get gas, interruptible gas, as soon as that can be worked out. So I think when you look at both near and then the longer term market viability for both of those projects, it's a pretty exciting place to have that quality of opportunity when you think about the combination of the reservoir characteristics and the access to market over there for both of those, Tamar and Leviathan.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore ISI","I'm sorry, just one quick follow-up, David. So would you think that we would be in a position potentially to have an expansion of Tamar and concurrently, an FID and beginning of a project Leviathan at the same time in 2017 if everything lines up on the regulatory side?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","First, just because of the emphasis and the priority and the critical need to get that second big project on, I would continue to think of the Tamar expansion as probably following the Leviathan project.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore ISI","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning. I wanted to see if you guys could discuss the potential implications from an inventory perspective of some of the results that you shared at Briscoe Ranch.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Now, let me turn that over to Gary.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah, Arun. I think the exciting thing about the results we're seeing at Briscoe is we've taken an area and significantly improved it by taking learnings from South Gates Ranch to a new area in the Eagle Ford. And of course, a lot of the success that we've had in South Gates Ranch improvement, and you're seeing it in the Delaware now, too, comes from our prior experience in the Marcellus and the DJ. And collectively, as a company, we've completed over 1,600 horizontal wells now. So we've got a lot of learnings under our belt.","I think specifically for that acreage and the inventory and the running room, Briscoe Ranch is a fairly small portion of the acreage. It's less than 5,000 acres, I think. But the exciting thing is there's other acreage nearby which we think a lot of those same improvements and completion designs can be applied to, and we can see a perhaps similar uplift to the results on those wells. So even though that block of acreage isn't huge, it certainly applies elsewhere. We've continued to have quite a bit of inventory still in South Gates Ranch, North Gates Ranch, and then obviously, in the Delaware, we're just getting started with the first two wells.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. I think, Gary, you guys have talked about 165 locations at Gates Ranch and 475 elsewhere within the Eagle Ford. So you think that perhaps some of the enhanced completions could maybe improve the well productivity on the balance outside of Gates Ranch?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Absolutely. I mean, I think the results that we've seen and, again, it goes back to what we've done on the DJ and the Marcellus, now the Eagle Ford and the Permian, where we've continued to see improvement in results as we've continued to refine completion techniques. I think what you're seeing now is certainly \u2013 bodes well for the potential of the future completions in those areas. I think the numbers you're citing there are still based on wider spacing, too. So to the extent that we continue to get better at confining the frac and stimulating more of the near wellbore rock, that potentially opens up tighter spacing over time, too, which would only add to the inventory count.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And my follow-up is on the DJ. You talked about 30% kind of per lateral foot productivity gains. What also surprised me was just the oil mix in the new wells. So just wondering if you could maybe just talk to us on why you think the oil mix was higher. Was it related to mix? I know that the East Pony well was a little bit oilier, but could you maybe just talk through that? Because that is a pretty significant delta in terms of \u2013 versus the historical mix in the DJ.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah, I mean \u2013 and the numbers on that slide are obviously over a three-year period. So it just goes to show why over the last couple years, we've really been talking a lot about refocusing activity in the best of the best, which is the higher oil content areas, Wells Ranch and East Pony. East Pony is by far the highest oil percentage acreage that we have in our portfolio, and that's where a large number of the wells that we're bringing on early part of this year were from, so that's partly driving that percentage up.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And, Gary, just in terms of the overall type curve, you have some decent history now on the DJ. When could you potentially declare victory on a higher type curve given the slickwater and some of the enhanced completions that you're doing on the DJ?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","I think certainly, by year end, we'll probably start talking about new EURs and new type curves. I think we're not done testing new ideas. We've only recently really ramped up the sand concentration in some of these wells and we've only done it on a few so far. So I think we'd like to get a few more of those under our belt and see some extended production history on some of these wells before we update the numbers. But clearly, from what we're seeing in the early time data, the results are very encouraging versus what we've talked about in the past.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thanks a lot, Gary.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Morning. So, Dave, if I go back to that just $50 barrel type number, let's say Tamar, you get additional \u2013 let's say we go to $50, we stay there \u2013 or whatever the number is, you get an extra $300 million or $400 million of cash flow that you want to spend on CapEx. Where \u2013 I know you mentioned U.S. shale, but where specifically would that \u2013 how should we think about that allocation?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi. I think we'd continue to build out our DJ Basin, accelerate some of that inventory, and we'd probably ramp up and accelerate some of the Delaware Basin. I don't know. Gary, do you have any different view?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","No. I think that's where we'd focus.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And then second, if I think about the Greeley acreage, I mean, any concern about some of the setback? And does that factor in the decision to sell that versus other parts of the DJ that you don't have a development timeframe?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. I think when you're looking at any other factors like setback or some of these other things, I think for us, the biggest reason we \u2013 we've sold that acreage was we felt somebody else could create more value out of it by accelerating than we were going create over time, and it actually increased our value because what we're focusing on and what we will be for a while here is where we have infrastructure in place, where we can drill longer laterals and where we have a higher oil content. So I mean, those are the reasons we made that transaction.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David Kistler - Simmons & Company","Good morning, guys. Real quickly, one of the comments on acceleration of activity, can you guys just give us a little bit of color in terms of after making personnel adjustments, what kind of a rig ramp you could prosecute? Or in some respects, I guess, that would be offset by the efficiencies you've seen as well. But maybe kind of a max rig count that the current staff could handle?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and I'll turn that over to Gary for some color, but that's one of the things we took into consideration as we looked at any adjustments in our organization, was to make sure we had the flexibility to go up or down within a reasonable range. So let me ask Gary to just give you more of his thoughts on that.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah. No, Dave, that's true. We did retain a decent amount of flexibility in our ability to ramp up activity when prices recover. So we're just running the two rigs in the DJ right now. We've got the capacity to handle a bit more activity there than two rigs when time is right. I think when you look at Texas, we're running off and on one rig total between the two areas, and we can certainly increase that activity a bit within the constraints of the current organization. So I think for any reasonable amount of activity increase that you would expect to see over the near term, we're fine.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I think the other key thing with that, Dave, and I mentioned it earlier, is maintaining the relationships with the service providers so you can stay in the priority queue there.","David Kistler - Simmons & Company","Okay. Appreciate that. And then just looking at kind of the decline in well costs in the DJ Basin, obviously, completions have become more intense, and just trying to understand what the biggest driver of that is. I mean, we understand efficiency gains, but is there something you're doing differently that's allowing you to reduce the costs as dramatically as you were able to show this quarter?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah, Dave, I mean, it's a lot of things. It's not one thing that's driving it. I mean, you certainly see it in the continuing improvement in the drilling performance where we continue to set records on a fairly consistent basis, taking a little bit of time off here and there of our previous records on drilling times. Slickwater has certainly been a driver of it as well.","Moving to monobore drilling has helped by taking a day, sometimes more than that, off of the wells as well, so \u2013 and then in Wells Ranch and East Pony where we've got existing infrastructure and the ability to drill those long laterals, which can drive your average cost per foot down as well, certainly help out. So we do have some things that are offsetting that as we're moving to higher and higher sand concentrations, and testing some tighter spacing in some areas, but the good news is we've been able to deliver enough efficiencies in all the other areas to more than offset that and continue to drive costs down.","As we mentioned in the press release, we're down to $2.7 million in Wells Ranch on an extended-reach, well-adjusted back to a normal lateral length, and that's with some of the impact of the higher completion costs from the higher sand loading. If you go back to more of a traditional type completion design that we might have had in the past, those costs are down more to the $2.4 million range. So great job by the teams in continuing to execute and look for efficiencies.","David Kistler - Simmons & Company","And maybe just one follow-up. Is any of that cost savings associated with using existing pads or would that be a step shift change as you go to that over time?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","I'd say very little, if any, of it's probably associated with that in the DJ. We don't have a lot of activity in the DJ where we go back to an existing pad and drill more wells given the type of acreage we've got there, being HBP, and the ability to plan that out around the infrastructure development plans. We generally go in and build a pad and drill it out from the beginning. So there might be some savings of that type come up in the Permian later on as we go back and move to a development mode there, but I wouldn't expect a lot of that in the DJ.","David Kistler - Simmons & Company","Super. I appreciate the added color, guys. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jon Wolff with Jefferies.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Morning. Useful update. Noticing a gem in the press release that says that Noble acreage included in the transaction remains dedicated to Noble's \u2013 Noble Energy's Midstream business for oil and water gathering, as well as freshwater services. Is that something that could be contemplated within the Noble Midstream LP? And that's my first question.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'd say you're very observant, Jon. And there's...","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","There's not a lot. (43:25)","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, not a lot that we can talk about on that given that we still have that Midstream business plan sitting out there. But I \u2013 Ken, did you have anything to add?","Kenneth M. Fisher - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. It will be that it maintained for the entity that's in the S-1, but we can't really comment on the S-1 while it's on file.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Did you give away any White Cliffs capacity or any other firm capacity out of the Basin?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","With the transactions?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. No, we didn't.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And the other thing that occurs to me is, could there be a vertical angle here for the buyer on development?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Vertical angle, meaning...","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Vertical drilling. It looks like a fairly untouched area.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I...","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Refracs or...","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not privy to the buyer's plan, so I wouldn't be able to speak to that.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Two more quick ones on Midstream. Have you done anything to change relationship on the Rosetta Eagle Ford assets? I know they had some dead acreage dedication, and a lot of processing contracts haven't been able to do anything to improve margins on some of the wet gas, NGLs, oil.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","No. I mean, we haven't made any significant changes to any of those contracts. Most of the dedication's in the Eagle Ford.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","There's no significant changes there.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","And last one on the Reeves County infrastructure plan. Are we just way too early to think about that? Does the acreage have dedication?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","It's certainly not way too early to think about it. We've been thinking about it for a while. I think given the activity levels that we're at right now, you won't see us move to probably a full blown development mode until maybe starting next year. But we're certainly in the planning stages to make sure that when we have the level of activity to support that, that it's well thought out like we do in the DJ.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Last one on \u2013 in Israel, the ability to flex more gas into the system should there be a hot summer, is it a material amount or is it confined by what's going on regulatory-wise? I wouldn't think so.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. Keith can address how we look at our volumes and how much more capability we have there.","J. Keith Elliott - Senior VP-Eastern Mediterranean Region","Yeah. So, Jon, we're \u2013 Tamar has the capacity for a little over 1.1 Bcf a day if you look at kind of where were running in the first quarter there. We've still got some room to go. Typically, in the summertime, you get into the real heat of the summer, it's \u2013 we'll probably be maxed out and then, of course, IEC keeps some LNG capacity for basically topping up like that, but we've got some room to go.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, Keith. Thanks for the good update.","Operator","And we'll go to our next question from Michael Rowe with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning. This is perhaps a follow-on to an earlier question, but was just wondering, given the work being done in Israel to address the Supreme Court's concerns about the framework's stability language, do you think you still need to spend the full $100 million there that you budgeted?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think we continue to look at it. I mean, our position's been, we're not going to spend significant money until we're comfortable we have the predictable regulatory environment that gives us the assurance for the project. And that's \u2013 I think we've been very consistent on that message. So what we have in there is still some money that ties to some pre-FEED work. How much of that we'll spend this year probably depends on how quickly they find their solution.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. That makes sense. And then just lastly, as it relates to the production guidance, I see that the U.S. onshore position is the primary contributor to the improved capital efficiency, but was just wondering on the international assets, does the update of full year guidance just reflect actual Q1 results? Or is there also, I guess, some upside baked in there now for an improved outlook for the rest of the year? Just thinking mainly about kind of any updated views you all have on Israel gas demand and West Africa downtime in particular. Thanks.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we honored the first quarter, obviously, and the read through on that is that we added some for Israel expectation with this mandate now for pushing more from coal to gas. Could there be some more? I hope so, but we'll wait to see. As Keith highlighted, on an average basis for the full year, we have ability to absorb some more upside if they continue to push more of their power generation to gas. But we've built in some of that.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go to our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on a couple of earlier questions. First, on the Delaware Basin wells that you highlighted on slide seven, both that had strong rates versus your type curve, if we look at the relative performance of each, the Calamity Jane outperformed on a lateral length adjusted basis, seemingly a lot more from gas and NGLs relative to oil. And I wondered if you could talk about the geology as it moves from east to west within your acreage block, and if we should expect a differentiation in well productivity and in production mix.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah, I think on the Calamity Jane, the gas percentage, what we see from our mapping, as you move probably further north and maybe a little east of the Calamity Jane location, we think it does get a little gassier, and we think we've tapped into some of that with this well. I think as you move back to the west where, by far, the majority of our acreage is, we would expect to see the higher oil cuts more in line with what we're seeing in Soapy Smith.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And so the decline profile is going to look similar on both wells or is there any other differentiation that you see?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Well, I think, we \u2013 Brian, we consider it all Tier 1 acreage. But even within Tier 1, there's obviously some acreages better than others, and I think generally speaking, we see the eastern half of the acreage, Tier 1 acreage, slightly higher quality. I think you're seeing that in the performance of the wells. Most of the activity that we have planned for the rest of the year is in either the central or eastern half of the acreage block, so we'll continue to test that theory as we go.","I think the interesting thing about the Soapy Smith is even though it's outperforming the type curve \u2013 not as much as the Calamity Jane is, but it's outperforming the type curve, it's significantly outperforming, I think, some of the historical wells in that area by as much as 20% or 30%. And so that's the well we did the slickwater test on. It's really the only well that we've done a slickwater test on in that area. I think that potentially could create some excitement going forward as we test more slickwater in the Delaware Basin and see how much uplift we can get from that versus the historical hybrids.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. And then going back to the asset sale, you've gotten a couple questions here on you thinking about using proceeds towards debt pay down or balance sheet improvement and recommitting capital to drilling. But wondered on the M&A front, how you're thinking about and what ability there may be to further add to your Permian and Eagle Ford positions, and whether the asset sale opens up the flexibility in your mind to do so?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it just gives us more firepower, if you will, Brian, for that type of thing. And there's no doubt we'll continue to look at opportunities in those areas, especially up around the Delaware and so forth, and obviously, a number of others are doing the same thing. So it would have to be the right opportunity, the right situation, and it's going be based off the asset and inventory quality that we'd be looking at. But we'll continue to look. This doesn't really change how much or what we're looking at, but it just gives you more in reserve to use. And that's one of the three legs of opportunity that this can be used for. We talked about the balance sheet, we talked about accelerating the activity when that makes sense, and the third piece of that is continuing to build opportunity for the future.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And I guess given the point that you made on \u2013 that it is a competitive environment, you're not the only one looking to expand in the Delaware, do you think it is realistic that something that could meet your needs from an accretive acreage perspective and financial objectives could come available here this year?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think we'll see some things we'd be interested in. We'll just have to see if we can find the opportunity to make the right deal at the right price. So I mean what this \u2013 we have a big inventory, I mean, as I've talked about before. Our Delaware Basin position plus our Eagle Ford position is pretty much the same thing as our Wells Ranch and East Pony position. So both of those give you a large inventory, but we'll continue to look at what new opportunities will be there and make sure we're in the market so we can understand what a good opportunity looks like.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Dave, I wonder if I could go back to the cost question in the DJ. The other thing that kind of jumps out to us is that obviously, you completed about a third of the wells than you did a year ago. So I'm wondering if that new \u2013 the cost level, your obviously pretty impressive reductions year-over-year, would be sustainable as you \u2013 if and when you had to ramp activity back up again. In other words, is it structural or something just related to high grading?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah, Doug. This is Gary. I mean, I don't think that's a huge driver. I think it's true, if you got less activity going on, you can have more people focus on it and perhaps be a bit more efficient. I think you also have a tradeoff, though. When you have less activity going on, you just have less scale and less ability to be more efficient that way. So I don't see it being a huge driver one way or the other.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Yeah, thanks for the answer. Dave, on the acreage, the sale, obviously, a pretty good number given you had nothing going on there. There was also a \u2013 there seems still to be a fairly large footprint outside of your two core areas. What are your thoughts on further paring down that position in the DJ given your current activity levels?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. I think I'd go back to my earlier statement. As long as we feel we can create more value out of it than somebody else, we'll continue to keep looking at the optionality of that acreage. I mean, I think when you look at even outside of Wells Ranch and East Pony, it's very valuable acreage, and I think this deal highlights that. So no rush to do anything different.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","How would you characterize the \u2013 any interest \u2013 any ongoing interest levels? Or was that the only thing that was on the table currently?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think this was the one that has the most interest. It was the one that made sense discussing. But I don't think there's anything else that's at that stage right now.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And last one from me, if I may, is the MLP sector has obviously had something of a rebound since the lows a couple months ago when you deferred the timing of IPO on the Midstream. So, I'm wondering if your appetite is changing any, given the \u2013 and I realize commodity's still pretty weak, but at least the sector has had a bit of a bounce. What are your thoughts on timing? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Kenneth M. Fisher - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, this is Ken, Doug. I think we've continued to monitor that very closely. The sector has bounced a bit since February, but I think you ought to see continued \u2013 a little improvement before that would be imminent.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the answers, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. And we'll take our final question from John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yeah, hi. Thanks. You've mentioned monobore drilling for the DJ. I was wondering if you're doing it or planning to do it in Texas at all.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Hey, John, it's Gary. Yeah, we haven't really progressed that in the Texas area yet. I think that will be one thing that we certainly look at as we increase the activity especially in the Delaware and start to move more of it to a development mode there.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. Last one. You had about 173 DUCs all in onshore U.S. at the end of the quarter. How quickly will you consume them throughout the year?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","I think we've talked in the past about we'll work off some of that DUC total through the year in the Marcellus where the completions are kind of loaded towards first half of the year. Certainly, in the DJ, with only running two rigs this year, we'll work that down a bit this year. I think when you look at the Texas assets, a certainly point forward. We've got roughly as many wells planned to be drilled as we do to have \u2013 bring online, so that will be fairly flat from this point forward. (57:32-57:40)","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session.

Following today's presentation, there will be opportunity to ask questions.","Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brad Whitmarsh. Please go ahead, sir.","Brad Whitmarsh - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm sure you noted in yesterday's earnings release, the year is off to a very strong start. As part of our disclosure enhancements, we released a new quarterly supplement, which provides additional detail and information that you will want to reference. This press release and supplement are available on our new website www.nblenergy.com. And we anticipate utilizing this same format each quarter going forward. Later today, we plan to file our 10-Q with the SEC.","In addition, this morning, we announced an agreement to divest our upstream Appalachia assets in West Virginia and Pennsylvania. This is another step in our portfolio transition that further focuses activity on our highest-return assets that accelerates value for shareholders. Given the recent signing of this transaction and the fact that it's still very early in the year, we elected not to provide updated full-year expectations on volumes, capital or cost, however, we will do so in the near future. What you will hear as we proceed through this morning's comments is that we are performing extremely well, with particular outperformance on total company and U.S. onshore oil and NGL volumes.","Following our prepared comments, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would ask that analysts limit themselves to one primary and one follow-up. Dave Stover, Chairman and CEO; and Gary Willingham, EVP of Operations will provide prepared comments. Joining us for the Q&A session is Ken Fisher, EVP and CFO, and other members of management.","I want to remind everyone that this event may contain projections and forward-looking statements as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures in our latest news releases and SEC filings for a discussion of these items.","Results from the first quarter reflect the company's continued excellent performance across the business. Total company volumes came in at 382,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, above the high end of our range, and 2% above the midpoint. Of particular note, total company oil volumes were 119,000 barrels a day, which is the high end of expectation, reflecting a strong U.S. onshore contribution and robust volumes in the Gulf of Mexico as well. Onshore oil volumes were actually above the high end of guidance, reflecting a great quarter in the DJ and the Delaware from enhanced completions and strong base performance. In fact, the DJ reflected a record oil mix of 52% of total basin volumes.","Natural gas volumes in Israel also exceeded the high end of guidance and were a record for our first quarter period. This is even with the 3.5% Tamar working interest cell down, which closed late year. Revenues for the quarter benefited from strong realizations and load differentials, particularly, in the U.S. across all commodities. This materially benefited our DJ and Eagle Ford production as well. Capital for the quarter came in well within our expectation as did our overall cost metrics, leading to both an earnings and a cash flow beat.","With that, I'll turn the call to Dave.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Brad. I appreciate everyone joining us to review our first quarter results. Noble Energy has truly had an exceptional start to the year. We strengthened our U.S. onshore position, with the closing of the Clayton Williams Energy transaction. We sanctioned Leviathan and increased sales from Tamar. Our operational execution hasn't missed a beat, as you can see from the DJ and Delaware well results. And we have accelerated shareholder value through the agreement to monetize our Appalachia position.","On slide 4, we revisit key 2017 goals we shared with you last quarter and our progress year-to-date. I will start with the significant progress refocusing the company's portfolio. Three years ago, we made the strategic decision to increase our onshore U.S. oil exposure and take advantage of our horizontal development expertise. This initially led to the Rosetta Resources merger in 2015. And now, with the addition of the Clayton Williams acreage, we hold the second-largest position in the core of the Southern Delaware with about 120,000 net acres. We closed the transaction within three months of the announcement and close coordination between both companies is resulting in a smooth integration. I'm delighted to welcome Clayton Williams' shareholders and employees to Noble Energy, where our financial capacity and combined technical capabilities will generate substantial future value for all our shareholders.","The next step in this transition is the divestment of our Appalachia assets, which was announced this morning. The Marcellus has been a tremendous asset in terms of productivity, a direct result of the success of our employees' efforts. However, the expanded inventory of high-return investment opportunities in our liquids-rich basins, which now totals over 7,500 drillable locations at around 4.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent potential, has resulted in minimal capital allocation to the Marcellus.","Today's announcement reflects the ability of our teams to accelerate the value of this asset for shareholders. These proceeds enable us to essentially cover the cash cost of the Clayton Williams transaction. We've already exceeded our proceeds target for the year, with a high likelihood of additional monetizations in 2017. Additional proceeds would be used to further strengthen our balance sheet and support our U.S. onshore growth.","With the recent portfolio enhancements, I'm completely confident that our U.S. onshore position has the best assets, our teams will deliver the best execution, and combined, this generates industry-leading production and cash flow growth for years to come. We're just scratching the surface on increasing our onshore resource potential from enhanced completions and stacked pay. Our growth from the U.S. onshore is also becoming more visible, as activity levels accelerate and we drive sequential increases in our liquids plays throughout the remainder of the year.","A key to delivering our growth agenda is our Advantage midstream position, with Noble Midstream Partners operations aligned with the company's U.S. onshore plan. The first central gathering facility will commence start-up in the Delaware Basin in the next few months, with the second by the end of the year. Noble Midstream also recently expanded their Delaware business with the acquisition of the Advantage Pipeline crude oil system, as part of a joint venture with Plains All American. We've now dedicated essentially all of our Delaware acreage to Noble Midstream for gas, oil, and produced water.","Our world-class Israel assets compliment our robust U.S. onshore outlook. We sanctioned the initial phase of the Leviathan project offshore Israel, the largest discovery in Noble's history, and the largest gas discovery in the Eastern Mediterranean region. This is an important and strategic project for Noble Energy and our partners, for the government of Israel, and for a region that is significantly short in natural gas. We were recently in Israel, meeting with customers, government officials and partners. These meetings reinforced our confidence in the energy transformation that is occurring within the country, driven by the exceptional reliability of Tamar and bolstered by the visibility and confidence in the Leviathan project. The value accretion for our shareholders will be significant as we deliver Leviathan major project milestones on the way to first gas production.","Since sanctioned, we have rapidly advanced the project. All major equipment and installation contracts have been awarded. The rig is in the field to drill two wells back-to-back, and we accelerated other project activity in continued support of a start-up by the end of 2019. Also offshore, we still anticipate a material exploration well in Suriname later this year, which will test over 500 million barrels of gross oil potential. This is a tremendous opportunity to test a potentially impactful prospect for approximately $10 million net to Noble.","I will now turn the call over to Gary to discuss the operational outperformance across the business.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Dave. I'll start with the U.S. onshore business, where our teams have once again delivered significant operational enhancements. We continue to improve capital efficiency, both in drilling and completions, all while continuing to set new standards for safe operations. We are reducing both total drill times and costs, reducing completion cycle times, and continuing to complete more productive wells. With just a few small changes, we already expect completion cycle time for long laterals to improve by 10% in the DJ Basin.","And on well productivity, beyond proppant concentration, we are honing in on optimal stage length and cluster spacing, assessing ways to improve the frac effectiveness and generate even greater capital efficiency per well. We're also devoting more resources to advanced analytics to generate faster analysis of completion design performance and allow for even quicker design modifications that will deliver the most effective completions possible.","Turning specifically to the Delaware Basin on slide 8. The three Noble Energy wells turned online in the first quarter of 2017 are shown in yellow, normalized to 7,500 feet. After 60 days of production, the wells are outperforming the average performance of 2016, and they are 35% above our 1.2 million barrel equivalent type curve.","This yellow line includes another well in our Calamity Jane area, as well as two wells in the new Pony Deal development area in the southeast portion of the legacy Noble acreage. The Pony Deal 12 5H was completed with about 3,000 pounds of proppant per lateral foot. And the Pony Deal 12 1H was completed with approximately 5,000 pounds of proppant per lateral foot.","The longer-term production performance of these two offset wells will be important as we continue to optimize designs to create the most value. Early performance of the 5,000 pound per foot well is very encouraging. After 30 days, it is performing 20% better; and after 60 days, it is performing 30% better than our 3,000 pound per foot well on a per lateral foot basis. As a reminder, our average proppant loading for the basin in 2017 is 3,000 pounds per foot, with some completions both lower and higher.","In addition to these new wells on the legacy acreage, I hope you've had a chance to review the wells we announced last week that Clayton Williams Energy completed in the first quarter. Two Lower Wolfcamp A wells in the southern portion of the acreage, the Collier and Geltemeyer, are continuing to outperform the acquisition type curve currently by 30% to 40% after 7 months of production, up from the 20% to 30% previously disclosed.","In addition, Clayton Williams brought online two Lower Wolfcamp A wells in the north of their acreage in the first quarter which are outperforming the acquisition type curve by 10% to 15% in the early days. Also, Clayton Williams completed their first Wolfcamp C well, with a slickwater design during the first quarter, the Longoria 11 #2H . The well's on the west side of the acreage and utilized 2,500 pounds of proppant per foot. In early days, with only around 30 days of production, the well is currently producing 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including over 1,100 barrels of oil per day.","There's a lot more to come in the Delaware in 2017. We just finished drilling and completing our first pad of 10,000 foot laterals, including our first 3rd Bone Spring well. The wells are timed to commence production with the startup of Noble Midstream's Billy Miner central facility around midyear.","With 10 to 15 wells coming online in the second quarter and 20 wells per quarter by the end of the year, we'll be gathering more data on the effectiveness of different completion designs. And the result of these wells will provide much greater visibility for our long-term growth. We'll also have our first Noble-designed wells completed on the acquired acreage in the third quarter.","Moving on to the DJ Basin. Our enhanced completions in Wells Ranch continue to outperform the type curve by over 50% over extended periods. On slide 10, we show six wells utilizing our standard 1,800 pound per foot slickwater completion commencing production in the first quarter. These wells are indicating significantly lower development costs per Boe.","We've also expanded our enhanced completions results outside of Wells Ranch to include East Pony. Specifically, four wells testing a concentration of 2,800 pounds of proppant per foot which came online late in the fourth quarter are far outperforming the type curve after 120 days. Given the outperformance over those time periods in both Wells Ranch and East Pony, we're now anticipating even greater capital efficiency improvements and value creation for our DJ Basin assets in 2017 than originally planned. We're continuing to monitor decline profiles and expect to have a better sense of the increase in estimated ultimate recoveries in the coming months.","In the Eagle Ford, production growth from South Gates Ranch completions is underway. These are impressive wells which produce over 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent for a 7,000 foot lateral in just 120 days. Already robust rates of return have been enhanced even further by recent improvements in NGL realizations. Production from the Eagle Ford is currently trending around 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and will continue to ramp up with close to 30 of these highly prolific wells online by the end of the year.","Finally, in Israel, we recently completed the Tamar 8 well, which will continue to support our best-in-class field reliability. Our teams executed a high-quality completion, and the well has already flowed around 270 million cubic feet per day with minimal pressure drawdown. Based on extensive production history on our existing five wells, as well as our analysis of the Tamar 8, we see the potential for positive revisions in both our gas in place and recoverable resource estimates later this year.","Robust demand growth continues to drive favorable production trends at Tamar. Gross sales volumes were up 12% versus the first quarter of 2016 and 54% versus the first quarter of 2014. Some days domestic demand from Tamar even exceeds our nameplate capacity. And it's still early days for the country in terms of shifting from coal to gas, with the government calling for natural gas-powered generation market share to grow from 60% currently to as much as 80%. This goal has been supported by announced coal plant retirements and the recent government of Israel approval of an expedited permitting process for new-build independent power producers.","Work on exports from Israel continues as well. We delivered gas from Israel to Jordan for the first time during the quarter, setting an important precedent as we continue to market Leviathan gas to export markets.","I'm extremely proud of the accomplishments that all of our teams have delivered these last few months. Clearly, this was an exceptional quarter that once again demonstrated our track record of operational excellence and delivery. We look forward to continuing that trend throughout the year.","And with that, I'll hand the call back to Dave.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Gary. We are delivering sustained differential improvement in well results and have already accomplished several key objectives that strengthen our company for the long term.","I will conclude by saying everything is right on track or better versus our 2017 plan. In fact, the second quarter guidance highlights a 30,000 barrel per day increase in our liquids volumes from the first quarter. Half of this increase is attributed to oil, which has 13% quarter-on-quarter growth.","We are aggressively pursuing the upside in our onshore programs and progressing Leviathan to a late 2019 start, all with a laser focus on execution and performance. We are well-positioned to deliver our long-term plan, creating value for shareholders.","Alan, at this time, we'd like to go ahead and open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. And we will take our first question from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. My first question, Gary, I just wondered if you could just maybe go through kind of the cost benefit of the enhanced completions in both the Delaware and the DJ. Starting with the Delaware, you're seeing, it looks like 30% improvement after 60 days for the 5,000 pound jobs. Could you just talk about how much incremental cost relative to the 3,000 pound jobs, and where you're at in terms of determining, whether 5,000 pounds is the way to go on a go-forward basis?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Arun, thanks. I'll actually start probably on the 2,000 to 3,000 pound change, given that's where most of the focus has been today. We've only had the two 5,000 pound job so far. When you look at the 3,000 pound wells that we've announced, we're seeing, 35% improvement in the productivity over the first three to six months on those kind of wells. Our actual cost increase associated with that 35% improvement, going from 2,000 pounds to 3,000 pounds, has only been about 10% in the Delaware. And part of that's because, we're still early in the program there and continuing to see pretty significant efficiency improvements that are offsetting some of that underlying cost increase associated with more proppant. So, very efficient increase in capital use there. Again, 35% improvement in productivity for about 10% more cost going from 2,000 pounds to 3,000 pounds.","When you look at DJ Basin, for example, where we're seeing up to 50% productivity improvement, given where we're at in the life cycle of that program, and given how efficient we already are in drilling wells, we're not able to offset quite as much of that increase cost related to proppant to increases there. So, going from a 1,400 pound well to an 1,800 pound in the DJ, we're seeing on average probably 15% to 20% cost increase, but, again, we're seeing 50% productivity improvement there.","So, I think that'll give you a sense of where we're headed as we test some of the even higher proppant concentrations, more than just those first two 5,000 pound wells in the Delaware. We can get a sense for where that'll settle in. We've said most of the program this year is going to be around 3,000 pounds in the Delaware. We do have plans to test a few more higher proppant jobs where most of it will be about 3,000 pounds on average.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. And just my follow-up, it sounds like you guys are pretty upbeat about how the year's progressing. My question initially in terms of the overall guidance, is the guidance basically based on your type curves? And given the outperformance, when can you be in a position perhaps to raise your guidance, just given how the wells in the DJ and Delaware are outpacing your type curves?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I think we'll be looking at that. We'll be looking at guidance for the rest of the year here in the coming months. Clearly, with the announcement this morning to divest the Marcellus, we need to update full-year guidance in the future here anyways. So, I think nearer term, we've skewed the second quarter volumes up, and I think that's a realization of how well these enhanced completion jobs continue to perform. So, when you look back at the original budget, I'd say, our forecasts were based more online with our \u2013 it increased designs that we were looking at, at that time, the 1,800 pounds in the DJ and the 2,000 pounds to 3,000 pounds in the Delaware. But clearly, we're seeing some outperformance for that, and we've accounted for that in slightly higher guidance for 2Q.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys, and good results.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Good Morning, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. It looks like 2Q is the peak in the quarterly CapEx for the year. I mean, can you quantify how much of the Leviathan spending drives the increase, to better understand how your CapEx drops in the second half, while U.S. onshore activity rises, or just maybe color on your U.S. CapEx trend throughout 2017?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I think, when you look at \u2013 you're right, second quarter could be the high-water mark on capital, at least, as we see it now. I mean, a couple of things driving that. You've got probably more of your completions, especially in Eagle Ford in the second quarter. The Leviathan drilling that's going on now, we essentially added the second well over there and made the decision to drill the two wells back-to-back. So, majority of that will occur here in the second quarter. And so, when you look at it from Eastern Med, oh, that's probably up $50 million to $100 million in the second quarter over first quarter capital.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's good. And maybe as a follow-up if I could, shifting to the Marcellus, can you disclose, your tax basis there? Think you should be covered \u2013 or what you estimate cash flow or EBITDA multiple in the sale? How many acres you considered core within that position just to kind of get an acreage metric, and I guess, how you might think about the value or the savings from shedding the FT agreements? Trying to understand better this sale.","Kenneth M. Fisher - Noble Energy, Inc.","Evan, this is Fisher. I don't anticipate any tax on the transaction, so I think the proceeds will be available cash. Your second question...","Brad Whitmarsh - Noble Energy, Inc.","EBITDA multiple.","Kenneth M. Fisher - Noble Energy, Inc.","On EBITDA multiple, last year's operating cash flow was about $80 million, so I think quite a strong multiple, looking at it on a last-year's basis. I would say, the very high-value acreage in the core, probably 90,000 acres of the total. And then some, other inventory there. And I think we'll transfer some of the FT to the buyer, and then retain some of that. And I think we'll be able to probably on-sell some of that as well. So, we'll take that all into account as we account for the transaction in second quarter.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And if I could, you mentioned that several other opportunities for additional proceeds in 2017 in your opening comments. I mean, beyond a potential Tamar farm-down, any color or dimension in there or no? I'll leave it at that.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","I think NBLX drop is something that'll still be a real possibility to drive some proceeds this year. And then, we'll just continue to look at our asset base from the standpoint of \u2013 our focus is on the high-return, high-margin growth drivers. And outside of that, if we can monetize something for good value, then we'll take a hard look at it, if it's worth more to somebody else.","So, that whole portfolio portion and review of the portfolio is something that we just continually do. But as you've seen the transition and what we've put in place over the last couple of years now, with the addition of the core position in Eagle Ford and the Permian, it has our ability to focus on those high-return, high-margin growth drivers, and that's where the focus is going to stay.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good job. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Brad Whitmarsh - Noble Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Just a follow-up on the last question there, with all of the moves that you've made, adding \u2013 Can you hear me, okay? Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me okay?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Now, we can. Yeah, you're better.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Fantastic. You made a number of moves over the last year, adding Clayton Williams, divesting the Marcellus. And a little bit of a follow-up to that last question. Beyond the Tamar sale, is the balance sheet kind of where you want it to be? And what is the constraint that you see to U.S. onshore investing? Is it cash flow? Is it managing the balance sheet if oil prices kind of hang out here? How would that impact your strategy?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think, first point, oil price is kind of about where we expected it to be or planned for it to be for this year, so we haven't changed plans. It's too early in the year to change plans. I'd say, from a balance sheet \u2013 the nice part about even the Marcellus sale, it covers the cash cost on the Clayton Williams, so that very quickly returns our balance sheet to where it was.","And then we'll just look at what else comes up here. I think there'll be some more opportunities as we've highlighted to generate some more proceeds this year, accelerate some value, and then look at the mix of further balance sheet strengthening compared with opportunities to accelerate onshore activity as we go. And I would guess with sizable proceeds, we'll be able to do both.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's great. And my follow-up goes to the Permian. You talked about the performance from the recent Clayton Williams wells that were announced last week. Could you talk broadly about the Clayton Williams assets, whether we should expect well performance to be as strong as the legacy Noble and the Rosetta wells, and what you plan to do differently on the Clayton Williams acreage if the characteristics of the two wells from last week are representative of what you're planning on doing going forward?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Let me turn that over to Gary, but I'll say it first is the results of the Wolfcamp C well get us off to a great start.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Brian. I mean, I think it's important to remember that we just closed the deal, so I mentioned that our first Noble-designed completions won't be on until later this year. But even with the recent results that Clayton Williams has been posting out there, all the wells are pretty much above the acquisition-type curve that we use, so that's certainly encouraging.","You'll probably remember, back when we announced the deal, that we ascribed virtually all the value to the Wolfcamp A, Upper and Lower. The Wolfcamp A Lower has been more of a focus for them recently, and they've had good, strong well results across both their southern and northern portions of their acreage. So, that helps to prove up some of the \u2013 or give us even greater confidence, I guess, in some of the Lower Wolfcamp A, on our own existing acreage.","But beyond that, since most of the value was on the Wolfcamp A Upper and Lower, that provides a lot of upside in the other zones. And we talked about the recent Wolfcamp C well that they brought online that's producing 1,400 barrels equivalent per day with about 75% of that or so being oil \u2013 about 1,100 barrels a day of oil, so that's certainly encouraging.","I think it's early days. Again, we just got it closed, but certainly looking forward to bridging some of the same technology and experience to that acreage that we brought to Rosetta. And I would expect to see improvements going forward, probably pretty similar to what we've seen with Rosetta acreage.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Can you guys hear me?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","We can, Scott.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. Great. Great. And let's stick on the Permian Basin though since you guys were just discussing that and a little bit more on the Wolfcamp C. The well performance looked pretty good initially based on what you all had provided. Do you have a little bit more color on some of the performance metrics on that? And is this something that could be \u2013 do you sense is somewhat available on some of your other acreage and could be more in the plans if you look at the rest of the 2017 and maybe early 2018?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I mean, it's certainly possible. It's probably more like an 2018 number for our existing acreage. We've been watching Wolfcamp B and Wolfcamp C results from other operators around us and certainly see potential on our legacy acreage as well. We don't have anything in the plans for 2017 to test the Wolfcamp C. We've got a number of Wolfcamp B wells that'll come on later this year in addition to the one that we brought on a quarter or two ago. So, it's definitely in the future for us, watching other's activity and looking forward to testing it on our own acreage.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, yeah. More specifically, I guess, then, what would you be looking for in terms of comparing that to whether it can compete with kind of the core Wolfcamp A performance? I mean, what do those wells cost on a relative basis, and what do you need to see from productivity?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, the wells aren't that much more expensive. I think it's going to come down to the productivity, the longer-term production results. Again, this is the first Wolfcamp C on acreage that we own today, and it's only been on for about 30 days. So, clearly, we need to see a bit more data than that before we go out and start standing up rigs dedicated to the Wolfcamp C. But looking forward to watching the performance of this well and judging how much activity we may devote to it in the future. I think it is a zone that produces a bit more water than the Wolfcamp A, so we'll need to keep an eye on that, but 1,400 barrels a day on the first well is pretty impressive.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then as a follow-up on operating cost, can you give us a sense of what the impact is of the Marcellus when you go-forward LOE? And maybe a little bit of color, too, into 1Q LOE came in a little bit hot. Just a little bit of color on that.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I think the first quarter was impacted by a number of things, including some of the lifting time in Africa. We'll be, again, releasing some updated guidance here in the next few months once we get the Marcellus closed. But probably check in with Brad prior to then on impact of LOE for the Marcellus.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Generally, do you have a sense of how much below sort of your average run rate it was, roughly?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","It's a little lower than the average run rate. I'd say, Scott, I'd also point out to you the gathering, transportation and processing which was a good bit under. So, the combination of LOE and GTP there, we were right in line.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. Fair enough. I appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Irene Haas with Wunderlich.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Yeah, so I have a question for you on Marcellus. By the way, congratulations for exiting the trend and a really nice transaction. My question is really on CONE. Could this be a future divestiture candidate now that you're no longer really doing upstream work in Appalachia?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. We'll have to look at that pretty hard, Irene, as you would anticipate. I think the nice part is this probably actually helps the value of CONE when you think about somebody coming in that probably has plans to be maybe a little more aggressive on development than it fit in our portfolio. So we'll just have to see how that plays out.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Phillip Jungwirth with BMO.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning. And really like all the new disclosure in the slide deck. You commented that the results from Tamar 8 and production history suggests upside to the resource potential at Tamar. And I was just hoping you could expand upon, the gas in place seems higher than expected, and maybe put a range on what this could mean for increased resource potential at Tamar.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I'll let Keith talk about that. It was pretty impressive test of productivity from that well.","J. Keith Elliott - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Phillip, as with any reservoir of the size and scale of Tamar, as you add more wells to the field, you're continually learning new things. And, of course, the combination of that with then having three years of production on the field now, and a little over a Tcf produced, we're just capturing more information on fault block performance, kind of individual zone performance and we now have a chance to step back and integrate that data, take a look at both \u2013 particularly in addition with some special core analysis work that we're doing on some cores that we captured from the Tamar 8 well. And we'll be integrating that over the next few months and we're optimistic about what we'll be able to do with it.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","I kind of think of it, it falls back into that category that we've seen over our careers that the best and biggest reservoirs tend to get bigger and better over time.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's great. And then with current gas sales agreements for Leviathan at, I believe, 525 million a day, you're pretty close to the low end of your first gas sales target. Was hoping you could walk us up to the 1 Bcf a day high end and which LOI's or future agreements would be most critical to achieving that high end.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think there's a number of things in the works that give us a high level of confidence that by the time Leviathan comes online, we'll have filled up that Bcf a day or possibly even over a Bcf a day capacity. You have additional in-country demand that we're seeing. Gary mentioned the coal conversions and the potential switching from coal. I mean, that in and of itself just with existing facilities is probably 400 million a day or so, so that's a sizable market, let alone new opportunities there.","In some of the export areas, I think there's potential in Jordan to see additional needs there. And then, we're still working hard on tying up some contracts into Egypt that can be expanded or used through existing pipeline infrastructure. So, probably on at least three fronts we see some pretty clear line of sight to how we're going to fill up that Bcf a day.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Maybe if I could ask a first one on the DJ Basin. You had great results out of the enhanced completions there in the basin. Can you maybe provide a little clarity on how much drilling inventory you have there in East Pony and how many of these are on private versus federal land, and then when we might see the extension of some of these upside completions tested in the Mustang area?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Ryan, I mean, we've got a good amount of inventory left in East Pony still. It is a mix of both private fee and federal lands, as you mentioned. And a good portion of our activity for the rest of the year is on BLM. We're certainly very encouraged by the first wells that we tested up there with the enhanced completions that we disclosed this morning. That type of performance and seeing kind of replicate the performance of those enhanced completions that we were seeing down in Wells Ranch and East Pony has been pretty impressive. You can see on the slide that we showed, after 120 days, those wells, on average, are producing about twice what our type curve suggested for that area, so very excited about that.","I think for the remainder of the year, a lot of the activity again will be on federal land. And due to some of the permitting constraints there and the lead time on those, the average proppant concentration on those jobs will be more in that 1,400 pound range versus the enhanced jobs that we just released. So, it will be interesting to see how those wells perform, too. But inventory going forward, still quite a bit there. I think as far as Mustang, you'll start to see some more results from Mustang towards the end of the year when Noble Midstream brings on the first centralized facility in that area for us.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And then maybe, as you continue to transition the portfolio with the Marcellus divestiture, I don't know, you have a well coming up in Suriname, but can you talk a little bit about maybe what the role of traditional exploration \u2013 how you kind of envision that playing in the company going forward, and as your assets continue to refocus on the U.S. onshore, how the deepwater Gulf of Mexico kind of competes for capital within that?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Brian, on the exploration piece, I think having those capabilities will continue to be a long-term benefit for us. We've obviously reduced some of the capital spend on that, and really partly to make sure that we're pushing the best of the best opportunities to the top. We put Suriname in that category, things that can be highly impactful, the things we're looking at that we \u2013 acreage we picked up offshore Newfoundland, the acreage we have over in Gabon, all those are in that same category.","The way I think about it is our objective there is to find and then pour it into the portfolio, a new core area that can really be developed probably on the heels of Leviathan wall of cash coming on. So, I think it would be a nice mix to that portfolio. We can come up with a very material new core area that we can start developing around the turn of the decade here.","I think on the Gulf of Mexico, we're in that phase now, where we've had the benefit of bringing on some very economic high-impact major projects over the last couple of years, and we're benefiting from those being on, and the cash flow that those provide right now. I think when you look at the whole program and the capabilities of the organization, the capabilities of that exploration mentality, we see it play out in our onshore development and the rapid transfer of learnings. We see the capabilities of the major project execution that kind of goes hand in hand with that playing out, as we look at integrated development plans in the onshore, and how we put a fully integrated plan together from subsurface to surface to marketing. So, I think, we're benefiting from those across the organization and will continue to do so.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Congrats on a good quarter and the Marcellus sale.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thank you, David.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just service cost, outside of pressure pumping, sand, the stuff that's been in the headlines, can you talk about what you are seeing elsewhere in the service cost chain as far as inflation?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, David, I mean, this is Gary. Those two are certainly the biggest ones that we've seen, pressure pumping and sand. We've seen some increased prices on steel. Starting to see a little bit of increase on rig rates in some of the onshore areas, although nothing really significant at this point. I think the biggest impact for us really, for this year, is the portion of our capital that's gone to the Eastern Mediterranean, $650 million or so being spent in the Eastern Mediterranean this year, primarily on Leviathan. And that's all pretty well locked in at very close to historic low rates for those types of projects. So, it's certainly an advantage that we've got.","I think when you look at the other areas, again, pressure pumping and sand are two of the big ones. Permian is hot, everybody knows that. That's where we're seeing some of the highest increases. But I think it's important to remember that as a portion of our overall capital program for the year, our completion capital in the Permian is only about 12% of our total capital budgets. So, while we may be seeing a hot market there, it doesn't influence the overall total that much.","When we came out with budget time, I think we signaled 10% to 15% inflation is what we expected to see in the onshore. I think we're seeing that. In some cases, maybe a little bit more than that, but, again, it's highly localized and doesn't really drive the overall number as much.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, Gary, just following up on that. We're hearing that some operators are doing different types of artificial lift, doing the one-offs that we can't see right behind the scenes, the offset well costs. Is there anything there you can talk about? And then just as a one more follow-up, in Eastern Med, when you locked in those rates, as a percentage, what was that compared to when you looked at the project say, two, three years ago?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I think when you look at like-for-like versus the mark off, it's down in the 20% range or so, like-for-like basis versus Tamar, Leviathan. And I'm not sure where you were headed with artificial lift on capital costs. But I think in the onshore area, we're certainly always looking for the most effective artificial lift method, and it ranges across the areas. Delaware Basin, we may have three or four different things that we're testing at any one time to ensure the optimal lift of those wells. But haven't seen a huge impact there from a cost standpoint. or upfront capital cost standpoint anyway.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate the color. Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just wanted to say good morning, Dave, and congrats on all of the news the last couple of days.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I've got two quick ones, hopefully. Can you walk us through how we should think about the development plans, DJ versus Delaware. And what I'm really thinking about is obviously the oil mix is getting better in the DJ, as a result, you're focused on the lower GOR part of your plays. Is that deliberate? Will it continue?","And a related question on the Delaware. What are the limitations on moving to an integrated development plan there? And I've got a follow-up please.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","I'd say, the increase in the oil mix in the DJ is definitely deliberate. I mean, we've been talking for a couple of years now about how we've focused activity on the oilier parts of the basin, primarily, Wells Ranch and East Pony to-date. You can certainly see the impacts of that, as we've shown on slide 9 there: 46% oil, second quarter of last year to 52% this last quarter. And when you think about how much volume we produce out of the basin, a 6% increase like that is pretty significant. I think, most of our capital will continue to be focused in the oilier part of the basin, so you'll probably see some continued trend upward from that.","I think as far as the IDP style of development, we're adapting that to the Delaware, taking all the learnings that we've had from the DJ Basin. Noble Midstream is constructing facilities for us in both places, using a lot of the same technology, same techniques, again, adopting the learnings from the DJ, and don't really see any constraints from that going forward.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess just for clarification, Gary, the move to Mustang, will that change that positive oil trend or no?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Depending on where you are in Mustang. I think the Eastern edge of Mustang is probably pretty similar to some of what we're doing in Wells Ranch. You go further West, and it starts to get a little bit gassier. But I think given the activity, we're still going to have folks in the Wells Ranch area over that time period. I wouldn't expect for that to drive the overall mix gassier again.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks for that. My follow-up is on the Gulf of Mexico. Obviously, to your point, Dave, about the tailwind you've got after spending a bunch of capital there. The decline there seems to have been a little better than we were expecting. I'm just wondering how you see the outlook for the Gulf over the next couple of years in terms of things you can do to offset the rollover in that production, tiebacks and things of that nature? Can you just walk us through your thoughts there? And I'll leave it at that. Thank you.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think yeah, it's held up extremely well. I think, we'll start to see some decline. We've seen some decline in the Dantzler, Big Bend area, as we would have expected. And we'll start to see some decline in Gunflint coming up.","I think the next opportunity out there is probably the Katmai development, which we've talked about probably coming online over the next couple of years. So, that's probably the most visible piece, and then beyond that, it really probably depends on what we see from exploration opportunities or other \u2013 whether it's Miocene tiebacks or deeper Cretaceous plays. And so, those will just have to be fit into the portfolio.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Does Katmai work at sub-$50, Dave?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Sub-$50, I think probably. I'd have to go back and look, but what I've seen of it, I think you can make it work at that. We've seen that work for some of the other Miocene tiebacks. I don't think this should be much different.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Tim Rezvan with Mizuho.","Timothy A. Rezvan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my question. I, guess my first one is for Ken. Ken, there's been a lot of moving parts on the balance sheet subsequent to quarter end with the Clayton Williams deal, and now this announcement. Can you walk us through some of the parts on the cash and get movements to help us understand kind of pro forma leverage.","Kenneth M. Fisher - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, sure, I think, we ended the quarter at $4.8 billion liquidity, and about $6.9 billion of debt, $6.7 million of that debt is bank and bond debt. We drew on the revolver for the cash component of the Clayton Williams transaction, which was the cash consideration. And then to take out their debt, that'll essentially be gone, then with the proceeds from the Marcellus transaction.","And then as Dave mentioned, any further proceeds, we'll take a look at do we help strengthen the balance sheet and reduce some more debt, and\/or what's the appropriate investment alternative for that? So, I would expect us to continue to probably come down on the debt side with proceeds. And then, I think, as you see, as we move through the end of this year, you get the cash generation and margin enhancement, even at the $50 price deck.","So, our metrics continue to improve over the next couple of years, so I feel very comfortable that we've got the balance sheet in good shape, liquidity very more than adequate, very robust liquidity, and we can support the business growth. And, so I think, that's probably the summary.","Timothy A. Rezvan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. So the $6.2 billion of net debt at quarter end, is that kind of a good number to use pro forma?","Kenneth M. Fisher - Noble Energy, Inc.","For the end of...","Timothy A. Rezvan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","As your quarter-end number before the Clayton Williams closure?","Kenneth M. Fisher - Noble Energy, Inc.","Say, the question again. Are you talking about where we'll end up at the end of 2Q, or are you talking about the end of 1Q?","Timothy A. Rezvan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","No, well, I'm really just asking about today. Because you were $6.2 billion of net debt, and then we had these moving pieces...","Kenneth M. Fisher - Noble Energy, Inc.","Right...","Timothy A. Rezvan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","So, it is safe to say that it potentially netted out.","Kenneth M. Fisher - Noble Energy, Inc.","We went up about $1.3 billion for Clayton, and you'll have about $1.1 billion from the Marcellus transaction. So, net that, I'd expect it to be about where we finished the end of first quarter.","Timothy A. Rezvan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And I guess my follow-up for Gary and his comments on the DJ various discussions that you monitor, and the decline profiles from the high proppant loadings you've recently used in the DJ. So, I guess, are you seeing any differences across either the DJ or the Delaware from a decline perspective, as you've used these high proppant loadings?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I think we're seeing longer periods of kind of a plateau production before it goes on decline. And then once it goes on decline, at least from what we've seen so far, the decline rates tend to be a bit shallower. So, that's one reason we would still like to see more data before we come out and increase our EUR estimates.","Some of these wells, given the size of the fracs that we're putting on them, and how we're ramping them up. They may not go on decline for six months, yeah, startups. So, traditionally, we've talk about kind of needing six months of data, maybe 12 months of data to get a good view on EUR estimates. If they're not even starting decline for six months, obviously, we need a bit more data on them. So, we're watching them closely, but certainly encouraged with what we're seeing so far.","Timothy A. Rezvan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, David, to the rest of your team there.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Hey, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Hello. So, I'd like to ask a question about your first exports in the Eastern Med. It may not have been a large magnitude. It seems to me that, that's a significant threshold that you cross by \u2013 and it goes back to the pit that you guys made a few years ago towards those regional export markets. I wondered if you can talk about what maybe happened behind the scenes to get to the point where you could flow that gas to Jordan, and what lessons that may hold for us or for you about what you guys going to do with exporting Leviathan volumes.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Let me let Keith talk about that, and take credit for that, because him and his team have done a fantastic job on marketing over there.","J. Keith Elliott - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Charles, I suppose the behind the scenes pieces really were just managing the \u2013 beyond managing the contractual arrangements just managing getting the cross-border interconnects in place through the INGL system. I mean, the benefit to this particular project is it's very close to the Israel\/Jordan border, and so the infrastructure buildout was relatively straightforward and simple and mainly focused around just cross-border activity agreements for the construction of that infrastructure.","I think the lessons in that have been invaluable to us going forward to, particularly, the next phase with the NEPCO contractor because we've learned what's required to permit construction on both sides of the border and what's required to actually do gas measurement and allocation across the border. So, those are a few of the key things that we've learned that are directly applicable into the NEPCO contract and have been incorporated into it.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thank you, Keith. And then, Gary, if I could maybe ask one more question about those DJ completions. I know you fielded a few on that already this morning. But as we look across the industry really, we see a lot of incremental improvements in completions with increased sand loading. But really, as we look at those graphs you guys have up there and particularly when you look at the one for East Pony on page 10, that really looks more like a step change rather than kind of an evolution or iteration.","So, I'm wondering if you can talk a bit about, does this cause you to go back to your reservoir model or has this really caused you to go back and dig deeper and reevaluate old assumptions to get such a dramatic change in a short period of time like this?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, Charles, I mean, we're always incorporating data from new designs that we test and taking that data and going back and kind of challenging our previous interpretation of things. It's all part of the evolution of making sure that we've got the most effective designs that we can have. I think it's no doubt that \u2013 and should be pretty clear to everybody that we're leading the industry, and really the DJ and the Delaware both, testing these higher-intensity completions. And certainly, the results have been pretty phenomenal.","It's not just a matter of how many pounds per foot. I mean, we're doing a number of things around stage spacing and cluster spacing to increase the effectiveness of the frac beyond just putting more sand in there, as well as our flowback procedures. And all of that is combining to, as you point out, some pretty impressive results in East Pony especially. And so, we're certainly taking that into account. We're going back and revisiting our models and make sure that we incorporate all the data and continue to learn. We've talked a lot about some of the advanced analytics that we're using to be able to take that data and learn from it even quicker than in the past and hoping to get to the point where we can essentially modify designs as warranted on an almost real-time basis. So, that's all part of the plan. It's where we've been headed for a number of years, and again, I think it's pretty clear we're leading on this, and certainly, have the results to show it.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thanks for the color, Gary.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","And we will take our next question from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question. When we looked at your Delaware Basin API gravity in our recent Permian report, you all seemed okay in terms of marketing. Are you hearing anything on the marketing side around Delaware producers seeing either increased enforcement of API gravity or higher discounts, or any thoughts about where those thresholds are for WTI standard?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","No, David, I can't really comment on that. We haven't had any issues ourselves at all. I mean, so the area that we're in is very high-quality crude. We've certainly got plenty of take-away capacity, so no issues from us. And the NBLX Advantage Pipeline acquisition also came with some storage and blending capability.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Oh, cool.","Kenneth M. Fisher - Noble Energy, Inc.","So, I think we're extremely well-positioned.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","And so, in that line then, I guess, your appetite for firm transportation out of the Delaware, like oil and gas, you're pretty well-handled. Any thoughts on how that would go going forward?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think, when we look at it, especially with our relationship with Noble Midstream Partners, and as Ken pointed out, their recent acquisition along with Plains of the Advantage Pipeline, I think we feel pretty good about our ability to get both crude out of the basin as well as gas out of Waha.","So, I think when you look at the capacity today for both oil and gas export versus the current production levels, when you look at the number of projects that have been announced on both the oil and gas side, going forward, I think it's up to 5 Bcf a day of new projects that have been announced on the gas side and over 1 million barrels a day of new projects on the oil side. So, we feel pretty good about where we're at.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yeah, you're in a good spot. And just kudos to the IR team. I think slide 5 will provide a pretty good summary of quarterly progression on the onshore operating and production estimate. So, that will be really helpful.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Dave.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Mike Scialla with Stifel.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Just had a follow-up question, and I think Charles asked you a little bit on the East Pony area. But it looks to us like it's kind of the only place outside of the Greater Wattenberg where the Niobrara works economically, at least with any scale. I guess, one, is that a fair statement? And if it is, do you have any explanation for that? Is it geology or it is just the completion techniques that you're using or any other thoughts around that?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","I'm sorry, let me make sure I understood your question. Was your question is that East Pony is the only place in the DJ where the Niobrara works economically? Is that what you said?","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Outside of the Greater Wattenberg. I mean, it looks like there's obviously \u2013 the gassier portion of the play works fine in the Greater Wattenberg area but in the oilier part of the play outside of the Greater Wattenberg area, it seems like East Pony is a one-off. I'm just wondering if that is true. And if so, can you explain that?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","I don't know if it's a one-off or not. I mean, most of the recent activity outside of what you would consider kind of the traditional Greater Wattenberg area has been focused in that area, whether it's by us or a couple of other companies that are near East Pony. And certainly again from the results we're showing, it's a highly economic part of the basin for us.","In the past, we've tested some other acreage outside of the traditional Wattenberg area and outside of East Pony, and frankly, had some mixed results. I'd remind everybody, that was a few years ago with old frac technology or old frac designs, and so I don't know that it necessarily condemns those areas. But certainly, our focus right now, again, is on Wells Ranch, East Pony, and soon to be Mustang, is where we see most of the best value-creation opportunities near term.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So, just as a follow-up, so with the new completion design, does that make you rethink potentially some of those other areas?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, I think that's fair. We've still got a decent amount of acreage outside of the five IDPs that we've talked about in the past. You can see it on the map that we published. So, it's certainly causing us to rethink those things. We're looking at the results that we had on those wells several years ago, with types of completions that we were putting on them, looking at how much improvement we've been able to show in some of the other areas with the new completion designs, and certainly, looking at that as to whether that's a place to test some new designs going forward.","And we may do some of that. I don't think it's going to be a significant part of the capital program in the next year or two, but it's certainly an opportunity to test some things and see how much wider we can create kind of the opportunity wedge here with some of this new technology we're using.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Gary.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Gail Nicholson with KLR Group.","Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC","Good morning. In regards to Wells Ranch, in 4Q, you talked about the wells at Wells Ranch were exhibiting higher oil compositions than the type curve. In the 1Q well that you brought online, did you experience a similar compositional outperformance?","Brad Whitmarsh - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I think that's true, Gail, and particularly, as you look at our 1Q total oil mix to continue to grow, I think, it's up from 46% about a year ago to 52% now. That is from focused activity and low GOR areas at both Wells Ranch and East Pony. So, certainly, running a little bit higher on the oil side than our type curve on the oil mix in Wells Ranch.","Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC","Okay. Great. And then could you talk about the unitization agreement at Alba, and what that does for you on a go-forward basis?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Gail I mean this is an agreement that has been being negotiated for a couple of years now. We've got it finalized finally. It did result in a reduction in our interest in Alba by a couple of percent. And so, when you think about our sales volume forecast for Alba going forward, you need to take that into account in the forecast. But it's really a situation where the field extended onto an adjoining block, and it's been part of an ongoing negotiation for quite some time.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. And that, actually, as we look at it going forward that reduction in interest there is really more than offset by the performance of the onshore program so...","Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And it appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Whitmarsh, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks, sir.","Brad Whitmarsh - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thank you. I know we've run over a couple of minutes. Appreciate all of the questions today. Our team is available all afternoon and going forward for additional engagement and conversations, and we look forward to talking with you.

Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions I will turn the conference over to Mr. Brad Whitmarsh. Please go ahead, sir.","Brad Whitmarsh - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. We issued two news releases this is morning, one covering the fourth quarter and our full-year earnings and the second one laying details on our 2016 plan. We also posted to our website a number of supplemental slides for this call which you will find helpful as we talk through our prepared comments. And later this morning, our 10K will be filed with the SEC.","Following prepared comments from Dave Stover, Chairman, President and CEO; and Gary Willingham, Executive Vice President of Operations, we will open the call for question-and-answer session. In order to meet our one hour timeframe, we would ask that participants limit themselves to one primary and one follow-up question. Additional management team available for Q&A are Ken Fisher, Executive Vice President and CFO; Susan Cunningham, Executive Vice President of Exploration and New Ventures; and Keith Elliott, SVP of our Eastern Mediterranean Assets.","I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains projections and forward-looking statements, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those items. With that, I'll turn the call to Dave.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. For more than a decade now, Noble Energy has planned and structured itself to succeed in any market environment. I'm proud of what we've accomplished last year and I feel good about how we are positioned moving through this challenging time. I'd like to start today's call with a few highlights wrapping up 2015 before focusing on our plans for 2016.","Fourth-quarter results show our continued operating momentum and focus on prudently managing within cash flow. For the second straight quarter, discretionary cash flow exceeded capital expenditures. This reflects our asset quality, our portfolio diversity and the ability of our organization to execute. It's also a testament to the swift, decisive actions we took to reduce spending and drive capital efficiency beginning more than a year ago.","Sales volumes for the quarter averaged a record 422,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was above the high end of our increased guidance. This was driven by accelerated project start ups in the Gulf of Mexico, strong asset performance in Equatorial Guinea and Israel, and continued improvement in completion design and infrastructure capacity in the DJ Basin.","Looking at our full-year 2015 accomplishments, it was a year of outstanding operational and strategic execution under the backdrop of a difficult commodity environment. We began last year targeting increased production capacity from our DJ Basin asset, more recognition of the value in our Eastern Mediterranean project, and alignment with our Marcellus partner for future capital spend.","By year's end, we had accomplished each of these objectives while transforming our cost structure to match the current environment. This was all achieved while realizing record safety performance across the business. In addition, we took advantage of an opportunity to expand our leading U.S. unconventional portfolio with new, top-tier positions in the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin. Initial operating results have exceeded expectations and highlight Noble's technical proficiency with new completion designs and drilling efficiencies.","Our major project execution capabilities were again evident in 2015. We commenced production on both Big Bend and Dantzler in the Gulf of Mexico while keeping Gunflint and the Alba compression project on plan for 2016 start up. In Israel, an approved and implemented natural gas regulatory framework gives us substantial momentum for future projects and the regulatory clarity necessary for new development to meet the region's growing demand for natural gas.","We ended 2015 with total proved reserves of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent, which was up slightly versus year-end 2014. Excluding the impact of the Rosetta Resources merger and SEC commodity price changes, we replaced 1.5 times 2015 production at a replacement cost of around $16 per barrel of oil equivalent.","Total organic capital for 2015 was under $2.9 dollars, down approximately 40% from the previous year, while unit operating costs were driven to their lowest point in eight years. At the same time, our average full-year reported sales volumes were up nearly 20% over the year before. Part of the increase was the addition of the new Texas asset. But our legacy volumes grew more than 10% by themselves.","I would now like to take a few moments to describe how we're moving forward in the current environment. Noble Energy is an 84-year-old company. We've been through many cycles before. We believe our high-quality, low-cost and diversified portfolio combined with capital discipline and tremendous investments flexibility, provides the best formula for long term sustainable value creation. Look at 2015 and 2016. Without question, we are achieving more while spending less. As I look across the E&P spectrum, I believe Noble Energy is competitively advantaged for the future.","Protecting the balance sheet is fundamental in this environment. That is why we are committed to managing total cash outflows within total cash inflows at the company level, which started 2016 with $5 billion of liquidity, including $4 billion on our undrawn credit facility. This liquidity has already been further bolstered this year by approximately $200 million in cash proceeds from non-producing Eastern Mediterranean asset sales. An additional $200 million of capacity was created through the recent dividend adjustment and debt refinancing.","We also intend to reduce leverage using additional cash flow from operations or portfolio proceeds beyond what has been captured to date. Cash flow for the year is positively impacted by our hedging position, which covers approximately 35% of our global oil and 25% of our U.S. gas production.","As we survey investment opportunities against the outlook for commodity prices, current returns do not justify prior activity levels. We're again pulling back capital aggressively in 2016 and focusing only in those areas where long-term value opportunities make sense.","We have further reduced our capital program by nearly 50% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. This will allow us to maintain financial strength and sustain underlying operating capabilities. As part of our intense scrutiny on capital allocation, our operating teams continue to improve capital efficiency while ensuring that each dollar spent is justified by the future value created. This focus, along with our ability to monetize additional asset, gives us flexibility to adjust in a volatile price environment.","This year's program targets two-thirds of our capital to the U.S. unconventional business and one-third to development and exploration offshore. Gary will go through our detailed development programs in a moment, but first, I want to briefly cover our exploration plans and production outlook for the year.","Our organic exploration strategy has generated substantial value and created long-term cash flows for Noble over the years. In 2016, we're focused on drilling two to three offshore wells, while obtaining and interpreting seismic to open up future value opportunities. We see this as a great environment to deepen our exploration inventory of high-quality opportunities at a relatively low cost of entry.","Now, turning to production. In 2016, we expect to deliver volumes of approximately 390,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is up 10% on a full-year reported basis, and essentially flat to the pro forma 2015 level. From a quarterly standpoint, we expect the first and third quarters to be higher volume than the second and fourth, with the second half of the year generally equal to the first. We've had a strong start to the year, and I'm optimistic that we can drive new capital and operating efficiencies to outperform our goals.","In the slides for this conference call, we've provided detailed full-year and first-quarter guidance. First quarter volumes reflect downtime for the Alba compression project in Equatorial Guinea.","I will now turn the call over to Gary Willingham, who will review recent performance and the 2016 program at the asset level.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Thanks, Dave and good morning, everyone. As Dave noted, from an efficiency and cost perspective, the company is firing on all cylinders. And I'm extremely pleased with the results we are delivering. I believe there is a strong correlation between our record safety and exceptional operating performance. I'll start our asset level discussion with the DJ Basin. Fourth-quarter total production of 121,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day reflected continued improvement in completion performance and infrastructure development. The DJ Basin was, once again, a big contributor to the company's lower operating costs and production outperformance.","Essentially all of the growth in the DJ versus the fourth quarter of 2014 and the third quarter of 2015 has come from liquids, with most of that oil. The December start up of the Grand Parkway system further reduced line pressures to the lowest levels we can remember, and should provide redundancy and improve through-put. Noble's operated Keota plant in East Pony, which came online mid-year 2015, is also running well, supporting our activity in that area. After drilling and completing horizontals in the DJ Basin for more than 5 years now, our team is still driving step changes in drilling results and well performance.","Our full-year 2015 average drilling cost per lateral foot was down 40% from 2014. And as well costs have been substantially reduced, we've also enhanced production performance with optimized completion designs.","We continue to focus on slickwater as our standard frac fluid design, which is consistently delivering lower costs and enhanced production per well. The next step in completion innovation and capital efficiency is utilizing a completion design that will allow slickwater fracs to be pumped to the toe on long laterals and also with higher proppant concentrations. Actual results on both hybrid gel and slickwater wells with higher proppant concentration are exhibiting better initial production and flatter declines compared to our historical jobs.","For 2016, we plan to operate two rigs for the full year, focusing in the Wells Ranch and East Pony development areas. These are our highest value IDPs, with strong oil contributions and existing infrastructure already in place. Total capital allocation to the Basin this year is just under $600 million.","70% of the DJ Basin wells to be drilled in 2016 are planned to be extended reach, many of which will be 9000 foot laterals in Wells Ranch. We are targeting the drilling of 150 equivalent wells this year and expect to commence production on slightly more than 200 equivalents. While these lower activity levels suggest that DJ production will be down somewhat from last year, I'm optimistic that these new completion designs can help offset some of the potential declines.","Moving over to our Texas assets, I'm pleased with our integration efforts in 2015 and believe we're making good progress in optimizing the performance of these assets. During the fourth quarter, we started production on our first five Noble design completions in the Eagle Ford. And based on our review of public data, our first three design completions, which tested wider lateral spacing and higher profit concentrations, are among the most productive Eagle Ford wells ever completed.","We also announced 30-day results on two additional wells today. The average 30 day IP for these wells was over 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and this is remarkable when you look at the fact that they were drilled by Rosetta on tighter 500 foot lateral spacing. Production from these two wells, when normalized to a 5,000 foot lateral, is also significantly above our 3 million barrel EUR type curve, which is based on wider lateral spacing.","Capital allocation for the Texas asset is approximately $250 million. 60% is expected to be spent in the Eagle Ford, primarily to continue Gates Ranch development. The remaining 40% will be spent to begin our operated appraisal work in the Delaware Basin.","Our first two completions in the Delaware are beginning production this month, and while we have pulled back capital in these assets from prior expectations, I still expect higher volumes in 2016 versus 2015 pro forma, driven mostly by the Eagle Ford.","In the Marcellus, total capital for this year is currently planned at $150 million. We've reduced activity to zero drilling rigs, with plans for the JV to be cash flow neutral. Focus will be on a limited number of completions in the non-operated dry gas area and will be weighted towards the first half of the year. As such, this is expected to deliver modestly higher volumes versus full-year 2015.","The Gulf of Mexico finished the year strongly, with Big Bend and Dantzler starting production during the fourth quarter ahead of schedule and on budget. Our Gulf of Mexico strategy of pursuing high-quality reservoirs near existing infrastructure generates substantial value. A full year of Big Bend and Dantzler, along with the Gunflint startup, will contribute significant year-on-year oil volume growth during the coming year.","Noble's Gulf of Mexico budget is $250 million for 2016. As we complete the Gunflint project, the vast majority of capital will be for exploration and appraisal activities. The lineup includes the Silvergate prospect, which is currently drilling, and an appraisal well for our 2014 Katmai oil discovery. Silvergate is a Miocene target with a resource range between 30 million and 100 million barrels of oil equivalent gross with nearby subsea tieback potential, and results are expected by the end of the first quarter.","In Israel, natural gas sales volumes averaged 250 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day during the fourth quarter. This represents an increase of 9% from the same period last year, mainly due to robust power generation demand. Strong natural gas demand is continuing into 2016, not only from this year's early cold weather, but also from the expanded use of natural gas over other power generation source fuels.","In 2016 we have included approximately $100 million for pre-FID capital expenditures on our Eastern Mediterranean projects. The region is fundamentally short gas and will focus this year on finalizing gas sales agreements within Israel and with multiple regional customers.","As we progress the technical and commercial readiness of our projects, we are operating with the following principles: First and foremost, ensure that our development concepts match market demand. Second, we remain focused on meeting and growing demand for natural gas within Israel while diversifying our regional market opportunities. And third, we are managing project risk through financing including the potential involvement of international financial institutions.","I'd now like to take a couple of minutes and provide an update on our current thinking about the Leviathan development. Along with our FPSO development concept, we are also progressing another design that utilizes a fixed platform to ensure timely first production. The initial development under this fixed platform concept would be anchored by Israeli domestic demand, Jordan power needs and Egyptian industrial demand. While continuing to refine the technical requirements, initial capacity could start at over 1 BCF, billion cubic feet of gas per day and is quickly expandable to more than 2 BCF a day. This option provides the most flexibility to match contracted volumes with accelerated development while retaining the capability to meet existing and growing demand.","As you would expect, pre-production capital outlays can be substantially reduced by this design modification, along with the current service cost environment. This will all be firmed up as we move through 2016 securing necessary gas contracts, recosting the final technical project, and finalizing project financing to move forward to FID.","Additionally, we continue to work with L&G plant owners in the region to secure gas contracts. A combination of our high-quality, Eastern Mediterranean reservoirs with idle L&G plants positions us well to be competitive in the global L&G world.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for closing remarks.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Gary. We've highlighted this morning how we executed exceptionally well during 2015. We did what we said we would do and then some. We know these are no ordinary times, but Noble is no ordinary company. We've outlined the 2016 program today that ensures we maintain financial strength and operating capabilities. It provides flexibility to adapt in any environment. And it positions Noble Energy to build long-term value.","We believe the prudent approach is to manage the business within total cash flow while keeping our eyes focused on the long term. How can we say this, because our diverse portfolio and capabilities have us uniquely positioned to differentially outperform in 2016 and beyond. At this time, Debbie, we'll go ahead and open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first caller, Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, Dave. I first wanted to ask you, Noble has a lot of strong operating momentum in 2016 with the Gulf of Mexico, Wattenberg, and the flush Eagle Ford completions. I wanted to see if you could perhaps give us your thoughts -- I know it's early, but sustaining that operating momentum as you think about 2017.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Arun, yeah, appreciate the comments. And highlighting the momentum that Gary, his team and actually the whole organization has put in place and realized as we've gone through 2015 and what we are seeing already moving into 2016. As you look beyond 2016, into 2017, you have to look at the pieces of the portfolio and kind of just think through each one of those and how they are impacted. The Eastern Med, for example, is going to be flat to up depending on demand.","In the Gulf of Mexico, we should see some improvement in 2017 versus 2016 because you're bringing Isabella back on. We've got Isabella workover here in the first quarter impacting 2016. We'll bring that back on so you'll have impact of Isabella and then you'll have a full-year of Gunflint in 2017.","West Africa, you will have the full-year of Alba, which has been impacted this year in 2016 by the downtime on putting the compression project in. That should offset the decline on Aseng and Alen, so West Africa should be flat to essentially up.","So, the international offshore portfolio will give you good sustenance, if you will, underlying the production base. Then, in U.S., I would assume the Texas properties will continue to grow in 2017 and then, at the current type investment levels, you could see some decline in the Marcellus and the DJ. But, when you think about 2017 overall, the way I think about it, at kind of the 2016 spending level, you probably remain fairly flat. But I think a lot of work and a lot of time is going to be on looking at where we want to set up the 2017 program before we go too far down the road as to what we'd actually be spending.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That is very helpful as we think about 2017. My follow-up or second question, really regards the Delaware Basin, it looks like you guys will be turning in the sales about 10 wells. Gary, could you give us a little bit more detail around where the completion activity is focused and a little bit about expectations for those wells and then just maybe discuss some offset wells that you see in the area.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","I'd say those wells are spread throughout kind of the core part of the acreage that we're focused on. This year remains a bit more of a appraisal delineation well as we bring some of our own completion techniques to the Basin. So, we're just now bringing our first two completions on this month. With those, we're trying two different completion techniques; one a hybrid gel frac that's been more typically used in the area and also our first slickwater completion in the area. So we'll see how those perform. We'll continue to test some other things this year.","I would expect performance relative to historical performance to be up similar to what we've seen as we've brought new completion techniques to the Eagle Ford and similar to our history in the Marcellus and DJ over the years, as we continue to refine things. So, still a bit early this year to see what we've got just bringing the first two wells on but excited to get those on and see how we continue to progress the development of that acreage.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, gentleman.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys and good results.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Evan.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I guess it's never too early to focus on 2017. So I'm looking to follow-up on one of the prior comments. How do you think about the priorities? (25:34) grows your balance sheet into 2017, and more specifically, what oil price would you expect to need to being a reacceleration process.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think the priority is assuming you're in the same price environment or the same as this year, which is managing that balance sheet and also keeping an eye on both the near and long-term capabilities that you're continuing to build. I think as we looked at this year, we've built the capital budget from ground up. We looked at what commitments and requirements we had and then how much discretionary capital and where would we put the first crunch of the discretionary capital, I mean, that's kind of been in the Texas and the DJ Basin right now. And then you're watching your cash flow and you're watching where that comes together.","So, I think for this environment, we're going to continue to position ourselves to manage within cash flow and I think we have the portfolio that allows us to do that and still maintain a strong underlying foundation.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. I appreciate that guys. And my second is a follow-up to your Eastern Med comments, what \u2013 maybe I missed it, can you \u2013 what's the latest timeline on the Leviathan progression, that new concept timeline to submit the development plan and FID? I'll leave it at that. Thanks.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'll let Keith \u2013 we've got our expert, Keith Elliott here, he can talk a little more on how he is thinking about things. But I'd just say things are still moving along. We've got all the potential customers at the table. We're outlining some flexibility in different scenarios on development plans that can even create more value potentially and continue to accelerate the project, as it makes sense as things come together. But, let me just let Keith talk a little bit on how he's thinking of development plans and how the timing...","J. Keith Elliott - Senior VP-Eastern Mediterranean Region","Yeah, Evan, so we're still focused, as we always have been, on delivering a quality product and quality project first. Really, the course of 2016, that's kind of got, as Dave said, sort of four key areas that we're working on. We made a lot of progress in 2015 on the regulatory framework and that resolved. Now we're focusing on the technical work, revising and optimizing the development scenario. As you heard, looking at concluding our gas marketing contracts and of course getting our project financing lined up and our view is that we can be in a place to have that all finished out by the end of the 2016.","Brad Whitmarsh - Director-Investor Relations","Debbie, I think we're ready to move on to the next question.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Good morning, guys.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Dave.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Real quickly, in your prepared remarks and in your slides, you referenced the potential to monetize portions of your portfolio and use that for de-leveraging. Can you give us a little bit more color around that in terms of scale, scope, and is there a target leverage metric you're trying to get to? Just any kind of additional details there would be helpful.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think we've already seen some of the monetization take place here in the first quarter, with a couple hundred million from Tanin and Karish and what we talked about on selling down some interest in Cyprus. I mean, we know we've got some unique assets in Eastern Med, for example. We know, as part of the framework, that we are going to sell down some Tamar interest over time. Again, we've got a significant period of time \u2013 six years to do that. But, it does give you an opportunity as that value is realized whether it's Tamar or whether it's some interest in Leviathan, to have some assets that are positioned a little differently than some of the rest of the world out there. I think the other thing we've talked about and it is still on the shelf, if you will, is just continuing to unlock value in the midstream part of our business. I think that's another unique high-value asset piece that can help in that whole portfolio mix over some period.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Appreciate that. And then maybe switching gears a little bit, you also referenced a tax policy change in your release. Can you talk a little bit about that decision, what it does for you guys going forward?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Let me have Ken kind of highlight that.","Kenneth M. Fisher - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Dave. See like many people with offshore earnings had a APB 23 assertion on that said that we would continue to reinvest our foreign earnings internationally and not bring them back to the U.S. at that point in time. As we looked at it in 2015, at the end of the year, we removed that assertion, and that allowed us to utilize the foreign tax credits very effectively, and so what that means is, we have then full fungibility of about a couple billion dollars of additional monies that could be repatriated through time to the U.S. So, it adds a lot to our flexibility and it was, in a sense, a good time, because we could utilize the foreign tax credits efficiently.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think, Dave, it's consistent with a number of things we've been doing to make sure we provide ourselves the most flexibility as we can.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International","I appreciate that. I assume it also makes, maybe, forward guidance on international tax a little bit easier for all of us. Is that a fair characterization?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, I think that's true, because you'll see then it will effectively be more the statutory rate. So, it should make Brad's life a little easier.","Brad Whitmarsh - Director-Investor Relations","Another benefit.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Great. I appreciate it, guys. Great work.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore Partners Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to get back on the new comments on this fixed platform concept for the Eastern Med. Are we to read anything in terms of, I guess, in the script, what was discussed was Israel domestic, Jordan power, which we have heard about, but then Egyptian industrial demand. Is that still the same L&G concept we have been talking about? Or is this a different customer?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's a reflection of all the customers. I think the customer base and the customer needs have done nothing but grow, as we have been in discussions over the last year or two. What this is a reflection of is being able to match up, as some of these contracts come together, we can make decisions and then scale this as we go, and essentially match it to the timing of contracts as they come together, be able to keep pushing forward and accelerate. And one of the other things, and Keith mentioned it a little bit, is probably take advantage of actually a better cost environment, as you start looking at the fixed platform concept, if that is where we end up with on this because, one, it probably utilizes capabilities of the industry a little better and it probably also ties into what we've already done over there. So, there is a knowledge base that's already built.","But I think it is kind of a win-win on all fronts. No read-through to any different outlook, as far as all the potential customers. I'd say all the potential customers are still at the table. But just the recognitions and things will come to place at different time periods, and as they do, it will enable us to continue to move forward faster.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore Partners Inc.","Great, okay. Thank you. I appreciate that, Dave. And I guess on that, I guess, the benefit relative to an FPSO is scalability. And also, is the \u2013 is the Israeli domestic market, your view of that market in, at the end of the decade, significantly higher than it was just a couple of years ago? Is that fair to say as well?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think it \u2013 like the rest of the regional bases; we're seeing more potential demand. I mean, we're seeing, and I think Gary alluded to it briefly, but we're starting to see some indications there could be more demand even coming in places early as this year, that we're going to keep a close eye on, as there's continued movement to generate more of their power with gas.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore Partners Inc.","Right. Okay. I was wondering if I could slip in one other maybe for Ken, just in terms of how we should think about project financing. I know it's early, but as you think about 2017 and the capital call coming, how should we think about this? Is it \u2013 was this consolidated debt at the NBL corporate level, is there another structure here? How should we all think about funding this project in a muted commodity price recovery scenario?","Kenneth M. Fisher - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Sure, we continued, all throughout the last year, to keep the banking sector warm on Leviathan financing, and we still see that there. If you look at the (35:30) guys did very successful financing on Tamar, on a project basis. Those bonds actually got investment grade rating and continue to trade very well. So our sense is, the bank market will be there. Our intent will be not to add new equity in from \u2013 into Israel, but rather leverage the things that Dave talked about, in terms of some partial monetization of assets. We just had realized $200 million from non-producing assets there. And so I think the financing will be either a project finance or an RBL type of financing.","For our share, it will count as debt. And if it's project finance, it still probably will be counted as debt. We'll think about it that way. And then we'll also try and leverage multilaterals or export credit agencies to help support the project, both financially and from a risk standpoint. So, all that effort continues. And so, I don't see it as a pacing item to enable sanction.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I think then, going hand-in-hand with some of this \u2013 I've also stepped back and looked at just some of the things that have happened over last quarter over in Israel. We've seen now export approval to Egypt. We've seen longer-term LOIs with parties in Egypt for gas from Leviathan. We've seen additional demand, to your point earlier about in-country, additional demand coming forward for Leviathan gas. So, I think where we are with this framework in place, where we are with keeping the external financing parties well-aligned, as we have pulled this whole thing together, it's just created a lot of momentum, and we just got to keep things moving forward.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore Partners Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, good morning, everybody.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Dave, I wonder if I could hit the hedging comment. Obviously, you've got some hedging in place for this year. In the event, I'm thinking \u2013 in the back of my mind, I'm just looking at what the credit agencies have done for the whole sector in terms of their debt. Let's assume that they were right and we got fairly onerous outlook. Then obviously your hedging gains, I'm guessing roll off back end of this year. Where is the flexibility in the portfolio going into 2017 if that was the case? How would you think about where you would take capital from? And I've kind of got Leviathan in the back of my mind as well. We'll do that one first and then I've a follow-up.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, you have to look at the different components. I think, even in the case of Leviathan as we get things sanctioned, you probably got a couple hundred million, $300 million potential capital needs next year that I think we should be able to cover from the ring fencing concept that Ken talked about. So, when you compare apples-to-apples for the rest of the program, you got some of the of the Gulf of Mexico, both Gunflint dropping off as far as capital needs next year. You've got rig commitments dropping off part of the year next year. Alba compression project will be done this year. So, when you look at truly committed portions next year, there is very little. Most all the capital next year will be discretionary. That'll be driven by what we elect to invest in relative to how we're looking at our cash flow.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So we should still think about you living within cash flow irrespective of the debt (39:31)?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think that's how we are running of our business in this environment.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Then my follow-up, someone touched on that earlier about the disposal program, but we've seen a lot of companies talk about monetizing assets. I'm just curious, is it the unique aspects of your portfolio geographically that gives you confidence you can still get that done, for example, Israel? Or do you see opportunities still in this market in your lower 48 portfolio? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The good part about our lower 48 portfolio, it's essentially been cleaned up and cored up to what we're focusing on is high quality with tremendous upside value opportunities. So any trimming in the lower 48 portfolio would be around the edges on that, so there's no dependency here, if you look at things going forward on any big trimming on our lower 48 portfolio. Where we've talked about sales or divestments is really around early monetization and how we manage the cash, both inflow and outflow, in eastern Med. And I think that is unique to us.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's really helpful, Dave. I guess it's just really more about having confidence that folks can execute asset sales. I guess you're in a much stronger position than others.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and I don't think we're real reliant on that as being part of the program. I think where that comes into place is part of the program of this ring fencing around the Eastern Med.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. I'll leave it there. Thanks very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Dave, and to the rest of your team there. If I could ask another question about the Eastern Med and I guess everyone wants to ask about where you're selling gas for $5 right now. But the recent news about the Israeli Supreme Court suggesting that framework should be sent to the Knesset. Is that \u2013 should we look at that as just a sideshow or is that more part of the main act? And hopefully you can shed light on how we should look at that.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, I think it's no surprise that this was going to go to the Supreme Court to be brought up and discussed with an expectation that any of the opposition to the framework was going to take this to the Supreme Court and they were going to have to weigh in at a certain point in time. So I'd say this is part of the process right now.","I think what I am focused on and what's important, is when you look at the comments from the government on all of this and the comments on the total framework being critical to move forward, I think that's definitely in the place that we are. And I'd go back to how everything has come together as this framework has come together, how the customers have come to the table, how the demand has probably held up or increased and how we've moved forward to come up with some alternatives and options that can keep this project, the Leviathan project especially, moving forward as quick as possible and maybe even accelerate it as some of the contracts come together.","But I think us and the government are in complete agreement on the necessity of the framework and the urgency of the framework and it's time to keep moving forward.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then if I could just go in a completely new direction. The Codell results you guys in I believe it was in East Pony, could you talk more about that? I think you mentioned that they were kind of equivalent to some of the Niobrara wells in the area, which sounds really good. And I'm wondering if that \u2013 how much appraisal of that Codell zone might be part of 2016? If you can kind of take your temperature on that.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah, Charles, I don't know how many we'll drill in 2016 yet, to be honest. We've drilled the one up in East Pony today. The Codell gets quite a bit thinner up in that part of the field, so the one we drilled was more of an appraisal type test to see what we would get. We are very encouraged with the results and how they compare to the Niobrara development in the area. We need to see how that holds up a bit over time and where that could lead to. But, the Codell in that area is certainly not anything we've really counted on too much in development plans in the past. So, it could be interesting.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay, that's helpful, Gary. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dave Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Good morning, guys. And thanks for the time.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi Dave.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thinking about your 2016 outlook, just very specifically in Israel, I mean, have you included any regional sales or any interruptible volumes in your outlook for this year?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, Dave and that's a good point to make sure we emphasize. We have not. We've essentially assumed a fairly flat demand given how strong the demand was in 2015. And so, besides any interruptible impact, the other thing we're going to be watching pretty close is just the in-country demand. As I've said, we're starting to see some indication that there is some more push to use more gas for power instead of other fuels. And just don't really have a feel for how much that could be yet, but we'll be watching that pretty close this year.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","And that would be the mainly third quarter, summertime (45:30).","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'd say you can see that start to trickle in fairly soon.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Oh, really? Okay.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","By first half of the year we could start to see some impact of that, hopefully.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","And then, last year, you'll made a pretty strategic acquisition of Rosetta and there's been a lot more pain in the industry and you talked about your move on the tax side to make more liquidity available. How do you think about additional opportunities at Noble as a consolidator going forward?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think, as we have talked about in the past, we'll continue to do our business development work to look at what would be priorities, mainly from quality of asset. Rosetta jumped to the front because of the quality of asset and the value we felt we could bring to that asset base. So, anything else going forward would have to have those same attributes.","I'd say right now, I'm just not seeing things close the gap on expectations from buyer and seller at this point. So, it is not something I anticipate anytime real soon. But, we keep our capacity and financial firepower available to take advantage of opportunities. But I'd say those will be further down the road at this point.","What we don't want to do is take on other people's problems. So it would have to be high-quality assets that also would make a positive difference from an overall balance sheet and just future quality and opportunity base for the company, so...","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks for the perspective.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, good morning.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Going back to the Eastern Med, you spent some time talking about the various volume impacts here. Can you talk more on the pricing in the current low oil price and tough spot natural gas price environment, how you see some of the Eastern Med export gas price opportunities looking? And how oil prices versus spot L&G prices versus what you're already getting with the Israel contract would play into that?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I will give you just a quick overview and then Keith is closer to it and can talk a little bit about it. But, when you look and you even go back to how we were talking about contracts before, there is a mix of different contracts and what you're competing with. You're competing in some cases against importing L&G or higher-cost fuels into countries at different points, and in some places like the existing idle L&G plant, you're looking at what makes sense there, giving that you've got a high-quality known gas source that you can tie in with probably one of the lowest-cost L&G plants in the world. So, you're kind of balancing both of those types of contract and potential pricing outlooks. So, each one has a different characteristic. I'll let Keith talk a little bit about how he is seeing things playing out.","J. Keith Elliott - Senior VP-Eastern Mediterranean Region","Thanks, Brian. So, as Dave said, I think we see the market to be too, if you will \u2013 the regional market to be too fundamentally connected, but slightly different markets, i.e., in one case you're competing against the alternative of being imported L&G and in the other case, you're competing into the L&G global market through supply to these idle L&G plants in the region. And so as you look at that market that's I'll call more connected to regional pipeline export, then what you see there is a market that's very well represented by the existing contracts that we have in place and certainly in some cases some premiums to those contracts.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think when you look at it on the scope of different things, current contracts in place in Israel, I probably wouldn't expect a whole lot of price swing on those. I'd say on the future contracts, as Keith talked about, having this known high quality of gas in the quantities that we have it, right adjacent to huge regional demand and growing in-country needs, is going to keep us very highly competitive on a global market basis here as we go forward.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. And then, not to go back to the CapEx-cash flow point, but I will again. You've mentioned a few times that in this environment, you want to keep CapEx and cash flow aligned. Is there an oil price, or what oil price would this \u2013 no longer represent this environment? Or what oil price would you be more willing to spend above cash flow? If any?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know. I mean, that's hard to speculate on at this point. I think you just have to see how it plays out and where your confidence is on where price is going to. I think, no matter what, it makes good business sense to watch your cash and make sure you're directing and allocating your capital to, not only the highest return projects, but the projects that create the greatest value per dollar invested, and that's just the way we'll continue to look at it.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Rowe with TPH.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Mike.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","I see that in the Marcellus, you all expect that gas volumes will be up marginally on a year-over-year basis, but I was wondering if you could give some context around how you see that trajectory throughout the year, given that you had a very strong exit rate in 2015?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think, given the capital profile and how we're managing that within cash, I think you would expect the second half of the year to be lower than the first, just given the activity level.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Michael, this is Gary. I think we mentioned in the prepared comments that those completions that we are doing this year are heavily weighted towards the first part of the year.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, makes sense. And I guess last, I think this was touched on a little bit earlier, but wanted to go back to your thoughts around target credit metrics and sort of how you see those oscillating throughout the year, given this 2016 outlook, and is there a certain type of threshold that you're looking to protect, utilizing non-core asset sales and spending within cash flow?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, let me let Ken touch on that. He's been \u2013 him and his team have been in constant communication with the agencies.","Kenneth M. Fisher - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Mike, I think we look at all the metrics and we also stress test at very lower decks than the agencies use. So, I think we're comfortable that we can continue to maintain strong liquidity, and, as we are not outspending cash flow, maintain our debt position in such a way that we're not going to create any issues for ourselves.","So, I think that's the prudent thing to do now. Spend within cash flow, manage the business that way, and then, if we have some portfolio proceeds, we'll certainly have to take a look at that in the context of de-levering, as Dave mentioned. The term loan that we did was very advantageous, in that it's another synergy from Rose (53:41) and saving about $50 million of annual interest costs. But the other thing that was most attractive was, it gave us the ability to potentially pay down some debt as we move forward. All of our debt to date had been bond debt, which had some friction involved in any prepayment. This gives us full flexibility. So, that's how we'll manage going forward. And as Dave mentioned, we'll continue to stay closely engaged with the agencies; the recent S&P announcement reaffirming our investment-grade rating was welcome. And we'll just have to continue to work through that with other agencies.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think the key \u2013 just to add a little bit to that. I think the key has been to getting in action early. If you go back to \u2013 we started to get into action late 2014 very quickly, not knowing how long we'd be lower for longer. It's turned into longer for lower, I guess. The other piece of that is, I think we are doing the right things in the decisions we are making and getting out in front of this, and I think we have seen that somewhat reaffirmed in just what S&P came out with a couple of weeks ago.","Kenneth M. Fisher - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I mean, we've had some conversations with the oil and gas heads and rating committees and when they lay out what actions people should be taking, to Dave's point, we can check the box that we've done all those things. So \u2013 and we were there early, to Dave's point. So, I think we're in good shape on that.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. Appreciate the commentary.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","We'll go next to John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yeah, thank you. Just another one on Leviathan. If you went to the fixed platform decision, what kind of lead time would you need?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think, actually, that's where we'd some advantage. I think that would be part of what would help with the acceleration overall, given that you're moving to something that is more tried-and-true and off the shelf, if you will. I don't know, Keith, any other thoughts?","J. Keith Elliott - Senior VP-Eastern Mediterranean Region","Yeah. I think, really we would expect the project, if you go down that pathway, to be something that we could deliver on an accelerated timeline versus what we could do with an FPSO.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think either way, John, your higher capital levels will start to kick in in 2018 and 2019.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay. Next one for me, you're focusing on a lot of your core areas. Clearly, you have enough midstream capacity now. What about down the line? How far out are you looking?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll let Gary comment, because he is in discussion on these. But, you were looking at least a couple years out.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah, I mean, John, when we look at our plans in each of the core areas and how that matches to our firm transport capacity, firm processing capacity in each area, we feel very comfortable with what we've got.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Irene Haas with Wunderlich.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Irene?","Operator","Irene, your line is open. Check your mute button on your side, please.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead.","Operator","We'll move on to our next caller. We'll go to Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. You're in good shape and in that context a lot of other companies are selling assets. Could you just comment on any interest you might have in what's out there? Thanks.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll go back to my earlier comment that \u2013 and you hit it at the beginning. I mean, we're focused on continuing this execution and operating momentum on our asset base, because the last thing we want to do is dilute our quality of asset with something else. Like I mentioned, we're not interested in bringing in anybody else's problems or something to deal with and take away from our focus on executing the portfolio that we have. So, we'll continue to keep our eyes open on what would be attractive to us. And continue to keep a priority list of things like we had when we did Rosetta. But I just don't see anything like that in the near-term.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Sure, understood. These are kind of follow-up questions really. But, could you go back to Israel and at a high-level talk about what the outlook is there for pricing and the extent to which there is a threat from low oil prices? You've mentioned that demand is very good. Again, could \u2013 I know you've somewhat been over this, but could you just talk about what the structure is there for the market that causes the outlook for demand to be so good and for prices to be so unique, relative to almost anywhere else in the world? Thanks.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think we've touched on the on the pricing. I don't know if I have a whole lot more to add on that, on the demand. You're seeing the regional demand in Egypt, you're seeing the need in Jordan, you're seeing the increase demand potential in Israel, Turkey has reached out, they're interested in more gas over there. You have the potential with tying in with Cyprus at some port to get more into the EU piece. So, you've got a lot of regional pieces moving around and that are interested in things. We just need to focus on bringing things to the table. And what we've talked about here today is as we bring things to the table, we can make decisions to move forward.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, when you look at the competitive threat from cheap oil, why is that not a bigger deal?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think \u2013 go ahead, Keith.","J. Keith Elliott - Senior VP-Eastern Mediterranean Region","Paul, I guess if you look at the core structure of our Israel business, I think just like we have a diverse portfolio across the company, we have a diverse location within our existing gas sales contract. So some of our customers in the past have chosen to take on gas contracts that are more inflation indexed. Others have chosen to take on gas contracts that are more oil indexed. But those contracts typically have floors in them. And so I think that's why you see some of the confidence that we can...","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, and you've got, not to forget, these are long term contracts. I mean in most cases you're talking about 15-year contracts that start up say 2019, 2020. So what you're looking at is pricing from 2020 through 2035 when you're looking at these initial contracts.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, and I guess a general observation would be that the economies and population pressure there is kind of stronger than you agreed in the press?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think the best indication we have is that customers that are at the table and the discussions about how much gas they would like to talk about.","Brad Whitmarsh - Director-Investor Relations","Hey, Debbie, this is Brad Whitmarsh.

I'd now like to turn the call over to David Larson. Please go ahead, sir.","David R. Larson","Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Noble Energy's second quarter 2013 earnings call and webcast. On the call today we have Chuck Davidson, Chairman and CEO; Dave Stover, President and COO; and Ken Fisher, CFO.","This morning, we issued our earnings release for the second quarter, and hopefully you all have had a chance to review our results. A few supplemental slides were also posted on our website. If you have not already downloaded them, you will want to do that now as we'll -- as they will be good reference material for the discussion today. Later today, we expect to be filing our 10-Q with the SEC, and it will also be available on our website.","The agenda for today will begin with Chuck discussing the quarter and providing an updated view of the remainder of the year, highlighting our dramatic production and cash flow growth, combined with a number of exciting Exploration opportunities. Dave will then give a detailed overview of our 5 core operational programs and near-term plans. We'll leave time for Q&A at the end and plan to wrap up the call in less than an hour.","[Operator Instructions] I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements, as well as references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our disclosures in our latest news release, SEC filings for a discussion of those.","With that, let me turn the call over to Chuck.","Charles D. Davidson","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. It's hard to imagine that we're already well into the third quarter of the year. And when I look at the list of accomplishments through the first 6 months, it really reads like a full year's worth of activity, which just showcases the fact that our teams have really been extremely focused. And we're not anywhere near through for the year. There's much more to come.","Certainly, highlighting the list for the first half is that we've continued to set new production highs, driven by the acceleration and optimization of our DJ and Marcellus Shale programs, as well as the startup of major projects, including Tamar offshore Israel in the first quarter and Alen offshore Equatorial Guinea, which began commissioning late in the second quarter. Commencement of production at Alen follows the successful startup of multiple large-scale developments, including Aseng in late 2011, Galapagos in 2012 and Tamar earlier this year.","Four major projects brought online within a period of 2 years is a tremendous feat, and I'm very proud of what we have accomplished as a team. Delivering the Alen project ahead of schedule and on budget furthers our exceptional track record of execution and continues to highlight what we believe is a significant competitive advantage for Noble.","In addition to reaching record production levels, we've also bolstered our pipeline of major projects with strong Exploration appraisal drilling results. This includes a new discovery in Israel at Karish and the successful appraisal at Gunflint in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. I'm equally excited about what is still to come this year with further production and cash flow growth anticipated from multiple areas of our business and a number of additional major projects targeted for sanctioning.","In addition, we have 2 Exploration wells planned for the Gulf of Mexico, our first exploration well in Nicaragua, initial drilling in Nevada and a number of meaningful appraisal wells all before the end of the year.","I want to spend some time reviewing our second quarter results, which reflect the significant operational momentum we've built. Adjusted income from continuing operations for the second quarter was $249 million or $0.69 per diluted share with the adjustments from income this quarter primarily representing unrealized gains on commodity derivatives. Revenues were $1.1 billion for the quarter with nearly $900 million of our revenues coming from liquid volumes and supported by continued strong U.S. and global crude oil pricing.","We had record sales volumes for the quarter, totaling 260,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Volumes were led by exceptional performance internationally, where total volumes were also a record at 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from continuing operations.","Strong sales in Equatorial Guinea combined with Tamar, which contributed its first full quarter of volumes, led our International performance. Domestic production totaled 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter with the drivers of our ongoing growth being the horizontal programs in the DJ and Marcellus, which are benefiting from continued operational efficiencies in drilling and completions.","As we noted in last quarter's call, our second quarter volumes were impacted by late winter storms in the DJ Basin, as well as some third party facility downtime at Na Kika in the Gulf of Mexico, which handles our Galapagos production. Discretionary cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was $765 million. We ended the quarter with over $700 million in cash and an undrawn revolver. That resulted in total liquidity of $4.7 billion at the end of June. And net debt to book cap was at 28%.","It all adds up to a solid quarter that reflected continued execution of our multiyear growth agenda. However, the numbers really have greater significance when one steps back and looks at our performance over the course of the past 4 quarters. So as compared to second quarter 2012, production this quarter was up 16%, revenues up 19%, discretionary cash flow up 20%; and adjusted earnings up 82%. All of this, of course, from continuing operations; really great progress and very consistent with our long-range plans.","Let's now take a quick review of our core operating areas and the status of our major projects before spending some time on the Exploration and appraisal calendar for the rest of the year. Onshore, we're operating at the highest level of horizontal activity in our company's history, targeting 300 operating wells to be drilled this year in the DJ Basin and approximately 80 operated wells in the Marcellus.","In each play, we're intensely focused on optimizing the drilling and completion techniques, testing various spacing patterns, testing longer laterals, delineating new areas of potential. Both of these areas in the DJ and the Marcellus continue to grow rapidly and as a result, are currently producing well above their second quarter averages, delivering new production highs for Noble Energy. Dave will be providing some further details on our current record production levels.","In West Africa, the Aseng oil project continues to perform strongly. Having recently come off the plateau of production as expected, the field has now produced over 35 million barrels of cumulative production. As mentioned earlier, the Alen project has commenced production, is expected to reach full operations by the end of this -- the third quarter. With its condensate recovery, gas processing and gas reinjection systems, this project represents Noble's most sophisticated processing system worldwide, and is expected to be a strong contributor to the company's production and cash flow profile.","Moving to the Eastern Mediterranean, we've been extremely pleased with the performance of Tamar following startup with -- while experiencing nearly 100% uptime in the field and facilities. This level of reliability on the world's longest subsea tieback with a project of this size installed in industry-leading timeframes is a significant accomplishment for Noble Energy.","We're continuing to progress plans for an expansion of the Ashdod onshore receiving terminal, which handles our gas production in Israel. This expansion, which is anticipated to be online in 2015, will take maximum capacity volumes from today's levels, which are just under 1 billion cubic feet a day, to around 1.2 billion cubic feet per day.","Recently, the Israeli government finally issued their policy on gas exports. It permits the export of some 40% of discovered resources, although the percentage is allowed to be determined on a field-by-field basis and is higher for larger fields such as Leviathan. The policy was approved by the cabinet, but has been challenged as to whether it should be approved by the Knesset. And we expect an indication from the High Court in a few weeks' time on that issue.","We and our partners are evaluating the final terms and conditions of the export policy and its implications on the scope and pace of further and future developments. In the meantime, we continue with our Leviathan phase 1 development planning and also continue to work with Woodside and our existing partners in finalizing agreements associated with the sale of Leviathan interest. The closing of these agreements has been delayed primarily due to the uncertainty over exports, as I mentioned earlier. Hopefully, we are nearing closure on that issue.","Let me wrap up with a review of our Exploration and appraisal programs, which are summarized on Slide 5, and which include a number of meaningful and impactful wells for the remainder of the year. In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we have 2 new Exploration prospects to be drilled with operations currently ongoing at Troubadour, which is about 5 miles east of our East Bend -- of our Big Bend discovery. And then followed by an additional Exploration well in the Gulf later this year, right now likely to be a large prospect called Dantzler, which is approximately 14 miles southwest of Big Bend. So this is turning into a very active area for us.","We're also looking forward to commencing frontier Exploration drilling on our initial Nicaragua prospect during the third quarter with a gross resource range of 210 million to over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The Paraiso prospect is anticipated to be at total depth in the fourth quarter. An initial farm-out of our position there was recently completed and is subject to final government approvals. And we're also continuing negotiations with additional parties for the further farm-out prior to drilling this prospect.","In the Eastern Mediterranean, we're currently drilling the appraisal well to our Cyprus discovery, and we'll be looking to perform our first production flow test after completing drilling operations. Results from the appraisal well will help confirm the resource size, and are important in the decision-making for domestic market planning, as well as an LNG export project there. In support of these efforts, we've already completed pre-FEED studies and have executed a memorandum of understanding with the government regarding a potential one-train LNG development. We've been very pleased with the country's desire to aggressively move forward, planning for both the domestic and export options.","New Exploration drilling offshore Cyprus and Falklands is anticipated for the second half of next year. And we've recently completed or are currently conducting significant 3D seismic programs in both areas in support of these drilling plans. While we've certainly had a strong first half of the year, we're also positioned well to set new records through the remainder of 2013. Our substantial third quarter production growth can be seen in the chart on Slide 8, which shows an anticipated 30,000 barrel equivalent per day increase versus the second quarter with new contributions coming from nearly every one of our core areas.","Just a reminder as well that while this quarter-on-quarter projection is quite impressive, we're still on a multiyear journey for growth here at Noble Energy. We'll be highlighting more of that journey at our December 17 Analyst Meeting that is planned in Houston.","So now I'll turn the call over to Dave, who will give you some more details on our ongoing operations.","David L. Stover","Thanks, Chuck. Let me start by commenting on the U.S. onshore region where we are currently experiencing record levels of production in both of our core areas, the DJ Basin and the Marcellus.","For the second quarter, DJ Basin production averaged approximately 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 22% versus the second quarter of last year. Liquids volumes continue to be a major driver of our activity in the area, comprising 62% of our production and 84% of our revenues.","On the drilling front, we have increased our rig count to 11 operated rigs, which can be seen on our DJ Basin map on Slide 9. We will operate most of the remainder of the year with 10 drilling rigs in the play, as the 11th rig will drill only a few pads before moving to Nevada to commence drilling our Wilson Exploration prospect late in the third quarter.","Through the first half of the year in the DJ, we spud over 130 horizontal wells, targeting the Niobrara and Codell formations, including 16 extended-reach laterals with the entire horizontal program continuing to be very encouraging. As mentioned in our call last quarter, we continue to see the performance of the 9,000-foot extended-reach laterals on average in excess of the 750,000-barrel equivalent type curve. And a number of the wells are performing in line with 1 million-barrel equivalent EUR.","As we continue to appraise new areas of Northern Colorado, we are testing the potential of extended-reach laterals in areas where vertical wells were uneconomic, and even a few standard length laterals performed below average. Of particular note are 2 recent wells in the Cummins area where EURs from extended-reach laterals are estimated to be more than 3x standard lateral well in the area. This is encouraging and a positive sign for areas in Northern Colorado outside of those that have already proven productive such as East Pony.","Throughout 2013, we're continuing to focus on understanding the optimum recovery plan in regards to well density, lateral lengths, multiple layers and well patterns throughout different areas of the basin. Of our total 300 horizontal wells planned for 2013, we anticipate more than 10 to be focused on the Codell and more than 80 to be targeting the Niobrara A or C bench.","Horizontal Codell wells in the greater Wattenberg area are performing in line with what we are seeing from similar length in Niobrara wells. And we're currently testing our first long lateral at Codell. With the entire 300-foot vertical column through the Niobrara and Codell observed to be productive, we have yet to see any production interference amongst tightly spaced Niobrara B wells and A, C and Codell completions.","Our primary focus remains areas with high liquid content, including the Wattenberg oil window and Northern Colorado where total liquids represent over 80% of the production stream. We'll also continue to transition to larger pads, more centralized production and water handling facilities and gathering systems to support our increasing levels of activity. We estimate that over 60% of the water utilized in our completion so far this year has been piped to location rather than trucked, resulting in an elimination of approximately 44,000 truckloads or an equivalent 3.3 million miles taken off the Colorado roads.","Recent infrastructure improvements, along with our active development program, are resulting in record production levels for Noble Energy in the DJ Basin. To illustrate the high levels of current activity, we completed 31 wells in the month of June with 604 stages pumped, a record for us and significantly above our prior record of 26 wells and 500 stages pumped in October of last year.","On Slide 10, we highlight our net horizontal production in the DJ, averaging a record 50,000 barrels equivalent per day in the second quarter and already currently around 55,000 barrels equivalent per day. In total, our DJ volumes are currently between 95,000 and 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Reflecting back to where the DJ was just 1 year ago versus the third quarter of 2012, the production levels are up about 30% and the horizontal volumes are up over 75%, highlighting the tremendous impact that our program is having.","In support of continuing growth from this leading U.S. onshore play, additional near and long-term infrastructure expansions are being brought online. An in-field oil gathering trunk line is scheduled to begin service with up to 50,000 barrels a day of capacity in September. This line will help us deliver crude oil efficiently to the White Cliffs Pipeline and the plain's rail facilities, which combined are adding 140,000 barrels a day of capacity between now and the end of next year.","On the gas side, DCP is bringing on the LaSalle plant in September of this year, which will initially add 110 million cubic feet per day of capacity. And the plant will then be expanded in the fourth quarter by an additional 50 million cubic feet per day.","Further midstream projects are also planned for 2014 and 2015, including Noble Energy's own Tioga Gas plant, which will service our wells in Northern Colorado and our adjacent LNG facility. And the LNG facility, the first of its kind in the state, will mainly provide fuel for our drilling and completion operation starting in late 2014.","Moving over to the Marcellus. We're in the process of rigging up our fourth wet gas rig. Two of these rigs are operating in the Majorsville area with one rig drilling each of our first pads in the Pennsboro and Oxford areas of West Virginia, south of Majorsville. We anticipate adding a fifth operated rig to our program later in the third quarter, which will initially focus on delineating a new wet gas area just west of Majorsville in the Moundsville","area. We're continuing to focus drilling efforts on optimizing lateral lengths and completion designs with a recent highlight that we drilled our longest lateral on the play to-date, in fact our longest lateral ever drilled by Noble Energy in any play, with a total end zone pay length of over 10,400 feet. First production from this pad is anticipated late this year.","With our drilling plans in the wet areas along with the 2 rig dry gas program operated by CONSOL, we remain on target to participate in about 80 wet gas wells and 40 dry gas wells in the Marcellus this year. In June, we brought to production the 11-well WEB 4 wet gas pad, which represents our fourth operated pad on production in the Majorsville area. Results have been very encouraging with initial gross production reaching a maximum of more than 50 million cubic feet of natural gas and 3,000 barrels of condensate and NGLs per day.","Combined with recent completions on the gas side by our partner, we've seen our current net Marcellus production increase to a record 150 million cubic feet equivalent per day, which represents an increase of over 30% from the beginning of the year. The outlook for continuing our production growth in the Marcellus through the remainder of the year is excellent, supported by our increasing activity levels.","Right now we have completion operations ongoing in various stages on 8 wet and dry gas pads combined including our first pad in the Normantown area, which is testing the southern extension of our acreage. Continuing to execute on our plans will enable us to exit 2013 with Marcellus production above 210 million cubic feet equivalent per day net to Noble.","Shifting offshore to the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, our development teams are making significant progress, moving forward plans for our Big Bend and Gunflint major projects, which represent the next leg of production growth for our Deepwater Gulf assets. We're targeting a sanction of both of these projects later this year with initial production estimated around the end of 2015.","In the near term, our third quarter volumes in the Gulf of Mexico will be affected by 2 weeks of downtime at Galapagos for regular pipeline inspection, as well as approximately 20 days of downtime at Ticonderoga for the tie-in of a recently drilled development well and the installation of gas lift. The Ticonderoga #4 well, where we have a 50% working interest, is currently being completed with plans for first production early in the fourth quarter of this year.","Bringing the well online is anticipated to add 3,000 barrels of oil per day net to our production. As Chuck mentioned earlier, we are currently drilling the middle Miocene-Troubadour prospect, which is adjacent to Big Bend. And results are expected to -- in the latter part of the third quarter. Discovery at the 30 million to 60 million-barrel equivalent prospect could be incorporated quickly into our development and sanction planning with Big Bend.","Following Troubadour, we'll drill an additional Exploration prospect, and are currently selecting between several candidates. A leading possibility is an upper middle Miocene prospect named Dantzler, which is located only 14 miles southwest of the Big Bend-Troubadour area on Mississippi Canyon 782. Dantzler has a gross resource range of between 50 million and 220 million barrels of oil equivalent, and results would be anticipated towards the end of the year.","Moving over to the International side. A big highlight of the second quarter in West Africa was the early startup of our Alen gas condensate project, which commenced production late in the quarter. Since startup, we've been slowly ramping up volumes, optimizing all of the major component systems including our gas separation and compression facilities. We anticipate reaching full operations at the field late this quarter, 3 months ahead of our original schedule.","As a reminder, the produced condensate volumes from Alen are being transported by pipeline to the Aseng FPSO for storage and offloading. Also continuing to progress the appraisal and predevelopment of Diega and Carla, with a well currently drilling at Diega and plans to perform a long-term flow test following total depth. In Carla, we drilled an appraisal well in the southern area in the second quarter, encountered oil in the upper zone, and then lower zone was wet.","Our early development planning for these discoveries is focused on the potential for subsea tiebacks to existing infrastructure at Alen and Aseng. In the Eastern Med, we're very pleased with the performance of Tamar, which drove strong second quarter production volumes in Israel, will be a significant contributor to our growth through the remainder of the year. As a result of the startup, deliverability of natural gas to the Israel market now exceeds the average daily demand bringing us back in a position of providing for the swing in the market.","For example, this month we have delivered approximately 1 BCF per day gross on certain peak load periods during the work week, while the overall average for those days is closer to 800 million cubic feet per day, again highlighting the flexibility and deliverability of this world-class field.","Weather continues to have an impact on the overall electricity generation demand in Israel. And thus far, in 2013, it's been generally milder than in 2012. This has been evidenced in the third quarter with July electricity demand down about 7% versus the same period last year.","Natural gas sales in the third quarter will also be impacted by this year's holiday calendar in Israel, with very few higher demand workdays in September. That being said, we continue to see a strong long-term demand outlook for natural gas in this region.","With respect to Eastern Med Exploration, discovery of Karish marked our fifth discovered field of greater than 1 Tcf, and brought total discovered gas resources and basin to approximately 38 trillion cubic feet.","Perhaps of greater interest was that Karish contained higher condensate yield than our previous discoveries -- in the order of 7 to 10 barrels per million cubic feet. Subsequent lab analysis indicates the condensate is thermogenically sourced and provides further encouragement for the potential of oil in this basin.","Construction of the Atwood Advantage drillship remains on schedule for delivery late this year. As we've mentioned before, capabilities and efficiencies of this rig will enable us to drill a deep Mesozoic oil prospect in the first half of 2014. With the potential for the deep oil prospect under a number of our existing discoveries in Israel and Cyprus, we're very excited about testing this substantial new play as soon as possible.","Let me wrap up with some comments on our outlook for the third quarter and remainder of the year. As previously discussed, significant growth in the U.S. onshore regions, production capacity in Israel and the ramping volumes from Alen will all provide additional contributions moving forward. We remain in good position to meet our full year guidance with current production already close to 285,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And third quarter volumes anticipated to average between 285,000 and 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The midpoint of this range reflect the 12% increase from the second quarter of this year.","Overall, our rapid production growth, multiple major projects targeted for sanction, Exploration drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, Nevada and Nicaragua, as well as our ongoing appraisal programs provide a strong second half and great momentum for 2014. These are just some of the many reasons we have planned another Analyst Day late this year to update and highlight what we are building at Noble Energy.","Tim, at this time, we'd go ahead and open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Let me start with one kind of a financial one. Your deferred or I should say, your adjusted deferred tax rate for the quarter was a little higher than you guys had guided to, and I think most people were looking for. And I'm sure there are some idiosyncratic view -- reasons for why that happened in Q2, but I wondered if you could just give some detail on why that moves around and how that might affect the outlook for that item in the back half of '13?","Kenneth M. Fisher","Sure. Charles, this is Ken Fisher. The deferred rate came in at about 19%. That's a calculation that we do quarterly, projected on the full year's provision, tax provision and the -- we had forecast some less utilization of some foreign tax net operating losses in the foreign jurisdictions and -- but if you look at it on a full year basis, the guidance range we give is 5.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. So if -- is it kind of a fair simplification that it's kind of like a quarterly mark-to-market on where you expect you're going to be in the year?","Kenneth M. Fisher","Yes, yes. We were high in the first quarter, a little lower in the second quarter. But yearly, guidance stays the same.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","And then shifting to the operations, and maybe this is a best question for Dave, I was a little bit -- I know you guys had guided to lower -- higher downtime in both the -- in the DJ and the Gulf of Mexico for Q2. But the -- you had a string of 5 or 6 or more consistent U.S. oil growth broken here. And as I'm looking at the breakdown to that, it seems like with some of the -- both the slides you have on the DJ horizontal volume growth, that growth trend is attacked. And so I think what we're left with is maybe the legacy production of the DJ maybe underperforming. Or perhaps as Chuck mentioned, the -- I know there was some anticipated downtime at Swordfish for Q2, but it sounds like maybe there was the Galapagos host tieback in Na Kika might have had some unexpected downtime. So I wonder if you could decompose that?","Charles D. Davidson","Yes. I think that -- I mean let's start with -- the best news is what we're at now. So when I mentioned where we're at on overall company production and also where the DJs back up to in that 95 to 100 range. But what we saw a little bit in the second quarter was we had probably a little longer downtime on that Na Kika getting the Galapagos production back up. So that had an impact. Obviously, that's what 12,000 barrels a day -- any extra week of that has a big impact in the quarter. And then in the DJ, the other thing we saw is as we were doing some of these plant, as -- say we -- the operator was doing some of the plant facility downtime. We had a little extra plant facility downtime in the DJ on that, but that's all back up and running now. And the exciting thing up there is we're on the verge of bringing on a big new facility up there with that LaSalle plant in September. So I'd say all of that was just temporary, Charles. And that's why we're excited about where we're back up to on the DJ volumes and actually how that overall horizontal production's performing. But when you have any of that period of downtime and then bringing anything back on, it does affect the legacy wells much more than the horizontal producers.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You talked about on the call having some tightly spaced multi-zone wells in the Niobrara, basically producing from the A, B, C and the Codell. Can you give us a little bit more color on kind of what you saw on that? And if you can elaborate on what you think there the potential is for multi-zone development across broader areas of the Niobrara-Wattenberg?","Charles D. Davidson","Yes. I mean, and we've been talking, Leo, for a while here or I guess this year on how where a large part of the focus is testing these different multi-layer horizons. And what we're seeing so far is that they look every bit as good as the Niobrara B, especially when you adjust for the various thickness of those intervals in these particular areas. Like one of the comments I had in the notes here today was particularly on the Codell horizontal wells where they're looking as good as our Niobrara wells. And we're actually going to now start to test that on a little longer extended reach basis on some of that. So I think what you'll see us evolving into is we're continuing to test some of these other zones, we'll start to mix in some of these longer laterals in with some of these zones on some of this. So I'd say all of that's been very encouraging. I think we're still optimistic at the end of the day. When you settle on a complete pattern out here, you'll have a mix of different zones in some of these areas. And that's why we're continuing to say, on a base horizontal B program up here in Northern Wattenberg and in the oil window, the base program that we've been focusing around is that kind of 16 wells per section for the B. It's not going to surprise us if we don't have more wells per section where you've got a combination of the B and some mix of these other zones, depending on their thickness in different parts of the field.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And I guess you also talked about the LaSalle facility. Is that going to potentially debottleneck any production for you guys? Do you think we would see production increase maybe more significantly in the fourth quarter as that's up and running there in the Niobrara?","Charles D. Davidson","Yes. I mean, that's a good point. It'll be a big help up there as a lot of our focus has been here in the Northern Wattenberg piece. LaSalle will help to pick up a large part of that volume up there, it's what I think a little bit southwest of the Wells Ranch area, if I remember correctly, where it's located. So it actually will come into play in an area where we've had probably our largest activity here recently. So it'll be interesting to see how that ramps up. And as I've said, it's kind of in 2 phases that, that's coming on here in late third quarter and into the fourth quarter. So the real impact of that'll be seen in the fourth quarter.","David L. Stover","Just as a reminder, that plan is part of a multi-plan expansion that's ongoing there. And we expect further expansions in 2014 as well. So this is all about staying ahead of the production and managing the overall program to a very broad area. So there's been a lot of projects underway, not only that, but some compression and some other work to accommodate the gas production. So we're very encouraged by the additional facilities that are going in. And they're going to be needed because we're growing our production very rapidly.","Kenneth M. Fisher","And as I mentioned, we're putting some of our own facilities up there into Northern Colorado for that area.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess just in terms of Israel real quick here. I guess I'd heard some chatter on potentially some incremental taxes levied on export gas. Wanted to get you all thoughts on that. I guess is there any potential still to develop Cyprus jointly with Leviathan? Any read on the new export policy, whether it allows for that?","Charles D. Davidson","Yes. I think on the -- I think you characterized it correctly is the chatter on taxes is our sense is that was really more of a reiteration of what's already included in the existing Shishinksy. And so we're not anticipating from our perspective and from our plans anything incremental on that side. On the thinking on the Cyprus LNG and the possibility of developing that with Leviathan, right now the export policy that's been issued basically provides that LNG would be in Israeli territorial waters, but there are some possible provisions where you could go back to the government and seek to do something differently. We're not at that point yet. We're right now moving, as we noted, moving forward with the appraisal at Cyprus. That will give us a good handle on that. We've already entered into a memorandum of understanding that is the basis of an LNG project, the one-train project at Cyprus. So we're continuing to look at all the options on Leviathan. But as just a reminder, we see some of the regional and domestic gas sales options for Leviathan. They're most likely going to be some of the early projects that we move forward because we've got increased demand in Israel and other regional demands that is -- been growing. So it's our thinking right now is that Leviathan is going to be a combination of an LNG export, as well as domestic sales. And we're continuing to move those plans forward.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly in the Niobrara, you mentioned in your remarks and in your release that you've drilled about 131 wells year-to-date. Target's still 300 completions. You've done about 113. I know you're at 11 rigs now and dropping down to 10. Can you just walk through, is it efficiencies in drilling that are going to be driving your ability to execute to that 300 wells? And any kind of color on how that 300 wells drilled ties into wells that are completed as well?","Kenneth M. Fisher","Yes. David, I'll give you a little bit of color on that. If you remember that the first part of the year, we had some late winter storms, which affected some of our completion timing and activity. And that's why I mentioned the amount of activity here in June. We had over 30 wells I think that we actually completed. So we're going to see a much higher level of completion activity here through the second half of the year catching up with some of the drilling. At the same time, on the drilling side, we've added what, 2 rigs I think since we last talked. And one of those, which will stay for a short period of time and then go to Nevada. So when I look at it and I look at the monthly schedule, we're right on track for that full year delivery with much more heavy second half of the year weight, especially on the completions, which were affected by that timing, in the late first quarter, early second quarter. So the key thing there is look at what happened here in June and what we'll be doing going forward.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great, appreciate that clarification. And then just one more with respect to Israel and the export decisions right now. If I'm not mistaken, the decision that they placed was relative to export from offshore facilities. When you think about that and you're bringing gas in domestically into Israel, does that apply to exports out of country through Israel?","Charles D. Davidson","I think that we're still doing some more work on that because they are working on some accommodations for regional exports as part of that. So I think I'm probably going to wait until I see the final, final before we make a decision on that. But clearly, there are some opportunities, as you know, in adjacent countries. I think initially as they were working through a preliminary export policy, they had considered -- considered -- exempting those from the export. But they were concerned that the volume could grow very large. And so the policy as it is now involves those, but there are some procedures that you might be able to go through to get certain allowances for it. So it's -- I know that is a really complicated answer, but it's -- the simple way is I'm not sure right now.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, I appreciate the clarifications, and I completely understand that that's something that's going to be in flux for a while as you're working through the government.","Charles D. Davidson","But I think, just as a follow-up, you have pointed out one thing that's very important. And that is the regional markets have grown and the potential for regional markets are growing very quickly. And it's changing our own thinking and our plans. And it's changing Israel's thinking as well. So it's an opportunity that is much larger than what we thought even just 6 months ago.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dave, I wonder if I could back to your -- some of the comments you made in your remarks regarding stepping out into, I think you mentioned the Cummins area. I'm just kind of curious as to how you would characterize the running room you think you have beyond what you've already disclosed to us? Because you referenced East Pony and I'm wondering if we should be thinking that you believe that some of these former vertical areas could have the same kind of characteristics as greater Wattenberg or more like the East Pony. Again, I'm just trying to get an idea as to what you're trying to signal to us there in terms of potential. And I've got a follow-up, please.","David L. Stover","It's a good question, Doug, because that is one of the things I'd say I've come out of this quarter probably most excited and interested in is the additional potential that we continue to uncover up there. And we're seeing that as -- you pick that Cummins area, for example. Vertical wells didn't look very good in that area. The original couple standard lengths, horizontals that we tried were, I'd say, marginal there. And we went in and drilled a couple of long laterals, 9,000-foot laterals in there. And they looked very good in that area, especially when you look at the economics of that and the F&B improvement that you potentially can see in that area. And then you couple that with some of the appraisal testing that we're doing up in Northern Colorado outside of East Pony. And so far, we've had the chance to get some semblance of testing on maybe another 20,000 to 25,000 acres that -- I would put that in that category of more encouraging also at this point. So there's still areas to go up here, and I think we have probably in total this year we'll drill 15 to 20 of what I'd called these appraisal wells up here in Northern Colorado and areas that we really haven't defined or really included yet. So there's a lot more to come on this, and we're still very encouraged and why we keep going back to. We're still early in this game of unlocking all the resource value up here.","Charles D. Davidson","Let me just follow on that, just one thing. Even in East Pony, some of the early work in that area was perhaps initially discouraging. And then we went in and really started working it and really applying the learnings we had. And it's turning out to be an outstanding area. So it's not only testing new areas, but it's also bringing our latest techniques on completion work in these areas. And we're just, as Dave said, it's been a nice positive surprise that these are opening up some opportunities that we didn't, perhaps 6 or 12 months ago, didn't think that were going to be that prospective. I'm sorry, you had a follow-up. Go ahead.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. Sorry, Chuck. Yes, it's kind of a related follow-up and maybe a little cheeky actually ahead of your Analyst Day in December because what we are seeing anyway, and I think what your results are showing, is that the type curves you've given us both for these longer laterals and for your kind of base greater Wattenberg, I could be forgiven, I guess, for thinking that well results you've had to-date are going to ultimately push those numbers higher. Can you give us some indication as to whether directionally that's how you're seeing things right now, and ultimately what that could mean for your stated resource potential? I think there's a couple of billion barrels up there currently?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, Doug, you're right on the first part of that. We probably won't really get into updating numbers until the December piece. But I'll you some direction or indication on some things. I mentioned that we're still seeing a lot of encouragement on these longer laterals. And we've got a number of them now that are getting closer to that million-barrel type curve. We've probably got twice as many now that are approaching that million-barrel type curve as we showed last time, probably up to 6 or so. But the whole issue with that is we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. A lot of this is still early data. But everything we're doing up here is still very encouraging.","David L. Stover","I'll put it this way since they never will share numbers with me because I write them down. But when I look at those curves, my expectation is the numbers are going to go up.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask a follow-up on the first of Doug's questions with regards to the connection between the Cummins' successes and potentially expanding the footprint in Northern Colorado. Are you seeing similar geology outside of East Pony? And is this something where we can just look at the north, the northwest and the western portion of Northern Colorado and draw this connection or I guess thinking a broad point of, hey, there are areas in where horizontals initially don't work or where verticals don't work, and we can make these extended laterals work?","Charles D. Davidson","Yes. The first part of that, Brian, it's not blanket. There is variations, there is changes on some geology, porosity, resistivity, some of this thickness of these various intervals as you're going through some of this. So we kind of have to break it down in what we call kind of pod-by-pod or piece-by-piece on this. And kind of where we've started is kind of west of East Pony. And in that area, and we'll kind of start there and work our way north from that. So the first part of this is that first 20,000, 25,000 acres I've talked about that we'd kind of concentrate on first is kind of just slightly west and northwest of East Pony. And then we still have to go from there.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And is this something where you'd have decent additional color on by say year end or perhaps December 17?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, we'll have some more color on that. And it's -- I think there's still -- portions of that will be in very early stages of testing. And portions of that will have some more established production history by that time. So we'll be able to get some update on what we're learning as we go. Just depends how far along we are on some of these bringing new wells on.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And lastly, in Equatorial Guinea with Alen coming on earlier, and then I think you referenced in the press release, Aseng has come off plateau, can you just refresh us on what we should expect, e.g. net oil production, to do next year versus this year when we layer in the growth from the growth from Alen, and then it would appear some declines at Aseng?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, yes. I haven't even looked at next year's yet. I'd have to go back and look at that. But when you think about Aseng, we've talked about it's kind of come off its plateau. And you have to remember we actually brought it on and actually increased its early volume higher than we originally anticipated. And then it kind of had a step function down somewhat as the first well as expected when it started to see water. And then I'd say going forward on Aseng, you can probably look at kind of 10% to 20% per year type of decline, which is what I would expect just in general. Alen, we bring that on, hopefully get that out. Well, we plan to get that ramped up to full volume by the end of the quarter. So starting in the fourth quarter, you're in that I don't remember what it was -- high teens, 1,000 barrels a day type net. And then it should hold fairly constant for kind of like Aseng for close to a year at least.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Chuck, Dave, I just wanted to talk a little bit. Obviously, lots of headlines on the export decision. What I'm trying to understand is as you guys interpret the export rules today, trying to understand how many trains of LNG do you think you have support for today? I think you found, call it 37 Tcf of gross gas. As you interpret the rules for large field, small field is -- how many trains of gas do you think you have today to support?","Charles D. Davidson","I think the answer to that is 2 to 3 that -- but the key on that is that -- and it came up in an earlier question, is we have this regional export that is really growing in demand. So as a result, that might move some gas from an LNG export to a regional export. So that's the variable in this. But keep in mind, and I mentioned that this is on a field-by-field basis, and so for Leviathan, it's higher than that 40%. So we've still got a lot of resource at Leviathan that can source a multi-train type of facility.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Chuck, just to elaborate a little bit. I know Jordan has been a place which has been short gas. If the stars were aligned, could you export gas to Jordan for say, sooner than 2018, 2019? Or would the timing be similar?","Charles D. Davidson","No. It would be sooner because you've got the ability to not only develop but also produce. And pipeline access is a lot easier depending on which route you go. And there's a couple of different ways you can go. But keep in mind, there's a pipeline in Israel that already goes to the Dead Sea area. So there's some possibilities that we can easily, we would expect to easily be able to export to Jordan much sooner than that. And like everything else, it's early on. It might be smaller volumes. We've got a lot of our capacity committed right now, but we're working to expand the Tamar capacity. And we'll be working on Leviathan, which is expected to have a domestic component, and could also help bolster these regional exports as well.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then my follow-up question is just on Gunflint. I guess you had previously, Chuck, talked about maybe a 90 million-barrel type of discovery there. Based on the most recent well, I'm just wondering if you could maybe comment on that resource range? And maybe some thoughts, I believe it will be a tieback on the initial production and timing of that -- as soon as 2015.","Charles D. Davidson","Yes. When -- and we updated, I think, the resource size after our appraisal. Keep in mind, the deep opportunity there was not present. So we're looking now at something that's around 65 million to 90 million-barrel. So it's in that range, and yes, it's going to be a nice tieback. We're working on the host options currently on it.","Kenneth M. Fisher","Yes. When it starts up, you should probably -- it should probably start up with 2 of those prolific Miocene producers kind of towards that late 2015, early 2016 timeframe. And that would be coupled with at the same time a nice Big Bend well. And if we were fortunate to have a discovery at Troubadour, you could have 3 to 4 wells coming on around the same time out of these Miocene producers.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Malone with Mizuho Securities.","John T. Malone - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Just on Israel, is there anything that we can anticipate coming out of the legacy fields, Mari-B, Noa and Pinnacles, or is it pretty much all just a mar [ph] from this point? I mean, it reads like that was 94% of the gross production in Israel this year anyway. Is there anything left in those fields that we can see over the next 12, 18 months?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think you can see a little bit yet this year, and it'll pretty much deplete most of that off. I think between them, you're maybe making about 150 million a day between Pinnacles, Noa and Mari. We actually had a little work-over on Pinnacles here in the second quarter that enabled us to continue to produce that some this year. But I think by the end of the year, most of that will all be depleted.","John T. Malone - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just to ensure I heard you correctly. Nicaragua, you do have a farm-down agreed? You're just waiting for government approval?","David L. Stover","Yes. We've got a farm-down with one company, and we're still talking with several others who are interested. And yes, this is -- they're subject to government approval, but we expect to obtain those approvals. And we're set to begin drilling that well this quarter.","Charles D. Davidson","Yes, towards the end of August, early September.","John T. Malone - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Do you anticipate getting a carry on that? Or would it just be a straight up split in the cost of risk?","Kenneth M. Fisher","No. Because of the terms and their clause in there, I don't want to discuss the specifics. But yes, there is a promote involved and a recovery of some costs as you would expect on a prospect of that size.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bob Brackett with Bernstein.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes, following up on Nicaragua, can you talk about gas versus oil risking? And what would the economic threshold be if this is a gas discovery? And then I've got a follow-up.","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think our expectations is that this is an oil prospect. And it's a large structure, and everything we know about the depth and the temperatures that we would expect it to be in the oil window. If it's gas, that's -- we would just have to look to see what the size of it is. But clearly, we have gone into this with the thinking that this is an oil opportunity.","David L. Stover","Yes, with multiple oil, large oil prospects down here is the way we're looking at it.","Charles D. Davidson","Right.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So when you quote that 1 in 4 geologic chance of success, that's for an oil discovery or a hydrocarbon discovery?","Charles D. Davidson","Yes. That's -- yes, because basically our model is based on it being oil. So it's tied to being the geologic chance of that -- of discovering that. You can always be surprised, but a lot of things would have to happen for that to turn into gas. And quite honestly, I think we would expect to see probably some different seismic responses if that was a gas prospect rather than oil.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And I can't remember if you've disclosed, are you chasing the cretaceous age source or is it a tertiary age?","David L. Stover","I'm not -- it's cretaceous, I think. And I'm not sure what else we have said on that, but...","Charles D. Davidson","Yes, the best -- the most we've said about was probably when we had our call last October where we talked specifically about all the big Exploration plays.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And I guess the final, if you hit -- it's a carbonate -- if you hit poor reservoir quality but you see evidence of hydrocarbons, would you sidetrack that well right away?","Charles D. Davidson","It all depends on what we saw. I'm not sure if you saw poor reservoir quality that you would just sit there and sidetrack it at that location. You'd probably want to step back and come up with a process as to why you believe the quality might improve and then decide in what direction you would go. But I'd -- to me, the best opportunity for a sidetrack would be is if you saw something that was perhaps quite positive and you wanted to see -- try to check on it, yes.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","I would like to ask a question on offshore Israel. When you mentioned earlier, the Karish discovery, you found biogenic gas, and yet you have condensate of thermogenic source. So I just want to have a little color. How does it fit with your migration model? And it certainly would be a positive indication that you could have another system working in the basin.","Charles D. Davidson","Yes. I think your conclusion is right along ours. And that is as you've -- it's just more evidence that there's a second source in this basin, a thermogenic source. We talked about, as we were drilling deeper in the Leviathan, we did not reach their primary objective there, but we saw signs of thermogenic. We have seen it in some of the condensate samples, I believe, in Leviathan. But Karish is probably the biggest example so far because the condensate yield is so much higher than anywhere else. And yes, and it's because it's through the analysis that shows it came from a thermogenic source. We've got a different source that migrated into that trap. And our job is to chase that down and find out if it's productive at its origin.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Pretty much everything has been asked, but some quick ones. With Nevada, once you move the rig in, are you just going to drill a bunch in core or drill and frac? When will you start releasing information about results?","Charles D. Davidson","Yes. John, what -- the plan is we're going to drill 2 vertical wells first and understand the reservoir a little better, and based on that decide how we want to actually test this play. Now if you remember, we're expecting a pretty thick section. It could be anywhere from 1,000 to 2,000 feet. So the real question's going to be what's the distribution of hydrocarbons? Are there hydrocarbons, where at? What kind of reservoir quality are we seeing? And then come back and design, do we want to test this with a horizontal program? Do we want to offset 1 or 2 of these vertical wells into a horizontal program? Do we want to contact a thick part of the section and slant forward? Do we want to do a vertical program and frac it somehow or not even frac it, aspedize [ph] it? That's what we need to see depending on the reservoir quality, how we want to set up our completion. But we -- first step is to get some real, real true reservoir information of a couple of wells, vertical wells in the area. So I would say information will come out slowly on this one as we set up a plan for this.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. One other one. With respect to what the discussion in Northern DJ with horizontal is working versus -- extended horizontals working versus regular horizontals or verticals, in the case of the formations, is this an issue in terms of the heterogeneity being more diogenic, depositional or is it kind of both? Is it just going to be heterogeneous because of all of the above?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, you would -- because it -- I'll give you some suspicions, and that is with extended laterals working so much better than the normal laterals that you're somehow through the extension, maybe you're connecting up with some better quality at some point in it. But there's more work to be done on that. We do know there's variability up in these areas. And so we're trying to understand that variability. And maybe it's just helping us to, ultimately, to find the sweeter spots to go after.","Unknown Executive","And probably minimizing any natural completion damage, if you will, by minimizing drawdown down these wells with the longer lateral. That seems to still be a prevailing theory on what's really helping on these.","Operator","Yes. We'll take our last question from Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I'll be brief. What's your estimate of the decline rate on the legacy vertical production from the Niobrara?","David L. Stover","Yes. I think you're now far enough away from the drilling on that, you're getting more into the established lower level of decline, maybe 15% or so, plus or minus. Again, those are the wells that get impacted first on anything that changes in the field dynamics. So I think as we bring some of these new facilities on and you get into next year, you'll get a more established decline on some of those. But that's what I'd kind of expect, maybe that 10% to 20% range.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Got it. And then as a follow-up, what do you estimate to be the economic limit or the economic breakeven price for your dry gas, Marcellus operation today?","David L. Stover","Dry -- I mean, it probably continues to move a little bit because we're still seeing opportunities for increasing efficiency out there on an -- even on the production piece on just the performance, production performance. And you see that as you look at some of the overall Marcellus performance. You're down probably in the area -- and I'll temper it somewhat by what net revenue interest you're working with because a lot of what we've been drilling in the Marcellus dry, we have a very high net revenue interest that came with the CONSOL piece. So with that, you're probably down in the 2s.","Charles D. Davidson","So I want to, again, thank everyone for participating in the call today and your interest that you've had and will have in Noble Energy. And I'd like to suggest you all have a great day.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation."],"15898":["Noble Energy, Inc.

Good morning and welcome to the Noble Energy's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Following today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","And now I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brad Whitmarsh. Please go ahead, sir.","Brad Whitmarsh - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jake. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning I hope you've had a chance to review our second quarter 2016 operational and financial news release, as well as the supplemental slides for this event, which highlight a very strong quarter for Noble Energy and an enhanced outlook the remainder of the year. Both items are posted to our website. And you'll find them helpful as we talk through our prepared comments. In addition, we anticipate filing our 10-Q with the SEC later this morning.","Following prepared comments from Dave Stover, Chairman, President, and CEO, and Gary Willingham, EVP of Operations, we'll open the event for a Q&A session. In order to meet our 1-hour timeframe, we would ask that analysts limit themselves to one primary and one follow-up question. Additional management members available for Q&A are Ken Fisher, EVP and CFO; Susan Cunningham, EVP Exploration and New Ventures; and Keith Elliott, SVP of our Eastern Med Assets.","I want to remind everyone that this event may contain projections and forward-looking statements as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those items. With that I'll turn the call to Dave.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Brad. And good morning, everyone. Before diving into specifics on the quarter, I thought it'd be helpful to take a high level view of our performance to date in 2016.","Entering the year with an uncertain outlook on commodities, our stated focus was clear. First, operate the business within cash flows. Second, continue to improve capital efficiency to enhance returns. And third, increase our flexibility and financial strength by leveraging our portfolio. We're running well ahead of plan for the year, and meeting or exceeding all of these identified goals.","We've delivered another quarter where cash flow exceeded capital expenditures. We raised our full year 2016 volume expectation for a second time this year, providing an additional 10 million barrels of oil equivalent compared to our original expectation. And we have accomplished this with less capital than originally planned, an efficiency story that not many in our industry can match.","We've also reset our underlying cost structure and continued to strengthen our financial position through a series of portfolio optimization transactions. Each of these accomplishments has improved our long term outlook and generated significant value. In terms of what we control in our business I can easily say that we're executing as well as I've seen in my 14-year history with Noble.","Moving into the second quarter results. It was a period of operational records and milestones. To name a few, Noble reported record total company sales volumes, led by our U.S. onshore assets and Israel. Over the last year we've realized a daily volume increase of nearly 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent, while absolute lease operating expense and G&A combined were actually down period over period. As part of the volume increase, 31,000 barrels per day were oil and 32,000 barrels per day were NGLs.","Focusing onshore. In Texas we brought online our best Delaware Basin well yet, along with several great Eagle Ford wells, extending our successes in these assets since we acquired them a year ago. In the DJ Basin we enhanced our asset position through a strategic acreage exchange, adding additional depth of high quality inventory in our core Wells Ranch IDP area. And in the Marcellus, wells continue to outperform expectation, enhancing resource recovery in this leading gas position.","This operational momentum has continued offshore. Recent highlights include in the Gulf of Mexico we commenced production at Gunflint, on time and under budget. In Equatorial Guinea, the Alba compression project has also started up. And in Israel at the beginning of July we entered into an agreement for an initial 3% divestiture of our world class Tamar asset, establishing a gross valuation benchmark of $12.3 billion.","Second quarter volumes totaled 427,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 43% versus the second quarter of last year or 18% on a pro forma basis.","Performance for each business unit and commodity was ahead of expectations. This illustrates the benefits of our portfolio and industry leading execution, continuing to drive differential value among our peer group.","With respect to costs, results were within or below our expectation on essentially every metric. Capital was below the low end of guidance, driven by efficiency gains and the shifting of some onshore wells into the second half of the year. Unit lease operating expense stood out, down 30% from the second quarter of last year.","LOE per barrel equivalent benefited from record total production and deferred work over activity. I cannot overemphasize the strong performance of our Texas assets, where completion optimization and a busy quarter of activity drove substantial growth. Our third Noble designed Delaware Basin completion is showing robust productivity and a higher oil mix. Gary will share more on this well and our plans for the Delaware in a minute.","Everyone seems curious how we and others are thinking about capital allocation for the remainder of the year and into 2017. Our capital allocation discussion never stops. It's a continual process, focused on delivering the best value and returns.","The forward curve on oil has declined versus where it was the time of our last earnings call. And 2017 remains notably below the $50 level. The recent trend reflects resilient global supply and high inventories.","The outlook on gas appears to have improved slightly for 2017, yet it softens quickly in the following years. Significant volatility in both commodities remains. We've not yet seen market fundamentals reach a point where we would consider changing our capital plans for the year. At the same time, our execution and operating performance has increased our inventory and resource potential for when the environment is appropriate to accelerate.","While our total capital for the year remains under $1.5 billion, it has shifted slightly more toward the U.S. onshore unconventional liquid plays, where we have been able to exceed our production goals with fewer completions.","Adding to our flexibility is the expectation that we will now exit this year with about 140 operated drilled uncompleted wells. This represents a decrease of just 10% from the beginning of the year, a higher inventory than previously expected.","As we look forward, our capital will be prioritized on accelerating our Delaware Basin position, developing our DJ and Eagle Ford positions, and post-sanction, implementing our first phase of Leviathan. Our other offshore assets will provide necessary cash to support these activities. The Marcellus program will be driven by the gas price outlook.","With an improved liquidity profile following our asset sale proceeds, we're positioned to begin paying down debt by the end of the year, which will continue to lower Noble's underlying cost structure and further strengthen our balance sheet. Efficient liquidity will be maintained to allow us to increase activity when it makes sense.","We have executed as well as anyone during the volatility over the last 2 years. I am confident that our focused and disciplined strategy is the right approach in this environment. Let me now hand the call over to Gary to walk through our excellent operating performance.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, high levels of operating momentum continued in the second quarter, particularly in the U.S. onshore business. Operating and capital costs have been further reduced. And production from new wells is outperforming historical type curves in every one of our business units.","I want to start off this quarter in Texas, where improvements we've made in both areas in a relatively short period of time highlight the quality of our acreage and the value that Noble Energy can deliver.","I'll start in the Delaware with the Calamity Jane 2101H well. To say this is an exciting well is an understatement, especially when you consider it's only our third completion in the basin. You can see on Slide 5 the location of the well versus the first two Noble completions. The 2101H well is nearly 5,000 feet in lateral length and was completed with 3,000 pounds of proppant per lateral foot and slickwater fluid. In absolute terms, we have a 2,500 barrel of oil equivalent per day well with 1,450 barrels of oil, 560 barrels of natural gas liquids, and over 3 million cubic feet of gas per day.","The chart shows the production compared to our prior two wells and the type curve. The first two wells continue to widen versus the 700,000 barrel equivalent type curve. And this latest well is even better. Versus type curve, this most recent well is more than 75% higher.","From recent industry M&A activity it's clear that the value of the Delaware Basin acreage continues to increase. Two recent transactions specifically in and around our acreage reaffirm to me that we have a very enviable 45,000-acre position in the basin. Being early into the play obviously generated a tremendous amount of value.","We'll have a rig operating in the Delaware almost continuously through the remainder of the year, with several new drills and wells coming on production. Long-term development planning is under way. And our focus will be on delivering substantial well cost efficiencies by utilizing multi-well pad design and longer laterals. And we will also delineate multiple Wolfcamp zones in the Third Bone Spring across our acreage. In addition, we are working to design a centralized infrastructure, which will support our long term plans.","We also announced extremely strong results in the Eagle Ford this morning, specifically in the Gates Ranch area. Slightly more than half of the announced wells had 500-foot lateral spacing, with the remainder completed at 1,000-foot lateral spacing or more. And I want to emphasize a couple of takeaways from these results, which are shown on slide 6.","First, results continue to demonstrate the benefits of higher intensity fracs, specifically more proppant with tighter cluster and stage spacing. A great example of this is the two wells which commenced production in the north Gates Ranch area during the quarter. These wells are performing above the 3 million barrel equivalent type curves that we used for Southern Gates Ranch, or three times our prior assumption for North Gates Ranch. This follows similar significantly improved results in Briscoe Ranch, which we talked about last quarter.","Second, we are gathering additional production history on lateral spacing, which will increase our drilling inventory going forward. With the 500-foot spaced wells performing in line with the 3 million barrel equivalent type curve, we believe that South Gates Ranch area will support at least 750-foot spacing, as we move into drilling and completing the fourth row of South Gates Ranch during 2017.","In addition to our Delaware rig activity, we have a rig coming into the Eagle Ford for the remainder of the year and have ongoing completion activity as well. Our Eagle Ford volumes will be lower in the third quarter, reflecting shut in impacts for offsetting frac activity. Several new wells are expected to come online toward the end of the third quarter, giving us strong momentum exiting the year and into 2017. This will include wells in the Briscoe Ranch area, one of which will be an Upper Eagle Ford test.","Moving to the DJ Basin. The dominant theme continues to be transformative capital efficiencies from drill time reductions and cost savings, as well as performance improvements from enhanced completions. As we indicated on the first quarter call, our central processing facility underwent its first planned turnaround since starting up 3 years ago. As a result, the only wells which were brought online during the quarter were in May or June, and thus did not have a full quarter impact. The basin also experienced unplanned third-party facility downtime during the quarter.","Once again we reduced normalized extended reach lateral well costs. We are now down to $2.6 million in Wells Ranch, which represents a sequential quarterly decrease of another 4%. This includes the cost efficiencies of monobore drilling, which accounted for nearly all of our drilling activity during the second quarter, as well as the increased costs of higher sand concentrations and tighter stages.","On the completion design front the change to slickwater fluid as well as increasing proppant loading continues. And I'll turn your attention to Slide 8, which provides more detail.","Cumulative production charts on the right show the actual averages for these new completion designs with 1,000 pounds of proppant or more, compared to historical types curve. As you can see, performance in Wells Ranch is at least 15% higher than historical type curve. And East Pony has improved by more than 35%. With continued strong performance improvement, I'm excited about the potential impact of a higher percentage of these well designs coming online the remainder of the year.","The new 10-well Moser pad and the Mustang IDP includes our first seven wells testing enhanced completions outside of Wells Ranch and East Pony. These wells came online at the end of the quarter and are significantly outperforming expectations, which speaks very positively for the future potential of our Mustang IDP development.","During the quarter we continued to optimize our large DJ Basin acreage position. We completed the first closing of the previously announced sale of approximately 33,000 net acres from our Greeley Crescent area. This acreage was not in our development plans for many years. We received $486 million in proceeds, with a remaining $19 million expected around the end of the year.","In addition, we completed a strategic acreage trade with PDC Energy, which expands our Wells Ranch position by approximately 20% and provides substantial operating synergies and cost efficiencies for both companies.","Both transactions are consistent with our strategy to focus on areas with higher oil content, where we have more contiguous acreage and to drive efficiency gains through long lateral development and existing infrastructure.","As part of our focus on improving total value in the DJ Basin, we have been deferring workovers and repairs, especially for legacy vertical wells when those expenditures just don't make sense in this price environment. As a result of these economic choices, vertical production is expected to be impacted by up to 5,000 barrels equivalent per day during the second half of 2016.","Moving on to the Marcellus. Production remains above expectations, despite the limited capital spent. In addition, the JV continues to benefit from shared infrastructure to optimize recycling of produced water, significantly reducing our operating expenses.","Recent pads in both the wet and dry gas areas continue to highlight the prolific nature of our position in the play, as depicted on Slide 9. We remain aligned with our partner to operate the JV within cash flow in 2016 and will continue to be flexible with activity for the remainder of the year. At current commodity prices we expect six additional wells to be completed between now and year end. The continued outstanding performance of the Marcellus wells has driven the growth seen by CONE, the midstream gathering company partially owned by Noble.","Offshore in the Gulf of Mexico we continued to see strong production from the Big Bend and Dantzler fields during the quarter. This is despite a temporary shut-in of the Thunder Hawk facility in late June, due to issues at a downstream third-party gas processing plant.","In July we brought online our Gunflint development, on time and under budget. This is the third Middle Miocene tieback to commence production in the last 12 months, contributing to the almost doubling of our Gulf of Mexico volumes this year.","The net amount from Gunflint to Noble Energy is expected to be at least 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with potential for additional volumes, dependent upon available capacity at the third-party host facility. The two wells are currently ramping up as expected.","Sales volumes in West Africa were up from the first quarter, which had downtime from the installation of the new Alba B3 compression platform. Startup of this Marathon operated project, which will enhance full field recovery, occurred in July. While Noble's quarterly sales volumes will fluctuate a bit quarter to quarter based on the lifting schedule, we would expect total West Africa production to remain relatively level for the remainder of the year.","Our Gulf of Mexico and West Africa assets don't often get the attention from the equity markets that they deserve. The company's major project execution capabilities were highlighted again recently with the successes at Gunflint and Alba. And these capabilities continue to deliver substantial value for Noble Energy. Looking forward, near term capital needs in both are relatively low. And the assets remain significant cash flow generators.","In Israel, natural gas volumes from Tamar were up nearly 30% from the same period last year and even higher than the first quarter of this year.","The Israeli government has mandated a reduction of coal fired power generation by 15% year over year as shown on Slide 11. This reflects the government's recognition of the economic and environmental benefits of natural gas, and their confidence in the timing of the Leviathan development.","This new underlying base load demand is showing up in big numbers, particularly in the shoulder periods, when additional quantities of gas have historically been available. As a result, coal power dispatched during the second quarter was down over 20% versus the second quarter of last year.","We are now into the high demand third quarter period, when Israel will need even more gas. We've also announced plans to commence drilling another well at Tamar later this year, which will reinforce reliability and help meet peak demand going forward.","At Leviathan we are continuing to target a final investment decision around year end. We've now contracted up to 100 million cubic feet per day of natural gas to Israeli customers. And continue to advance negotiations with additional domestic and regional customers.","The regulatory progress we have seen over the last quarter is also significant, including the government's approval of the fixed platform plan of development. FEED work is under way, and early indications are that this continues to be a great opportunity to lock in very competitive costs for this long life resource project.","Over the coming months we expect to finalize remaining key milestones for sanction. This includes additional sales contracts, both in Israel and for the export market and financing plans, as well as completion of the engineering work and project cost estimates. Now I'll turn the call back over to Dave.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Gary. We provided a full update to our 2016 guidance on Slide 14. As I mentioned earlier, we've now raised full year sales volumes to 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up more than 7% from our original guidance on a divestment adjusted basis, while reducing our original full year capital expenditure guidance.","Not many companies will grow production at that rate, while enhancing their financial position and without diluting shareholders. This is a testament to our high quality portfolio and the underlying execution in our business, delivered by our talented and dedicated workforce.","For the third quarter capital is expected to range between $400 million and $450 million, with 80% going to the U.S. onshore business. Sales volumes are anticipated to range between 405,000 and 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","The primary difference from the second quarter is our Eagle Ford volumes, due to well shut-ins for offset completions. In our other onshore areas, Marcellus will likely be up in the third quarter and DJ is expected to be down, reflecting lower vertical production as Gary mentioned. Offshore volumes should be relatively flat for the second (sic) [third] (22:07) quarter with Israel up and West Africa lower due to timing of liftings.","The third quarter outlook also includes the impact of about 2,000 barrel equivalent per day from the Badoin (22:19) sale in Montana and the initial closing of the Greeley Crescent divestiture. The production impact from asset sales grows to around 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the fourth quarter, with the second Greeley Crescent closing and the Tamar sell-down already announced. These asset divestitures accelerate and highlight the value in our portfolio.","There's a lot to look forward to in the second half of 2016. We have continuous operations ongoing in both the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basins, including a doubling of new wells in the Delaware compared to the first half of the year.","We will also continue to advance the enhanced completion designs in the DJ Basin and leverage our Midstream competitive advantage. And in Israel, we expect to see higher utilization of our Tamar asset, while at the same time, progressing Leviathan toward final investment decision.","When you put it all together, this is a great company with a great future. The high quality and deep inventory of our U.S. onshore portfolio can deliver high return growth for many years. This is complemented by the visible and prolific long term growth and value potential of the Eastern Med assets. In addition, the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa assets provide meaningful and long term cash generation.","Portfolio, execution, and financial capacity, these are our competitive advantages and our strong foundation to build upon. At this time, Jake, we'll go ahead and open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll pause for just a moment to assemble the roster. And we'll now hear first from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Look, very strong well performance in the acquired southern Delaware acreage. Any color on the returns uplift and incremental well cost for these enhanced completions? And is that the completion design you expect to be using in the second half of 2016? And somewhat related, I know you're also drilling longer laterals in the second half, what color or \u2013 any color on the percentage of your acreage position amenable to longer laterals there?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll have Gary jump into more of the details. But I'll reiterate your observation first, that the performance has been outstanding, whether you're looking at the Delaware Basin or the Eagle Ford. But let me have Gary go ahead and expand on that.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah, Evan, I mean clearly we've been very happy with the results we've seen after only the first three wells. I think for the plans of the rest of the year, lateral length may get a little bit longer for the second half of this year. And then we'll really start to see longer laterals lengths, probably beginning more in 2017.","We're continuing to test different completion designs, so we're not quite in that full development mode yet that you would expect to see and start to see significant savings on the D&C side. That'll probably come more in 2017, as we get into full development mode as well.","For the rest of this year we're going to be testing different designs though. This latest well with 3,000 pounds per foot, we'll actually go back and test some lower sand concentrations on these next couple of wells, just as we zero in on what the best value case is. I think for us, we're always trying to look at what's the most value creating completion that we can design.","It's not about IP30, although clearly we're very happy with this being our best IP30 well to date and one of the best we've seen anywhere in the basin. It's certainly not about IP24. And it's not about EUR over the long term. It's about how much value we can create.","So we'll test some smaller sand concentration designs as well, as we zero in on that best value. And we'll have another half dozen or so wells by the time we get to the end of the year to help inform what our plans are for next year.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think, Evan, the other thing that's important to note there too, as we had set up the year, we're now moving into that part of the year where we're having them \u2013 we're setting up ourselves up for a more consistent operation in both the Delaware and the Eagle Ford. We're going to have a rig running in both areas now. I think that will help accelerate even some of this learning curve as we go forward.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I mean is there \u2013 do you have a cost that you can share on the Calamity Jane? I know that the results were fantastic. I was just curious what the incremental CWCs are there? And then and just I don't know if you \u2013 it's too early, but your acreage looked very contiguous, and that's kind of why the question was, how much may be amenable to a longer lateral, when that becomes part of the development program in the future?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah. As we move more to pad drilling you'll definitely see longer laterals, just like you've seen us do in the Wells Ranch and East Pony.","I think on the cost side, again it's only the third well. I think it's probably fair to keep using an assumption that we've rolled out in the past for these wells. And as we move into more of a development plan, we'll see potentially some cost savings from there.","Again a large part of it depends on what completion design we end up with. I mean if we end up with 3,000 pounds per foot across the board, then that's going to add several hundred thousand dollars to the completion of each well. So we'll continue to test and figure out what the most value adding completion design is, and as we move into development mode next year, we'll really start to see those cost efficiencies.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Good job, guys.","Operator","We'll now move to a question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","With Leviathan potentially getting sanctioned and the interest that you described in expanding your activity in the Permian, DJ, and Eagle Ford, the potential for higher gas prices to increase interest by your Marcellus partner in increasing drilling activity, can you just talk to your interest level and extent about spending cash flow in 2017? And how you would time the level of activity based on front month and strip oil prices?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think as all of us are doing now, we're starting to look at our plans for 2017. And there's still probably a lot of volatility as to what kind of commodity price expectations you're looking at.","I think when you look at our capital program for 2017, obviously the capital in the Eastern Med will be driven by the timing of a Leviathan sanction. And as we've talked about, we're well set up and especially now also with some of the sell down of the Tamar interest to be able to fund that from kind of that ring fence strategy over there.","As we look at the U.S., the Eagle Ford has been great returns. The Delaware performance highlights what the returns in that area can be. And the DJ has been strong returns. So then you're looking at in the Marcellus, I think we're still in the mode of continuing to manage to cash flow and working with our partner in that element. What we've said there is as gas price continues to increase, it provides more cash to continue to be able to spend in that arena.","So I think when you put it all together, Brian, we're really going to have to continue to watch and stay flexible on how we allocate capital based on water outlook on both oil and gas commodities. The good part is we have a lot of flexibility, because we got very little what you'd call non-discretionary capital next year. I'd say it's all pretty much discretionary.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks. And then the follow-up is on the operating costs. You've shown pretty low op costs here on the LOE side for the last few quarters. And I wondered if you can speak to, if we do go into a higher commodity environment here, the sustainability of these cost declines on the operating side? And then if you see room for any further efficiencies?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well I think a lot of it is sustainable. I think when you think about operating costs, a lot of it is driven by people cost and the electricity cost. So those are going to be the two moving factors on that.","I think what you're seeing as we continue to get more and more efficient, the cost will continue to be beneficial going forward. I think you're seeing that. Look at what we're doing now. We're handling about 33% more volume right now at the same LOE and G&A cost that we did prior to that. So I mean that's pretty much a testament to the ability to continue to manage that.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And now we'll hear from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Dave, and to the rest of your team there.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","I'd like to dig a bit deeper on your U.S. oil volumes in Q2. There was a decline of about 6,000 barrels a day from 1Q. And I know you've gone into some detail on some of the things in the DJ Basin that contributed to that.","But I'm wondering if you could add any other context to what contributes to that sequential drop? And if that's the kind of thing where 2Q is what we should be thinking about as a level for the back half of the year, whether there's going to be some rebound on U.S. oil volumes, as if those issues are more transient?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think on oil volumes, in reality, they were right in line with what we had expected on that. We had expected and some of the DJ piece to come down a little bit from first to second quarter, just based on the activity levels, quarterly activity levels. I think in the Gulf of Mexico they were down a little bit in the second quarter also from first quarter with some of the downtime that Gary mentioned on some of the onshore facilities.","I think when you look at it going forward, it's going to move around some quarter by quarter, just from the liftings in West Africa. And as you know, Charles, we've seen that before.","But as far as the outlook on oil volumes, U.S. or total, I mean it's on track with what we've been expecting. I think when you look at the third quarter too, and a little bit in the fourth quarter, you got to not forget that we have to build in a little bit of assumption on some downtime in the Gulf of Mexico for both storms and potentially some of this onshore facility impact. So you have a little bit of that.","But you have \u2013 quarterly you have volumes moving around a good bit. For example, third quarter the West Africa volumes, oil volumes will be under lifted.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Right.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But when we look at the projection going forward, we've taken a pretty hard look even at the horizontal volumes in the DJ, for example. It's pretty consistent on oil percentage going forward. So that's why I say it's tracking pretty well with what we expected.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","No, that's helpful detail, Dave. And then if I could ask a question that perhaps dovetails on those, again the really remarkably good results you had in the Delaware Basin. The thing that stands out there is the 3,000 pounds of sand a foot. And I know it's a different basin from the DJ. But it's just the contrast is there with these recent completions you have with the DJ being 1,000 pounds of sand a foot. And is there more room in the DJ to increase those sand concentrations? Or do you think you kind of zeroed in on it? And it's \u2013 and you're at the right spot that's dictated by just the reservoir conditions and the rock properties?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think you're picking up on a good theme there, Charles. I think whichever, whether it's Eagle Ford, whether it's Delaware, or whether it's the DJ, we're seeing continued performance improvements as we continue to work on optimizing these completions.","And to my feeling, we're not at the end of that game yet. I think Gary will expand on that a little bit. We've actually seen some increased concentrations in the DJ. And he can talk a little more to how he's thinking about those from each of the different areas.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah. Charles, I mean I think when we've talked about enhanced completions in the DJ, we've said 1,000 pounds or more. And historical designs in the DJ were in the 700- to 800-pound per foot range. So 1,000 pounds or more is 50% more to twice as much as we've historically used.","I'll tell you that we've tested some that are quite a bit more than 1,000 pounds, more in line with some of the types of designs that we've been using down in Texas. So to Dave's point it's a transition that we're making to test some higher proppant loading designs there as well. And certainly if we see a similar uplift there that we've seen in some of the areas in Texas, it could be very encouraging for those volumes going forward.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But I think part of what you're seeing too, is the ability to transfer our learnings from each area to the other. And then tailor them specific for the area. And we're seeing the big benefit of having multiple areas to continue to work on here.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","It seems that way. Thanks a lot, Dave and Gary.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Charles.","Operator","And now we'll move to a question from Scott Hanold with RBC.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, thanks. I have a question on adding the rig in Texas. So you're going to have one in both the southern Delaware as well as the Eagle Ford. How much room have you guys found in your budget due to cost savings and efficiencies? And how much more could there be over the next say 6 months to 12 months?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think we've seen the benefit of that when you look at just what we're delivering now versus what we're spending. When we went into the year, we talked about spending $1.5 billion for \u2013 what \u2013 390,000 barrels equivalent per day for the year. Now we're spending what looks like, if you just project out what we've laid out for guidance for third and fourth quarter, under $1.5 billion and delivering 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the year. So we're seeing that benefit.","You're seeing that's allowing us to do a little more even here in the second half of the year, which shows in some of the activity, both in some of the capital activity, what we talked about, the allocation of 80% of our capital here, this second half here going into the onshore business. Or close to that. But I don't \u2013 Gary, any other thoughts on that efficiency and how it's playing out?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","No, I mean I think just similar to my earlier comments, it's very early days in Texas. We are picking up rigs in both places and moving into a development mode more in 2017 in the Delaware especially. So I would expect to see similar cost efficiencies and improvements in the Delaware over time, similar to what we've seen in the DJ.","And it's a bit surprising to me how we continue to still see improvements in the DJ to the magnitude we are. Another 4% just in one quarter is a pretty significant number, given how far we've already come. So I think we'll continue to see small gains in the DJ going forward. And probably some pretty significant gains in the Delaware as we move to that development mode of operating.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But those efficiency gains, they're playing out on the cost side. But we're seeing it play out, as some of the callers have referenced, just on the resource potential and the performance per well. And that's just adding inventory to us.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And you all have highlighted development in the southern Delaware in 2017. What do you envision that looks like? Is it pad drilling? How many wells do you set up on a pad? What zones do you figure you're going to target in? Would that be more than one rig? Would that say be maybe two or possibly three rigs?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah. I mean it could definitely be more than one rig. We're still working through plans for 2017 budget right now. But I think when you think, whether it's 2017 or 2018, kind of near to medium term for the Delaware Basin, you need to think about it very similar to what we've done in the DJ and Wells Ranch and East Pony, where we start building centralized infrastructure, where we can take advantage of those scale and efficiencies. We start building or drilling more multi-well pads, longer laterals, and we see a lot of those same efficiencies show up in the Delaware that we've seen in the DJ Basin.","So we'll continue to work the budget here for the next few months and talk about that when it's the right time. But I think we'll certainly see more activity in the Delaware next year than we've seen this year.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks.","Operator","And now we'll hear from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","David Lorenzo Fernandez - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hello. This is David Fernandez filling in for Ryan Todd. Just first a question on the asset sale front. Just if you could remind us what the update is on the Tamar divestiture? And kind of like the timeline associated with that? And any thoughts around a potential IPO of the Midstream assets?","And as a follow-on \u2013 I guess not as a follow-on, but as a follow-up question. Any insight or color around the performance at the Mustang IDP enhanced completions would be appreciated. Thank you.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Let me start on Tamar. We put the announcement out on Tamar, where we reached agreement to sell 3%. And I think that's a great marker, that's a good marker for the asset. I think as far as the timing, I would expect the timing of that to close by the fourth quarter. So definitely before year end. And we'll just \u2013 we'll obviously announce that as it happens.","I think on the Midstream IPO, that'll be \u2013 we've kept the S-1 alive, so we've kept that available as to enter the market when the market conditions kind of dictate that. So we'll \u2013 that's about all I can say on that at this point. But that's something we're keeping alive.","I think on Mustang, that's an area, it's probably our next IDP area. Gary can mention a little bit on that. But I think just the initial results, very encouraging there.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah, David, I think very happy with the first results. It's, like we said, a 10-well pad, seven of which tested enhanced completions. It's one part of the IDP, obviously with it only being one pad. So but very, very encouraged with what we've seen so far. It's only coming on right at the end of 2Q, so a bit early to start putting numbers out there.","But I think when you look at how much the enhanced completions have improved, the performance of the wells in Wells Ranch and East Pony, and again that's on one of the slides in the pack. And you can see how much uplift we're getting from that. You can see why we're excited from similar level of improvement in Mustang with just the first pad there.","David Lorenzo Fernandez - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And now we'll take a question from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Perhaps, Gary, I was wondering if you could maybe help us understand a little bit about some of the trends, production trends you're seeing in the DJ Basin. I guess I was wondering, you had the turnaround in Q2 plus some unplanned downtime. But you did indicate that you'll have less workover activity for verticals. I was wondering if you could help us think about how the DJ may progress on a sequential basis for the balance of the year?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah. No. I mean I think we've said for quite some time that in the DJ Basin it takes three to four rigs to keep production flat. We've been running two obviously for a while now. Balancing part of that is clearly the fact that we've seen better results from these enhanced completions.","I think in 2Q you had the issues that you mentioned, the turnaround at the Wells Ranch Central Processing Facility, as well as some third party gas plant downtime that impacted volumes. As we mentioned and you reiterated there, we've also held back on some workovers and repairs, especially on vertical wells that just don't make sense in this price environment. So those have impacted vertical volumes.","I think when you look at our level of activity going forward with the type of performance we're seeing on these enhanced completions, even with two rigs we're probably flat on horizontal production through the end of the year. Vertical will decline a bit. So overall you'll be declining through the end of the year, as we've kind of suggested in the past. But the horizontal program is holding in there quite nicely with just two rigs.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think to that point, Arun, and it's worth emphasizing. And Gary mentioned it. Is we're actually on the horizontal program doing as well or better with the amount of capital that we're spending than we would have laid out before.","What's masking it a little bit is some of these decisions, which are the right economic decisions. And the fact that everybody is looking at everything as a business decision on some of these vertical wells. And some of that production can be brought back at a later time in the right price environment. But now is not the right price environment to be trying to maximize the vertical production up there.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And that makes a ton of sense. Thanks for clarifying that. And just, Gary, one of your peers has highlighted in pretty close proximity to you guys some optimism about the Third Bone Spring interval in the southern Delaware. Any plans to test that over the next call it 6 months to 12 months?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","We've got plans to test it. We've got one Third Bone Spring well that we'll spud around the end of this year. We won't have any completions on this year, but we will spud one towards the end of the year.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","I think with everything we've seen from offset operators and our own mappings, we believe that the majority of our acreage we would consider probably Tier 1 prospective for the Third Bone Spring.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And now we'll hear from Irene Haas with Wunderlich.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Yeah. So congratulations on all the good work you've done in Texas in specific. And I'm curious as to on Wolfcamp A, how many zones have you decided to tackle? Would you consider Wolfcamp B? And importantly, at which point \u2013 how much time would we need to really get some clarity on interval spacing and sort of completion design too for you to sort of update your drilling inventory in the Delaware Basin?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah. I think everything we've done so far is Wolfcamp A and really the upper part of the Wolfcamp A. As we get into the latter part of this year, as I mentioned, we'll test the Bone Spring. We'll test a Lower Wolfcamp \u2013 or we'll spud a Lower Wolfcamp A. It probably won't be on this year. So we'll continue to delineate through that vertical section.","I think it's probably a bit early to zero in too much on how many wells or what spacing we think we'll ultimately end up at, given that we've only brought our third Noble operated well on so far. I think it's a pretty wide range we're looking at right now, when you consider all the way from the Third Bone Spring through the Upper A, the Lower A and maybe even into the B. It could be as many as 15 to 25 wells. I know that's a wide range. But give us a bit more time than three completions, and we'll narrow that going forward.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","May I have one follow-up question? How much money did you save from using a slickwater versus hybrid in Delaware Basin?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","The Delaware Basin, I don't know the exact number, Irene. I mean what we've seen in the DJ Basin with those fracs is it's $300,000 to $400,000 savings from slickwater. It's probably on the same order of magnitude in the Delaware.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And now we'll take a question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","David, I wonder if I could ask you about the type curve trajectory you see in the Delaware Basin? I mean clearly it's early days. But when you look at the offset operators and obviously the myriad of industry data out there, what do you guys need to see before you revisit what is clearly looking increasingly like a kind of stale assumption at this point?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think Gary touched on it. We just need to get more wells on production. And we need to get more time and history on the wells we have on production, some more extended production periods. Not only ours, but even the offset operators, even some of the more recent wells there that have been highly encouraging.","We're not going to rush to revise the type curve and then have to rush to revise it again. We'll get a little longer extended production period both for ours and offset operators. And watch them both and then get some more wells online.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","And...","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess what's behind my question \u2013 okay, go ahead, Gary. Sorry.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","No, I was going to say, I think what's encouraging for me, Doug, is again, even though it's only three wells, it's three wells that are spaced across the acreage and all are above the type curve, which is obviously intended to be an average of the acreage.","So I think we'll continue to see improvement in the completion designs there. And once we get a few more than three under our belt, we can talk about what that 700,000 [barrel equivalent] goes to.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. I realize it's very early days. I guess what was at the back of my mind was, when you think about incremental rig adds, obviously the type curve economics that you currently have, as your current well, if you like, has very different implications as to whether you would add in the Delaware versus the Eagle Ford. That's really what I was kind of getting at.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. And to the same extent, we're looking at that same opportunity in both, where they're both well outperforming the type curve. So we have to take that into account as we look at setting our plans for next year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks.","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah. I mean in the Delaware, where you look at a well in the Delaware that's 75% above the type curve in the early days, obviously huge impact on the economics of that. But as Dave points out, we're seeing very nice improvements in the economics in the Eagle Ford too, which were already very robust.","And when you look at the 500-foot spaced wells that are in line or above with the 3 million barrel type curve that was based on spacing twice as wide as that. When you look at Northern Gates Ranch, where we're above a 3 million barrel type curve, which is three times what we assumed when we did the acquisition. And when you look at Briscoe Ranch, where we're significantly above the type curve that we assumed at the type time of the acquisition, and we haven't even brought those enhanced style completions to all the areas yet. I think there's tremendous upside potential in both of these areas that'll be very economic even in this price environment.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A nice problem to have, fellas. Dave, my follow-up is maybe a little bit of a standard question nowadays. But with the signature deadline coming up on the 8th of August, I'm just wondering if you could share your latest thoughts on the Colorado setback rule? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well yeah. I think extremely glad we put the work in that we have over the last couple years. I think we're doing the things we need to do. And I'm comfortable we're doing the right things to stay out in front of this.","We've stayed focused on \u2013 engaged on being out in front of and defeating any potential ballots, if they get enough signatures. And we'll wait and see where that \u2013 how that plays out. But either way, we're staying out in front of this.","The nice part is we've built a strong coalition in the business community up there. You've got landowners, farmers, home builders that all are affected by this, and greatly affected if something like that went through. So they're out in front of this also and working hard on this.","I think the government's been supportive of what we're doing and very engaged in this effort.","So the other part of it is the public education has worked. I mean you can see that from the polling. You can see that from the results. The increased support, awareness and understanding. So again I'll go back to where I started with, we're doing the right things, and we're in the right position to stay in front of this.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the answers, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor Pickering Holt Company.","Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","In the Delaware can you comment more on what forthcoming drilling completions activity will be focused on this year? You mentioned the Wolfcamp zones and the Third Bone [Spring]. Is that the primary focus? Or could we expect some sort of aerial delineation as well?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","No. I mean as I said it'll be \u2013 we'll test \u2013 drill a Third Bone Spring and probably a Lower Wolfcamp A later this year. A half dozen or so additional completions that we'll bring on production this year, I think are all Wolfcamp A Upper. And as far as aerial testing, they're all probably in that east to central part of the acreage block for the rest of the year.","Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And then one on guidance. Just kind of going back to the ongoing outperformance across your U.S. oily onshore (52:50). Anything baked in on that front at this point? Or is it all still based on existing curves, the 700,000 [barrel equivalent] in the Delaware and so forth.","And similarly regarding Israel, is there anything being factored in for the potential for continued coal to gas switching? And again just with respect to kind of the full year and updated Q3 guidance numbers here?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","Yeah. I mean I'd say both of those we've baked in some of what we're seeing. But given the early days on both of those, we've probably been a bit conservative in the guidance.","Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thanks for the detail.","Operator","David Beard with Coker & Palmer has the next question.","David Earl Beard - Coker & Palmer, Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for squeezing me in here. My question is a little bit macro-related in trying to better understand how you circle in on your budget for next year. And maybe even specifically if you look at strip, would you plan on spending at cash flow or above or below? How should we think about your process there? Thank you.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I think as I mentioned earlier, we're working through that process now. And obviously you're seeing a lot of volatility on the pricing still, when you see even 2017 outlook for prices continue to change.","But we'll \u2013 the benefit we have is we've generated excess cash this year. And as we look at that, and as we look to next year, we'll look at our cash flow projection and what other opportunities we have to support cash flow next year on various things.","So we'll look at the whole picture of things in setting the budget. And focus our capital activity on what we need to do to support the Leviathan development, based on wherever it is. And most of the rest of it will start with our onshore activity and how we allocate between the different plays, based on the things we've talked about this morning.","David Earl Beard - Coker & Palmer, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","And next we'll move to Gail Nicholson with KLR Group.","Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC","Good morning. In the presentation here you talked about how the larger, the bigger jobs in the DJ lead to longer cycle times and clean-up periods. So I was wondering if can you quantify that versus the old standard completion, versus the new enhanced completion?","Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations","It all depends, Gail, on how long the laterals are and how many wells there are on the pad. So it's hard to give you kind of an average number. What I will say is it did push some completions from 2Q into 3Q. We're addressing some of that by bringing a third frac crew out to help bring some more wells on before we get to year end.","But it's going to vary quite a bit based on how long the laterals are and how many wells that are on a pad. And it goes to really more how many stages or what the cluster spacing is, the stage spacing is on the wells probably even more than the sand concentration.","Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC","Okay, great. And then you also mentioned as you progress through the year a potential debt reduction as you get towards year end. When you look at that debt reduction, is there an internal target of absolute? Or is it more kind of a level of net debt to EBITDA that you'd like to be at? And then is there any thoughts about taking the cash that was generated and returning it back to shareholders in a potential increase in the dividend?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I think when you look at the debt piece, we look at a number of different factors. And we haven't set a specific number. The nice part about that is with how we've continued to build liquidity somewhat this year, it doesn't become an either\/or discussion from debt versus investment in the business.","I think we'll have the ability to pay down some debt by the end of the year. And at the same time not reduce our capacity and maintain our capacity to be opportunistic, whether for accelerating opportunities in the portfolio as the environment dictates or other new opportunities. So the nice part about it is we've maintained the capacity to look at all those spectrums.","Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","We have time for one more question. That will come from Jon Wolff with Jefferies.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Morning, guys.","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Jon.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","A question around Delaware. The area you're in is obviously sizzling hot. I guess you're moving kind of as fast as you can practically. But do you spend a lot of time thinking about the potential for missed opportunities around acreage grab, given the level of activity there? And if \u2013 understanding that the DJ is better now, is there a way to go faster in the Delaware? Is that even a choice? Or is it constrained by something?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I think we've been following the plan we laid out for the year. As we continue to learn, we'll continue to adjust, especially as we're looking into next year.","But as Gary said, the performance has been better than we would have even expected. And the nice part about it is, it's been across the spectrum of the acreage.","I think when you look at other opportunities, yeah, we're looking at the other opportunities. If the right opportunity for the right price comes around, we'll move on it. But in the meantime we've got 1,200 locations on our position that we're focused on now.","And to your point, to the extent and how we manage that and how we set up that program is important. As Gary mentioned, we've kind of modeled this a little bit after some of the DJ portion, where we can use an IDP concept. We put the facilities in. And we make sure we're optimizing the value, not just the value for this year, but the value for the whole play.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Great, I guess to add onto that, do you feel like you're at any disadvantage in terms of knowledge? Are you capable of bidding on adjacent acreage? Do you have the knowledge base as yet?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'd say we're definitely not at any disadvantage. I think from what I've seen and our ability to execute and our ability to take advantage of the learnings and take advantage of the learnings quick, we're in a great position.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","That's helpful. Last one, Gulf of Mexico, Dantzler, Big Bend, update on how they're performing? And then Gunflint seemed to have come on about exactly where you thought \u2013 the timing you thought it would. And then obviously fields do decline, so any exploration plans?","David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think on the three projects, to your point, we brought on three major projects over the last year on time. Performance has been as expected or better and on cost. So again that's a testament to our major project execution that's shown up here very visibly in the Gulf of Mexico over the last year.","I think, no. As we look forward here, I would expect some decline now that we've had Dantzler and Big Bend on for about a year. That's in line with what we've said originally. Gunflint, we'll see to what extent it ramps up after we get it ramped up. And as I mentioned before, we've built in some downtime expectations from some of that onshore facility coming back online or some of its downtime and some storm downtime here near term. So everything is performing as expected out there. At least as well as expected.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Great. Okay. Thanks, Dave.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Brad Whitmarsh for any closing remarks.","Brad Whitmarsh - Director-Investor Relations","Yeah, thanks all for joining us today on the call, as well as your interest in Noble. Now Megan [Repine] and I are available for calls all day today. Appreciate your time.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Please go ahead.","David R. Larson","Thanks, Camille. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Noble Energy's Fourth Quarter and Year End 2012 Earnings Call and Webcast. On the call today, we have Chuck Davidson, Chairman and CEO; Dave Stover, President and COO; and Ken Fisher, CFO.","Earlier this morning, we issued our earnings release for the fourth quarter and hopefully, you all have had a chance to review our results. A few supplemental slides were also posted on our website. You'll want to download the slides, if you have not already done so, as we will be referencing them in today's discussion. Later today, we expect to be filing our 10-K with the SEC, and it will also be available on our website.","The agenda for today will begin with Chuck discussing the final quarter of 2012 and make some comments on '13. Dave will then give you a detailed overview of our operations programs, including a summary of our 2012 reserves and a breakdown of our activity levels for the upcoming year. We'll leave time for Q&A at the end and plan to wrap up the call in less than an hour. We would ask that participants limit themselves to one primary question and one follow-up. Should you have questions that we don't get to this morning, please don't hesitate to call, and we'll do our best to answer them.","I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call does contain projections and forward-looking statements based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. We provide no assurances on these statements as a number of factors and uncertainties could cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from what we discuss here. You should read our full disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest news releases and SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that influence our business.","We'll reference certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted net income or discretionary cash flow in the call today. When we refer to these items, it's because we believe they are good metrics to use in evaluating our performance. Be sure to see the reconciliations in our earnings release tables.","With that, let me turn the call over to Chuck.","Charles D. Davidson","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. I'm going to start out with a quick review of 2012, including the fourth quarter results and make some comments on our plans for 2013 and how I see things shaping up. Dave is going to finish with a walk-through of our global operations.","We completed a great quarter, and we're really excited about 2013. Some of you listening to this call attended our analyst conference back in December, where we presented a comprehensive review of our business and our growth expectations going over the next 5 years. The presentation material and the webcast recordings of the conference were made available on our website for those who want to review it.","We also released at that time our 2013 capital program outlining our spending and guidance for the year. I believe we presented a very exciting future for our company, a future that includes very strong value-creating growth.","The story of our future really starts with the great accomplishments we had in 2012. And as just a few examples over the course of the past year, we've dramatically grown the scale of our onshore resource plays in the Niobrara and the Marcellus. We've accelerated the pace of the Niobrara to a level that we could not have envisioned just a year ago, with production from our horizontal wells at the end of the year far exceeding our original targets.","But 2012 was not just about our unconventional plays. Our major projects in the Gulf and in international hit major milestones with the startup of Galapagos in the Gulf, Tamar on track for startup in April and Alen on pace for an earlier-than-expected startup in the third quarter of this year.","We also announced a strategic partnership in Israel, discoveries in Israel, in the Gulf and new exploration opportunities in Nevada, the Falklands and Sierra Leone and a successful divestiture of non-core assets with proceeds totaling over $1 billion.","Our sales volumes grew 11% over 2011. We project an even higher rate of growth of 20% this year after adjusting for divestitures. And finally, we issued our first Sustainability Report, an area that's becoming increasingly important to investors. At Noble, we're not only proud of our financial and operational results but also we're proud of how we carry out our business. These strong results have us well positioned to extend our success into 2013 and beyond.","So let's go to the fourth quarter. As I said, it was a strong quarter, so let me get to the numbers. Adjusted net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $296 million, or $1.65 per share diluted. Excluded from the adjusted net income were unrealized gains from commodity hedges and an asset impairment associated with Mari-B offshore Israel. Mari-B has been an outstanding field that is rapidly approaching the end of its production life, although it could have an important role going forward as a gas storage reservoir. Our focus right now is to squeeze as much gas as we can out of these depleting existing reservoirs to bridge the gap until Tamar comes online in just a few months.","Revenues were $1.2 billion for the quarter, up 30% from the fourth quarter last year, with revenue from crude and condensate increasing 52%. Our sales volumes for the quarter were 255,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 5% increase over the third quarter and a 14% increase over the fourth quarter of 2011. This number does not include 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day associated with our discontinued operations.","Sales of crude and condensate represented 98,000 barrels per day, or 38% of total sales. The overall volume growth was almost entirely due to increased crude oil sales, which, as I mentioned earlier, were up 17% over last quarter and up over 50% over the fourth quarter of 2011. The growth in crude oil was from the DJ Basin, Gulf of Mexico and West Africa.","Natural gas volumes were essentially unchanged from last quarter, with gains from the DJ Basin and the Marcellus offsetting the impact of non-core domestic divestments in the third quarter. Domestic sales totaled 149,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 6% from the last quarter despite the loss of production from our divested non-core assets and was up 17% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Domestic results benefited from our horizontal programs in the DJ Basin and Marcellus, as well as growth from the Gulf of Mexico, which was impacted the previous quarter by shut-ins associated with Hurricane Isaac.","Internationally, sales volumes were 106,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 5% from last quarter and up 9% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Strong performance from Aseng and Alba in West Africa accounted for our growth in international volumes. Noa and Pinnacle fields offshore Israel have continued to perform well and contributed to average gas sales in Israel of 118 million cubic feet per day net, essentially unchanged from last quarter.","Our discretionary cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was a record $824 million, that's up 16% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Our liquidity position remains extremely strong at over $5.4 billion. Our cash position of $1.4 billion and our credit facility of $4 billion provide us with tremendous financial flexibility as we go forward.","Our fourth quarter was our highest sales volume quarter and contributed to our annual average volumes from continuing operations up 239,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the year. Having closed out 2012, we're now focused on 2013. We anticipate that our 2013 sales volumes will substantially jump in the second quarter with the startup of Tamar and continue to ramp up through the rest of the year. Dave will break down our guidance expectations for the first quarter later in the call.","The addition of Woodside as a partner in the Leviathan project contributes to our confidence that we can deliver on our development plans in Eastern Mediterranean. Our initial focus at Leviathan is delivering natural gas to the domestic market in 2016. That is a market where natural gas demand continues to grow. Longer term, our plans anticipate exporting gas via LNG. We expect that Israel will enact their export policy later this year, and Woodside's experience and expertise in LNG projects will contribute to our progress on an export facility.","In West Africa, Aseng and Alba continue to perform well, and we've been able to move up the expected date of first production from Alen into the third quarter of this year. Also, in West Africa, we discovered a new reservoir, Carla, and plan to flow test 2 intervals there.","So 2013 is in full swing. We're actively moving several exploration discoveries also towards full development. The major development projects that may be sanctioned this year, which could be as many as 5, will compliment our growing domestic horizontal programs.","In the Gulf of Mexico, we're working towards the sanction of 2 projects, Gunflint, where we're currently drilling an appraisal well; and Big Bend. In West Africa, after production tests, we anticipate that Carla should be ready for development. And in the Eastern Mediterranean, we're moving towards sanctioning a Phase 2 of Tamar, as well as the first phase of Leviathan. In total, these major project sanctions will likely include, in total, significant bookings of new reserves in 2013.","In the press release today, we included a summary of our year end reserves. Dave will review these reserves in more detail, but I'd like to add just a few comments. All of our reserve adds are from organic activity, not acquisitions. Excluding divestments, our reserves at the end of 2012 were up 3% over 2011. We added approximately 200 million barrels in the DJ Basin and the Marcellus and still have over 3 billion barrels of net risked resources still on book from these 2 plays. As Dave will discuss later, we're currently booking less than 3 years of proven undeveloped locations for our domestic horizontal programs.","Later today, we will be issuing our 10-K, which will include our year end 2012 SEC 10 valuation. Despite the soft domestic gas market, slightly low average liquid prices and divestments that resulted in over $1.1 billion in proceeds, as well as $3.5 billion in commodity sales net of production costs, even with all of these, our SEC 10 valuation ended up essentially flat to the prior years. This reflects the quality of our portfolio, demonstrated by the increased liquids reserves in the DJ Basin and the increased value as a result of the progress we're making on our major projects, Tamar and Alen.","Before turning the call over to Dave, I wanted to highlight some of our 2013 exploration activity. Exploration has been a true value creator for Noble Energy, and we believe it will remain a strong contributor to future growth of our company. To start with, we're actively appraising our earlier exploration discoveries. In the first quarter, we expect to have results from the Leviathan 4 appraisal well. Also, we recently spud the second Gunflint appraisal well, which may include an exploration tail to test the deeper myocene interval. And finally, we expect to drill the Cyprus appraisal well later this year.","We'll continue to mature our new ventures program, and we have a number of exploration wells planned. In Northeast Nevada, where we have about 350,000 net acres, we plan to begin testing vertical wells in the second or third quarter of this year. In the second half of the year, we plan to spud our appraisal prospect offshore Nicaragua, where we have a 1.8 million acre position and currently hold 100% working interest. A number of companies have visited our data room, and we'll be evaluating their proposals as we move forward to bringing a partner into this prospect.","In the Eastern Mediterranean, we plan to spud an exploration well at Karish, following the Leviathan 4 appraisal well. Karish is a 3 Tcf prospect with a high chance of success. Our new build drillship, the Atwood Advantage, is scheduled to arrive in the Eastern Mediterranean about the end of the year where it will drill the deep Mesozoic oil play at Leviathan. We're continuing our seismic programs offshore Falklands where we have a 35% working interest and a 10 million-acre position. We'll be taking over operatorship of the northern area licenses on March 1 of this year and of the southern area licenses no later than March of 2014. At our acreage position offshore Sierra Leone, a 2D seismic survey is being prepared. We currently hold a 30% working interest in those leases.","Throughout the year, our new ventures team will be evaluating additional areas that have potential to become future core areas for the company. This is a dynamic process that we believe will continue to fuel our long-term growth. So as I mentioned at the beginning, 2013 will be a very exciting year, one that myself and many others have been looking forward to. It will be a year of significant growth with new projects coming on stream. They'll be led by Tamar, which will not only have a material impact on our company, but just as importantly, a material impact on the state of Israel.","We're very proud of the role we're serving in developing the newly found resources of that country. It will also be a year of continued acceleration of our unconventional development programs led by the hugely impactful Niobrara program. This is a program that continues to deliver more positives every day.","And finally, it will be a year of moving major prior discoveries to development, as well as testing very material new exploration opportunities, some of which could be -- have a significant impact on the future of our company.","So now I'll turn the call over to Dave, who will give you more details on our ongoing operations.","David L. Stover","Thank you, Chuck. As you mentioned, it was an outstanding quarter, but the best is yet to come. Before I discuss the activities in our core operating areas, I want to start with a review of our reserves at the end of 2012.","We reported total proved reserves of 1.2 billion barrels oil equivalent, which is up 3% after adjusting for our non-core asset divestitures.  Slide 6 of the supplemental materials shows the reserve changes from last year. Net of revisions, total company additions of 121 million barrels of oil equivalent replaced 136% of 2012 production.","In the U.S., net additions of 105 million barrels of oil equivalent replaced 207% of U.S. production. Domestic reserve additions were from our horizontal developments in the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale. We booked only the proved undeveloped locations that are currently part of a specific development plan, which equates to less than 3 years of drilling in each horizontal program. Additional locations will be booked as future drilling plans are developed.","Included in net additions were reductions of 26 million barrels of oil equivalent due to negative price revisions from lower natural gas prices and 94 million barrels of oil equivalent due to the termination of the legacy vertical drilling program in Wattenberg as we concentrate on the higher-return horizontal program.","The reserves debooked due to the focus on the horizontal program, will likely be developed beyond the 5-year SEC window. The horizontal program reserve adds in the DJ Basin more than offset the vertical reduction. And despite debooking 94 million barrels oil equivalent, basin reserves increased 6% over the prior year. At year end 2012, we have booked 358 million barrels oil equivalent in the DJ Basin, only 17% of our estimated 2.1 billion barrels oil equivalent resources.","And in the Marcellus, we have booked 146 million barrels oil equivalent, which is only 9% of our estimated 10 trillion cubic feet equivalent resources. Our Marcellus reserves increased 61% over the prior year.","Internationally, net additions of 16 million barrels oil equivalent resulted from strong performance at Aseng and further appraisal at Tamar. As Chuck mentioned, we have not booked any reserves associated with the major projects we are targeting to sanction this year. We could book in excess of 200 million barrels oil equivalent reserves this year associated with the possible sanctions of Leviathan, second phase of Tamar, Carla, Gunflint and Big Bend. Also, with the startup of Tamar and Alen later this year, we expect to shift the bulk of their 400 million barrels oil equivalent of undeveloped reserves to developed reserves. As you can see, 2013 is shaping up to be an outstanding year of reserves growth.","Let's now review the operations in our core areas, beginning with the DJ Basin. We're excited about what the teams have been creating here, and our superior execution and results in the fourth quarter provides tremendous momentum as we move into 2013. We produced 86,000 barrels oil equivalent per day for the fourth quarter, a 30% increase year-over-year.","Slide 7 shows the growth in net production over the last 5 quarters. Horizontal production contributed 39,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That's a 2.5-fold increase versus the fourth quarter of last year. We exited the year with horizontal production above 42,000 barrels oil equivalent per day net from about 280 horizontal wells.","Liquids production from the DJ Basin in the fourth quarter was 51,000 barrels per day, or 59% of the total production stream. Oil alone represented 44% of our production for the quarter. Since we have been focused on developing the oil-prone areas of the play, our oil production has dramatically increased year-over-year by close to 50%.","We drilled 200 horizontal wells in the DJ Basin in 2012 and operated 8 horizontal rigs at the end of the year. Over 85% of those wells were in the oil areas of the play, which includes northern Colorado and the oil window of the greater Wattenberg area.","All the wells have been completed in our 15-well horizontal pilot focused on testing, recovery of 40-acre density in multiple benches of the Niobrara, as well as the Codell. Remember, we are testing 3 different development patterns here across the entire 300-foot oil-bearing section, with a potential of over 30 wells developed per section as shown in Slide 8.","All wells are being prepared to flow through our newly constructed EcoNode facility, and initial results will be available during our next quarterly update.","Looking at what we have learned over the past year, our base plan is to focus on 40-acre density across the oil window while accelerating activity and continuing to unlock ways to increase recovery. In 2013, we plan to add 2 rigs in order to drill 300 horizontal wells, all but a handful in the oil window.","About 60 will be extended reach lateral wells, with lateral lengths of 7,000 to 9,000 feet. Normalizing for an average lateral length of 4,000 feet, we'll be drilling close to 350 equivalent wells, up over 70% from 2002 activity levels -- 2012 activity levels.","As shown in Slide 9, the average production from 3 initial extended reach lateral wells is showing minimal decline and is tracking well above a 750,000 barrel oil equivalent-type curve. In fact, if you look closely at the last 2 months, the average, shown in red, exhibits essentially no decline. Obviously, we're excited about how this is evolving.","In one section of Wells Ranch, we're drilling 8 extended reach lateral wells on an 80-acre density pattern. We recently finished drilling 4 of the 8, with lateral lengths of approximately 9,000 feet. We expect to spud the remaining wells and begin well completions on this 8-well section by the end of the first quarter.","In Northern Colorado, we plan to drill 80 wells in 2013. This activity stems mainly from the exploration success we have experienced in the East Pony area. As noted on Slide 10, we now have 20 wells online that are exhibiting superior results, 24-hour peak flow rates averaging close to 800 barrels oil equivalent per day with about 80% oil. We plan to drill 55 to 65 wells this year in East Pony, incorporating some of the same thinking as we've done in Wells Ranch, laying out a very integrated development plan that will incorporate pipelines for water and oil transport, as well as multi-well pad drilling and centralized facilities to reduce our footprint.","To support our expected growth in northern Colorado, we recently sanctioned the Kyoto gas plant with a designed processing capacity of 30 million cubic feet per day. We will own and operate the plant scheduled for startup in the second quarter of 2014. This new plant alongside our 15 million cubic feet per day Lilli Plant allows us to control our own gas processing needs in this high oil area.","In Marcellus, production averaged 121 million cubic feet equivalent per day net in the fourth quarter. Wet gas production averaged 14 million cubic feet equivalent per day net from 3 pads. In January, we completed drilling the last of our 11 wells on our fourth wet gas pad and completions are underway.","We drilled 11 wells in the fourth quarter and operated 3 rigs. Two of the rigs are in Majorsville, and one is delineating our acreage position in Normantown, West Virginia. We plan to add a fourth rig in the second quarter in the Pennsboro, West Virginia area. The addition of a fifth and sixth rig later in the year will help us to drill 85 to 90 wet gas wells by year end.","In December, we showed the returns uplift from the liquids on our wet gas production. Slide 12 demonstrates that the value of the wet gas is about double the dry gas. It's easy to see why we are increasing our development in this portion of the field.","In the dry gas area, our partner, CONSOL, drilled 14 wells during the quarter and operated 2 rigs. For 2013, we have agreed to a 36-well dry gas program, down from 64 dry gas wells drilled in 2012. Our strategies are well aligned in this natural gas price environment, and we continue to focus on the high EUR and high net revenue interest areas of the play. Most of our leases are held by production, so our drilling plans are not being driven by lease expirations. Instead, we're able to optimize our development, and we are retaining the optionality to grow our program when domestic natural gas prices rise.","Moving offshore to the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we produced 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, led by production from Galapagos. For the full year, production grew more than 20% over 2011 to nearly 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our Gulf of Mexico production is approximately 80% oil and receives premium Light Louisiana Sweet pricing.","In the fourth quarter, we announced the discovery of Big Bend, with approximately 150 net feet of high-quality oil pay and the same productive interval as our Galapagos discoveries. The excellent reservoir and oil characteristics are similar to Galapagos, giving us confidence we will realize significant value from the development and production of this resource.","We have a 54% working interest in Big Bend, and we intend to sanction a development project later this year. Success at Big Bend has also derisked our adjacent Troubadour prospect, which we intend to drill this year. If successful, Troubadour could be co-developed with Big Bend, adding value to both projects. We hold an 87.5% working interest in Troubadour.","We're currently drilling our second appraisal well at Gunflint. Our first appraisal well established a commercial subsea tieback project. The second appraisal well will test the south side of the Gunflint structure and possibly a deeper myocene interval. A successful deeper myocene test could warrant a larger stand-alone development. After results of this well, we anticipate sanctioning Gunflint development as early as the second half of this year. The combination of Big Bend and Gunflint oil production will be a significant new source of cash flow in the 2015, 2016 time frame.","With respect to exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, we continue to mature both subsalt prospects as well as amplitude prospects. Later this year, we plan to drill another exploration well after we finish with Gunflint and Troubadour. We recently exercised a 1-year option on the ENSCO 8501 to support our expected drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico and still maintained 3 additional 1-year options.","Shifting now to our International business, let's begin in the Eastern Mediterranean. Our existing production from the Mari-B facilities was essentially unchanged from last quarter due to the contribution from the Noa and Pinnacles fields. We've developed these fields with the intent that they would deliver natural gas until the Tamar field comes online, and they have performed extremely well. We're now only a few months away from first production at Tamar.","Slide 14 shows a couple of pictures of Tamar facilities. The installation of the jacket and platform was completed in December, and offshore hookup and commissioning operations are in progress. We're on schedule for first production in April, and we'll ramp up growth Israel volumes to reach full capacity, around 1 billion cubic feet per day, in the peak summer demand period. We expect to average gross sales volumes of approximately 700 million cubic feet per day the last 8 months of the year.","We spoke in detail in December about the growing demand for natural gas in Israel from electricity providers and industrial customers. To meet this demand, we're planning to implement a Tamar Phase 2 project to increase peak capacity to 1.5 billion cubic feet per day. The project consists of 2 components: installation of compression at the Ashdod onshore terminal to increase onshore delivery capacity, and storage at Mari-B to increase the offshore delivery capacity. With this increase in system capacity, we anticipate averaging around 1 billion cubic feet per day annual sales from Tamar in 2015.","At Leviathan, we're continuing the appraisal of the massive field and spud the Leviathan #4 appraisal well late last year. The Phase 1 development concept involves the use of an offshore host, likely an FPSO, to process the gas before bringing it onshore through a northern entry point. A portion of the capacity will be earmarked for domestic needs with the remaining volumes available for export. We expect domestic demand to continue its growth, resulting in potential sales of several hundred million cubic feet a day from Leviathan beginning in 2016.","In West Africa, crude and condensate volumes from Alba and Aseng were 36,000 barrels per day net in the fourth quarter. We continued to see strong prices on our listings with an average realized price around $108 per barrel. The Alen project, as we announced in December, has accelerated its schedule for first production to the third quarter of this year. Well operations are complete, and platform installation is scheduled for the second quarter. Initial condensate volumes are expected to be 18,000 barrels a day net, which will be transported to the Aseng FPSO for offloading.","At Carla, we discovered an additional reservoir in the fourth quarter. Our appraisal of Carla is in progress with the next step, a flow test of the original and the newly discovered reservoirs. The complete analysis of these results will guide our plan of development, which will likely be a subsea tieback to Aseng.","Before I open the call for questions, let me quickly touch upon our volume guidance. Our full year volume guidance of 270,000 to 282,000 barrels per day and all full year guidance ranges that we announced in December remain unchanged. We expect the first quarter to be our lowest volume quarter, and that production will increase significantly in the second quarter with the startup of Tamar and will continue to ramp up throughout the year, exiting around 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","We anticipate first quarter volumes to be 238,000 to 242,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, essentially no different than what we expected when we provided full year guidance in December. This range includes the impact of underliftings of over 4,000 barrels per day in West Africa, maintenance downtime in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as normal depletion at the Mari-B field and the timing of pad startups in the Marcellus Shale. Offsetting the Gulf of Mexico downtime is several thousand barrels per day higher production from the DJ Basin.","In summary, we continue to execute and deliver on the plan we've laid out. Before long, the Tamar and Alen major projects will be online; we will have drilled significant appraisal wells at Leviathan, Gunflint and Cyprus; and we will be testing large oil prospects in Nevada, Nicaragua and the Eastern Mediterranean. It's no wonder we are excited about our company.","Camille, with that, it's now time to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question is on the Niobrara, and then I know the production profile in Slide 9 continues to be flatter than your type curve after 3 wells. And while I realize it's early days here, is there anything specific to those -- these locations that could make them more outliers? Or any incremental changes on your view of the type curve and maybe how many wells you think you need to give you comfort to revisit that type curve?","David L. Stover","Yes. It's a good question. It's -- when we look at it, and particularly what we emphasized, especially as that production's continued from those longer laterals, you can see how flat that curve is. I mentioned in the last 2 months, really, if you look at the last 3 months, it's fairly flat. That gives us a lot of encouragement on what we're doing there. I would say, we've looked at -- is there -- is this really an outlier area? We don't really believe so. We think the real application of the long horizontals is up in this oil window and that northeast part of Wattenberg and then up into northern Colorado. So we're really going to test that this year. As I mentioned, we're going to drill close to 60 longer lateral horizontals. We've got an 8-well program or a section that we're completing drilling and completing now in that Wells Ranch area. So the real answer to your question in part is then we'll be real comfortable with how well do we understand this, it'll be towards the end of this year when we get more wells drilled in more different areas. But from what we've seen and where we drill these 3 wells, and you combine that with that initial long lateral that we drilled that's now over a year of production, we're really enthused by what we're seeing from this program.","Charles D. Davidson","I think it just points out once again how important it is on unconventional wells to really wait until you get extensive data and try not to make judgments too quickly. In the case of the Niobrara, it just -- certainly in the extended area, it's just gotten more and more positive as we've gathered the performance data on these extended laterals.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","If I could ask just one more follow-up to that, is -- I mean, can you just generally discuss the constraints for growth here in the Niobrara? I mean, is it midstream? Staffing? Otherwise? Or some combination? I mean -- I guess I'm looking at the 500 well rate in 2016, huge growth rate with still over a 19-year inventory. What's the limiting factor for faster growth? And I'll leave it at that.","David L. Stover","The one thing you want to do is you want to lay out a pretty thoughtful plan and lay it out at least a year or 2 ahead of time as you're developing this. I think when we look at it right now -- I mean, if you look at this year's activity, when you look at it on a normalized footage basis, we're up over 70% from what we did last year, heading towards, as you mentioned -- going from 300 wells to closer to 500 in a couple of years here. I think the thing that will play into this is the work we're doing on understanding the vertical recovery component of the Niobrara. In other words, where do we get to on -- how many different laterals do we need in any one particular area? Everything we're looking at and evaluating from that A bench down through the Codell. We need 1 lateral. Do we need 2 or even 3 in some of these areas to optimize that? As we start to unlock that and understand that, and if you get into areas where you're doing more multi-laterals, then you potentially have the ability down the road to be doing more off central facilities even than what we've got planned now, which could help accelerate some of the timing as we get into that. But I mean, that's some of the things that are going to have to play out over the next year or so.","Charles D. Davidson","I think also it's -- as you're probably aware, this plan continues to evolve. If you look at our -- the plan we laid out in December versus the 5-year plan that we showed a year before, our most recent plan had 1,100 additional wells over the 5-year period. So we continue to accelerate the program as results come about. And as Dave mentioned, we continue to look for ways to push it forward but to make sure that we are developing it in a very efficient way. So it's exciting to have that kind of potential. It's exciting to see the potential grow. And we know that we've got a lot of work ahead of us to continue to accelerate it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","See if I can get a little bit more color on some of the high-potential exploration. Wanted to get a sense if you guys thought you would have results from the well in Nicaragua by the end of the year. I just wanted to get a sense of when you thought you'd start drilling in Sierra Leone.","David L. Stover","Yes. I'd say, Leo, on Nicaragua, I'd say about end of the year is probably about the right timing for that if we get started by mid-year, a little after mid-year. So I think that would fit with what we're thinking right now. Sierra Leone, right now, it's a little bit further behind. It's earlier stages. We're just working right now on planning what the 2D seismic program will be, which then, based on what you see from that, you'd plan a 3D program before you get around to start drilling. So the drilling there is probably a couple of years off yet.","Charles D. Davidson","I think on the other high-profile wells, while it's a different type of play, keep in mind that somewhere around the middle of the year, we'll be starting in Nevada with that program, and that's testing a pretty sizable resource there. And that information will evolve over time. And then also, at the very end of the year, as we mentioned, the drillship will be moving back into Israel to start drilling the deep Mesozoic oil test. But we wouldn't expect results on that until early the following year.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. And I guess just a question on Israeli production. Just looking at your production guidance, you talked about some of the moving pieces here. Are you all expecting Israeli production to be down pretty significantly in the first quarter of '13 in your guidance?","David L. Stover","Yes, I think it will be somewhat. We kept it ramped up third and fourth quarter to meet some of the needs over there and supply everything we could as we're getting closer to Tamar. And actually, you're starting to deplete some of these fields a little more. You're probably -- I'd say, in the fourth quarter, we were running that net 270 to 300 growth range. We'll be down closer to 250 or -- plus or minus in this quarter. Probably 230 to 250 is what we'll run it at.","Charles D. Davidson","On a gross basis.","David L. Stover","On a gross basis.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","If I could jump back, Dave, please, to the northern Colorado area. I think in the past you guys have suggested that the limiting factor was really more about large ranch stages and so on. I'm just curious, given the success that you've had, if you're able to still add acreage up there? And if so, is -- ultimately, what do you think the extent of this extended lateral area could be? I think that sounds maybe similar to a question you had before, but really more about the acreage adds.","David L. Stover","Yes. If you recall, we added a significant portion of acreage in northern Colorado last year, which help delayed some of the activity and the development of this East Pony area. I think when you think of north Colorado this year, it's really 2 pieces. It's moving into full development over in that East Pony area, and then it's probably, I'd say, testing and delineating probably another 100,000 acres up there with a number of wells. I'd say, 5 to 10 wells up in that area. So that's probably the 2 main focuses of the program in that area for this year.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So you feel you've got plenty of running room in terms of -- are you still adding acreage? Or are you pretty much done?","David L. Stover","I mean, we add pieces here and there as it fills out drilling spacing units and so forth. But we're not adding big pieces of acreage. We still have -- I think if you remember, we still have probably 100,000, 150,000 acres that we need to delineate up there in the northern Colorado portion right now.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My follow-up is really -- you've had a pretty good clean up of the portfolio here in the last year or two but, Chuck, we haven't heard you talk about China in a while. What are your thoughts there in terms of potential disposal? And I'll leave it at that.","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think we continue -- like you say, we continue to clean up the portfolio, and I think we would view that China would move into a category where it would be non-core. It's always a matter of matching up the right -- the buyer of the assets. We worked on the North Sea for quite some time till we found the right home from some of that because we do put a lot of value on focusing on our core area of businesses. So we've got a little bit left in the U.S. to finish up on that program. We got most of it last year, very successful program, but there's still a couple more packages here in the U.S. we need to clean up as well. So always moving it down the food chain, so to speak, and keeping it as clean as possible. So more work to come.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly, kind of thinking more about the service cost outlook. Last quarter, you guys had talked about thinking towards a 5% to 10% decline in 2013 in the DJ Basin. Has anything changed that landscape as you move more rigs up there and do more pad drilling? Do you have the right fit-for-purpose rigs? Are you able to get them at similar rates? Any kind of sense on where you guys are thinking in terms of continued cost compression that you've benefited from as well?","Charles D. Davidson","I don't -- I'll also ask Dave to comment, but I don't think we anticipate any changes from what we just talked about at the end of the year. But we do have to keep in mind that we are driving -- especially in the development programs, we're driving to a more efficient development program. The pad drilling, multi-wells on a pad, some of the things that we outlined in December that we're doing in areas such as handling of water, of more efficient movement of fluid. These are all built to get more efficiency out of the scale that the Niobrara program is going. But in terms of just looking at service costs themselves, I don't think we see any big changes in what we outlined before.","David L. Stover","No. And a lot of that is predicated on moving more to these fit-for-purpose rigs, which we've been doing too, Dave. So nothing's really changed on that outlook.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe kind of more of a housekeeping item, it looks like LOE for 1Q is kind of trending up versus where it was 4Q and is certainly above full year '13 guidance. Can you talk about what's kind of moving that around, just for that one quarter? Or is that a trend [indiscernible]?","David L. Stover","Yes. There is some -- in that first quarter, we're seeing some impact of some Swordfish maintenance cost on our Swordfish well out there. We had lost the power supply for a period of time so we had to bring in an additional power supply, and then we had some compression work that needed to be repaired. So a lot of it is driven by that, Dave.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. So really one time in nature more than anything else.","David L. Stover","Yes. I think we'll see that trend down over the next part of the year and especially as you start to bring the Tamar project on, too.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our your next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On the Marcellus, you talked about the liquids-rich components contributing about 12% of the total; and in your prepared remarks, talked about reducing, I think, the number of wells you're drilling on the dry gas side. Can you talk about how you see your mix changing in the Marcellus over the course of the year and how you see overall production trending, given the shift in activity?","David L. Stover","Yes. I mean, our production trend -- no different than what we laid out in December. So -- I mean, we'll be up still significantly overall. A lot more of it, as you allude to, Brian, will be driven by the wet gas portion. We'll be drilling, what, close to 85 to 90 wet gas wells this year compared to 35, 36 or so dry gas. But a lot of those pads really don't start to come on till second, third, fourth quarter. So it'll be more second half of the year weighted where you start to see the real impact of the more liquid portion of that.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then going back to reserve bookings internationally. Can you just refresh us on Alen and Tamar, what is booked now from the projects that -- at least the portion of Tamar that you have coming on in 2013, and if there's anything less to book? And then how we should think about reserve bookings, perhaps at year end 2013 internationally with some of the sanctions that you're planning?","David L. Stover","Yes, Brian. We've booked kind of -- if you remember, we booked the liquid portion, probably a fairly significant portion of that. I think as far as additional potential for bookings at, say, Alen and -- when I'm thinking about Alen and Aseng, we saw some improvement this year from Aseng from performance. We may be able to see some of the -- the same thing from Alen. When you think about what we're doing at Tamar, I think we've booked, if I remember right, about 70% of the total reserves there. And then we'll look at that as we get performance and get further along in development.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Irene Haas with Wunderlich.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Today I wanted to focus my question mainly on marketing issues in 2 regions. Firstly, in the Niobrara, you guys generally are sort of a trendsetter and pace setter for the play. And I'm wondering where your crude is being sold to, a percentage into Cushing and then other Rocky Mountain area, and just really sort of a longer view as to how you're going to pace yourselves. Then the second part of this question is really offshore Eastern Mediterranean. I mean, surely, there's a lot of countries nearby that you can sort of export your gas to, and my question is how comfortable you are in terms of getting oil index-type pricing in light of the fact that some of the Gulf Coast projects are selling it at Henry Hub Index? So that's all I have for today.","Charles D. Davidson","Thanks, Irene. I think Dave and I will tag team on this a little bit. I think, in Niobrara, the one thing to keep in mind is that our marketing has greatly expanded over the course of the last, really, 1.5 years, 2 years. So not only do we market locally to a -- oh, it's actually a company that has 2 refineries in the area, but now it's broadened out to a number of customers in the region. And then also, we send a sizable portion of our crude down to the White Cliffs pipeline into Cushing. In addition, we're working with partners on a rail facility that will start up in the second half of this year, and that rail facility will actually allow us to move crude to multiple markets throughout the country. It's just not about moving it through the Gulf Coast. We can move it to the East Coast and the West Coast as well. It really opens things up for us. So as a result of all this, we're seeing a lot of flexibility going forward in terms of how we market our crude out of the basin. And with the capacity growing, with the expansion that White Cliffs has undertaken and with the rail facility, we're able to move these ever-increasing amounts of oil. On the Eastern Med, I would just say that on the export side of it, obviously, near term, we're focusing on this growing domestic market in Israel, which is probably going to support 2 more expansions, one of Tamar and a first phase of Leviathan so that we can satisfy that market. And then we'll be -- we continue to work the export process. There may be markets nearby, but I think we really see exports as being an LNG export project. And gosh, what kind of pricing evolution that will happen on that? We know we'll have European customers that have a different pricing methodology as some of the Asian customers and it all continues to evolve. And so that -- those will be all the pieces that will be continuing to work where countries are all different. The good news is, is that we're dealing with a resource that can be developed at low cost and can be competitive in a number of markets. I might ask David if he wanted to comment anymore on either of those.","David L. Stover","I'd say, when you look at our DJ Basin crude, I mean, we don't see that going forward, even with the rail situation coming in. We don't really see what you've seen as far as deducts from WTI really changing that much. I mean, we see, with the ability to move crude to a number of different places and a number of different markets, we still have a good plan there on how to continue to handle that. And that gets even better with some of these expansions that Chuck has mentioned.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I had a quick question on Tamar Phase 2. You mentioned there are 2 capital items around compression and storage. Will you need any more wells to supply that volume? And can you remind us on the nameplate capacity for the platform?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, the -- I'm not -- well, there are 2 platforms that are involved here. One is Mari-B that potentially would be used as a storage facility, and then there's the big Tamar platform that we put in. So right now, the nominal peak capacity of the Tamar Phase 1 will be around 1 Bcf a day, which is delivered out of 5 wells of which probably 4 could make that volume and the fifth is additional. The peak capacity for Phase 2 would be about 1.5 Bcf. And again, that would be achieved through probably some swing volumes from Mari-B out of storage, as well as utilizing the compression that we would install onshore to be able to enhance the delivery. So will there be another well along the way? We'll just see. I would speculate at this point that we'll want to see the performance of these wells that we have as part of the base development. They've been -- some have been flow tested. They're very high productivity. And then we'll just see -- we always want to make sure we've got some redundancy in the system as we go forward. But it's a very highly prolific field, very productive wells.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Malone with Global Hunter Securities.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","You mentioned earlier in the call that you think that you might get approval from the Israeli government for exports later in the year, if I heard correctly. Can you sort of walk us through what you -- the expected timing, the ideal timing post that approval? When do you think you might have some SPAs with customers and when you think the earliest date for FID is possible?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, on an export project, I think we still see -- a final investment decision is out into the future. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on facility design. And as you pointed out, just making sure you're secure on markets and customer. So that's not a -- that is not something that we would anticipate anywhere near this year. That's out some time. As far as the export policy, the committee that studied that in Israel made their final recommendations late last year. We would, as I think kind of anticipated because of the elections that were called in Israel, there was no final action taken on that. Israel is now building the new coalition government after elections have occurred. And I guess my anticipation would be is that, that export policy would be taken up after the new government is formed, which will be probably some time late this quarter, early next quarter. And then it will just go through its process. But again, we would expect that relatively soon, they would finalize that, because it does give us more certainty in how to plan and design going forward.","John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just a follow-up to that, probably too early to answer, but Woodside in the past has gone to 2 FID on projects without having sold 100% of capacity on the idea that they can get some spot volumes sold as well. Are you guys thinking of these terms yet, or is it too early?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think it's way too early. But I would just say that as we've looked at the LNG markets, there is some strategic advantage to leaving some of your volume uncommitted for spot sales. And so, again, without -- we just haven't gotten that far. But we, at least philosophically, agreed that there's some value in doing that.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","If I could go back to a sub -- comment that Chuck made in his prepared remarks, I think -- this sounds like this was a new prospect, this Karish, if I'm saying it correctly? And I'm wondering where that is in relation to your other prospects and what your work condition is, what a developed scenario would look like.","Charles D. Davidson","Well, it's not a new prospect, Charles. It's one of that inventory we had up there in the Levant Basin that we've seen -- as we've gone through all our 3D work. I guess it's about a 3 TCF prospect, and it's a very high chance of success. We think it can kind of help solidify the resource base there in Israel.","David L. Stover","Close to Tamar.","Charles D. Davidson","And it is. It is close to Tamar, probably a little east of Tanin, our discovery that we made. That was early last year. So it just fits in with that program.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And so that would just have some kind of the same sort of subsea development and tieback as you're using for Tamar?.","Charles D. Davidson","Oh, I would think so. Yes.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And then the follow-up. On Carla, on the cartoon map you guys have, it looks like the southern portion of that prospect hasn't been tested yet. Is that correct? And is that going to be part of your 2013 appraisal program?","David L. Stover","Yes. I mean, we've got a -- that sort of started out as a multi well with some additional sidetracks to more fully appraise this. So what we're going to do is kind of systematically appraise this now multiple reservoirs. And the next step here is actually flow testing a couple of these reservoirs.","Charles D. Davidson","Keep in mind, we did drill Carla earlier at a different location. And so what's happened with this most recent well, we didn't -- I don't think on our cartoon -- we didn't really show the well locations. But this latest well showed that we had some reservoir separation there. So certainly, there will be some more work to be done, and we show a fairly large range for Carla. Our latest on a P75-P25 shows that it could range anywhere from 36 to 136 million barrels equivalent, from about 80% being liquids. So it's a sizable feature, and it will probably -- again, after we do our well tests, we'll put together the development plan and we'll just see how we stepped through it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Hoping to get your view on domestic NGL prices and what the options are to not price DJ Basin production off Conway. Just asking in an effort to better understand the impact of margins here going forward.","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think the key thing to keep in mind that will, I think, give us some flexibility on DJ volumes is the new pipeline that's being built that will go into service, I want to say, early -- end of the year, of this year, beginning of next year. And that will move it away from Conway and start moving it down into the Gulf Coast. So you've got then more flexibility on the pricing there.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, great. And then as a follow-up, with respect to the new gas plant in northern Colorado, can you give us the amount of capital that will or has been committed to building, constructing that plant? And should we expect much by way of changes to the initial capacity of $30 million a day here going forward? And maybe as a follow-up to that, the amount of third-party volumes that may go through that same plant?","David L. Stover","Yes, Dan. I mean, right now, we're looking somewhere in that $30 million to $40 million range, if I remember it right, for that facility. And at this point, we'll see how it develops. But with our plans for development in that area, we're looking at it, filling that up with our gas. I mean, if there's any additional capacity, we'll surely look at any third party gas in the area. But our plans right now are based on our activity and what we're seeing up there to continue to load that up with our volumes and our activity. I mean, that's at least the emphasis upfront.","Charles D. Davidson","Yes. Just to keep in mind, that's a very low GOR area. So you don't need just a small amount of processing capacity. And again, we've got an existing Lilli Plant and then this Kyoto plant that we're building that -- that really helps us able to move things up there.","David L. Stover","When you have 1,000 GOR or so.","Charles D. Davidson","Exactly.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Amir Arif with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a question on the extended reach laterals. Have you tried that up in the northern Colorado area, given the higher oil cuts? And the follow-up question to that really is what's the difference in the economics uplift that you see with the extended laterals versus your average lateral based on your results today?","David L. Stover","Yes. Good questions. I think right now, we have not yet drilled extended laterals in northern Colorado. But our plan is to drill a handful of them this year up there, so we'll start to get a look at it up in that area, as you say, given the acreage position up there and the oil prone -- theres the high -- low GOR, high oil in that area, it's a natural place to move that program. When you look at the returns, we're seeing returns over 100% from when you look at these first 3 or 4 extended reach laterals. So when you look at what we've shown on our base program and that 40% to 60% returns, it's a pretty nice uplift here to go -- get up over 100% return from what we're seeing so far on these.","Charles D. Davidson","And just to add to some things that Dave was talking in the prepared remarks is that, that's -- 100% plus is what we are seeing based off of the type curve analysis that we had out there, and our performances is going well above the type curve. So we're probably -- even at the type curve, we're seeing F&D down about 20% on these. So that's probably -- with what kind of success we're seeing, that's set up to improve as well. So very, very high return wells.","David L. Stover","I guess the real story there is we don't really know yet what the limit to recovery from this program is.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Hall with Robert W. Baird.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Most of mine have been addressed. But just a quick follow-up on the DJ marketing topic, just curious on the rail volumes. Have you actually contracted any capacity out of the basin on rail? And what might the per barrel cost be on that?","David L. Stover","Yes. On the rail capacity, we've committed 10,000 barrels a day, and I wouldn't be surprised to see us move up to 20,000 by the time it gets put in, given how fast our oil production is growing up there. When you look at it, as Chuck mentioned, it goes -- potentially can go to a lot of different markets to get better pricing than WTI. I think the costs we're looking at are in -- to deliver, it's probably $10 to $12 a barrel.","Charles D. Davidson","And the gross facility, the gross rail facility has a capacity of about 60,000 barrels a day, and there's another partner in it that's made a commitment for some capacity as well. So a lot of room to grow.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And sorry, is that in northeastern Colorado? Or -- where I guess physically is the...","David L. Stover","No, it'd be in the Wattenberg area. In the Wattenberg area, probably closer to Platteville.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it. And then just curious, I don't know if it's necessary, a whole lot to be read from it, but just curious what your per well EUR bookings are on the horizontal program at this point on proved reserves?","David L. Stover","I think in the DJ you're around that 300 that we've been talking about. On a gross basis, you've got to net that down for our net revenue interest.","David R. Larson","Hey, Camille, this is David. It looks like we're -- we've reached our 1-hour limit here, so we are going to end the Q&A session now.

Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Brad, and good morning everyone. I will begin with brief remarks on our strong third quarter, which reflected our high quality asset performance and continued differentiated execution. Clearly the benefits of our repositioned onshore portfolio are really starting to show up in our financial results. Third quarter volumes came in well above our original expectations with capital and cost towards the lower end. Of particular note, U.S. onshore oil volumes achieved a quarterly record of 93,000 barrels per day, pushing us towards the high end of our increased guidance on total oil for the quarter. Well performance in the DJ Basin was a big part of the U.S. onshore oil beat, with continued stellar results from the Wells Ranch and East Pony areas.","Our portfolio repositioning to focus on high return, higher-margin opportunity is driving substantial increases in our onshore operating cash margins. As compared to the third quarter of last year, U.S. onshore operating cash flow per BOE has increased by approximately 50%. In addition to our record U.S. onshore oil performance, other major contributors to our higher cash margins include higher oil pricing and the divestiture of our natural gas assets in the Marcellus.","In the third quarter of last year, the Marcellus made up more than 20% of our total company volumes but only about 5% of our cash flow. While these volumes were low margin, they were also low LOE costs that we have shifted to an oilier mix. We've been successful in keeping our unit operating cost structure relatively flat, quite an accomplishment by our teams. I'm very happy with the trend of our cash flow and volume performance onshore.","Offshore, our Israel assets established an all-time quarterly volume record in the third quarter, averaging nearly 1 billion cubic feet per day growth. And our other offshore assets also performed well with West Africa and Gulf of Mexico continuing to generate substantial cash flow.","While we still have most of the fourth quarter ahead of us, it's an appropriate time to pause and reflect on all that we have accomplished this year.","As we laid out our plans for 2017, we highlighted the following as our primary targets for the year: One, continue to enhance the capital efficiency in our onshore business; two, grow the value of midstream within Noble; three, commence the Leviathan development; and four, continue to focus the long-term portfolio on high-margin, high-return assets with a divestment target of over $1 billion. Clearly, we have already checked the box on all of these items and in fact, delivered significantly more on every front.","The substantial ramp in cash flows and volumes from our high-margin positions in the DJ Basin, Eagle Ford and the Delaware, highlight the exceptional performance from our well results and Noble's ability to execute. With our legacy of over 2,000 horizontal wells drilled and completed across the U.S., basin scale in each of our plays, and leading technology and data science, we've been on the forefront of evolving completion designs across the industry. And the performance results show clear differentiation for Noble Energy.","Gary will spend some time on the drilling efficiencies onshore but I continue to be impressed with the cost per foot reductions being delivered in both the Delaware and DJ Basins. The DJ is really remarkable as this is a continuous multi-year trend. More footage drilled with less rig days is certainly a part of the formula for success and we are delivering.","Noble is, without question, a top tier onshore company with a top tier portfolio. Cash flow and volumes will continue the growth trend in the fourth quarter, with a more than 10% onshore oil volume increase coming primarily from the ramp in our Permian activity.","Pro forma for transactions executed this year, fourth quarter oil volumes onshore are slightly ahead of our previously guided 40% increase versus the first quarter this year.","Key to our execution and efficiency onshore is the midstream build-out and integration of facilities and gathering systems. The team at Noble Midstream has executed extremely well in the DJ and Delaware Basins and they continue to gather record volumes, primarily as a result of Noble's outstanding well performance in both basins.","Earlier this year, we completed the first midstream drop to NBLX and I would anticipate another drop next year as we grow the EBITDA of our retained Delaware and DJ interests.","NBLX celebrated the one-year anniversary of its IPO last month and it has been an outstanding performer in 2017 for both the NBLX unit holders and Noble Energy.","Another outcome for the year was to commence the Leviathan development, which was sanctioned in the first quarter. The project is making great progress, nearly 25% complete, on schedule and on budget for a late 2019 start-up. My excitement continues to build with start-up now only eight quarters away. Leviathan is one of the world's most attractive offshore projects, with margins competitive to the best U.S. onshore plays and an impactful steady cash flow stream for decades ahead. In support of the funding requirements for Leviathan, we're on track to sell down an incremental 7.5% interest in Tamar over the next year.","Regarding portfolio transformation, we've completed the integration of the Clayton Williams Energy assets. This positions us with one of the largest and most contiguous acreage positions in the Southern Delaware Basin. I'm excited that this quarter we're starting to bring on production wells that Noble Energy has both drilled and completed on the acreage.","With a 2017 target of $1 billion in portfolio proceeds, we've announced more than twice that amount to-date. These proceeds have been well deployed to fund the cash costs of the Clayton Williams acquisition and we'd retire all the debt assumed, bringing these assets into Noble debt free. So in summary, Noble is clearly delivering on our major objectives for 2017.","Looking forward, while we are still scenario planning and finalizing our budget for 2018, I want to provide some insight as to how we are approaching next year. Consistent with what we told you last November when we rolled out a multi-year plan, 95% or more of our capital will be allocated to the high-return, high-margin U.S. onshore business and the Eastern Med. 2018 will be the peak investment year for Leviathan Phase 1. And as I mentioned earlier, this will be primarily funded with our sell-down of additional interest at Tamar.","Once you add in our net Tamar annual cash flows of nearly $400 million per year, this business is continuing to generate cash flows above the level of our Leviathan investments.","The remainder of our capital program for next year will be focused on the DJ Basin and Delaware areas, with a smaller Eagle Ford program anticipated as compared to this year. Our U.S. onshore investments should again benefit from the support of NBLX proceeds.","As we have shown over the last two years and as we laid out last November, our sources of cash will more than cover our use of cash. In addition, we will continue to look for opportunities to accelerate value of assets that are not attracting capital.","Use of proceeds will be prioritized to further debt reduction, while also considering shareholder return opportunities. In the context of the current commodity environment, we would not anticipate using additional proceeds to incrementally increase activity. As you look further into the future, the impact of Leviathan start-up will provide more opportunities for returning value to shareholders.","The portfolio repositioning of the last 24 months is driving substantial value growth for Noble. Combined with our industry-leading execution abilities and differential performance, we are delivering meaningful U.S. onshore margin expansion, enhancing overall corporate returns.","A year ago, when we laid out our multi-year outlook, our first slide highlighted our plan to fully fund our capital program with improving balance sheet and corporate returns. This focus on corporate returns has been a key part of our DNA for many years.","As we establish next year's detailed plan, we remain focused and committed to delivering double digit corporate returns within the next few years in a $50 oil price world. This will be driven by a significant increase of cash flow per share over that period.","Now, I'll hand the call over to Gary to walk through key operational highlights.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, and good morning. As Dave mentioned, our operations teams are delivering to plan across all business units. Importantly, this execution is occurring while maintaining a relentless focus on safety, on our culture of no harm, a culture that exists across all of our operations, and this focus is showing in our performance.","During the third quarter, we set a new record for consecutive days without a recordable incident across the entirety of our global upstream operations, and several operating areas have recently set individual records for days without recordable injuries or lost time incidents.","This performance comes while we've integrated the Clayton Williams Energy assets and we've increased activity levels. And it only comes because of the constant focus and attention that our teams bring to the job every day. I'm appreciative of their efforts to ensure the safety of our operations and everybody that comes on site.","Before moving into the basin highlights, I want to take a few minutes to cover the substantial drilling advancements across our U.S. onshore business. Our teams continued to set new records on short, medium, and long laterals in the third quarter in the Delaware and DJ Basins.","A number of items have contributed to this. We're applying advanced analytics on real time well data, with roughly 30 data points collected every second on every rig. That's roughly 1 terabyte of data per rig per day. With constant monitoring and analysis of the data streaming in from each rig, our drilling teams and geoscientists now have the ability to quickly identify what is happening downhole and rapidly execute any needed modifications to the program.","In addition, we've retrained our drilling teams both in the office and the field to use a physics-based approach to drilling rather than simply relying on empirical knowledge in the field. This new approach lets us take full advantage of the massive amount of data we are collecting, such as revolutions per minute, weight on bit, pump pressures, et cetera.","We're utilizing and continually improving algorithms that allow us to analyze performance relative to expectations and relative to prior wells. Our goal is to maximize the amount of energy generated by the rig that is actually being used to make new hole.","The combination of these items along with our experience of drilling more than 2,000 horizontal wells in the U.S. continues to drive significant drilling efficiencies.","With our teams' persistent focus on continuous improvement, we anticipate even further progress, particularly in the Delaware Basin, where we are still in the early days of development.","In the third quarter, we increased the average footage drilled per rig, per day by more than 30% over the average of the first half of the year. Our reduced drill-time has also led to a 38% cost reduction per lateral foot compared to 2016.","The continued drilling efficiencies that we are seeing allow us to maintain two rigs in the DJ Basin and five rigs in the Delaware Basin rather than increasing rig counts in both basins by year-end as previously planned.","On the completion side, our teams in each area continue to optimize designs to deliver maximum value. In addition to the higher proppant concentrations that we've been utilizing, we're also testing alternative stage and cluster spacing designs.","And with our post job data analytics on completions, we continue to refine our understanding of predicted versus actual performance of our stimulation designs. We continuously plow those learnings back into the next set of designs, always focused on creating the highest value completions for each area.","Ultimately, our drilling and completion execution has contributed to exceptional well productivity. Our wells continue to lead the pack for both oil and total production per foot in our focus areas in the Delaware and DJ Basins according to analysis by a third party.","Beginning in the DJ Basin, we continue to see strong well performance within our focus areas of Wells Ranch and East Pony. New well production from these low GOR areas led to record horizontal volumes in the third quarter of 103,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, along with a record oil mix of 54% across the basin.","Within three of our development plan areas in Wells Ranch, we've achieved rates over 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on 31 of 34 wells, with productions in the remaining three wells still increasing. These consistent results across Wells Ranch from our standard well design provide further confidence that our type curves will be increasing in the future.","Importantly, the strong well performance is contributing to greater capital efficiency. Year-to-date, the incremental production delivered from 2017 wells is significantly above that of our 2016 program and we've actually achieved that with 25 fewer wells brought online.","In the Eagle Ford, volumes and cash flow are increasing substantially as we continue to bring online the highly prolific South Gates Ranch wells. Late in September and early in October, flash flooding from localized storms caused the curtailment of a large portion of our Eagle Ford production, which impacted third quarter volumes on average by approximately 5,000 barrels a day equivalent. The teams were able to safely and efficiently bring production back to the pre-flood levels in mid-October. And we're currently on track to average north of 90,000 barrels a day equivalent in the fourth quarter.","Within the third quarter, we brought online four wells in North Gates Ranch, testing co-development of the Upper and Lower Eagle Ford using enhanced completions. While still early, the Upper Eagle Ford wells are performing in line with our expectations for the new completion designs and they are significantly outperforming the historical completions. Continued success in the Upper Eagle Ford, generating competitive returns, would derisk inventory for future development.","Moving to the Delaware Basin. In the third quarter we made significant progress on our transition to a full-field integrated style development. The majority of the wells brought online within the third quarter were long laterals on multi-well pads. 10 of these wells are currently flowing through the new Billy Miner central gathering facility, which started up in late July. The oil from this facility then flows on into the Advantage Pipeline system, which is owned and operated by Noble Midstream.","Our integrated approach with Noble Midstream Partners is providing tremendous operating efficiencies. With the additional midstream facilities expected to come online in the next few quarters, we're expanding oil throughput capacity from 15,000 barrels a day currently to 90,000 barrels a day by midyear 2018. And all of these central facilities will be interconnected to ensure reliable operations. With 60% of the EBITDA for the Delaware system still retained at the sponsor level, the financial advantages are certainly apparent with significant future drop-down potential in the years to come.","We're continuing to unlock value across multiple horizons in the Delaware. Our initial 3rd Bone Spring well on Monroe pad is performing exceptionally well, averaging more than 2,100 barrels a day equivalent for 60 days. Our third Wolfcamp B well, which commenced production late in the third quarter is outstanding and it's significantly outperforming prior Wolfcamp B wells in the early days.","The results we've seen from 3rd Bone Spring, Wolfcamp B and even the Wolfcamp C provide further confidence in our ability to realize value well beyond what we originally anticipated.","As we're progressing our development, we're realizing improvements in well performance from applying lessons learned. The Monroe pad was a great example. After modifying the flowback procedures from our initial 10,000-foot lateral brought online last quarter, we saw a significant uplift in performance in the Monroe Wolfcamp A long lateral wells.","Tracer analysis on both the Upper and Lower Wolfcamp A wells shows consistent contribution across the wellbore from the toe to the heel, and we're seeing shallower declines over the initial 60 days on productions.","In the fourth quarter, I'm looking forward to our initial produced water recycling test. We'll also be incorporating locally sourced 100 mesh sand and varying the mix within our completions. Both of these items have the potential to materially reduce our costs in the future.","Cash flow and volumes from the Delaware are expected to jump significantly in the fourth quarter, driven by a number of wells that came online late in the third quarter and an additional 20-plus wells commencing production in the fourth quarter.","Late in the year, we'll be bringing online a seven-well Calamity Jane pad, which will test vertical and lateral spacing across the Upper and Lower Wolfcamp A and 3rd Bone Spring horizons. This pad will tie into our second central gathering facility, which will double our throughput capacity within the basin when it comes online in December.","In the Eastern Mediterranean, once again we've set a record for gross sales volumes this quarter. Israel in-country demand led to 79 days of gross sale volumes above 1 Bcf a day. Late in September, approximately 4.5 years after start-up, we performed our first major planned maintenance at the Tamar platform. The maintenance required a full field shut-in, which was executed safely and efficiently, and the field was back online after a few days.","The brief maintenance coupled with a strong growing demand in Israel highlight the criticality of the Leviathan project in providing an additional source of natural gas for Israel's future.","Looking to the fourth quarter, we've maintained our total company sales volume expectation of 380,000 barrels a day equivalent to 390,000 barrels a day equivalent, which reflects the resilience of our business despite some weather and other non-recurring impacts.","Our Gulf of Mexico assets continue to perform exceptionally well. However, fourth quarter volumes will be impacted by two events: the temporary impacts of shutting in all production due to Hurricane Nate earlier this month as well as fewer royalty relief barrels, which is due to higher LLS price realizations than originally expected.","In West Africa, 4Q production is forecast to be in line with previous expectations. However, a change in lifting schedules between the partners has shifted some of our oil sales volumes from 4Q into 2018. None of these changes alter our view of the performance of these assets.","From a cash flow perspective, the changes in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa are nearly offset by an increased outlook for our high-margin natural gas volumes in the Eastern Mediterranean due to quicker than anticipated completion of maintenance in October and continuing robust demand. Of the changes in the offshore, the only one that is structural is the increased demand in Israel, which is certainly a good thing.","Moving to the U.S. onshore, which I know everybody is watching closely, total volumes and oil expectations are unchanged in the fourth quarter. In fact, every hydrocarbon in the U.S. onshore business is expected to be higher by double digits from the third quarter, driven by our Texas assets.","We have seen some shift between gas and NGLs as we true up our recovery models for performance to-date as well as increased contributions from South Gates Ranch.","As I mentioned, onshore oil remains unchanged. We've been talking all year about delivering a 40% increase in oil volumes from 1Q to 4Q. That was a target that was frankly met with skepticism from some, yet we've delivered almost 25% already from 1Q to 3Q and our projected growth from 3Q to 4Q gets us the rest of the way there.","It's interesting to now see some of the early notes yesterday and today that now call this guidance conservative. To me, that shift in external perception says a lot about the execution credibility that our teams have built over time. And our performance in 4Q will drive a material increase in operating cash flow in the U.S. onshore.","So to wrap up, we're delivering what we said we would in 2017. Our teams remain focused on our highest margin assets. We're driving capital efficiencies in the U.S. onshore while delivering a substantial volume and cash flow ramp throughout the year.","The Leviathan project is progressing on track and we continue to generate substantial cash flows from Tamar. The remainder of the year will be no exception. Our operational momentum will continue and the fourth quarter will provide a strong finish to 2017.","With that, Rebecca, let's open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Hey, Evan.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Morning.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, my first question is on the DJ. Do you have any color on how their capital efficiency changes when you move into Mustang in 2018? I mean, have you closed the returns gap that you disclosed last year at the Analyst Meeting between Wells Ranch, East Pony and Mustang? It sounded like you hinted at that at your comments and if you could provide any color, that would be helpful.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, that's a great question. I think if you look back at November, we did show slightly lower returns, I think, in the Mustang versus Wells Ranch and East Pony. Those returns that we showed in November are actually, I would say, the average of returns across that entire 75,000 net acres in Mustang, I think, it was over 900 locations we were showing. So that's the average over that entire section. Our initial focus in Mustang is going to be on the eastern edge of the IDP, which is an oilier part of the area. And we think the returns in those areas will be very similar to what we're seeing in Wells Ranch.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. So that'll keep up the trend that you've \u2013 where you've had success in getting that oil ratio up. Maybe on a second question, moving to the Med, great results in Tamar. Investors remain focused on Leviathan contracting pace. And I guess my question is what are your expectations for the pace of Leviathan gas contracting? Should it largely be back-end loaded? Any thoughts or just kind of confidence in that contracting program prior to start-up? Thanks.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Evan, great question. I think extreme confidence on our ability to fill up the first phase of Leviathan by the time it comes online. I think we'll have a great deal of clarity on that by this time next year but when you think about it on the three fronts there, that just the increasing demand in Israel itself, the continued push and movement to coal, from coal to gas. The \u2013 what we're seeing as far as movements and interest in the neighboring countries, the increase and solidify gas exports, I think we're in a great position. If you go back to one of the slides we laid out, I think, it was last call, we're engaged in discussions on volume and demand with customers that would probably be about twice as much as we need to fill up the remaining portion of this initial phase. So I'm extremely confident that by this time next year, we'll be able to sit here and have a great discussion with a lot of clarity on where the gas is going to be moving to and when.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Appreciate it, guys. Thank you.","Operator","From RBC Capital, we'll hear from Scott Hanold.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, hi. Thanks. Good morning.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Morning, Scott.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Morning, Scott.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, Dave, you had mentioned looking at opportunities for returning, I guess, cash to shareholders, if I interpreted that right, you're looking at various aspects of shareholder return. I guess from my seat (27:44), I guess, what we've seen in industry that infers stock buybacks, dividends with some of the capital that you might be able to bring in with some asset monetization or free cash flow with from Leviathan in the future. Can you give us some frameworks or context, how you all think of that?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I think that's something and making sure we're delivering the return to the shareholders has always been critical and important to us. Some of those considerations will, obviously, be on the table as we're starting to generate more cash and start to create more room as we move forward here.","I'll go back to what I laid out in my discussion, kind of our priorities are to continue to make sure we keep that strong balance sheet, focus on the return to shareholders, and look at that on a per share basis. So I think everything will be on the table there as we continue to create more visibility on the cash flow growth.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. So if I am interpreting again what you're saying, it's probably once Leviathan comes online is when some of those options will likely come onto the table?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think you obviously start to create a lot more room when Leviathan comes online. I mean, if you look at just the cash flow impact of Leviathan from going from a spending level in 2019 to a \u2013 if you fill up full capacity in 2020, that's about $1 billion change switch just over that year. So that creates a lot of capacity.","What I'd like to do is create more capacity in the near term also with some of the proceed acceleration that \u2013 that's not really even so much about how much proceeds are you generating but keeping the business focused on what we need to focus on to build our value going forward. So Leviathan, when it comes on, obviously, we can create some more room in the near term, that's even better.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then as my follow-up, you talked about looking at learnings from Tamar-8 and potentially applying that going forward. Can you give a little color on \u2013 a little bit on that? And what you might do different with some of these Leviathan wells?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Scott. I mean, I think the Tamar-8 reference is really to the increased reserve booking at Tamar. So, obviously, every time we go out and drill a well in a field, we gather a bunch more data and we go back and incorporate that in our models of the understanding of the field, and in this case it allowed us to increase the resources and reserves of Tamar by about 10%. So that's just kind of part of the normal process of evolution as you go out and learn more about a field.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. So there's nothing specific in terms what you did with that well that you'll apply differently to Leviathan?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","No. No. I don't think so.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Understood. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning, gentlemen. Gary, I was wondering if you could comment \u2013 in the Delaware, you highlighted a lot of drilling efficiencies that you're seeing ahead of your plan. I was wondering if you could just talk about kind of the inflationary environment you're seeing in the Delaware and the DJ? And how this is a \u2013 what you're seeing in terms of impacts to potential completion timing?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Arun. I mean, we really haven't seen much recently. In the first half of the year, we saw some increases on pumping services and steel, and we've talked about that in the past. But recently we haven't seen much. I mean, there's still folks out there asking for the occasional increase, but I wouldn't term it as anything significant.","I think as far as actually being able to get the services, that's as important or more important in my mind, and we really haven't had any issues there either.","I think that's driven by a couple of things. One, our long-term relationships with many of our key partners out there when we're completing the wells, and then just the level of activity that we've been able to maintain and the number of crews that we've been able to keep busy on a consistent basis. And once you get them, you don't let them go.","And so we haven't really had any issues from the \u2013 on the supply side, if you will, either. I think the Delaware certainly remains a hotter basin than the DJ, so it is a bit more challenging there, but again, nothing we haven't been able to overcome.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","How many crews are you running, Gary, between the DJ and Delaware right now?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Frac crews? About two...","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","...each on average.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Great. And just my follow-up, you guys have highlighted some successful tests of both the Wolfcamp A and the 3rd Bone. Could you highlight how this is shaping your thoughts on future development of those stack pay?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Sure. I mean, the Monroe pad that we brought on in late July was designed to test on one pad, completions in the Wolfcamp A Upper and Lower and the 3rd Bone Spring and work to confirm the spacing that we've got in mind as well as the lateral spacing between the zones to make sure we don't have any interference between the zones.","Nothing we've seen to-date suggests that our spacing assumptions are wrong. We've pumped chemical tracers in some zones. We haven't seen them in the others. We haven't seen any interference once on production, so I think that test is going quite well.","We're obviously bringing on a seven-well test on the Calamity Jane pad late this year in December. That'll be a similar test but with more wells; it'll be two Wolfcamp A Uppers \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 two Bone Spring, three Wolfcamp A Uppers, and two Wolfcamp A Lowers. So that'll be a good test not only of the vertical spacing again, but also the lateral spacing.","We also brought on a pad this quarter that had two Wolfcamp A lateral spacing tests, and we haven't seen really any interference there. So all this work is designed to really help us lay out what the optimum spacing is going to be, what the optimum development plan is going to be. We're always going to remain focused on what development plan creates the most value and so that goes to which zones we go out and drill and complete day one versus others that you may come back and get later. As far as those go, we've tested Wolfcamp B and C, as well, too. We brought on our third Wolfcamp B well this quarter and it's performing exceptionally well. We'll continue to watch that and see where that leads.","We've had good results from the Wolfcamp C, as well. We've got another Wolfcamp C well coming on late this year, so that'll be more data there. So it's all part of that process of really getting to the development plan, the spacing assumptions, the completion designs that generate the most value that we can for the shareholders.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's very helpful. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Next we'll go to Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, good morning, everyone.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Hey, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, you somewhat addressed this already, but you did mention now, I think, a target, I guess, of \u2013 you said corporate returns in double digits at $50 over the next several years.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Right.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Can you talk a little bit more about that in terms of are we talking returns on capital employed? What's the sort of dynamic of getting to that number? I think as I mentioned, you've obviously talked about the start-up of the Leviathan but if you could just put some more meat on the bones there, that would be great. Thanks.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Paul, yeah. We're talking about return on capital employed. I mean, if you go back through our history of presentations, Analyst Days, even last year, it was something that was always front and center in our discussion. And I think the path to that double-digit over the next few years is going to be twofold. It's going to be this onshore growth that we're seeing and the high-return focus of the DJ, Delaware and even the Eagle Ford that's contributing to that and that cash flow growth that we talked about on some of this and the increasing margins. And then Leviathan, also, is going to be a big kicker when it kicks in 2020. So it's the combination of both of those things that are going to drive that increase in EBITDA over time.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. And the idea was to basically, you mentioned, would be sort of $50 flat WTI I guess, would it?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Right. I mean, what we're saying is even \u2013 we're setting up our program so that we can deliver that over time here, even in a $50 world. And we've got increasing confidence on that when you look at just what's happening in both the onshore program and what's happened with solidifying the project in Israel.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Great.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","I think we're getting much greater line of sight.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Sure. And just a follow-up. Where does exploration sit in all this now that you've got that kind of line of sight and the scale of the assets you've got? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. No, I think on exploration, what we talked about going into this year, even late last year, is we've really focused that program, a much smaller budget but also pushing that so that best of the best comes to the top. We've had the ability to bring in some things, especially in the current environment, having our capabilities to bring in some things that are pretty interesting longer-term. But we've got some time to mature those and develop those and fit them into that long-range plan with a pretty strong discipline on how much we're going to spend on that but continuing to make the best of the best rise to the top there. And it's a great environment to do that in. So it's a (37:37) facility.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","So should we roll the budget for this year forward as the kind of spending level that you anticipate?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I mean, we're still working through that process but the exploration spend's not going to be much higher next year if that's what you're asking.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. And then can I just finally say what \u2013 is the CapEx going to be similar as well, overall?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think, probably it's a little early to get ahead of that. I think the couple things we've talked about and will continue to work through is in the onshore program, obviously, the Permian as it's developed through this year, will be a little higher next year than this year, just where we're ending on, and the Eagle Ford will probably be a little lower. And then in Leviathan, next year as we've said, it's the largest year of the three for Leviathan spend, so.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Very clear. Thank you.","Operator","From Bank of America, Doug Leggate.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Dave, one onshore and one offshore please. I guess, the offshore question first. So Leviathan, obviously, you've got line of sight for this thing generating potentially substantial free cash flow as you pointed out. What happens after that? I realize it's a long-term question, but if offshore spending is kind of slowing down, do you have a repatriation issue? Do we go to phase 2 Leviathan? What's the thinking in terms of what happens longer-term?","Kenneth M. Fisher - Noble Energy, Inc.","Doug, this is Ken Fisher. How are you? Repatriation, not really a concern. If you look over the last \u2013 since 2013, I think we've bought $4.5 billion back with no incremental tax cost from overseas. We still have some capacity to do that. I think we repatriated about $155 million in third quarter.","And then as you bring Leviathan on, you're also at the period where you have the oil profits tax on Tamar in Israel. So that, I think, allows you to have an efficient repatriation program continue.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Ken, while you have the line, I'm wondering if you could just tell us where you want your balance sheet to be as you move forward.","Kenneth M. Fisher - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think, as we've always looked at it, we like to maintain strong liquidity. So we finished the quarter at about 20% liquidity to assets, so very strong. We managed the maturity profile, so we actually took out some \u2013 a $1 billion 8.25% bond this quarter and replaced that with two tranches, a 10 and a 30, both at record low coupons.","If you look, similar to our corporate returns, all our credit metrics continue to improve. I think the thing that will be of particular note is with the Tamar reserves add and then bringing Leviathan to sanction, our leverage full cycle ratio looks really strong going forward over the next couple of years.","So we continue to be mindful of all the credit metrics. And then, I think, as I said that the glide path to lower overall leverage is clear. So we like the BBB space because it's \u2013 we've been historically the efficient frontier of E&P financing, and it's also means you have market access regardless of conditions.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","And, Doug, I think, just to add to what Ken's saying, what it does is it gets you in the place between the things we're doing with the portfolio near-term and Leviathan coming on longer-term that you've got the glide path to get yourself back to your debt metrics and so forth that you were entering this downturn.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate that. Dave, my follow-up is just a quick one on cadence. You, obviously, had some completion timing issues back-end loaded in Q3. I just wondered if you could give us, to use your word, a glide path towards an exit rate this year? Where do you think we exit 2017 on oil? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","I think we've laid out a pretty clear path, as you say, with the number of completions coming on in the Permian. Some of those will be in December so forth, so I think as you exit December, we'll be in great shape relative to what we've laid out for our average for the quarter.","So you've got that whole Calamity Jane pad that Gary talked about coming on in December, beginning of December, so I think and you tie that in with what NBLX has been talking about on their growth towards the end of the year, I think our onshore oil volumes are in great shape, as you highlighted, exiting the year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I was hoping for a number, but I'll leave it at that. Thanks, guys.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","I figured you were.","Operator","And we'll go to Bob Morris from Citi.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Gary, you highlighted the significant improvement in the Wolfcamp B well this quarter, which was your third Wolfcamp B well, but on a per lateral foot, that IP-30 was significantly above the second Wolfcamp B you announced last quarter. Can you give us a little bit of description on why that was? Was there, what, any completion technique there boosted that so much? And how repeatable is that on a go-forward basis on a per lateral foot, given that rate you saw?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, no, you're right. I mean, it's on a per foot basis, it's quite a bit higher than anything we've done before. I would caution you a little bit, it's a shorter lateral. It's about 3,800 foot, so just like we've talked in the past that on the long laterals, we ramp them up a bit slower and so you see maybe a little bit suppressed initial rates on a per foot basis on the short laterals as kind of the opposite of that. So I wouldn't use that calculated rate per foot and assume long laterals are going to be at that rate certainly going forward.","As far as what we did, I think it's just a continuing evolution of learning about the zone, learning about the completions that we're pumping into them. It's only the third well, and so we expect to continue to learn more as we go just like we have in the other zones and look forward to our next test in the Wolfcamp C, which will be later this year as well and see what improvement we can continue to make in those zones that \u2013 frankly, we really didn't pay anything for when we bought Rosetta or Clayton Williams, either one. So it's nice to see this amount of performance from those zones.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Sure. And then, Dave, my second question is, you could bring in significant capital in monetizing some of the assets if you were to do so that you're not allocating capital to this year and get the balance sheet back to where it was entering the downturn and still have some cash left. I know the Eastern Med is sort of ring-fenced and being self-funding, and right now you're targeting to spend within operating cash flow and what you do in U.S. onshore. But what would be the appetite with \u2013 if you did have significant funds for monetizations beyond repairing the balance sheet to actually accelerate U.S. onshore activity just given the results and the returns you have there beyond just spending within the cash flow that (45:15) those assets generate?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think, obviously, we've got the flexibility to do that. I think what we'd be looking at pretty hard is just how has the equity and market performed relative to considerations on returning value to shareholders.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. So is it you would look at that option or possibility, it just depends relative to where the shares are versus the share buybacks? So those would be some of your primary options once you repair the balance sheet?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, those are your two other considerations at that point, and we're going to look at what creates the most value for our shareholders.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","...Bob.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Leo Mariani with NatAlliance Securities (45:56).","Unknown Speaker","Hey, guys. I was hoping you could maybe touch a little bit on the CONE divestiture, whether or not that's something you can kind of give us a little bit more clarity on the timing of the proceeds? And I know that you guys are obviously continuing to work on Tamar sell-downs, but, I guess, apart from Tamar, are there any other kind of asset sales in process?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we're always looking at how can we accelerate value on things that we can pull value forward on, so we'll continue to work on some of those things that we don't see fitting in our investment profile over the next few years. But as far as CONE and Tamar, Ken can give you an update on those.","Kenneth M. Fisher - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Leo (46:44), I think on the CONE thing, you may be aware we are involved in a lawsuit. So I think we want to be careful to respect that. I would expect resolution of that over the next few months, and so we'll continue to keep that in view.","And then on Tamar, as we've communicated before, we continue to expect to monetize the 7.5% remaining sell-down some time over the next 12-month type of window. And so that's being worked as well.","Unknown Speaker","Okay.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","But I think that the whole point of that is we're continuing to be able to look forward to both of those things.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. That's helpful. Maybe just jumping over to the Delaware real quick, obviously you guys talked about some significant efficiency improvements on the drilling side. Obviously, there's been some service cost inflation earlier this year. You guys are just kind of starting to get more towards Noble wells, where you guys have done all the drilling and all the completions work.","Do you guys think you're going to be able to continue to maybe reduce some of those Delaware costs as you work our way into next year, even if there is some modest service creep on the cost side? Is this something where we think that we're still pretty early days in the efficiency? Maybe you can just kind of talk to that a little bit.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Leo (48:08), and I think we will. I mean, if you go back to what we showed in November, we were showing a cost for the Wolfcamp A drilling complete of $8.5 million for a 7,500-foot lateral. If you'll recall, that was based on a 2,000 pound per foot completion design.","Obviously, since then, as you note, there's been some inflation in the industry, especially in the Delaware. We've also increased that base design from 2,000 pounds to 3,000 pounds. Obviously, both of those are pressure on cost, but we've also delivered quite a bit of efficiencies as you've heard us talk about pretty much every quarter through new drilling records that we've set, new efficient completion designs that we've come up with.","I'd say, given where we are right now, we're probably still in that same window for a 7,500-foot well but with 50% more sand in the completions and with eating the inflation. So \u2013 and that really is now just getting started on multi-well pad drilling. And some of the drilling efficiencies that I alluded to are really very recent, here in the third quarter.","And we've still got other things we're testing, too, right? We've talked about local sand. That has the potential to drive completion costs down several hundred thousand dollars per well. We're testing some other things that we'll be talking about probably in the future too. But I think there's still a lot of potential to drive costs down in this play to increase efficiencies and to just get more capitally efficient overall.","It's not that different than what we've delivered in the DJ time and time again, right? I mean we continue to set records in the DJ on the drilling side. We continue to look for ways to make our completions more efficient, more cost-effective. We've done a number of things, testing a number of things still in the DJ today that have the potential to drive costs down. Kind of in that same window, couple of hundred thousand dollars per well if they work out.","So it's a constant focus for us. It's something the team's never let up on, and we look at things like inflation as a challenge, how do we offset that, how do we basically eat that and still return the same value or more to shareholders.","Unknown Speaker","Okay, great color. Thanks.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, we'll hear from Ryan Todd.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good. Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe a quick one, you've \u2013 a first one on portfolio management. You've talked around a little bit about the potential to monetize non-core parts of the portfolio. We've seen some other similar offshore type assets monetize recently. As you look at Gulf of Mexico and West Africa, should we consider both of these non-core going forward? And what would be the thought process in terms of monetization? Is it clearly a matter of price? Is it a matter of strategic simplification? And how do you think about the benefits of either bringing in cash early versus the benefits of longer-term cash flow from these assets?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well. I think as we've talked about, I think we've been pretty consistent on if we can accelerate value and realize the value that we'd get holding onto the asset, on any of our assets that we've looked at, we'll do that. And first part's making sure you understand the value of the asset.","So I think in any of those areas, we'll continue to be open to scenarios, where we can accelerate value on that and protect the value that we see from those assets. I'd say the assets themselves are still contributing nice cash flow. I think Gary talked about some of that. I think we've seen some of that on some of the slides that we've put out there, but they are declining assets that we're not investing as much capital in, so we'll continue to look at those.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then maybe a quick follow-up on the U.S. onshore. In the Eagle Ford, I guess, how should we think about \u2013 you mentioned that capital would probably be a little bit lower in 2018 versus 2017 in the Eagle Ford. Is there a strategy that we should think about in terms of how you look to manage that asset?","Are completions \u2013 should we expect them to be kind of lumpy quarter-to-quarter? Will you try to manage it for \u2013 to hold volumes flat? Should we expect it to be slightly declining or slightly growing? Any thoughts you might be able to give on kind of the trajectory of how we should think about that asset would be great. Thanks.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I think overall the trajectory is going to be \u2013 the activity level, at least, is going to be somewhat similar to this year, where we had a couple of rigs out there for the first half of the year drilling and then largely brought on the completions kind of 2Q through 4Q. I think plan for next year will probably look somewhat similar to that. As Dave said, it'll be less capital but it'll be a similar plan as far as taking the rigs out early and then bringing the completions on over time.","Obviously, the South Gates Ranch area that we've been active in are the most prolific wells that come on at very high rates. And you're clearly seeing that this year with the ramp in the Eagle Ford. And our expectation will be north of 90,000 barrels a day equivalent in the fourth quarter. You'll see some decline in the first half of the year probably as those wells start to come off until we could start bringing new wells on next year. So I'd kind of think of it that way.","I think as far as longer-term, it's going to be a matter of how well we can repeat early results from the Upper Eagle Ford and how economic we can make that program and how competitive it can be with all the other great options we've got in the portfolio. So if the Upper Eagle Ford turns out to be a competitive program that we want to invest dollars in, that adds at least a couple of years of inventory and runway to the program there.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question will come from Dave Kistler with Simmons, Piper Jaffray.","David Kistler - Simmons & Company, Piper Jaffray & Co.","Morning, guys.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Hey, Dave.","David Kistler - Simmons & Company, Piper Jaffray & Co.","A few maybe little housekeeping items. Kind of looking at your comments of wells performing above type curves and Tamar uplift from a reserve standpoint, DD&A guidance is flattish for Q4, but I would expect that that's obviously trending down versus what we're seeing as those reserves come in. Is that a fair way to be thinking about how we look at it for maybe 4Q and modeling going forward?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","I think, in 4Q, I think it's a fair representation what we've laid out as to where we are now. As the reserves get finalized at the end of the year, then we'll adjust fourth quarter for what the reserve impact is. I'd say you're spot on if you add in the Leviathan reserves that we booked this year, the Tamar that we've talked about, and then what's more important to the DD&A piece, the performance of the onshore activity this year. It should be a pretty good year from a...","David Kistler - Simmons & Company, Piper Jaffray & Co.","Yeah, yeah.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","...reserve standpoint as we exit the year.","David Kistler - Simmons & Company, Piper Jaffray & Co.","Yeah, that's helpful clarification. And then one other one. As we look at LOE for 4Q, your guide went up a little bit versus 3Q, or the guide you gave at, I guess, the 3Q time period \u2013 excuse me, 2Q time period. Can we talk a little bit what's driving that? Is that activity shift? Is we putting more workover activity into some of the legacy verticals? Anything like that? Just trying to get a handle on that.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Really, the sole driver of that slight increase there, Dave, is some workover activity in the Gulf of Mexico that we originally thought was going to occur in 2018. It's a non-operated asset and looks like that's going to pull forward into the fourth quarter of 2017. So that's really the only thing driving it.","When you look at the underlying kind of day-to-day operating costs, we continue to make great progress on keeping costs in check, driving them down in areas where you would expect as we increase volumes. Even the DJ, as we noted, we've subbed $4.00 per barrel unit LOE now. So that's been a tremendous focus for the teams and they're doing a great job of bringing costs down and it's really just this one acceleration of a workover offshore that's driving that slight increase.","David Kistler - Simmons & Company, Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Appreciate that. And just kind of thinking about that, coupling it with timing of completions, having workover activity there, having some lifting slip around a little bit. While all those might have an impact on 4Q, they should be, I would think, a net positive for FY 2018 and kind of how we start heading into the year on a growth perspective. Is that also a fair way to characterize it?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, I think that's fair. Certainly, the storm down time is \u2013 it's not loss barrels, it's deferral of production, which will work its way into 2018. The change in the lifting schedule in EG with some partner liftings moving around on us, takes sales volumes out of 4Q, that moves into 2018 as well. So both of those, while temporary in nature and impacting 4Q, are actually additive to 2018.","David Kistler - Simmons & Company, Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Well, great. I appreciate the clarifications, guys. Thanks so much.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","You bet, Dave.","Operator","And we'll go to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Dave. Thanks for sneaking me in here and happy Halloween to everyone there at Noble.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Hey, same to you, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Dave, in your prepared comments, you gave us a lot of your thoughts about how you're looking at CapEx and cash flow in 2018 but I wondered if I could just ask kind of the same question I think was asked earlier but from a slightly different angle. If you look at the Eastern Med, certainly if you assume \u2013 or it looks like if you assume you get that 7.5% sale of Tamar, that's going to be, on a net basis, free cash flow before you even look at the Tamar cash flow. So as we look at U.S. onshore, the rest of the portfolio, it looks like you guys could be in a position to substantially outspend your U.S. onshore cash flow. Is that the right way to \u2013 is that the right conclusion to draw? Or maybe you could give us any update on your thinking about how you're approaching the issue for 2018.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","I think I'll go back to what we've said on 2018 when you consider the Tamar sale and the NBLX proceeds contribution. The Tamar sale will help cover the funding of Leviathan or the increased funding of Leviathan for next year. And the NBLX proceeds will help cover the capital on the onshore U.S. So I mean you look at the total picture and that total sources of cash will cover our uses of cash, as we've talked about. And that's consistent going clear back to last November the way we've talked about our program, not only for next year but over that multi-year period.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful, Dave. Thank you. And then if I could ask a question about the Delaware Basin long lateral wells that you guys talked about. You talked about how they're showing this shallower decline in the, I guess, 30 to 60-day window versus the IP-30s. Is there something different you guys have done versus early wells, either in terms of the completions of the flowback? Or was there anything in that that surprised you? Because it looks like a significant positive.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Charles, I had mentioned in the opening comments that we modified flowback procedures based on the results that we saw from our first 10,000-foot lateral prior to the Monroe pad. So based on that, we did modify flowback procedures. We're quite happy with the results on the long laterals on the Monroe pad. We're \u2013 as you point out, we are seeing not a lot of decline between the 30 days and the 60 days. I think it's fair to say that we're going to be looking at the results on these wells and continuing to look for where we can further modify things going forward to make the performance even better on future wells. But it's certainly part of our philosophy to manage the flowback, to provide really the ultimate maximum value for the shareholders and not manage to perhaps a headline-generating IP 24-hour kind of rate. We're managing for the long-term value here.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Right. Thanks for that color, Gary.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","You bet.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Charles.","Operator","From Stifel, we'll hear from Mike Scialla.","Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Morning, everybody. Gary, maybe just a follow-up on that last question. With the modified flowback, do you think there's anything differently going on in the reservoir when you are choking back these wells? Or is it mostly just you, I guess, manage the surface facilities and match those up with the flow rates better?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. You cut out a little bit there, Mike, but I think I got the gist of the question. It's really tied more towards managing flowback downhole than trying to match some surface limitation on the surface. And it's really about how do we create the environment for the best recovery across that entire lateral length? So we've talked about how through tracer work and some other work, we feel like we're getting a consistent contribution across that entire lateral length from the toe to the heel. The managed flowback is designed to achieve that.","Again, if you go out and you just kind of rip the choke open and go for a high headline rate, you're probably not going to get that same consistent contribution across the long lateral and possibly do some damage longer-term. So, again, we're managing for the long-term. We're seeing the results that we expect to see based on the philosophy that we're taking and we're quite happy with it.","Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Good. That's what I was after. And on the Niobrara, you had mentioned in the release that you'd had to use a lower proppant intensity at East Pony maybe than you wanted to. I want to see if \u2013 are you going to be able to go to the 1,800-pound level here in the fourth quarter? Or what does that look like going forward? And is 1,800 pounds kind of your optimum for the East Pony and Wells Ranch area?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I mean 1,800 pounds is still our base design for DJ. We've tested designs, obviously, larger and smaller than that. We'll continue to test designs that are different than 1,800 pounds. But that is the base design. That's what most of the wells are going to be completed on where we can. The East Pony wells, as you mentioned, were permitted quite some time ago. They're on federal acreage and they were permitted at lower concentration levels. We made the decision that based on the length of time that it would take to go back and re-permit those with the federal government, we decided to go ahead and stick with the designs that we had. That was the best value decision, and those wells are performing nicely.","I think when you look forward at fourth quarter, we've got 20-plus wells coming on in the DJ. Roughly half of those are in Wells Ranch and half of those are in East Pony. Most of those East Pony wells are still going to be those lower concentration wells on federal acreage in the fourth quarter.","Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. How about for next year? Do you go back to the base design in East Pony?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","I think next year, we'll still work through the budget, right, and figure out where activity is going to go. We've talked about taking some rigs to the Mustang and doing some drilling down there. That will be a larger part of the program next year. So we'll see as we start talking through the budget and sharing that with you guys how much activity we end up with in East Pony. But certainly, our intention over time would be to bring the completion designs and the permits back in-line with what we think the best base design is going forward.","Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","We have time for one more question. And that will come from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Can you talk a bit more about the production trajectory, the U.S. onshore production trajectory, particularly onshore oil in 2018? I think in your comments, you talked about the Eagle Ford after the sharp ramp-up in the second half and fourth quarter, declining in the first half, and then as new wells are completed, rising in the second half. Is that the way to think about it? Should the ramp-up in the DJ be constant through the year or more back-end loaded? And then should the Permian be a bit more front-end loaded because of late 2017 completions?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I think, Gary kind of laid out the picture on Eagle Ford, which will be probably some decline in the first half of the year and increase in the second half of the year. I think the biggest driver for the oil story for next year will continue to be the Permian, which will continue to grow through next year when you look at the activity levels and just the wells coming on. So I think that will be a constant ramp through next year.","DJ is probably a little more back-end loaded after that next facility comes online.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, that's right. The next DCP plant comes on in fourth quarter timeframe next year, so you'll see a ramp probably more back-end loaded there.","As Dave points out, the Eagle Ford trajectory that I talked to earlier, given the gas content there, that doesn't really affect the oil trajectory that much through the year. It's really the Delaware that's going to drive it. And given the activity levels that we have going now and the pace that we're going to be bringing wells on, I'd expect to see a steady increase through the year there.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And then my follow-up is on the DJ. Can you talk about any discussions you've had with the state and local governments and regulators on setbacks, non-producing flowlines, updates on that? And then as you look ahead over the next few years, how you view risk of policy or tax changes impacting your capital efficiency?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","I think the conversation has been very positive. I mean, even look at what the governor has been putting out, and what he's even put out recently for legislative and regulatory changes, and it's all kind of \u2013 a lot of it's focused on the flowline inspections and so forth that with \u2013 the whole industry got heavily engaged in earlier this year. I think particularly when you look at where our acreage is located, we're in a great position there.

Finally, I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements, as well as references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those. With that, let me turn the call over to Chuck.","Chuck Davidson","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. My opening comments are going to be brief today. Our leadership transition that we announced last April remains on schedule with the announcement this past week of the election of Dave as our new CEO.","Dave will be an excellent CEO for Noble Energy and is perfect to lead the Company through its next phase of growth. He's been an integral part of our success to this stage and has all the skills, as well as an outstanding leadership team to support him as we move forward.","I'll continue as Chairman until next May, when I will be retiring from Noble Energy. My job between now and then is to work closely with Dave and the executive team to make sure that this transition continues to unfold smoothly and seamlessly and I have all the confidence that it will. I do want to take a step back for a moment and share my thoughts on where I believe Noble Energy is today and where we are headed. Noble is a Company that is built for the long-term. We have said that many times in the past. We've established ourselves as a diversified exploration and production Company that excels in onshore unconventional development, as well as offshore exploration.","In the U.S., we have core positions in two of the premier unconventional oil and gas plays, which are delivering value for our Company and its shareholders. Offshore, we have three core areas, which provided meaningful volume and cash flow growth through exploration success and project execution.","In addition, we\u2019ve a material exploration program in front of us, which will provide running room for the future.","Our diversified portfolio of assets is designed to deliver value in a variety of operating environments. As we've said before, we are not a single play Company, nor are we limited to a single commodity market. We have a portfolio of opportunities around the world that is well-balanced between liquids, as well as both domestic and international national gas, which gives us choices to effectively allocate capital and create value.","This portfolio results in a very unique, multi-year profile for a Company. It's why I believe that Noble Energy is well-positioned to deliver positive differential performance over the coming years. So with that quick introduction let me turn the call over to Dave and the team.","Dave Stover","Thanks Chuck. I appreciate those nice comments, and before I launch into the quarter, let me make a few comments of my own. The time goes by so fast that it is hard to believe I worked with Chuck for about 25 years now, from ARCO to Vastar to Noble. One of the things I admire about Chuck is his ability to handle adversity and always be thinking of long-term implication. It is a testament to him that these traits have become part of the DNA of Noble Energy.","I've been at Noble now for close to 12 years and it's been amazing to be part of the transformation of this Company and I truly believe the best is yet to come. When I think about doubling our volume in four of our five core areas in the next few years, and at the same time, having an exploration program focused on delivering a new core area, Noble is well-positioned for the future.","Another of Chuck's strengths is his focus on succession planning and I owe him a great deal of gratitude for mentoring me all these years. I believe we have a leadership team that provides a competitive advantage for years to come. We mentioned some of the additional adjustments in our press release last week and I'm pleased with the operations leadership that we've built. Some of them are here with me today, Gary Willingham, Susan Cunningham and Keith Elliott.","Now to talk about the quarter, I plan to keep my prepared remarks a bit shorter than in the past since we have expanded the operations section of the release with more highlights and details. I'm sure David would appreciate your feedback on this change. It was another exciting quarter here at Noble energy. Sales volumes for the quarter were above the mid-point of guidance, driven by record sales in three of our five core areas, including the DJ Basin, Marcellus, and Eastern Mediterranean. Our U.S. onshore assets continued to deliver outstanding results, as our understanding of the DJ Basin and Marcellus grows.","Our major projects in the Gulf of Mexico remain on track to deliver significant growth beginning in 2015. And in the Eastern Mediterranean, our teams continue to make progress capturing more gas markets, as the regional demand for our natural gas continues to grow. It's definitely been a busy quarter for Noble Energy.","Let's talk about our core areas. Starting with the U.S. onshore, we delivered record production in both the DJ Basin and Marcellus on the back of some strong execution of our horizontal programs. As you can see on slide 4, the horizontal programs have outstanding growth over the last year, up 50% over the equivalent period a year ago when adjusted for asset sales.","During the third quarter, we brought online 123 wells. We expect to bring on an additional 172 wells horizontal wells during the fourth quarter, putting us on track to meet our planned year-end exit rate. In fact, we have already brought online more than one-third of the planned fourth-quarter wells this month alone, and are currently producing 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent from the horizontal program in the U.S. onshore. In the DJ Basin, production was up 15% from the third quarter last year.","Our volume was reduced by a few thousand barrels per day as a result of facility downtime, some of which was mentioned in last quarter's call. We continue to work closely with our midstream partner to increase capacity and improve reliability. Recently, new compression and dehydration capacity has been added, which has contributed to new system throughput records, and several other incremental projects are expected to start up in the coming months. We feel good about where third-party infrastructure is heading and its ability to keep up with our activity levels.","We continue to focus on improving well performance in three ways. The first is through extended laterals, where we are clearly seeing better investment efficiency. In the quarter, 30% of the wells drilled were combination of mid and long laterals. Another focus is increased density. We have highlighted on slide 5 the initial results of our down spacing test in section 30 of the Wells Ranch IDP, results from this test are very encouraging and while early, the wells are performing at or above the type curve. We have additional down spacing tests coming online in other areas during the fourth quarter.","The third focus for improved well performance is enhanced completion techniques. We are also seeing encouraging results in this area. Our initial Plug-n-Perf completions at the Peaks\/Peppler pad in the core IDP continue to out-perform the type curve after five months of production. Late in the quarter, we brought online an additional four wells utilizing Plug-n-Perf completion design and we plan to bring online an additional 20 Plug-n-Perf completions by the end of 2014.","Ultimately, we have a huge platform of resources to work from as we continue to improve investment efficiency and ultimate recovery. We're making progress on a number of our Noble operated infrastructure products that will enable us to meet our long-term growth productions.","We recently expanded the oil infrastructure at the Wells Ranch Central Processing Facility. This facility is tied in to the DCP Rocky Compressor station, which is expected to come online in the first half of 2015 with a capacity of 100 million cubic feet per day and in the northern Colorado area, the Keota gas plant remains on schedule to start up in the fourth quarter, with an initial capacity of 15 million cubic feet per day. Plans are then to double its capacity in the first quarter of 2015.","This facility will provide significant incremental capacity in the liquid rich area of East Pony. The story in the Marcellus is very similar to the DJ Basin and it starts with a great execution and includes improving well performance, enhanced completions, and down spacing. In the quarter, production was up an impressive 31% over the previous quarter and the liquids component has now increased to 13% of this area's production. During the quarter, we had some very encouraging results delineating a new area in West Virginia. We began flowing back wells from the Oxford number, Oxford-1 and Shirley-1 pads and the Oxford-Pennsboro-Shirley area and you can see their performance on slide 6.","These are the first two pads online in the area and the initial performance is above type curve. The Oxford pad is our first 550-foot down spacing test in the area and we are encouraged by the high initial liquids contribution. The next pad coming online in this area is Missouri is the Pennsboro-1 in the fourth quarter.","We continue to manage our portfolio of assets and look for opportunities to bring value forward. During the quarter, we successfully completed the CONE Midstream MLP Initial Public Offering, which generated over $200 million in net proceeds to Noble Energy. In fact, CONE's current market capitalization stands at $1.7 billion, of which our share is $550 million. The proceeds from this transaction, along with our non-core assets divestment program, have contributed to our strong balance sheet, as we continue to invest in our major products and onshore horizontal development programs.","So as we look toward fourth quarter and the significant growth ahead for the U.S. onshore area, we are confident that we're in a position to deliver and enter 2015 in great shape. Let's move onto the Gulf of Mexico, an area that is a bit underappreciated in our portfolio today. Over the last year, we have had tremendous performance from our legacy fields, maintaining flat production levels with active reservoir and well management plans. Of specific note, the Galapagos field continues to outperform expectations, averaging 9000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net in the quarter.","Cumulative gross production from Galapagos has reached 36 million barrels of oil equivalent in just 25 months. The result is more than two times payout of the investment in two years, with the strong current production and up hole zones still to be produced. Earlier in the quarter, we announced final well results at the Katmai discovery and Dantzler appraisal well. Katmai represents our fifth operated Gulf of Mexico discovery in a row and provides another meaningful project to our lineup of Gulf of Mexico developments.","With the appraisal success at the Dantzler providing an increase in resource size, and the development work being done at Big Bend, the Rio Grande development will lead a sizable oil volume increase from the Gulf of Mexico over the next couple of years. We're looking forward to the near-term impact from our Gulf of Mexico developments. All major contracts have been awarded and offshore facility modifications have commenced for all ongoing projects. The project line-up can be seen on slide 7. First production is only about a year away for Big Bend.","The initial net production rate from each field is expected to be in excess of 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with over 80% oil. By designing Big Bend infrastructure carefully, we were able to make Dantzler part of that development and accelerate first production to the first quarter of 2016.","On the exploration front, we expect to spud the Madison well any day now, which is an acceleration of our original plans. Madison is another meaningful exploration test in the Miocene trend, where we have a proven track record of success. The well is located near the Galapagos field, and if successful, will be a tie-back to a nearby facility, results from the well are expected early 2015.","Internationally, our assets in West Africa continued to perform extremely well. The decline rates at our fields in Equatorial Guinea have lower than expected as a result of strong reservoir performance and production management. I'm particularly pleased with how the teams are managing these liquid rich assets, which provide significant cash flow for the business.","Looking ahead, we will be resuming exploration drilling in West Africa, with the Cheetah prospect offshore Cameroon in 2015. We recently added Woodside to our partnership for this well. In the Eastern Mediterranean, over the course of the last six months, we have executed letters of intent for regional gross daily volumes of over 1.5 billion cubic feet per day and total volumes of over 8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to these customers. These agreements highlight the long-term demand for Tamar and Leviathan gas and all parties are focused on completing them as soon as possible.","We've shown on slide 9 our expected regional sales for Tamar and Leviathan, which includes an LOI for interruptible sales from Tamar to Egyptian domestic customers. We anticipate we could be in position to provide around 200 million cubic feet per day at off-peak hours to Egypt, as soon as regulatory approvals are received.","The compression project at the Ashdod onshore receiving terminal, which handles gas for Tamar, remains on schedule to be complete by next summer. Once complete, peak capacity at Tamar will be 1.2 billion cubic feet per day. This is part of a multi-year expansion at Tamar, which will increase capacity to 2 billion cubic feet per day by 2017 to meet growing demand in the Eastern Mediterranean.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, slide 10 highlights our anticipated production growth. We expected to bring on a record number of horizontal wells in our U.S. onshore program, which underpins our production ramp. Natural gas demand in Israel is normally lighter in the fourth quarter. Our sales volume range for the quarter is 307,000 to 327,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, consistent with earlier guidance, but adjusted for the non-core divestiture recently competed in the Piceance Basin.","It is worth noting that our fourth-quarter oil volumes are expected to be 36% of the mix, up 3% from the 33% in the third quarter. This is driven by West Africa and DJ volumes. We look forward to a strong close to 2014 setting us up well for 2015. While it is too early for details, we plan to remain flexible with our 2015 capital program as we monitor the commodity outlook for oil and domestic natural gas. Our diverse portfolio of oil, domestic and international gas, combined with a strong balance sheet, provides us options to continue to build value in a variety of operating environments.","With that, Cassandra, we would like to go ahead and open the call for questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And we will take our first question from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","The first question following up on your last comment on 2014 CapEx, I know what your investor presentation in December at several slides that describe your risk management and those potentially relevant for today was cash flow at risk slides and in the slide you tested it down (indiscernible) for all '14 and '16 at $75 GI, 320 and I think it was a $5 (indiscernible) and that was $2.5 billion cash flow swing and you stated there was a minimum risk of breaching your key debt metrics and so I know you\u2019ve a significant liquid hedge and liquidity to maybe just kind of thinking back to that slide, can I conclude how Noble would operate in a $75 WTI environment or maybe explain how you think about that liquidity and willingness to draw on that liquidity to deliver the five-year and longer term growth plan.","Dave Stover","I think Evan as I\u2019ve mentioned it's little too early to get into exactly what we'll do next year. We're going to look at different sensitivities to commodity price obviously versus where that now both down and up on that and we will continue to do that cash flow at risk analysis as we've always done. I think when you look at our program for next year the main levers are the major -- when you look at the capital portion the major project timing on that, exploration program size and pace of the onshore development. I think as you mentioned we also have a nice hedge book for next year that kind of minimizes some of that impact on pricing swing. So we'll continue to look at all of that.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Maybe a different CapEx question that relates to your recent and successful CONE IPO. I know you put forth different pie charts on facilities CapEx with a pretty big wedge in that $3.3 billion U.S. onshore 2014 CapEx but how much of that or what did you spend this year? I mean Marcellus facilities CapEx given the CONE vehicle now gives you an ability to convert that CapEx investment to get back into cash at a reasonable timeframe.","Dave Stover","I don't have the number with me right now but it -- what you've seen in both the Marcellus and the DJ has been kind of increasing facility spend as we've gotten further down the road on some of these facilities. I mean in the DJ we have talked about the integrated development plans up there and in the Marcellus we're actually adapting some of that thought process into the Marcellus. So you\u2019ve seen an increase on both of those and obviously that led into the Marcellus to a CONE IPO which was very advantageous and highlighted some value in that area. So I think you'll continue to see some facilities spend increase but I don't have the exact numbers with me here. But it will continue to ramp up in both areas over time as both areas continue to grow.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","And just one other follow-up just to that -- given the success there and it is still more recent -- does it change your thoughts of potentially using that structure to monetize or to better capitalize infrastructure spending in other parts of your U.S. onshore or actually offshore (indiscernible) it will be onshore.","Dave Stover","To your point we've additional infrastructure coming on offshore too with big major projects. But we will continue to look at as I mentioned in my notes that helped unlock value in the Marcellus, we will continue to look at in the other parts of our business as the facility spend continues to grow and become a bigger part of the business.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I've two questions also if I may, Chuck it's kind of a follow-up to Evans CapEx question. There is a chatter around breakeven of shale economics in the U.S. I'm just curious as to how if you could share your perspective on your portfolio. In other words, is there a level or recourse to a level where you would consider at least a mid to high grade your capital allocation, I guess in the DJ in particular and I\u2019ve got a follow-up.","I was trying to get your perspective on how you see the (indiscernible) breaking even for U.S. unconventional production, really specifically to your portfolio and whether there is a level that you would consider that you need to hydrate your capital allocation within the DJ particular.","Chuck Davidson","I'm going to let Dave carry on with that but I'll just continue with the theme that I\u2019ve had before is that in many instances in the unconventional, it's not so much the breakeven economics, it's managing your cash flow and your balance sheet. And I think that's where for many producers we will see as they look at a particular commodity environment. We've seen this cycle on natural gas several times the past couple years. Oil, we've seen the cycle as well and I think it's a matter of managing cash flow and in some of these unconventional plays have very strong economics even at lower oil prices but you want to manage your balance sheet. And I'll leave it to Dave to comment on Noble's portfolio and how he looks at it.","Dave Stover","I think it was designed this way but we're set up to be in two of the best unconventional plays in the U.S. and I think that's borne out when you look at a lot of the analysis of breakeven economics that various folks do on these plays and especially in the DJ, it looks very good against that. Obviously there is different portions of it that have different economics as you have different oil and gas mix across the play but we're very comfortable and very pleased that we've got the portfolio we have, whether it's our onshore portfolio or the other components of our core areas. I mean that\u2019s the whole basis for that diversified portfolio but it starts with high quality assets in each of the core areas.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My follow-up is really in the longer term production outlook. I realize that the commodity outlook is clearly challenging, a lot of folk's expectations I guess, but as you pointed out Dave you have a lot of bouncing your portfolio specific to the Mediterranean and since you give us the update in December you have clearly had substantial progress in contracting Leviathan on gas in particular. So I'm just wondering if you could give us an idea how does the event of last several months in terms of Leviathan change your production expectations, your development expectations and if I may but what headroom do you\u2019ve left to max out, I guess you're getting pretty close on your export alone and (indiscernible) whether there is any effects of that. I'll leave it at that.","Dave Stover","Let me start on that and Keith can talk a little more about where we\u2019re on the whole Leviathan marketing. But when you think about, the biggest difference is when you look at the end of that five year outlook and into the 10 year outlook, kind of that 2018 and beyond period we're now looking at volumes from Leviathan potentially they are significantly higher than what we talked about a year or so ago.","We originally were talking about an initial Phase 1 of Leviathan that was about $800 million a day and now we're planning for something that has the capacity of 1.6 bcf a day with the plans to operate kind of on average up to 1.2 bcf a day and that's kind of what a lot of the contracting and LIIs [ph] and what we're moving on additional volumes but again that's just the first phase of Leviathan.","There is still a big component of Leviathan that won't be marketed in that first phase, part of it held for domestic but there is still additional export volumes also. So Keith may just update you a little bit on where we\u2019re in our thinking there.","Keith Elliott","","Thanks Dave. Yes, I think that's exactly right, Doug. When you look at the LOIs that we have in place on Leviathan and just now we\u2019re moving to -- well it's about 5.5 tcf that are in total under LOI which represents a little over half of the exportable allocation from Leviathan-based on the most between '13 export policy. So we still have ways to go and we still have -- the good thing is we continue to see growing demand in the region and we also see the growing opportunity for even extra regional export there. So we're very encouraged by what we've seen in the marketing activities in the region.","Dave Stover","The other thing I would add Doug is not just Leviathan it's Tamar also. We don't have this LOI with Union Fenosa which is substantial volume of gas. I think it's about over 400 million a day and close to 2.5 tcf and that's somewhat additive to what we were originally thinking about a year and year and half ag. Again it's kind of in that same timeframe, late '17 and getting full impact but in the '18 and beyond. So that\u2019s been the biggest difference, it's not just the clarity of the delivery of the overall five year plan but it's more clarity around what a 10 year plan looks like.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a clarification, so it's the resource at Leviathan expanded with export ceiling expand also?","Chuck Davidson","Yes. The export policy is written such that it's a percentage of overall total resource and the percentages vary by size of field but in scope of Leviathan it's roughly 50%.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Leo Mariani of RBC.","Leo Mariani - RBC","Just hoping to kind of ask a few follow-ups here on Israel, you guys have any sort of better clarity on when you think you might be able to sanction Leviathan project. Additionally can you just give us your current thinking around the potential for LNG in the Eastern Mediterranean, I guess just finally with respect to Israel, is there any update on when you may spud your deep oil prospect below the Leviathan field?","Dave Stover","On the Leviathan sanction I think we're still progressing towards the sanction but a number of things to fall into place those are the things that we're working on right now. The contracts taking these big contracts from an LOI to a GSPA whether it's the contract with Jordan, whether it's the contract with BG. Those will be key items and then on the back of that then getting the regulatory where it's export approval, agreement with what we've signed up for between the different countries but I think the thing that we're seeing is a lot of support for all of this by the timing of it's all got to come together. So that would be into -- most likely into next year sometime with the first piece of that being -- moving the LOI to actual gas sales agreements.","I think on -- which kind of then leads to the next second phase which is your question on the LNG piece. I think that gets into what is the best way to handle the second phase of marketing here. Part of that will be dependent on what we see for additional opportunities and regional, but part of it will also be tied to how much do we want to play on a world market and I think when you're looking at LNG for the Israeli gas, it's probably the most likely scenario on LNG would be an FLNG type project, so we keep that alive. We keep that option alive and we will continue to keep that option alive as we continue to see how much the regional market continues to grow.","And we've not by any stretch of the imagination captured all of the regional market with Phase 1 on this. I think on the deep oil part of this, I mean we're still excited about deep oil propsectivity over there but the timing is going to be dependent on when we bring our rig capable of drilling the deep oil prospect into to go along with the additional Leviathan and Tamar development and then in what sequence we do those things. So that all have to fit together."," ","Leo Mariani - RBC","Can you just give us a little bit more on Nevada? You talked about commencing production in July. I just want to see how many wells would that be? And it looks like you're adding three increments wells to the budget here in the second half, just trying to get a sense of those horizontal wells just maybe some more color on Nevada will be helpful.","Dave Stover","I mean that\u2019s still a big opportunity for us. I will let Gary talk just a little bit about what we\u2019re doing currently and Susan may expand a little bit about her thoughts going forward as she is getting more involved in this now to from the frontier new venture aspect of this actually trying to turn this into a new core area.","Gary Willingham","So we have had one vertical well that\u2019s been producing since July initially came on at fairly high rate, declined off fairly steeply and has been producing around 10 to 15 barrels a day for a while now fairly flat. We've moved the rate recently back to Nevada recently TD our third well in the southern prospect area the Huntington prospect area and are now in the process of moving the rig to the northern prospect area, Mary's River where we'll drill our first test up there. So we're encouraged by what we saw in the well in Huntington on the logs, a little bit thicker section than we saw in the middle prospect area where the first producing well is and we expect to start completion operations on that new well in the next 4 to 6 weeks probably.","We do have three wells that we talked about, that's not a change to the plan that's been the plan all along and at least these first two again are vertical wells. We are evaluating the potential maybe of drilling a horizontal well in the future, but that still remains to be seen.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Joel Allman of JPMorgan.","Joel Allman - JPMorgan","On your Plug-n-Perf completions how much outperformance are you seeing after 150 days from those first two wells in the core? I know the EUR [ph] you\u2019re looking at on average there is 480,000 boe, so what are these wells looking like and then could you talk about the implications of transitioning to Plug-n-Perf across the entire program if you're thinking about that and also what other completion, design changes are you testing?","Dave Stover","I mean in one of the things we're excited about is continuing to look at the opportunities here for tweaking, if you will the completion especially as we move to more down spacing activity. I will let Gary kind of tell you a little bit about what they are doing and what they have gotten in front of them there.","Gary Willingham","Yes, Joe, those first two wells that we announced a while back are still performing strongly as you mentioned. I don't have the plots right in front of me but I think they are outperforming, the sliding sleeve probably that 25% to 30% range. We\u2019re very excited about that, we do have plans to do quite a few more of those. We\u2019ve recently completed four more, they are not online yet. They will be coming on in 4Q and then we have plans for another 20 or so beyond that still for the rest of the year.","And we'll see where we go from there. Certainly the early days are encouraging. We think they provide a lot of benefits over the sliding sleeve and a number of ways, so we\u2019re going to continue to test those. The cost is about 400,000 more per well so we want to get comfortable that the economics are there for that incremental recovery but it sure looks encouraging to-date. As far as other completion things we're trying not to get into a lot of details but we're testing other fluids, we\u2019re testing other sand concentrations, perf strategies. So a number of things we're trying and we had mentioned prior our second underground laboratory in the Wells Ranch area, we tried a number of different things in the area and we're starting to get quite a bit of data coming in from those. So we will probably have more to talk about on the 4Q call from that.","Joel Allman - JPMorgan","In terms of down spacing, and will play to declare victory with down spacing using 32 wells per section at Wells Ranch and elsewhere and could you discover basically what you've done so far in terms of down spacing. Are you doing it in the Niobrara, C or the A, or the Codell, can you describe that. And then should we assume some degradation when you go down to 32 wells per section even if you\u2019re not seeing much right now.","Dave Stover","Yes Joel, I think it's still pretty early on a lot of those questions. The pad that we've released this quarter, the Wells Ranch, it's a combination of Niobrara, A, B and C and you can see that the 32 well per section, wells are performing right in line with the 16. So obviously very encouraged by that, I think it's going to be a case-by-case basis across the basin. It's way too early to declare victory and certainly declare victory based on wide but we've got quite a bit of down spacing still to come on this year of the wells that are still coming on in the DJ this year roughly half of those are down spacing wells either 24s or 32. So we'll get those online, we will see how they perform relative to not only the tight curve but the normal spacing wells in those areas and pass judgment for that.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Charles Meade Johnson Rice Investment Banking.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice Investment Banking","If I could go ask some questions about the Marcellus was at I believe has been touched on it. Those two pad that you had in Tyler and beverage County looks really strong and I know you said they were as good as some of your the best wells you had in majors ago but can you talk about how those wells perform versus your expectations predrilled and perhaps what the factors were that are contributing deleting to have they are performing whether that be the completion design I think you mentioned reduced stage of cluster spacing or perhaps the rock properties or whatever else may be at play there.","Dave Stover","Right. I think if you look at the slide and see relevant to the type curve how well they've done which the type curve is usually more of a predrilled type estimate. The other thing we have commented on the slide, we have a little higher liquids content at least starting out. So both of those have been positives but I'll let Gary expand a little bit on what he is seeing in there.","Gary Willingham","Charles very excited about the area. As we have said these two pads are the first two pads in the area and definitely outperforming our predrilled expectations which are the type curves that are shown on the chart. Just as excited that they are performing very similarly to each other. So we do see some consistency across the area already in performance and as we mentioned they are performing every bit as good or better than our best pad ever back in major.","So all very exciting. We are doing some different completion design tests down there as well including the reduced stage and cluster spacing and then as we mentioned earlier we've also got down spacing testing going at Oxford, those are 550 foot spaced laterals and so to see this level of performance on a down spaced wells in a new area obviously very excited about that. And looking forward to the next pad that comes on in that area which is the (indiscernible) pad coming on in 4Q.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice Investment Banking","I guess it wasn't clear on whether that type curve applied to these areas. But thanks for that clarification.","Gary Willingham","That is specific to this area.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice Investment Banking","And Dave if I could go back to a point you are making earlier into Q&A when you mentioned the three levers that you have for 2015 CapEx, I believe you said it was major project timing. The exploration program and then the pace of the onshore unconventional development. The way I understand you guys is all three of those are going to remain important to you in any commodity price environment. Can you talk about how those what the sequence of ratcheting it down and back up might be whether if the commodity prices go down from here or whether -- or if they were two back up from here is there a sequence the going.","Dave Stover","I think you have to look at all of it. If you to look at the whole portfolio. It starts with where are you on the timing of the development, where are we on sanctioning timing of the big Eastern-Med projects. How the timeframe that to the gas contracts come into place, the government approvals and that's kind of your first big piece that you're keeping an eye on. And the rest of it's all -- you have options on how you look at both the pace of onshore and the size of the exploration program. But as you said they're all important. They are all significant contributors to us and we'll look at it from a whole portfolio of the whole team will continue to look at it but the nice part is you continue to have more things out there to do then we'll spend money on. It continues to high grade the portfolio at no matter what the price environment wherein.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice Investment Banking","Right. That's better than the other -- than the alternative I suppose. And are you on your regular capital budgeting timeframe this year? So we should expect something may be December January?","Dave Stover","We are. As we've been talking about it's not the year to accelerate the timing of that, given everything out there but this is our normal course that we look back we've usually put out something by the late January timeframe at least.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","At the risk of hammering the point if I could just carry on asking about the sensitivity to your price environment. You mentioned that you would be managing towards balance sheet, could you just remind us what the parameters are, what the ratios are that we should look at and what your tolerances on the specs [ph]?","Ken Fisher","We laid out in the Analyst Day last year that we will continue to maintain strong liquidity level and that we would keep our work to keep our rating as it is. And we didn't give any specific targets around debt levels but we did show a forward projection kind of a range, so I think that\u2019s an appropriate way to think about it. We continue to think BBB is a good place to be and we work to keep it there.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Right and then the outlook given there would imply obviously that you would stay at BBB within that range?","Ken Fisher","Yes. And then I think the other thing is building on the point is we have a very deep portfolio with a lot of investment flexibility and then we have -- we\u2019re well hedged, probably differentially hedged for 2015 versus the competition at prices that are now well above the strip. So that sets us up well going into next year.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","And then if I could just clarify, I know you\u2019re speaking of the costs but did I hear right to an early question that you are saying that this is sort of a priority list we should be number one major projects, number two exploration and number three onshore activity would be the set of stuff that would look at or is that a misinterpretation.","Dave Stover","I wouldn't interpreted that there is a priority where we're going in any particular order there. The comment was around that those are the three things that make up the levers that we have on capital adjustment or flexibility if you will as Ken put it. And the piece that we will continue to watch, first is the timing of how these major projects that haven't started up, how they come together. But that's not a priority order of preference of where you put your money by any stretch of the imagination. All three of those are strong attributes.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Irene Haas of Wunderlich Securities.","Irene Haas - Wunderlich Securities","The question today has to do with the Marcellus. The Marcellus has become quite a bit of your gas production, so I'm looking at sort of price realization for both natural gas and NGL. It seems to have declined during the third, fourth quarter versus the first half. So my question is this somewhat seasonal? Should we expect a little better price realization for gas during the fourth quarter, same for NGL and then you actually talked about quite a bit on how you ship your gas out if you can give us a little bit more color on that and also some similarly what do you do with your NGL bucket, where does it go right now? Is it mostly local? And sort of what kind of pricing you're getting for that?","","Dave Stover","Let me see if I can start on some of that Irene, on the pricing realization I think first half of the year with a little bit stronger than second half. As you started to see more volume in the basin and trying to get out of the basin. I think fourth quarter and in the first quarter hope it will be a little better then that's as you start to see some more winter impact and you're starting to see some folks getting more of the products starting to move out of the basin.","I think what we've talked about is getting a larger and larger percentage out of the basin over time. I think we've got about 30% of our gas right now kicked out of the basin and we're in -- we\u2019re either in some arrangements or talking about some arrangements over the next few years to get a larger percentage even out of the basin which will help with pricing. And I've seen those anywhere from $0.40 to $0.90 on different scenarios type of thing. So that will continue to change as you go forward but I think directionally for everybody up there and just that part of the world that you\u2019re seeing a number of new pipes. You're seeing some things looking at being reversed down to the Gulf coast. You're seeing new pipes that go up to the Midwest some even up further Northeast, some to the Southeast and some to the Gulf. I don't know Gary anything else on that?","Gary Willingham ","No I think that pretty well covered it, Dave, I mean for us it's just diversity where the product can go. So we highlighted in the press release a couple of new firm capacity deals that we've done all the areas that Dave just mentioned as well as the Great Lakes. So when you look at our firm transport, firm sales today we\u2019re sitting at about $350 million a day and by 2017, the end of 2017 we expect to be up over or right at 800 million cubic feet a day, so that's a very well diversified portfolio of transport.","Irene Haas - Wunderlich Securities","So how about a little color on your natural gas liquid. Right now where do they end up? This is still mostly sort of in the middle of the continent and what pricing are you getting for those products?","Dave Stover","Well the NGL gets mainly handled through the processing facility there and where it ends up? I think it's a blend of pricing whether it's Mount Belvieu or others. That you said blend of pricing obviously you saw a little more ethane in the mix in the last quarter, so that had some impact on the overall pricing when you look at just percentage of pricing.","Operator","And we will take our next question from David Tameron of Wells Fargo.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo","When we transition from the macro to some of the DJ specific stuff and you alluded to this a little bit but you talked about the frac and flow back procedures and some of the slides being different on the tighter spacing wells. Can you give us more detail exactly what you're doing there?","Gary Willingham","","Yes David not to get into a lot of details that we talked in the past about as we go to tighter and tighter spacing, our goal obviously is to stimulate more of the rock volume near well bore. So we've done a number of things to try and achieve that, that\u2019s to obviously reduce any potential impact of interference as we drill tighter and tighter and laterals but those things include many of the things that we have already talked about, the Plug-n-Pref, we have run some tests on sliding sleeves where we have continued to use sliding sleeves but with tighter stage spacing.","We've done some test where we changed the way in which we pick and space our perfs out along the laterals. We've done a number of tests on different fluids and sand concentration. So it's really a good combinations of things. I mentioned we brought our second underground laboratory on recently and the DJ Basin in the Wells Ranch area. Those underground laboratories are designed to gather data strategy throughout the lateral length of the wells of those fiber optics are in and the wells that we ran the fiber optics in we've actually done different completion technique tests along that lateral.","So for instance we may do three stages using one technique the next three using another technique and so on and with those of fiber optics down haul we can actually determine the performance difference between each of those techniques which allows us to further optimize as we go. So probably a lot more to come on that on the year-end call.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo","Okay and can I just -- you talk about in the DJ longer laterals some operators have talked about difficulty in essentially drilling up the plugs once you get beyond some specified 7000 feet. Are you guys seeing that in the once you've done or did you see that in the wells you have drilled longer laterals with the 8000 foot type wells or can you talk a little about that?","Dave Stover","Yes David, I'm not really aware of any problem with -- any significant problems we have to-date.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo","Okay. And last question on the DJ, if I think about the vertical well production, obviously horizontal is up 30%, the vertical cause a little bit of your drag on your overall DJ number. Is that a natural decline issue. Is that a wells being shutting because of line pressures? I'm just trying to about how to think about that wedge of the production piece going forward.","Dave Stover","Yes it's a combination of both, the vertical are a lot more susceptible to height line pressures and third party downtime. When you look at the roughly 3000 barrels a day impact that we had in 3Q from third party issues and higher line pressures about two thirds of that was actually on the vertical program. They are just a lot more sensitive to those high line pressures not only in the moment in which they are flowing but if pressures get high enough that they're actually unable to flow then it takes a number of days for them to come back even once the line pressures drop. So it's definitely a disproportionate impact on the vertical wells. We have been doing a lot of work that only obvious with our midstream partner to alleviate the line pressure but on our own wells ourselves and optimizing how we are producing those to try and try and alleviate as much of that as we can but it is a greater impact.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo","Okay so with all the compression you talked about that you've added whatever DCP whatever midstream is doing out there, we should see that start to moderate the steepness of that decline on the vertical? Is that fair?","Dave Stover","Yes certainly, in everything that DCP is doing as well as what we're doing on our own pad facilities to reduce pressures and provide greater reliability of service is certainly going to help.","Gary Willingham","","It's probably fair to say in the fourth quarter you got a sizable portion of your wells that aren't even tied to DCP infrastructure but they are in our own system, right?","Dave Stover","Right. When you look at the slide that shows the number of wells coming on in 4Q for that DJ number roughly a third of that is up in Northern Colorado. So that's on our own system. We've already got capacity up there through our own Lily Plant as well as some different third party arrangements and then we're bringing in our own (indiscernible) plan on in the fourth quarter and that will service those wells as well. So a good chunk of the remaining well to be brought online are off of the traditional Greater Wattenberg DCP kind of system.","Operator","And we will take our next question from David Heikkinen of Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Just had a question that you\u2019ve have the plan of development submitted for Leviathan. Can you update us on the expected gross investment and then timing of spending?","Dave Stover","I think timing of spending is obviously dependent on everything comes together for the sanctioning. But I think you'll start to see a ramp up over the first year after timing and probably a majority of the spend and I'll let Keith follow-up on that prior end of the second year or so after sanctioning. But plan of development was a big step to get through there and I'll let Keith kind of walk you through how he sees expenditures flowing from sanctioning.","Ken Fisher","So we'd expected to be ramping up from the point of sanction primarily the course of the development plan is now as you have heard at 1.6 bcf a day FPSO and that is the subject of a lot of front end work that\u2019s continuing to go as we take the final investment decision on the project. We would be committing to that and I think you'd see a ramp up peeking really in the 2016 and early 2017 timeframe.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","And what was the gross investment expectation for this FPSO.","Ken Fisher","The gross investment for the total of Phase 1 is about $6.5 billion. And there is additional investment -- that includes the investment in the Leviathan upstream development, with all drilling and everything in. There is an additional investment that would be in the form of export pipelines to the Egypt LNG plants and that's to the account though of the purchasers they will be laying that line to the FPSO.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","And so as you think about from a year ago to now that's actually perfect segue. How much was that investment in the export lines to Egypt and how much did that change the gross investment to get you to the 1.6 bcf a day.","Dave Stover","I don\u2019t think when you looked at a year, a year and half ago that we even had the scenario of an export line to Egypt as our base scenario and the whole development has changed over that period. So you can't compare a cost of that versus what it was a year and a half ago. So the whole development has changed, the whole market has changed over there.","I mean just think about it from where we are now with about a bcf a day and by into 2018 between the combination of Tamar going up to 2 bcf a day and Leviathan at 1.6 bcf a day, you\u2019re now looking at 3.6 bcf a day of capacity in that timeframe completely different than what we were looking at a while ago. And before we were the first phase and the pieces we were looking at and talking was more focused around LNG projects. And how to factor that into the equation. So now we have the opportunity to maybe take advantage of existing LNG structures.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","It seems that you're getting to a higher volume at a lower capital amount because you don't have the LNG in the plan at this point, I was just trying to reconcile the Leviathan development before and that seems pretty clear.","Ken Fisher","That's exactly right.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Arun Jayaram of Credit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","I just wanted to ask you my first question on the Marcellus, clearly a macro-environment where spare capacity is rising in the oil and gas market. So I just wanted to see if you could comment how you're thinking about capital allocation to that Marcellus in '15. I do believe the carry now is often but just thinking about '15 because I do believe under your five year plan, the Marcellus is probably the biggest free cash flow negative piece of your growth profile.","Dave Stover","Right. I mean when you think about it the carry now as we get through October and we\u2019re almost through October we would envision the carry coming off for November when you look at forecast for next year, it could easily stay off for all of next year. I would say, when we look at the capital we have good meetings with our partner just as we've done every year, where we sit down and look at the environment and look at what we want to do both on the dry gas and wet gas side and that's what we'll be doing and continuing to do over the next month or two.","So it's too early to speculate on where we will go on that but we will be looking at all of those pieces. I would say the encouraging thing that we've seen out there is what Gary's talked about on just overall well performance in some of these items. And it's just been amazingly when look at how much that thing has continued to evolve from when we first got into that play.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","Okay. Just a quick follow-up, you highlighted an improved oil mix in Q4 versus Q3. What's the driver to that? Is that focus on East Pony? Anything else?","Dave Stover","That the piece of it very mentioned that the large number of new wells coming on East Pony, but it's really driven by probably 60% of that increase is driven by the DJ and 40% of it's by the West Africa lifting schedules and actually everything being on full board for the fourth quarter. So you see a nice uplift in oil volumes from both international oil and domestic oil for the fourth quarter.","Operator","And we will take our next question from David Kessler of Simmons & Company.","David Kessler - Simmons & Company","Following up on Dave Heikkinen question of kind of doing more with less. If you look at CapEx in the third quarter it came in well below expectations yet you brought a couple more wells online in the domestic portfolio than the prior schedule. 4Q same number of wells scheduled to come online as the prior schedule but running nine rigs. Can you talk about this being a reflection of ongoing efficiency gains both on the drilling and completion side maybe provide some color around the latest digital times cost etcetera.","Dave Stover","We are seeing continued especially on the drilling side just some remarkable continued efficiency and improvements on drilling times. I think they continue to set a record about every quarter for lateral length per day drilled in the Marcellus especially as the teams really continue to increase the learning curve in that area, but also seeing in the DJ.","We mentioned the nine rigs in the DJ. The difference there from what we had previously with 10 was the one rig we moved over to Nevada. But the forecast and what we've laid out in the fourth quarter has for the nine rig program in the DJ basin but continued to be impressed how they've increased efficiencies. Don't know where the technical limited yet but we've got to be getting close to it as much as we've seen the improvement on but continue to be amazed by how just focusing on each aspect of the drilling curve and the drilling leg, each interval if you will and looking at what's the technical limits for each interval and continuing to push towards that we continue to see improvements. But Gary can expand on that if he has something.","Gary Willingham","Yes I guess the only thing I would add you mentioned our 4Q well online targets is unchanged from before. We moved the rig to Nevada, that was part of the plan all along. So that's probably why it didn't change. And then the reality is that most of the wells that are coming on in 4Q have already been drilled. So dropping a rig there wouldn't have any impact anyway. But Dave is exactly right, the efficiencies keep coming. We do continue to see new records being sent especially in the Marcellus and so we look forward to the benefits of that greater efficiency on both capital as well as our being able to drill more wells with fewer rigs.","David Kessler - Simmons & Company","And one last one just in the DJ. With respect to the production you're seeing on each one of the intervals either in Niobrara A,B and C or Codell. How are those tight curves bearing? Are they maintaining consistency kind of across the board? Is there one area that\u2019s better than another that you might target instead in 2015 to enhance capital efficiency? Anything you can comment on that side would be great.","Dave Stover","I guess all I would say is that performance of the zones across the basin is different. They're not the same all the way up in East Pony as they are down in the core part of the field, A B or C. We certainly aim to target the best intervals in each area to impact capital efficiency as you mentioned. So at the same time as we continue to test down spacing and how we\u2019re laying out those wells, what types of patterns we're using, we\u2019re testing multiple intervals in each area. So way too early to say we\u2019re only going to focus on one or two of those four potential zones in any one area, but we're continuing to focus on the best ones.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","I wanted to follow-up on an earlier question with regards to some of the midstream related constraints. This was an issue you highlighted last quarter for a slower second half growth outlook. Can you just talk about how you see the growth trajectory in the DJ into next year? It's a little but a follow-up on one of the David Tameron's questions. And add any more specifics on the DCP constraints. In other words based on the trajectory -- based on the various plants that you highlighted that are coming online, how much room do see to increase the day production sequentially over the next three quarters.","Dave Stover","Well I think DJ is going to be a big driver of next year's growth. If you just look at how you're going to ended there this year with the big ramp up through the fourth quarter and then combined with the large facility they are coming online next year, you have 200 million a day or so plant of DCPs coming on about the second quarter next year. We mentioned some of these big compressor projects and other things. We mentioned our facilities that are coming and going in, starting fourth quarter this year into first quarter next year. It will be a big increase in capacity overall that will continue to set us up for DJ to be one of the big growth drivers next year and not just growth driver but value driver when you look at that oil and gas mix there.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","And it's sounds like the second quarter is when that DCP plant is starting up in your--","Dave Stover","It should be. I think probably early second quarter to ramping up through the second quarter by mid-year it should be fully up and running.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","And then a lot of questions were asked earlier with regards to how you're thinking about next year. Maybe I will try to ask it a slightly different way which is how do you think about your tolerance for outspending cash flow. Is there a specific number you fix? And does that tolerance actually rise in a lower oil prices environment versus a higher one.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","","I don't know Brian I mean it there's always a tolerant level at some point but that's not been established yet until we've moved to some of our analysis and look at some of the sensitivities. As Ken mentioned we\u2019re going to be sensitive to our balance sheet. We\u2019re going to be sensitive to investment grade. So we\u2019re going to look at all those different factors and then we\u2019re going to look at the project mix and what's the appropriate spending level to drive that given what we see the cash flow outlook to be as we talked about, we have a good hedge book. We've got a good position on both oil and gas and (indiscernible) are on especially the oil side of that equation and you got a good mix of international oil and domestic oil, domestic gas.","But you also -- when it's nice to have that components of gas in Israel at nice prices too. So that's a nice cash flow to continue to count on. So it all gets back to that portfolio and again I think especially in this type of environment diversified portfolio, that's all underpinned by high quality assets in each area is a -- I don't want to call it a luxury but it's sure nice to have.","Operator","And that concludes today's question and answer session. Mr. Larson at this time I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","David Larson","Great thanks.

Following today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Whitmarsh. Please go ahead.","Brad Whitmarsh - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Alison, and thank you all for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. I hope you've had a chance to review the earnings release and supplement that we published this morning. The press release and slides are available on the Investors page of our website. And later today, we plan to file our 10-Q with the SEC.","I want to remind everyone that today's discussion contains projections and forward-looking statements, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures in our latest news releases and SEC filings for a discussion of those items. Following our prepared remarks, we will hold a question-and-answer session. I would ask that analysts limit themselves to one primary question and one follow-up.","Dave Stover, Chairman, President and CEO, will provide this morning's prepared comments. And we will have plenty of time for a Q&A session. Ken Fisher, EVP and CFO; Hodge Walker, SVP of Onshore; and Keith Elliot, SVP of Offshore, are here to participate in the Q&A session.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I will start by stating what I hope is obvious. Over the past month, we have seen tremendous volatility from market concerns about global trade impacts, supply uncertainties from the pending Iran sanctions and overall capital efficiency questions about this industry. The market disconnect from energy stocks and commodity price seems overdone.","Over the last few weeks, the U.S. public E&P space has lost approximately $100 billion in market cap, which is truly astonishing to me, in light of where oil prices are and the growing uncertainty as to whether supply can keep pace with global demand over the next few years. This is despite the fact that we are seeing more commitment to shareholder returns and capital discipline than I can remember, against a backdrop of constructive oil market fundamentals.","For Noble Energy, we have evolved and deliberately transformed our portfolio to be competitive in any environment, and remain focused on delivering value for our shareholders. The diversification in our asset base provides multiple options to allocate capital to the highest margin, highest return opportunities, leveraging our high-quality onshore assets as well as global pricing exposure with Equatorial Guinea and Israel. While accomplishing this portfolio transformation, we have also paid down substantial debt, enhanced our financial flexibility and accelerated the return of capital to shareholders.","We are well on our way to achieving our 2018 objectives. Execution was strong in the third quarter, as we delivered volumes at the high end, while capital and costs were at the low end of our guidance. Year-over-year, we generated nearly 30% operating cash flow growth. The cash flow growth number is even higher on a debt-adjusted per share basis, resulting from debt reduction in excess of $1 billion and a decrease in shares outstanding from the buy-back program. Looking back, our quarterly operating cash flow generated was the highest it's been in four years.","Within the third quarter, we progressed a number of items across our global operations that create near and long-term value. Starting with the U.S. Onshore, we delivered record liquid volumes, substantially grew cash flows and maintained disciplined capital spending. In the DJ Basin, we advanced our Mustang IDP development, with 31 wells now online. These wells are currently producing a gross rate of 27,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with an oil mix of over 60%. Productivity from the first row of Mustang highlights the quality of our acreage and will contribute to continued growth in the fourth quarter from the DJ Basin.","Earlier this week, we received regulatory approval for our Comprehensive Drilling Plan for 100 square mile position in Mustang. This provides full operational control, ability to accelerate permits and efficiency advantages across this contiguous 75,000 net acre. I want to acknowledge and thank our teams, as this is the first Comprehensive Drilling Plan of this scale approved.","Also, we've strategically positioned our operations in the DJ to diversify across multiple gas processors. Within the third quarter, we began to see the benefit of gas processing expansion with DCP's Mewbourne plant that started up in August and ramped throughout the quarter. We also benefited from utilizing multiple outlets for our gas flow. Looking forward, we are well positioned to take advantage of the processing capacity additions coming online later this quarter and in the first half of 2019.","In the Delaware Basin, sales volumes in the third quarter more than doubled from the prior year, driven by continued strong Wolfcamp A well productivity across the acreage position. Over the last year, we've built out the necessary central gathering infrastructure to support our activity. These facilities, operated by Noble Midstream, are contributing to enhanced capital efficiency. In addition, we have secured long-haul takeaway on the EPIC Pipeline that will provide access to premium priced Gulf Coast markets, anticipated to begin in the third quarter of 2019.","Finally, just as we have done in Mustang and the DJ, we've transitioned our Delaware drilling program to row development, with four of our rigs now focused on multi-zone development around existing central gathering facilities. We expect row development will maximize the value of this asset, while also driving significant operating efficiencies. Our first pads of row development are expected to come online early next year. And in the Eagle Ford, we continue to generate solid cash flows from existing wells with little incremental investment.","Moving to the Offshore, in the Eastern Mediterranean, we delivered another gross sales volume record of nearly 1.1 billion cubic feet per day. At the same time, in-country demand is exceeding domestic gas deliverability, requiring Israel to import higher cost LNG in order to meet power demand. This underscores the importance of bringing Leviathan online, which will provide a second major domestic source of natural gas for Israel. Leviathan is nearly 70% complete. And we continue to pursue multiple options for quickly filling up the first phase and supporting additional development.","Looking at the domestic market, the Government of Israel recently acted to accelerate the remaining coal conversion as the government's plan calls for coal to become solely a backup fuel. To move this policy forward, the government has mandated additional excise tax on coal imports beginning next year. Israel also announced plans to fully convert to gas and electric-driven transportation by 2030 and enacted tax incentive plans to encourage these conversions.","Regionally, late in the third quarter, we announced pipeline agreements to deliver gas into Egypt, further solidifying the substantial cash flows we will generate from our world-class Eastern Mediterranean assets. We expect to flow at least 350 million cubic feet per day through the EMG Pipeline from Leviathan at start-up just over a year from now. And we're well positioned to meet growing regional gas demand as well as provide gas to global markets through the underutilized Egyptian LNG facilities.","Shifting to West Africa, we continue to see strong performance from our producing assets, generating significant cash flows from its linkage to Brent pricing. We're progressing the Alen gas monetization feed and marketing activities, targeting a project sanction early next year. This is a significant step towards gas monetization of over 3 trillion cubic feet gross we have discovered in the area. This gas will benefit from linkage to higher priced global LNG markets and the capital-efficient use of existing infrastructure.","To summarize, we're operating well across our diversified portfolio. And our deep inventory of global projects includes the potential to test 1 billion barrels of net risked exploration resources over the next few years. Our portfolio of world-class assets, robust financial strength and operational execution, positions the company to deliver a sustainable free cash flow profile competitive, not only across E&Ps, but across all investment sectors.","I want to take a moment to discuss next week's vote in Colorado. As a part of the Colorado community for many years, we have taken a leadership role in opposing Proposition 112. I'm proud of the engagement of our employees in helping the community understand the substantial negative impacts Prop 112 would have on Colorado's economy. While the results of the vote will not be known until next week, I remain confident that the measure will be defeated.","We continue to receive questions regarding future impacts under different scenarios in the state. Rest assured, we have completed thorough contingency planning and have plans in place for all potential outcomes.","I want to reiterate that we have been strategic in how we have set up our DJ Basin position. Through a number of transactions over the past several years, we have concentrated our acreage in the oil-rich rural areas of the basin. In the meantime, we have also been protecting our drilling inventory through proactive permitting, including the Comprehensive Drilling Plan I previously mentioned.","Last week, I was extremely pleased to announce that Brent Smolik will be joining us as President and Chief Operating Officer later this month. Brent will bring to the team a wealth of operational and technical expertise from over 35 years of oil and gas experience, deep capital markets knowledge and extensive executive leadership from his prior roles, most recently as the CEO of EP Energy. I've known Brent for a number of years, as have many of you. And I'm excited to have him join our executive team, and look forward to his contributions. It says a lot that an individual with Brent's capabilities sees the potential in Noble Energy and wants to be a key part of our future.","This morning, we provided guidance for the fourth quarter, which keeps us well on track to meet the total volume, cost and capital for the full year that we previously communicated. It's too early to provide details on 2019, as we're in the process of setting the budget and activity levels. We are making decisions to drive the best returns and create the most value for our shareholders.","Our guiding principles remain the same as outlined earlier this year. Our focus is on delivering leading cash flow growth on a debt-adjusted per share basis. Our 2019 investments will drive improving corporate returns, as we target double-digit return on capital employed in 2020. And we will continue to return significant capital to shareholders going forward, progressing the share buy-back program and growing the dividend as cash flow grows.","We are confident that we are taking the right steps to unlock the tremendous value inherent in Noble Energy, and we are optimistic that the market will recognize and reward our progress.","With that, Alison, let me open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question today will come from Michael Hall of Heikkinen. Please go ahead.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. Good morning, appreciate the time. Thanks. I guess I just wanted to talk a little bit about the dislocation you described in the opening remarks there, in the context of equities relative to commodities, and capital discipline being exhibited by the industry. You all accelerated your repurchase somewhat in the third quarter, and I was just wondering to what extent you might be willing to take that even further forward and accelerate more aggressively as we think about heading into 2019. How hard can you really press on that? And what are the current thoughts in that context?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","No, appreciate it, Michael. And thanks for recognizing that we did accelerate some this quarter. I think as we look at this, we've always talked about it as being a balance here. You're balancing your management of return to shareholders, your management of your balance sheet and your activity that supports the underlying value of the company. So as we look at 2019, we'll look at where the market is. We'll look at how we want to lay out our activity and that'll be part of all the considerations as we go forward.","I think as we look longer-term here, and not that longer term, we're putting ourself in the position here over the next year or so where we're going to start to generate significant free cash flow. And we want to make sure that that's one of the key attributes as we set up our activity levels and so forth is that we're setting ourselves up to support and deliver that significant free cash flow as you bring Leviathan on, as you continue to have the ramp-up onshore. And it doesn't end in 2020.","What we believe with our asset base and the portfolio and the plan we've set up, is that we set ourselves up to be able to sustain that going forward. And so that balance is something we'll continue to look at relative to how the market's rewarding the plan and the underlying value of the company.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay, makes sense. And I guess as my follow-up maybe on the operations front, just curious, on the Mustang development and the wells brought online during the quarter, I know that's kind of the first time coming back with these new completions. What additional color can you provide? Maybe quantify some of the wells performing above expectations as you have in the deck, and just remind us how much more additional Mustang turning lines we should expect over the course of the rest of the year? And how is that situated from the infrastructure front?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, for this year, the plan was to bring on this first row of Mustang. And so, it's pretty much now online. I'll turn it over to Hodge to talk a little more here in a minute, but we ramped it up here through the third quarter. You can see, if you look at the slide, I think it's slide 6. You can see that ramp up from going back to July to what it's doing now, extremely pleased with that productivity. I mean, we're up to, what, over 25,000 barrels a day just from Mustang alone.","I think what it does do is it highlights what the value of that whole area is. Another piece that ties into that is that Comprehensive Drilling Plan that we just got approved. I mean, that is unique. That only comes about because of the position that we've built for the large contiguous acreage. We've got 75,000 net acres out there at Mustang. And what that will do is give us the certainty of the planning going forward, the ability to streamline the permitting and the expectations and be able to line this out as a true manufacturing play as we move from row to row through this field.","So I couldn't be more pleased with what the team's done and the foresight they've had to lay this out on a very comprehensive plan, and now put in place and get the support from the regulatory agency to be able to plan this out extremely well as we move row to row. Hodge, anything else to add there?","Thomas H. Walker - Noble Energy, Inc.","I would just add that this is a new facility in a new area, and we wanted to make sure that we ramped up everything appropriately. We're really excited about what we're seeing in this area. It's going to be a key contributor to our 2019 plan.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Michael, just to take that one step further and use the analogy, this highlights why we moved to row development in the Permian Basin. If you want to see how we expect to see things develop in the Permian, this is a good example. When you look at that plot on page 6, as we move into the Permian and start to see the row development really come forward in towards the end of the first quarter and into the second half of next year.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","No, that's helpful. Certainly seems like an efficient way to go about things. Thank you for the time.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question will come from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Dave, I wonder if I could just have a quick follow up on Mustang, first of all, there.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yes.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I just wanted to clear up some misconceptions I think that are out there in the market around gas processing availability.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Right.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","DCP, obviously, there's been some speculation about allocation from extraction, I think it was. And that seemed to be true to you on the day. (19:58) Can you just clear that up in terms of whether you are constrained or not as it relates to your ramp-up?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Absolutely right, Doug. That's one of those overreactions we talked about and alluded to because when you look at it, we've seen benefit from the first plant come on here in the third quarter, as we expected. I think also as you look forward, we've got in the basin, there will be a second plant coming on, Discovery, now Williams, plant here by the end of the year and another DCP plant next year. And we still expect to see some nice benefit from both of those, especially when you look at where our activity is located relative to these new plants.","The other piece that helps us, too, is the fact that we've got diversified outlets now in the area. We've continued to diversify our outlets, especially up around that Mustang area and where some of this new production is coming on, and that's going be very helpful also. So we're very confident in our expectations. And I think that's showing up with what you've seen in the ramp-up already this year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So just to be clear, no constraints related to DCP and piping Noble?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","I think what we've laid out and what we've planned for, we're seeing come to fruition here.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. My related follow up on that is just to your comments on Colorado and the election. Can you give us some idea of what your drilling \u2013 well, obviously, you're a bit more rural than your peers. The permitting appears to have stepped up pretty dramatically across the industry. So in the event Prop 112 did get voted through, what would your running room look like as it relates to your current drilling backlog?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Doug, I think what we've been clear is, we don't want to get into those numbers right now, for obvious reasons.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Absolutely.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","I think if that's the way it played out, we'd quickly highlight to you where we are on that. But I think right now, we're keeping everybody focused on the activity to continue to educate the public, which is working extremely well. I mean, I think when you look at probably a month or two ago, probably very small percentage of the public even knew what this Prop 112 was. When you go out now and look at it, probably over the vast majority, probably three-quarters of the public now knows what that is. And I think that's a result of this education program, and I think that's the benefit that we're seeing up there.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I thought it was worth a try to try that one. Maybe try one final one then, David, if I may. I was actually out there last week and John Elway seems to be doing his thing, so we'll see how it goes. My last one is really going to Israel very quickly. Mari-B, as we all know from the trip you guys did recently, has got a ton of (23:00). How quickly could you move to bring Tamar gas into that East Med Gas Pipeline if that was indeed the solution via Mari-B? I'll leave it there. Thanks.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I'll let our resident expert, Keith, talk a little bit about that here.","J. Keith Elliott - Noble Energy, Inc.","As we talked about it in Israel, Doug, we can move pretty quickly to turn it around. I think obviously our focus is on getting Leviathan online, getting Leviathan up and running, getting the closure of the EMG transaction. And, as you well know, we've got ample running room of expansion projects there, as we've seen that regional market growing substantially both in Israel, Jordan and in Egypt. And there's certainly opportunity for Mari-B to play a meaningful role in the subsequent expansion of our capacity there.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Doug, to your point, what you bring up and highlight is even this first phase of Leviathan is just the beginning of tapping into what that potential is over there. The expectation of where this will go from beginning of Leviathan to another phase, Tamar expansion, potentially Cyprus and the matching with the growth of that market over there, it's been astounding to watch as that's developed.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","We'll watch with interest. Thanks for taking my questions, Dave.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Our next question will come from Irene Haas of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.","Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC","Oh, hey. Congratulations on how well Mustang has taken off. My question actually goes back to sort of a Noble roots, your exploration program. So you've got three projects highlighted plus two new ventures. Can we have a little color because it looks like you're going be testing in 2019 and 2020. Which area would start first? Can we have a little timeline on expectation on these new projects?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Irene, I'd love to give you a little more color. With some of the onshore leasing activity that's still going on, I'm going to have to wait a little bit there, and then getting some final government approval on some of the new country piece. But not too distant future, I'll be able to give you more color.","What you do highlight, though, is the fact that we've talked about the ability now to test probably around 1 billion barrels of risked resource potential over the next two years, couple years, starting probably late in 2019. It'll be a mix. I would expect some of that will be some appraisal work onshore U.S., and probably one to two very material offshore exploration wells each year, starting maybe not in a couple next year, but by 2020, we'll have ramped up to probably a couple material offshore exploration wells, with maybe one late next year.","Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC","And may I have a follow up?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yes.","Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC","How soon would you be able to get to the oil target in East Med and also Newfoundland. When would we see the first well?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I think in Newfoundland, it's probably a 2020 type timeframe, I would think. In the Eastern Med, the team's done more regional work, continuing to make sure we're understanding the carbinate aspects of the plays over there. And so we'll be sitting down with partners here over the next few months, next few quarters to talk some more about what should be the timing of testing what could be still a very large resource over there.","Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. Thank you.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","I think that's probably still a year or so away.","Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Dave, to you and your team there. I appreciate your comments earlier about not wanting to dive too much into your 2019 plan, but if we go back to February of this year, you guys put a flag in the ground with talking about 400 MBoe a day as an approximate number for 2019. And I know there's been a number of things have changed since then. You guys have sold some assets and some production in the DJ. You pulled in your horns a bit in the Delaware with the basis blowout, and you've had more of this shift towards returning cash to shareholders. So as we in the market look back at that as a flag in the ground for 2019, what are some of the other pieces that we should keep in mind have changed as we're calibrating our expectations for 2019?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Charles, I think the thing to really focus on and where the flag's planted is on making sure that we're in a position and that we're setting up our program to deliver leading operating cash flow growth, CAGR. If you look back at the numbers we had laid out for that CAGRs on operating cash flow, that's what we're really focused on. And delivering over that multiyear period, and making sure that we set up the activity and the capital program to do that.","The other couple things that we said that are driving how we'll allocate capital and the program is making sure that we're setting ourselves up to get back to double-digit return on capital employed by 2020. And also, like I talked earlier, to make sure that with Leviathan coming online, that we're setting ourselves up on an activity basis and cash flow basis that we'll have significant free cash flow in 2020, so we continue to support returning part of that to the shareholders.","So I think the other things that impact how we match up activity and capital is just what's been cost pressures, cost inflation over that period. When we set that up, that was a $50 world assumptions. And it's been much higher with much higher cost inflation pressure. So what we're going to be watching is to maintain the capital discipline that enables us to drive those three principles that I highlighted previously.","So managing...","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Dave, that's helpful \u2013 yeah?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Managing towards those factors by the end of that 2020 period.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you. That's helpful insight, and that's what I was looking for. And my second question, if I could ask more about this Comprehensive Drilling Plan that you guys have for Mustang. I saw that news come through earlier this week, and it really struck me as something really of an impressive scale.","Can you talk about exactly how long the process of getting this done and what it's going enable you to do differently? I think in your prepared comments you indicated it doesn't mean you have all the permits there. But can you just talk about what that is and if you have a desire or need to replicate that elsewhere in the DJ?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I'll turn it over to Hodge, but I'll go back to, again, you can only do this if you've built that extremely large contiguous acreage position, like we've been fortunate enough to do in the DJ. And I say fortunate enough; it was done deliberately through some of the property trades and so forth that we've pulled together over the last few years. And it's resulted now in the ability to put this streamlined plan together. But let me turn it to Hodge to give you a little more of the specifics, but I think you're absolutely right. It is fairly unique and it's extremely important.","Thomas H. Walker - Noble Energy, Inc.","Charles, building off the points that Dave made, we started this process over a year ago. And it kind of builds off what we've been doing with shoring up our acreage position in the basin. And the fact that we've got a large contiguous acreage position here in the Mustang has allowed us to move forward on this CDP process.","Team's done a great job. They kicked this effort off over a year ago, and really appreciate what they've done there. What it allows us to do is control the pace of development across this acreage position. It names us as the operator and it really allows us to move through the row development across this acreage and execute our business effectively.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you for that, Hodge.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Charles.","Operator","Our next question will come from Leo Mariani of NatAlliance Securities. Please go ahead.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Hey, guys. I was hoping you could expand a little bit upon some of the potential expansion plans that could happen in Egypt over time. You obviously mentioned another phase of Leviathan, potentially getting Cyprus moving, a Tamar expansion. Clearly, the goal is to get Leviathan on at the end of next year, but just trying to get a sense of how these things are progressing. Could we see some of these other expansions sanction here in 2019? And if so, when will we start to see incremental volume benefit there?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, Leo, let me let Keith kind of address how he's thinking the sequence of things coming together with \u2013 obviously, you're right. The emphasis right now is on filling up Leviathan, the first phase and then contracting the volumes that are going to support the next portion. So, Keith?","J. Keith Elliott - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Leo, if you think about it, as we've talked about in the past, all these assets have significant expansion potential and plans for putting those expansions in place. I guess the sequencing that I would think about would be if you look at Egypt right now, we've got 700 million a day contracted to deliver into the country. Of that, 350 million a day is firm from Leviathan, and 350 million a day is interruptible to be firmed up at our discretion from Tamar.","The reason it's interruptible is because right now, Tamar is full. And so if you think about it in that context, the logical thing would be we need to create some additional productive capacity to fill that contract.","Looking beyond that, we're certainly actively in negotiations to move gas from Cyprus into the infrastructure in Egypt and working closely with partners and government on that one. And then, of course, Leviathan, we built Leviathan with expansion in mind. Our base platform, our infield infrastructure, our subsea infrastructure, are all being constructed to be easily expandable to the 2.1 Bcf a day. And so, I guess in a large sense, that's the way to think about it. Overall, we'll be driven by managing these things against what I would call a disciplined kind of reinvestment approach. We'll be driven by market and be driven by firming up contracts.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Leo, what you highlight, I think is a good point, which is when you look out for Noble Energy, the visibility of the already-discovered, if you will, growth opportunities is, I think somewhat unique and enlightening. I mean, if you just think over the next four or five years, 2019 we'll be growing from the Onshore business. 2020, you get the big boost from Leviathan, while you're still growing your Onshore business. 2021, you've got Alen, big gas influx, high value gas influx global market gas coming in. And then beyond that, you also have the visibility of what Keith just talked about with a number of Eastern Med projects. So when you think about that discovered inventory and how it queues up and sequences over the next three to five years, it's pretty impressive array of opportunities here.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Yeah, no don't about that for sure, Dave. Just as a follow up here, wanted to focus a little bit on the Eagle Ford, I know it's an area you're not throwing as much capital at, but just wanted to get a sense, production's kind of been drifting lower over the last handful of quarters. What does that trajectory look like in the Eagle Ford? Is it expected to go down again in the fourth quarter and then start going up in 2019, just trying to get a sense of that? And also, how do you see the Eagle Ford fitting in, from a portfolio perspective, over the longer term?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I'll go back to how we've talked about it in the past and it really hasn't changed. We expected this year to be declining, coming off bringing on some big wells late last year into the first part of this year. And that's what we're seeing. It'll continue to decline through the rest of this year. And then, that'll start to turn around in the first half of next year and you'll have more of an incline through next year as we bring some of the new wells on. But probably fairly flat year-on-year overall is the way we've been talking about it.","What we've also talked about is that next year, we'll be conducting some tests and have a chance to bring on production on some of this Upper Eagle Ford and that'll give us some more visibility to the longer-term aspects of how this fits in our portfolio.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Thanks very much.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Leo.","Operator","Our next question will come from Welles Fitzpatrick of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Welles Fitzpatrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Good morning.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Morning, Welles.","Welles Fitzpatrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","On 112, the polling seems to be decently net no at this point, so if you'll indulge me and we just assume a no on 112 scenario, can you talk to your strategy and the industry's strategy post the election to make sure that this doesn't come back in presumably higher turnout year in 2020?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Probably too early to get into specific strategies, nor would we want to in this forum. But I'd say it's fair to say one of the things that this has highlighted this year and brought a lot of good conversation together is that no one wants to go through this again. Whether you talk about voters, whether you talk to industry, investors, government, I think that's a strong alignment.","The good part about this, if you will, the bright spot of having this out in front and driving this conversation is the discussions with the leaders of both parties in Colorado recognize that particular fact. I think the other part of that is everybody wants to drive longer-term solutions, so that this doesn't come back in a couple years.","I would say that that's something that has been in our repertoire, if you will, when you look back at, and we've got experience here in this arena: how we've dealt with putting a framework in place to address longer-term impacts in Israel; how we dealt with helping the industry return to work in the Gulf of Mexico post Macondo, getting the first permit; the engagement with the government in Colorado on progressive air regulations. So I think this is something that I think Noble Energy can help play a key role in going forward, and we will.","Welles Fitzpatrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah, no, that's great to hear, that industry's that focused on it. And then, if I could sneak one other one in, [Amendment] 74, the Farm Bureau's bill, also seems to be polling very well. Can you talk to any thoughts you might have that that would have on the oil and gas industry and how it might help you defend against some future regulation?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","No, we'll just have to see how that plays out. I'll tell you our focus is back to what you originally talked on, on 112. That's what we've stayed focused on and that's where we're putting our energy.","Welles Fitzpatrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thank you. Fingers crossed for the [November] 6th.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Welles.","Operator","Our next question will come from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. I was wondering if I could ask a question on the Permian and, obviously, you guys pulled the reins back a little bit because of diffs. Where do you all stand on that right now? It's been ebbing and flowing a little bit. Is there an opportunity for you to move back to the Permian sooner than sort of anticipated as we look at late this year, early next year?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think definitely in the second half of next year, Scott. I think if you look at how we've timed this, I think it's working out extremely well with how we've moved to the row development now, so we can get out ahead of this and set us up for the long-term development over that acreage position. What that has meant, as you've said, is it's slowed down some of the completion and bringing on new wells until we get out in front of this a little further and create the space that we need with the drilling program.","As I mentioned, we'll start to bring some of these rows on towards the end of the first quarter. We'll have built some are of this inventory here so that by the second half of next year, timing very well with the new takeaway infrastructure, we'll be in a position that we'll have a lot more flexibility on activity in the second half next year. And the nice part about it, we'll have established our row development concept so that we can make sure that we're maximizing our opportunity on productivity here.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, so...","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","I think it's actually come together pretty well now as you start to see the announcements on some potential new pipelines in the second half of next year.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, yeah, I know, certainly looks good for that, but just to maybe dive into it a little bit more, is it more of a takeaway constraint, say, over the next couple quarters that keeps you from accelerating sooner there? Are there other things constraining you to pivot the Permian a little bit sooner or is it more of your...?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","No, it's more just the time it takes to get the drilling out in front of the completions. If you go back and look at some of the diagrams we've shown over the last few months on how this row development plays out and the buffer zones, if you want, between the drilling and the completion side. It's just taking the time to get the drilling out in front of the completion activity, and then be able to start ramping the completion activity back up. So that just takes a couple quarters to do that. And that's why I said I'm glad we're doing that now. And so that we'll have that behind us and then we'll be ready as the new infrastructure comes on place.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Okay. And then on the Permian, if I can stay on the Permian, this quarter, well, two questions; one, this quarter, we did see the oil cut, overall on average, drop a little bit. And can you give us a little bit of color? Was that sort of a mix of where you were drilling or some other maturation aspect of existing production? And then I guess second, still on the Permian, what do you expect the improvement in well cost with this row development to look like as we go through 2019 versus where you are today?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I think on the oil cut portion, it's really a reflective of that mix of bringing in production from different areas. I think what we've seen from the different areas, we still have a high oil cut, 65% to a little over 70%, depending what area you're bringing on at one point in time. And we brought on some mix of some more of these appraisal areas on some of this. So it'll just fluctuate over time. But it's going to be in that range. So it's still a pretty tight range when you look at it overall, but quarter-on-quarter, it can vary a little bit.","I think when you talk about the impacts of row development, that's some of the things we're still looking at as we put the budget together for next year; what impacts to embed in there, still early in this. It's pretty easy to see the expected benefit as you move sequentially down a row how that ought to be able to provide some benefit versus coming and going from different areas, but we'll be quantifying that and laying that out when we lay out the budget.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","The other thing you've got to, you know, balance against is what other cost inflation pressures are there out there, so looking at that whole spectrum.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Understood. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning, Dave. Just wanted to ask you a little bit about the timing of the EPIC NGL conversion coming in 3Q. Does that impact the way you're thinking about completion activity in the Delaware next year or is it more driven by the row development that you talked about?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well I think it starts with the row development, Arun, but it kind of coincides nicely with how we've laid out the row development plan to be well down the road by the time this EPIC line goes into place. So I think it matches up extremely well. That goes back to my point earlier that I'm glad we took the steps to start the row development now so that we...","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Can be out ahead of this by the time this line comes on, and that gives us a lot more flexibility when this line's in place.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. And then the row development, obviously, a caller earlier asked about the three-year plan that you put out earlier in the year. Is the row development kind of a shift from the thinking when you all put that plan together? Because we're just still trying to think about your activity levels next year.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, it has a little bit. It's changed some of the activity profile near-term. I'd say longer-term, it creates, you know, the value, protects or it creates more value longer-term. But near-term, it changes some activity profile, like we've talked about and as expected. So takes a little longer to catch back up to that, but I think in the long run, we'll see tremendous benefit from this.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And just my follow-up, Dave, is regarding the DJ 2019; we expect you to be pretty active in Mustang. You highlighted some wells in Bronco, but any broad thoughts on what the mix of wells could look like between your areas in the DJ?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, I think, and Hodge can correct me here, but it will be a mix of Mustang, some Wells Ranch, and we'll actually be back to some East Pony next year also. Is that fair to say, Hodge?","Thomas H. Walker - Noble Energy, Inc.","Correct.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Okay.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Earlier in the year, I believe it was, you talked about your long-term growth targets in areas like the DJ Basin and the Permian. And obviously, there have been some changes that you've made to your capital allocation and then maybe some uncertainty, at least for the next week, over at the DJ. But I wonder if you could just kind of talk about where you see the long-term or three-year CAGRs from both those basins or when you would expect to address that.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think first thing, Brian, is to get through the budget for 2019 and then look at how we want to lay out capital and how that ties to activity. Again, what we're managing to are the three things I mentioned earlier when you look at our long-term targets. They're managing to that cash flow CAGR and making sure we're driving that leading cash flow CAGR. I think that's one of the key things that's going to make us competitive, not only within our own industry but other industries.","We've committed and we've told investors that we're going to get back to double-digit return on capital employed. So we'll make sure we're setting up our capital program and our activity to support that by 2020. And we've also told folks that we're going to, with Leviathan come on, be generating significant amount of cash flow, so that can support our shareholder returns and the activity growth going forward. So I'd stay focused on those three key things as to what we're focusing on as we lay out our capital plans.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. And my follow-up is on the capital allocation, shareholder return and also M&A. Noble, over the years, has not been shy about doing M&A. That's how you built a strong position in the DJ, and built your positions in the Permian Basin. As we inch closer to that cash flow you talked about, from free cash flow you talked about from Leviathan coming on, how are you thinking about the importance of retaining that for share repurchase versus considering additional M&A?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think it's going be important to have the balance that provides some aspect of that return to shareholders. I mean, I think that's just part of the new world here, or maybe the world we always should have been in, I don't know. But the other aspect is, and you go back to the things I talked about, the visibility on the new projects and so forth that are already in our inventory, sequence of those things coming on over the next five years. I think that gives us plenty to work on right now. So I think that's the focus of what we're doing, both of those items.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jeanine Wai of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jeanine Wai - Barclays","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Jeanine.","Jeanine Wai - Barclays","Just wanted to follow up on your prepared comments regarding Prop 112 and then hitting on some of the other questions that were asked. In your prepared commentary, you talked about how you've completed thorough contingency planning, and you mentioned your more rural position in the basin and proactive permitting. And my apologies if I missed it, but can you talk about your non-DJ-related contingency planning, specifically what is the efficient frontier (50:26) in the Delaware right now in terms of activity as it stands today, given your footprint and whatever other considerations you have? Row development clearly is a big step change in efficiency there. But it also seems like the timeline of meaningfully folding in successful oil exploration might be a little bit far off, and I know that you've always focused on efficient growth.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think the opportunity set, I mean, that's the advantage of having a portfolio of opportunities of different things. Next year, we'll be spending some money, I expect, in West Africa on some opportunities that we see there that will be helpful next year. We'll be positioning some things in the Eastern Med for the next opportunities here, on just what we've talked about getting ready. I think in the Onshore, the nice part is, we have inventory in the Delaware and the Eagle Ford also, that we can allocate capital to, especially after we get this row development in place and up and running by the middle of next year. So, we'll look at all those things as to what's the right thing to be doing.","And in the DJ, our plans are laid out pretty well right now for what we need to be doing. So to your point, we're not going to get into discussing specific contingency plans on various items right now, or on any speculation. But I think the takeaway is that with the portfolio that we have, the quality of the portfolio and inventory of opportunity, that gives us a lot of capability to redirect as we need to.","Jeanine Wai - Barclays","I guess so if you had to redirect more activity to the Delaware, is there kind of a ballpark rule of thumb with given your current footprint and how you're set up with infrastructure or whatever else, your acreage could handle X amount of rigs and still operate efficiently versus where you are today?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","I think we need to work through the budget on that and lay out some of the timing of various things. But safe to say, we could handle a little bit more activity than we are today. We wouldn't want to ramp things up too dramatic to where you start to create efficiency problems and take a step backward on things. So we'd need be smart about it.","Jeanine Wai - Barclays","Okay, great. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session.

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Larson. Please go ahead, sir.","David R. Larson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks Melanie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Noble Energy's fourth quarter and year end 2014 earnings call and webcast. This morning, we issued two news releases: one covering the fourth quarter and full year earnings and the second one laying out our outlook for 2015. A few supplemental slides for the call were also posted to our website.","Following today's remarks by Dave Stover, we'll open the call for Q&A with the executive team and hope to wrap things up in less than an hour. We would ask that participants limit themselves to one primary question and one follow-up. Finally, I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains projections and forward-looking statements as well as references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of these.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dave.","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, David and good morning, everyone. I'll start out with a few highlights of Noble Energy's fourth quarter before focusing on our plans for 2015. From an execution perspective, it was an excellent quarter where we delivered significant growth in our U.S. onshore programs and progressed a number of deepwater development projects toward startup.","Sales volumes averaged a record 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 14% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2013 after adjusting for asset sales, highlighting our performance with our U.S. onshore horizontal volumes, up more than 50%.","We ended the year with total proved reserves of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent, as production and non-core asset sales were offset by additions and revisions in our core areas. Over 90% of the reserve additions came from the execution of our low-risk U.S. onshore program, with the remaining coming from the Gulf of Mexico. We replaced 200% of our production in the U.S., even with PUD bookings reflecting future drilling activities based on the current price environment.","On the financial side of the business, we remain highly focused on maintaining substantial liquidity, protecting our balance sheet and sustaining our investment grade rating. Late in 2014, we proactively issued $1.5 billion in long-term notes at record low coupons for Noble and ended the year with $5.2 billion in liquidity, including $1.2 billion in cash and $4 billion on our undrawn credit facility.","Over the last three years, we've been very active in generating cash flow to the business through portfolio optimization, realizing over $2 billion in after-tax proceeds from non-core asset sales and our CONE MLP IPO. And I think it's important to mention that looking forward, we will continue to seek additional ways to protect our financial strength and flexibility and monetize assets that feel are undervalued. We've been very proactive in our hedging for 2015, with approximately 70% of global crude oil and 48% of U.S. natural gas hedged at attractive prices. Our Israel gas is also acting as a great natural hedge, an important contributor to our cash flow during the year, highlighting the benefits of our diverse portfolio.","Obviously everyone is focused on how the energy landscape has changed in the past several months. I believe the combination of our high-quality assets, deep drilling inventory, strong balance sheet and fiscal discipline have us well positioned not only for the current year, but for the long-term as well.","A key to our success and forward focus remains diversification, which has proven to be a competitive advantage in volatile markets. Our portfolio of opportunities around the world is well-balanced between liquids and domestic and international gas. It includes thousands of drillable locations in two top-tier U.S. unconventional plays, both of which are well positioned on the industry cost of supply curve.","These assets are essentially held by existing production, so we're not restricted in our ability to ramp up or down when appropriate. Offshore, our assets do not require large amounts of maintenance capital but contribute significant cash flow to the business and provide running room for future growth. This combination of assets gives us a tremendous amount of optionality in how we allocate capital and manage risk.","As we look at the uncertainty surrounding commodity prices and service costs, it is clear that now is not the time to push near-term production growth. The rapid decline in commodity prices has caused industry margins and project economics to be squeezed. With commodity prices at depressed levels, costs must find a new equilibrium with product prices before we resume investing for significant growth.","The depth and duration of the current commodity cycle is unknown. So we believe starting 2015 with a capital budget of $2.9 billion allows us to retain our financial strength and flexibility for an extended period of time. This program aligns us with the investment environment and cash flow and we continue to be very disciplined in capital allocation and focused on cost management.","We're intensely scrutinizing our costs and have already captured significant cost savings and reductions from our service providers. While these are primarily focused on achieving immediate cost reductions, we're also looking at the opportunity to implement some structural cost changes, where we'll have a long-term impact on margins and the efficiency of our business.","Now, let's walk through some of the details of our 2015 program. We've talked previously with many of you about the capital optionality in our portfolio, including the U.S. onshore program, major project spending and exploration as our primary levers in the allocation process. This year's program allocates approximately 60% of our CapEx to our core U.S. onshore and about 35% toward development of our offshore sanction major projects, which deliver substantial cash flows and value to the business. Exploration is set at around 5% of the budget, although we're still testing a couple of very material prospects that we're excited about.","In the DJ Basin, we're coming off a year in which we delivered about 30% growth in our horizontal volumes and further advanced our understanding of the value upside from long laterals, downspacing and enhanced completion techniques. We're currently running a four-rig program and have focused our activity in the Wells Ranch and East Pony development areas, where we can drill a higher percentage of long laterals and can optimize the use of existing infrastructure. Total capital allocation to the basin this year is around $900 million.","In 2015, we will continue to evaluate well performance from our 2014 downspacing tests, to assess incremental value in the basin above our standard 16 well per section development plan. We now have high density tests across all of our development areas with early performance meeting, and in certain areas outperforming expectations. We're not anticipating a one-size-fits-all downspace program across our acreage. Additional production data collected this year will help fine-tune our understanding of high density spacing and ultimate recovery throughout the basin.","Early indications from downspacing continue to suggest there's a huge prize for us in the DJ. Our capital budget assumes a $4 million average well cost for a standard length lateral in Wells Ranch and East Pony, which is down meaningfully from prior years. This has been achieved through supplier price reductions, use of existing infrastructure and sustainable efficiency improvements, much of which has already been captured to-date.","Our teams have been on the forefront of testing multiple completion methods in the DJ and we continue to see evidence that our sliding sleeve design is the best value. In 2015, we will continue to modify this design for optimal stage length and fluid type, both of which have the potential to reduce well costs even further.","Another factor driving efficiency enhancement in our program is the ability to drill extended reach laterals, which continue to deliver higher recovery and lower well cost per lateral foot. Approximately 50% of our 2015 wells will be extended reach. Overall, the program lateral length will average 6,500 feet per well, a 20% increase over last year. These are all components of a very competitive, unconventional liquids play. And the economics, even at today's prices, remain very attractive with before tax rates of return of approximately 40% and payout in under two years. We expect third-party infrastructure to improve in 2015, beginning with the startup of the 70 Ranch compressor station, which commenced in the first quarter of this year.","The Lucerne-2 plant and Rockies and Trout compressor stations are progressing for startup in the second quarter, providing necessary expansion of infrastructure in the Northern Greater Wattenberg area. In addition, we have recently committed to a third-party low-pressure gathering loop in Greater Wattenberg, which will have a positive impact to the overall operation of the field as early as the beginning of next year. On the operated side, we continue to build out our infrastructure in the basin and will investigate strategic opportunities to monetize these assets.","In the Marcellus, total capital for 2015 is currently planned at $900 million, with about 15% of the amount for midstream infrastructure. We're continuing to work with our partner on the optimal investment for 2015. This is not the time to be accelerating gas production, therefore, we've reduced Noble operated activity in the Marcellus to two rigs, while retaining the ability to accelerate drilling should that make sense in the future market.","Performance in the Marcellus shows that it is a world-class asset that is being even further enhanced with completions such as Reduced Stage and Cluster Spacing. The RSCS design continues to outperform standard completion by approximately 30% on our operated wells and we will continue to increase our use of this design in our 2015 program. Recently, gross daily production from the joint venture reached 1 billion cubic feet equivalent per day, with the major contributor to our growth in 2014 being the wet Noble operated volumes.","As mentioned earlier, we're completing our sanctioned oil projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Our estimated Gulf of Mexico development budget is $600 million, with three new fields to come on in the next 15 months. The lineup of production includes Big Bend startup in fourth quarter, Dantzler which has moved up to around the end of 2015, followed by Gunflint by mid-2016. While these projects don't have a meaningful impact on 2015 average production, they're certainly big contributors to our yearend in 2016 liquids rate.","We're currently finishing completion operations at the Dantzler-2 well and expect all drilling and completion operations in the Rio Grande area to be finished by mid March. Remaining 2015 investment is focused on subsea pipeline installation at Big Bend and Dantzler and drilling and completions operations at Gunflint.","In West Africa, the majority of the development capital will be directed to the Alba compression project in Equatorial Guinea, which will create additional value by lowering decline and extending the life of the field. We plan to resume exploration in West Africa with the Cheetah prospect offshore Cameroon. Cheetah is an oil prospect with a 47% working interest, targeting over 100 million barrels of gross resources and representing Noble's first Cretaceous test in the Douala Basin.","Moving to the Eastern Mediterranean, Tamar continues to perform exceptionally well, both from a reservoir and facility standpoint. Seasonally high demand and debottlenecking of the facilities has resulted in recent record production days in excess of 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas in gross sales.","I want to spend a couple of minutes discussing the regulatory environment in Israel. For over 15 years, we've been working with the government and people of Israel to explore for, develop, and produce natural gas. Our success has delivered substantial value to Israel in terms of reduced fuel and electricity costs as well as new energy security.","Early last year, Noble Energy, its partners and the Israel Antitrust Authority reached an agreement for the consent decree that included the divestiture of the Tanin and Karish gas fields in an effort to support competition of supply and move forward the development of Leviathan. A recent decision by the Antitrust Authority to not submit the agreed consent decree for final approval was a direct reversal of their prior agreement and another example of the uncertain regulatory environment in Israel.","As a consequence, we have suspended essentially all investment in Israel except for our Ashdod compression project, which is nearly complete. Resolution of the antitrust matter along with progress on a number of additional regulatory matters is required before we can proceed with significant further investment in Israel's energy sector. A predictable and stable regulatory environment is critical requirement in decisions related to major energy development projects. We continue to have discussions with the government in an effort to establish the regulatory framework necessary to progress development of these world-class resources. While no agreement has been reached to-date, we remain committed to finding appropriate and workable solutions. However, we are also prepared to vigorously defend our rights related to our assets in Israel.","It's worth remembering that Israel has only been producing gas for just over a decade. The discoveries of the giant Tamar and Leviathan fields provide the opportunity for substantial regional exports, which is changing the energy landscape of the Eastern Mediterranean. We're excited to be leading the way as further expansion of Tamar and initial development of Leviathan have the potential to materially expand energy, economic, and environmental benefits to Israel and the region.","We were able to sign multiple LOIs for regional export in 2014. The most recent of these was an LOI with a customer in Egypt to supply interruptible volumes from Tamar. The terms of the LOI include up to 250 million cubic feet per day with pricing equivalent to other export LOIs that we signed. It's an opportunity that can have near term impact, requires very little capital and would provide relief from gas shortages in Egypt. We have not assumed any of these potential sales in our base guidance, but are hopeful to commence exports this year, pending government approvals. To wrap up the Eastern Mediterranean, we continue to progress plans for development in Cyprus with our discovery there providing another option to meet growing regional demand.","Our exploration investments this year companywide will be about 5% of total planned expenditures, lower than past years given the environment. While the budget is reduced, the program will test an underexplored area in the Falkland Islands with multibillion barrel potential, as well as our large prospect in Cameroon. We will use 2015 as an opportunity to further strengthen and enhance our exploration portfolio. I am confident that our best-in-class process and talented employees will continue to deliver exploration projects that will be a key contributor to the long-term growth of Noble Energy.","As I mentioned earlier, now is not the time to be pushing near-term production growth. We have scaled our capital program back and expect modest growth of approximately 5% from 2014, driven primarily in the U.S. onshore business as well as Israel. In the U.S. onshore, we expect meaningful growth with more than 5% growth in the DJ Basin and 40% plus in the Marcellus. Natural gas sales from Tamar in Israel are expected to rise 10% or so year-over-year. Volumes are anticipated to be down about 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day year-on-year in West Africa, with approximately half of this amount being attributed to natural field decline and the remaining from plant turnarounds.","In the Gulf of Mexico, we anticipate flat to modest declines through the year until the Big Bend startup in the fourth quarter. While quarter-to-quarter volumes for us can vary quite a bit, contribution from our Gulf of Mexico development project sets us up well for 2016. In fact, excluding whatever Israel investment turns out to be, we can maintain and even slightly grow 2016 volumes at even lower capital levels than this year. It is this portfolio and diversity of projects that provides Noble a differential advantage going forward.","For the first quarter of 2015, we expect sales volumes to range from 305,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with the primary variance from the fourth quarter of last year being the timing of liquid listings and planned facility downtime in West Africa. Our U.S. onshore business at both the DJ basin and the Marcellus are anticipated to show growth with deepwater in Israel relatively flat.","Due to uncertainty as to the depth or duration of the present cycle, we believe the prudent approach to 2015 is to manage the spend more closely to cash flows. While this plan provides us with a more modest growth rate than we previously projected, our actions will continue to be focused on ensuring that we exit the current cycle with substantial operating and financial strength that will allow us to either resume a more accelerated pace of activity or pursue other opportunities that may arise. I believe this strategy is the appropriate course of action in a volatile market. Our U.S. onshore development, major project execution and exploration capabilities have us uniquely positioned to differentially outperform over the coming years.","Melanie, at this time, we'd like to go ahead and open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will take our first question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John H. Abbott - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Good morning. This is John Abbott calling in for Doug Leggate. We appreciate you taking our questions. If I could start off, what proportion of your Wattenberg inventory is economic in the current price environment before hedges?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, what I talked about in the inventory that we're drilling this year has about a 40% average return on that. So what we're focusing our activity this year is in what we would consider our best economic areas which are Wells Ranch and East Pony. And as I mentioned it allows us to also take advantage of infrastructure up there.","John H. Abbott - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Appreciate that. And this is a follow-up here. A number of your competitors have been delaying completion. Why not do the same? And also, as a follow-up to that, coming into the year what is your uncompleted backlog in both the DJ and the Marcellus?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we had a number of \u2013 if you go back to what we talked about last year, we had a number of completions that were coming on towards the end of the year into the beginning of this year. What we've done is we've looked at our inventory for this year and how we've laid the program out for this year. We've actually set it up so we've spaced out our completions more through the year. Part of doing that was tailoring that to some of the discussions on with the suppliers and service companies that went along with how we implemented some of this cost reduction very quickly here into the beginning of the year. And part of that was also tailoring then the pace of the completions. So we've actually slowed down and tailored that completions to tie it in with the \u2013 what we had set up from a frac crew standpoint that went into the discussions on how we implemented some very quickly reductions and completion costs here at the beginning of the year.","John H. Abbott - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","I appreciate it. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll go next to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. The DJ is really interesting, but I think you did a good job explaining what's going on there, Dave. I wondered if you could give us a little bit more detail on how your conversations are going on the Marcellus. And there's language in your press release that you're still working to figure out the plan for 2015 and one other kind of wrinkle to it seems to me is that, it seems to me that actually because of the NGL pricing and some of the infrastructure problems up there, actually the dry gas areas seem to me to be more attractive right now, at least for 2015. And so, could you work that in to your discussion?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Charles, it's a good question and one we've continued to be in discussions with our partner up there on what is the right activity level. What we've got built in right now reflects probably a decrease over where we started last fall when we started in this budget process, and I'd say it's an ongoing discussion to kind of optimize what the program should be. I think we're probably still in the camp that we could probably continue to push that down a little and I think we'll see how that progresses over time but it's a good healthy discussion. I think, in any good partnership, even if you aren't completely aligned up front, the structure of a good partnership is you continue to have good discussion and that's where it's going. I mean, and we've continued to bring down the program over time when you go back to last fall. So...","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. And would it be fair, Dave, that bringing the program down would be more on the non-op side for you guys than operated?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we've already brought the operated side down. We brought that down to two rigs on the wet gas. So I think the discussion now has continued to move around what is the right amount of activity level on the dry gas portion.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then if I could ask a question about Cyprus and this may be too far afield but I thought I'd try. Given the hurdles that have been thrown up in Israel, you're \u2013 as I look at it, the find you have in Cyprus is not that far west of your Leviathan find and you were talking about doing some pipeline exports from Leviathan. So I wondered, is that a possibility to do pipeline exports from Cyprus now and I'm thinking that where you didn't quite have enough for an LNG facility, but that was really before this regional export market popped up and I wonder if the Cyprus find can plug into that possibility.","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I think we believe Cyprus can still play a role in that whole Eastern Med regional picture there. I mean one of the things we're working with them on what would be the development plan in Cyprus, as you mentioned, was kind of moved away from an LNG project and probably more something that would be more of a regional piece. I think the other thing I would mention and remind you too, when we talked about even the regional market on what we were looking at for our Israel volumes, as we were marketing that and looking at what the size of that market could be, we were seeing a market that was potentially double the size of what we even were having in those LOIs. So I'd say there's definitely a role to be played for additional gas there.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much, Dave.","Operator","We'll go next to Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","If I may I would like to ask you about your year-end reserve booking. It's a little flat. So I want to kind of pick your brains on how you have approached the PUD. It sounds like you are taking a pretty conservative approach, probably using some pretty low pricing. Then also how did the events in Israel might or might not have impacted your year-end booking in 2014?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Yeah, on the first part of that, Irene, yeah, we could be approaching \u2013 we don't to be in a position where you happen to, if this is an extended low price environment that you're having to bring reserves off the books. So we actually made sure when we looked at our five year projection of activity levels, that we took into account the current environment without knowing when this current price environment would end. So we were looking at it more from the aspect of being in this environment for a while. So that influenced our onshore PUD bookings.","I think when you think about it from an Israel piece that the next big booking there will be with either some expansion at Tamar or the sanctioning of Leviathan and I think we all know we still have some regulatory hurdles and things to get in place on Leviathan to get that sanctioned. So that will be the next big booking from Israel. So I guess when you look at PUD bookings, and especially with this five-year rule, and then whatever price you want to assume, it's kind of moved away from the PUDs representing any change in quality of asset or anything, but more of how you're looking at tailoring your timing of your activity depending on what environment you want to project it through.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Gotcha. So you're really taking a very cautious approach assuming the worst and hoping that things wouldn't turn out that way but regardless your booking's pretty solid.","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Absolutely. And then it gives you the room for, as the environment turns up, you're adding to it.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Rowe with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Yes. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to maybe just outline a little bit about your anticipated cash flow outspend in 2015 and you mentioned earlier in your comments that you could look to monetize assets that you feel are undervalued. And so is your intention to plug the cash flow outspend gap with those asset sales, and if so, which assets should we be thinking about?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think obviously anything we can do on some asset monetization helps with that. I think the real driver in how we've set up our program and what we're looking at this year is to move as quickly as we can, irregardless of those other kind of portfolio levers as we'd call them, to get our cash outflows more in line with our cash inflows. And with what we've set up and realizing it takes little bit of time based on spending last year that rolls into this year, that we expect by mid-year, we should be in a good place on matching up our outflows and inflows. And then anything else we can do with other portfolio of things can just supplement that and keep us in an even better position.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Kenneth M. Fisher - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And we're planning it at conserve \u2013 this is Ken Fisher. We're planning at a conservative deck. When Dave says that.","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Kenneth M. Fisher - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","When Dave says that.","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we're working off that 50 to 55 range.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just one follow-up would be, you mentioned earlier trying to achieve some structural cost changes that may be distinct from just the service price reductions you're seeing as activity and rig levels are falling. So, is the thought here that these costs that you're getting on the structural side could actually continue to stay low even if we do see commodity prices rebound, and then potentially get service cost inflation picking back up again?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think it's a great opportunity to make sure everybody's laser-focused on the efficiency part of the equation and what we're working on. I mean, one of the things we put in motion a couple years ago and talked about was these integrated development plans and so forth.","And what you're saying is, a large part of our drilling for example on the DJ this year is focused in areas where we can start to see more advantage of that. We're already seeing some advantage of that on capital savings coming from the result of how we're handling facility costs, water handling and so forth. We're also seeing some of that impact on LLE and that's a little bit of what I reference when I talk about how we want to continue to embed more of these structural changes into how we go forward.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. A couple questions, and you've referenced this a number of times. But as we start thinking about going forward, if we look at the macro, one of your competitors put a slide out today saying at $65 oil they could earn the same return as they did at $95 oil in 2012. How do you view that internally? How much more cost reduction or efficiencies do you need to get back to, say, in a normalized $80 oil price environment a year ago? Now you're \u2013 that number becomes $60. I'm just trying to get some framework around how you're thinking about the longer-term cost curve in the U.S.?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, I'm not going to sit here and tell you I can match a current certain price with a certain cost reduction. I can say that the emphasis this year is starting to see more of this cost reduction. You've seen folks talk about 10% to 20% reductions on cost. You wanting to embed more reduction on an LOE basis too in some of this. So I think just this cost focus this year as folks have moved away more from an activity focus that was driven by growth, but now a chance to step back a little bit and look very hard at the cost side of the business, the efficiency side of the business, how we optimize things. We'll see the ability to change the economics at different prices. By how much, we'll have to continue to watch as we go through the year.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. All right. And I guess for a follow-up, if I think about your cash flow CapEx, I know there's some assets in the DJ that could be monetized from a midstream standpoint. Can you just talk about what those opportunities look like, how much of your portfolio you think you could monetize? Just anything around that as far as divestitures.","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think the first thing you look at is the non-producing asset piece and you kind of hit on one that's high on our radar screen is the infrastructure in the DJ Basin. We took the first step last year in what we did with our Marcellus infrastructure and I think that's turned out to be a very nice business opportunity for us. So I think we'll continue to look at things like that. I think the infrastructure in the DJ lends itself. I mean we continue to look around at our growing infrastructure in the Gulf even for example. Who knows, but that's something else that we'll continue to look at. So, there's various pieces of the business that still lend themselves to highlighting what their value can be and potentially unlocking some real value here.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thanks for the color. I'll jump off now. Appreciate it.","Operator","We'll go next to Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, good morning, gents. Dave, I wanted to start off talking about the DJ. I know you guys at some of the analyst meetings have talked about your view of the DJ kind of under a major project type of umbrella where you're introducing the IDPs. I was just wondering, with the IDPs, at how nimble you can be in a down cycle given your development approach that you're taking there.","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, I mean the nice thing is, we have a huge inventory in a large playing field out there, when you think about the 600,000 acres or so. When we've talked about the IDPs and what we've implemented, we kind of started with Wells Ranch and then we've been moving towards East Pony. So hand-in-hand with that is where we're going to concentrate this year's activity.","So, I think we have the ability to be pretty flexible. I think we've got the ability to adapt either way, pretty quickly. I think in this environment, we probably won't do as much front-end loading of facility capital right now. I think what it does is probably move us back just slightly on when we will see some of these other IDP bigger facility capital come in place. But I think it is a great time to benefit from this facility infrastructure that we've put in place and that we've already built. And I think we're going to capture some tremendous benefits of that as we match our drilling program to where we have this facility infrastructure in place this year.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's helpful. Just a quick follow-up, just on the completion count that the guidance is based on. I was wondering if you could just give us a ballpark of \u2013 I know you're going to four rigs in the DJ and two rigs in the Marcellus, at least on the operated side. What is the year-over-year change in completions in those two areas?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think just off the top of my head, I think in the DJ, it's probably about half, close to half of what we had in 2014. In the Marcellus, I'm trying to think here and look and see if I've got something on actual completion inventory. I don't know if I got the completion number on the Marcellus here right off hand.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","If I could sneak one more in, Dave, I just wanted to get some details around Israel. Obviously there's been a U-turn in terms of the anti-trust decision. What do you think drove that and what are the potential \u2013 what are some of the remedies that they're potentially seeking in terms of your assets there?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, obviously as far as remedies, we're in a lot of discussion with the government and even anti-trust on this. So it's, as far as remedies and what they're trying to accomplish, they're concern is about competition over there and that really was driven by the fact that when you go back in time, we were the only ones that were really successful and we were successful on a large scale over there. I think \u2013 so where we are and I think we were surprised. I think a lot of people over there were surprised with the reversal on that decision. And the thing that we're focused on now and what that's highlighted is the need to put together a comprehensive framework to provide some regulatory certainty and stability going forward to make the investment decisions.","I mean when you go back to the discussions with the anti-trust commission and where we had gotten to last year, we essentially agreed to and thought everybody had agreed to the resolution to that competition was selling Karish and Tanin. When you think about that, Karish and Tanin in total is about three times the size of what Mari-B was and Mari-B produced about 600 million a day for a number of years.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Right. Okay.","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So we thought that was a pretty good solution at that time. So right now what have entered into the equation is a discussion now of, okay, so how do we move forward on this. The good part of it is that it's brought the ministries together to even better understand the situation and better understand even the importance of resolving this and resolving this quickly for the betterment of Israel and actually the whole region over there.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks for your comments, Dave.","Operator","And we'll go next to David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Good morning guys and thanks for taking my question. Your comment on 2016 growth on lower CapEx was encouraging. One of the things we've been trying to think about is I know you have deepwater projects that are coming online, but with a lower activity level in the Wattenberg, do you have a shallower base decline at an exit at 2015 as opposed to where you're exiting 2014 on a higher activity level?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, yes, Dave. I mean the base question of that is you've got a lower amount of new production coming on. So it lowers your delta on absolute volume coming off, obviously. I think the other piece, and it points to our diversified asset base and why we think that is especially a strength in volatile price times. One of the decisions we made was to continue with the completion and the development of our Gulf of Mexico projects. That's going to add significant volume by the end of this year that gives us a year-on-year nice improvement out there for 2016. The other piece not to forget about is the Tamar volumes over there, and that continues to have growth potentials based on in-country demand without additional investment. So I mean, that is a -two pieces of a portfolio that we think are definitely differentiators for us.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","And then on the political landscape in Israel, clearly has weighed on you valuation some, but thinking about where Israel is now with Tamar online and the revenues that the country generates, where does that go to whenever a planned Leviathan development comes online, whenever that may be at this point. But I'm just trying to think of how much value is created to kind of the nation of Israel and why they \u2013 what is the incentives that they're thinking about from a Leviathan development?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. There's a huge incentive for them to get these projects on. When you think that they actually capture over half the value that comes from any volume of gas, whether it's sold in-country or sold in an export arrangement. If you remember on a Leviathan, we're talking about a capacity \u2013 a facility capacity of 1.6 Bcf a day and probably a run rate that would be closer in that 1 Bcf a day to 1.2 Bcf a day. A large part of that would be targeted from \u2013 would be targeted to go to export with some portion for fill-in with whatever is needed in the domestic demand. But you think of that relative to the perspective of Tamar and what it's doing now, we've seen the figures that indicate that's 1% of their GDP growth over there. So it's a huge impact.","Kenneth M. Fisher - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, David and...","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Ken can add some color.","Kenneth M. Fisher - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","When the export rules were passed, there was external study done by McKinsey and if I remember correctly the delta value to the citizens in GDP was $230 billion. So over the life of exports, and also it was 20 more \u2013 it was estimated to be 20 more years of domestic supply because of further exploration activity. So it's a material impact on the nation and the citizenry.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll go next to John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Yeah. Thank you. Regarding the U.S., Dave, you've given us your budget and activity for 2015. If prices are sustained, should we consider current planned activity levels to be kind of the new normal if prices stay weak or would you even cut back further?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think in this environment, we'd say \u2013 we'd monitor that as we go through the year but I'd say we just assume this kind of a level into next year. The thing that would change is we'd drop out this capital from the Gulf of Mexico developments and that's where I made the statement that you can see flat to increasing production growth next year based on the way our portfolio's set up with even less capital when you think of taking the Gulf of Mexico development piece out.","John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Right. Are the service companies at all willing to do term deals yet or is it still just basically discount from book?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that's probably all across the board I think. One of the things that we did was focused in pretty quickly with our top 100 suppliers and service companies and engaged in discussions with all of them, very quickly. I think some of it's been some immediate change. In fact, I think we're up to talking to our top 300 now. Some of it's been immediate impact, some of it, they're trying to get some costs rolled through to them that hopefully we can go back and also get some portion of that also. So everybody's in discussion with their suppliers.","John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Okay. That's fine. Regarding the exploration budget that you cut back, originally you had two wells planned in the Falkland, as it could be two or one, and then could you describe what the structure is at Cheetah, Cameroon?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In the Falklands, we're still assuming the two wells down there. So we've got two wells still in there and we've got the one for Cheetah probably about mid-year. It's a Cretaceous \u2013 it's our first Cretaceous project over there.","John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Right. But is it three way, four way?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","If I remember it right, John, I think it's a four way structure.","John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Bob Brackett with Bernstein.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah, quick question on the Marcellus. It looks like that's the lion's share of your production growth this year. Does that wedge assume a 6-rig program or are you already paring that down to less than that?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It assumes current activity levels out there.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So.","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Go ahead.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah. So we should sort of \u2013 if you achieve a reduced program out there, will that impact your full-year growth?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Probably, I mean the tail-end of the year, not a whole lot for this year, because most of the volume in there is associated with completions that get staggered probably about six months or so from when you drill them. So anything that changed activity levels in the latter part of the year probably has a bigger impact on the following year.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And in terms of Israel, if you're generating free cash flow in Israel because of investment difficulties, can you use that cash anywhere or is that preferentially spent in West Africa or in international exploration?","Kenneth M. Fisher - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. The Israeli cash is CFC or controlled forward corporation cash, but we have a pretty flexible structure built that allows us to fund around the world.","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Other international.","Kenneth M. Fisher - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, I think we've got a lot of flexibility there.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","But you can't necessarily bring it home without getting a hit.","Kenneth M. Fisher - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We have a structure that's allowed us to bring significant \u2013 we bought $1.3 billion back in 2014 without paying any incremental tax. So we have pretty flexible structure.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning. On Wattenberg, it looks like you have some line of sight to some of the third party midstream opportunities or bottlenecks getting into place and then online in the second quarter. Do you see this clearing the deck on midstream bottlenecks or are others emerging? And should we see a step change in second half Wattenberg production or is that just offset by reduced investment?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think when you look at the bottlenecking portion, I think there's a lot of things as we mentioned, Brian, that are going in place in the second quarter. There's also that, what we call the Grand Parkway System which is a big loop, if you will, to debottleneck and be more efficient on how gas is distributed around the field that will come into place towards the end of the year, beginning of the next year is when we'll really see the impact on that. So there's some staggered things that will be coming in place and then you start to get into the next plants beyond that. So, we'll continue to have to keep our eye on what else can be done as we move through the cycle here.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And I guess the quarterly trajectory, should we then expect once some of the plants are on in the second quarter that we'll see a step up in third quarter volumes, or how do you think about the trajectory?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I mean, that's going to have to be matched with the activity. I think when you think of the trajectory for the DJ for example, the second half of the year is probably going to be lower than the first half at this activity level. I think when you think of the company overall, I think the fourth quarter will probably be our, what we would foresee now, probably be our highest volume quarter when you consider the influx of some Gulf of Mexico production.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yep. Got it. And then one last one. In Israel, just wanted to clarify the level of investment in your CapEx that you are planning here for this year. Would that sustainably keep volumes flat before future expansion projects or is there some point at which your reduced level of investment would lead volumes to decline?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I think actually what we are investing in this year is completing the compression project, so that actually gives us a little more capacity. So I would say, at this level of investment, or essentially minimal to no investment going forward, you ought to be able to stay flat to grow and that's going to depend on the demand up to the level of what that Ashdod compression capacity gives us. So, up to about that 1.2 Bcf a day or so.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Joe Allman with JPMorgan. Mr. Allman, your line is open. Please check your mute button.","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We'll go to the next question.","Operator","We'll go next to Dave Kistler with Simmons & Co.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Co. International","Morning, guys.","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey. Morning, Dave.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Co. International","Really appreciate all the color on 2015 and certainly understand the adjustments to CapEx, seems prudent et cetera. In the past, you guys have given us longer dated plans that go out as far as five years. Any ability to update that forecast for folks right now in terms of how we should think about going through the model? I know you're being super conservative with a $50 to $55 deck, but just trying to help triangulate the next several years.","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think we ought to be going out too far in this environment Dave, because I think we've got to tailor that to what activity levels are you going to assume and how quickly are you going to ramp back up. I think what we wanted to do is give folks some perspective on how we see 2016 at certain level of investment to just give them some comfort on how we can sustain ourselves and even still grow some in 2016 at very low investment levels. I think starting to project beyond that's going to depend on where you start to ramp up, especially your onshore programs.","What I will say, when you go back to that five-year outlook, none of the resources in there have changed at least to the downside. If anything, what we've learned through our drilling programs, it continues to put upward pressure on that. So the nice thing is the resource is there. Now the timing and pace of activity is going to be dependent on how we handle and how we match up with the financial aspect of it and that's going to be dependent on price environment and cost structure.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Co. International","Yeah, I appreciate those clarifications. I know it's a difficult question, obviously, in the current environment. But maybe tying that a little bit to the financials and the current liquidity position, actually it seems like your target, or at least what you're communicating here is to just be pushing forward that liquidity position into 2016, 2017 when the environment does change so that you can ramp at that point, given that the resource base is, as you just highlighted, actually increasing during this time period.","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I mean when you think about it, we've got a wealth of inventory here. So it makes sense for us to maintain our liquidity, such that when the time is right, we can move as rapidly as we want to move to start to capture this additional value. So, I think you got to tie the whole financial management with the operational management. And the thing I like about our position is, we've got a very strong financial position. We're committed to keeping a very strong financial position. We got an inventory, a huge inventory of opportunities, and we've got a great proficiency in onshore developments, offshore developments, exploration and major project execution. And we're going to continue to fine tune and improve those efficiencies and proficiencies as we go.","It's one of the nice things about even our program this year. Even at this reduced capital level we still are exposing ourselves to some very significant material exploration prospects even at this level. So we continue to keep that exploration proficiency going. We continue to move the major project proficiency along as with these developments in the Gulf of Mexico. So, it's not like we've set any portion of our programs and capabilities on the shelf.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Co. International","I certainly appreciate that and makes sense in the current environment.","Operator","We'll go next to Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey guys. I was hoping you could follow up on what type of pricing we need to see here on the oil side, and I guess the natural gas side for the Marcellus to where you'd start to feel comfortable with activity increases. And could activity increases happen during 2015, if we saw a nice rebound as we moved into the second half? How quickly can Noble respond?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, well I think what we've talked about, Leo, is making sure that we're in a position that we can respond quickly. I think when that will be is open to interpretation at this point, but two things are going play into effect is what's the outlook on commodity price and how much cost are we seeing being able to pull out of the business that we feel we can sustain being out of the business, and continue to keep out of it. And how does that world match up both on commodity price and cost as we look forward. But our objective is to maintain our flexibility so that when that time is right, we can move very quickly.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. I guess, let's just throw in a hypothetical. If costs are down another 10% over the next three or four months and oil's $65 in July, will you guys add activity in the DJ?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We could. That'd probably be the first place where we'd look at it.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And I guess just in terms of Israel, can you maybe just put a little bit more color around the situation? Is it one where you guys are negotiating with the government and the ministry on what the potential outcome may be? Or is it more of one where you're awaiting the government to tell you what they need on their side and can you maybe discuss what Noble's legal rights are with regards to its assets as well?","David L. Stover - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. I think where we are in discussion is, we're engaged in discussion. We always think it's helpful to be engaged in discussion. So we're engaged in discussion with this government committee that's been pulled together that represents the ministries. And I think one of the things I mentioned earlier, this is probably the first time we've had the opportunity to be truly engaged in a discussion with a group that represents all the ministries, all the folks we need to get in the room together. And that discussion's centered around setting up a comprehensive solution that has a regulatory framework that can sustain the investment in development for future projects. And that's really the nature of the discussion.","Part of that whole discussion has been also \u2013 it's not just us in that discussion. They've had to bring in \u2013 if you think about this and the way we've talked about our investment, our future investment in Israel, we've talked about ring fencing that, about it being tied to financing and project financing and so forth. So that's lent itself to where some of these folks who would potentially finance some of this type of activity, the banks and so forth, financial institutions around the world are also weighing in on what it takes to have a sustainable investment climate.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And what are Noble's legal rights in this situation here?","David L.

Welcome to Noble Energy's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Larson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","David R. Larson","Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Noble Energy's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call and Webcast. On the call today, we have Chuck Davidson, Chairman, CEO; Dave Stover, President, COO; and Ken Fisher, CFO.","This morning, we issued our third quarter earnings release, and hopefully, all of you have had a chance to review our results. A few supplemental slides for the call were also posted on our website. If you have not downloaded them already, you will want to do so as they will be good reference material for the discussion today. Later today, we expect to be filing our 10-Q with the SEC, and it will also be available on our website.","The agenda for today will begin with Chuck discussing our very strong third quarter results and providing an update -- updated view of the remainder of the year, including a number of significant exploration activities. Dave will then give a detailed overview of all of our 5 core operational programs and near-term plans. We'll leave time for Q&A at the end and plan to wrap up the call in less than an hour. [Operator Instructions]","I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains forward-looking statements, as well as references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those.","As a reminder, we will be hosting our 2013 analyst conference on December 17 here in Houston. This is going to be an opportunity for us to provide a deep dive into our core assets and our new venture exploration opportunities. We will have a number of our management team reviewing their thoughts and plans for creating differential, long-term value to our many stakeholders.","With that, let me turn the call over to Chuck.","Charles D. Davidson","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Before getting into our third quarter results, I thought I would step back and put things into a bit of a broader context. Some of these themes you'll hear more about at our upcoming analyst meeting that David just mentioned.","But first is that we're not where we are today by accident. We arrived here through a unique strategy, as well as unique execution. We have established ourselves as a diversified company excelling in 2 lines of business, the first being in onshore unconventional developments and the second in offshore exploration.","I believe we're positioned extremely well today in the onshore U.S. business with core positions in premier oil and natural gas plays, which are delivering huge and valuable growth for our company. You can see that growth delivery on Slide 4, which illustrates that in under 2 years' time, our horizontal production in the DJ and Marcellus has grown by over 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In the offshore exploration business, we've also had tremendous success with multiple major discoveries now online and the next set of projects being sanctioned. These significant resources, including 35 trillion cubic feet in the Eastern Mediterranean, nearly 1 billion barrels equivalent in West Africa and, now, 2 more major projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, are normally found in much larger companies. In addition, we have a lot of material exploration in front of us, which is providing huge running room for future growth.","This portfolio, coupled with our ability to execute, results in very unique growth for a company of our size. This growth is not a 2013 event alone, but, rather, a sustained, multiyear profile. So Noble today is a large company, growing value very rapidly. This is highlighted by our delivery of record volumes and record discretionary cash flow in the third quarter.","I want to stop for a moment and touch on the recent and devastating Colorado floods that affected many communities in and around our areas of operation there. We remain steadfast and completely committed to helping affected communities in Colorado recover. For us, this is an opportunity to live out our corporate purpose of energizing the world and bettering people's lives. And so we're doing exactly that, partnering with a number of support agencies across Northern Colorado and devoting significant human resources to help in the process.","Our teams did an amazing job in preparation response with safety always our highest priority. I think it's a tremendous accomplishment that we had 0 safety incidents related to the flood. And I want to thank our employees, not only for their work at a very challenging time for own business, but also for their outstanding community support shown to their neighbors.","Focusing in on our third quarter, we experienced great quarterly results. On Slide 5, you can see that our sales volumes were up 13% from the second quarter of this year. Discretionary cash flow was up 29%, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.97 a share was up 40%.","We had record sales volumes of 293,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with high quarterly marks set in 4 of our 5 core operating areas. This was a 26% increase versus the third quarter of last year after adjusting for the sales of certain noncore onshore U.S. assets.","Crude oil sales volumes were up 14% from the second quarter this year with significant contributions coming from the DJ Basin, the Alen project, as well as strong oil liftings at Alba. Our natural gas volumes were also up double digit on a percentage basis, driven by activity in the Marcellus, DJ and Israel.","Revenues were $1.4 billion for the quarter, up 21% from the second quarter this year, with 80% coming from liquid products. Discretionary cash flow from continuing operations was at a record of $984 million, and we ended the quarter with $940 million in cash, total liquidity over $4 billion and net debt-to-book-cap ratio of 29%.","The majority of our costs were in line with our expectations, including lease operating expense and DD&A. Continued success through the drill bit at Troubadour, the Cyprus A-2 appraisal well and our Diega appraisal in West Africa resulted in no dry hole expense for the quarter.","Our interest expense, shown on the income statement, increased this quarter due to the completion of Tamar and the early start of Alen. This lowered the portion of interest that we capitalized. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was a bit higher than our annual guidance range, largely due to a change in the Israel corporate tax rate, as well as adjustments related to our annual tax provision.","Before handing the call over to Dave, I wanted to provide some recent highlights and things to look forward to between now and the end of the year. I mentioned major projects earlier, and most people typically associate major projects with our offshore business only. However, we're also taking a major project approach to our onshore and conventional developments. We believe this is where we can drive differential value for our company.","Now this is all about our Integrated Development Plan, or IDP approach, which is being implemented in the DJ Basin. We have recently completed our first central processing facility startup at the Wells Ranch IDP and have a number of other IDPs identified for the DJ Basin. This strategy ties in very well with our recently completed acreage exchange, which will ultimately allow for a more focused and contiguous development in this leading oil play.","We believe that achieving significant scale will ultimately be a very competitive advantage in onshore resource plays. Small players with more scattered acreage positions may still be able to drill good wells, but, in our opinion, will lose long-term competitiveness through higher infrastructure and operating costs. That is why we see the trade with Anadarko as so positive for both of us.","We're applying this major project approach to our Marcellus acreage as well, beginning with our large position in the wet gas Majorsville area. And later this year, we should have our first pads online from the new areas in West Virginia and Southwest Pennsylvania, which will further delineate our large Marcellus position. Combined, between the DJ and the Marcellus, we'll have a deep inventory of high returns, lower risk unconventional opportunities representing years of drilling with a lot of value to create.","We continue to streamline our portfolio and reached an agreement to sell our San Juan assets in New Mexico for gross proceeds of approximately $65 million. Our portfolio optimization remains an important part of our strategy, and we're continuing to pursue the sale of our remaining noncore properties. In total, we have generated about $1.4 billion in gross proceeds from the sale of noncore assets since the beginning of 2012.","In our offshore business, we've now approved the sanctions of 2 deepwater Gulf of Mexico major projects: Gunflint; as well as the first phase of development at Big Bend, which is part of the Rio Grande complex. Two great projects, both showing really high value per barrel. Both are subsea tiebacks that could come online in an accelerated timeframe.","In West Africa, we continue to ramp up the Alen project. We're close to completing, commissioning and processing of the reinjection -- excuse me, we're close to completing the commissioning of processing and reinjection facilities. We're also making progress on the next liquids developments in EG at Diega with a flow test that's currently underway.","Moving to the Eastern Med, we couldn't be more pleased with operations at Tamar and how the field continues to perform. Beyond Tamar, which is primarily dedicated to the Israeli domestic market, we continue to work predevelopment on many fronts on the 18 Tcf Leviathan field.","We experienced a true breakthrough this past year -- excuse me, we experienced a true breakthrough this past week with the Israeli high court ruling in favor of the government, thus solidifying the natural gas export policy issued earlier this year. We can now move forward in a number of areas related to Leviathan. Leviathan is almost certainly going to be composed of multiple major project phases initially supporting the Israeli domestic gas market, which is expected to continue to grow.","In addition, we continue to have multiple discussions related to the development of regional gas exports to nearby countries, for both near-term interruptible supply, as well as long-term baseload opportunities. We anticipate having an LNG project as well, which could take many forms. The options being studied include stand-alone LNG in Israel, either onshore or floating offshore, as well as a possibility of a combined project with our large Cyprus discovery.","We don't want to forget, our portfolio also includes new high-impact exploration potential. We're in the midst of a number of important exploration test with our first wells currently drilling in Nevada, in Nicaragua and a large Dantzler prospect drilling in the Gulf of Mexico as well.","Off the coast of Nicaragua, the Paraiso prospect has been drilling for several weeks now, and we anticipate results by the end of November. The prospect ranges in size from 200 to more than 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We have recently completed an additional farmout of interest during the quarter, bringing our working interest down to 70% from the well with our paying interest substantially below that. Results from the first well will help to define the potential of additional oil prospects we've identified on our nearly 2 million-acre position.","Offshore Israel, we've moved our drilling rig to the Tamar southwest prospect, which is a standalone structure, with gross on those resource range of 500 billion to 900 billion cubic feet of natural gas.","Back in the U.S, as I mentioned earlier, we advanced our drilling currently in the Gulf of Mexico and are drilling our first well in the Wilson oil prospect in Elko County, Nevada. With several results expected in the next couple of months, I would hope we will have a very nice exploration story to talk about in December.","And we continue to move forward on a number of other opportunities for future drilling as well. We've recently completed 3-D seismic over the majority of Block 12 offshore Cyprus, and we're preparing for additional 3-D acquisition offshore the Falklands and Nicaragua as well, not to mention our ongoing deepwater Gulf program in the deep Levant opportunity.","As I mentioned earlier, the results we're realizing are not by accident or not just simply a result of the environment we're in. We've been very deliberate in our strategy, how we have optimized the portfolio and how we execute. Our teams are already busy preparing for the analyst conference in December, which will show, I believe, a very bright future for Noble Energy.","So now, I'll turn the call over to Dave.","David L. Stover","Thanks, Chuck. As you highlighted, our onshore U.S. unconventional programs are delivering","[Technical Difficulty]","Charles D. Davidson","Welcome back. Sorry for the interruption. It looked like there was a technical difficulty there. I was just finishing up on my comments, and I believe where we lost it where I was turning it over to Dave. So Dave is going to start again at the beginning of his section.","David L. Stover","Okay, Chuck. Let me pick up where we left off there. As Chuck highlighted, our onshore U.S. unconventional programs are delivering substantial growth and value for our company. In the third quarter, our core positions in the DJ Basin and Marcellus contributed, on average, 125,000 barrels equivalent per day, an increase of 16% in just one quarter's time frame and over 35% from the equivalent period a year ago.","Our third quarter in the Marcellus continued to show the momentum we're building in the play. Production averaged nearly 170 million cubic feet equivalent per day, up 50% from the second quarter as a result of new pads and wells brought on production. In the wet gas area, as seen on Slide 9, the SHL 8 and WFN-1 pads commenced flowback during the third quarter, bringing 18 new wells online and production of over 90 million cubic feet equivalent per day gross. We've increased our operated rig count in the wet gas area to 5 with 2 rigs drilling in Majorsville and one rig in each of Pennsboro, Oxford and Moundsville delineating new areas. Combined with our partners activity on the dry gas side, we remain on target to drill approximately 120 wells in the Marcellus this year.","Capital efficiency continues to be a major area of focus, including the drilling of longer laterals, optimizing our completion designs and utilizing consolidated gathering and processing facilities. Slide 10 highlights the continued transition to longer laterals with our 2013 average, thus far, at approximately 7,000 feet versus 2012's average of 4,600 feet. This is resulting in lower cost per lateral foot drilled down approximately 15% this year. In fact, we've recently drilled some of the longest laterals in the Marcellus to date with 5 greater than 10,000 feet. Initial production from these 5 is anticipated late this year.","We're also continuing to optimize a number of wells per pad with all of our pads drilled to date including between 4 and 11 wells. Performance of our wells remains in line with or above our 5.6 billion cubic foot equivalent type curve, standardized for a 5,000-foot lateral. Late in the second quarter, we brought online the WEB 4 pad in West Virginia, which includes 11 wells on production with an average lateral length of 5,700 feet. These continue to perform consistent with type curves and show a recent flattening of decline, which suggests a potential for higher ultimate recoveries.","On the dry gas side, our partner CONSOL is drilling and completing some outstanding wells in Southwestern Pennsylvania and Northern West Virginia. Of recent note is the Nineveh 38 pad. These wells were completed with shorter-stage spacing of 150 feet between stages versus typical 300-foot spacing, resulting in elevated production rates. In fact, one well, the 38C with a lateral of 7,200 feet, IP-ed at 19 million cubic feet per day. In addition, late in the second quarter, CONSOL brought on the first joint venture Upper Devonian well, which was drilled in the Burkett Shale. Production started at 3 million a day with essentially no decline in the first 3 months of production.","Strong pipeline and market access to exit the basin, we have not seen the large differentials that have impacted operators in the northeastern part of the play. Factoring in our growth realized to date and the outlook based on drilling and completion activities, I feel very confident that we will exceed our prior projection of exiting 2013 with net production of 210 million cubic feet equivalent per day.","In our other core onshore asset, the DJ Basin, our production averaged over 97,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the third quarter. In just 1 year's time, we have increased our total production by 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with 70% of the growth coming from oil.","On Slide 12, we have included an updated map reflecting the recently announced acreage exchange executed with Anadarko. You can see from the pre- and post-map that the exchange has resulted in much more contiguous acreage positions for both companies, with Noble receiving approximately 50,000 acres in the north and eastern areas of greater Wattenberg. We expect to realize significant efficiency improvements from the trade with benefits coming from centralized field facilities, streamlined operations and reduced sand work. The large contiguous acreage blocks will also provide the opportunity to accelerate and optimize drilling activities and add more extended-reach lateral wells to the program. Even with the 8,000 barrel equivalent per day impact of production near term, we expect our DJ Basin production to grow by at least 20% next year.","During the third quarter, we spud over 90 operated horizontal wells in the DJ and remain on target to drill close to 300 wells for the full year, representing nearly 1.5 million lateral feet drilled in the Niobrara and Codell formations. As a result of some logistics challenges in the basin following third quarters floods, we estimate that we'll exit the year with a number of drilled locations which have not yet been completed. This represents a near-term timing delay in bringing this production online, and we plan to be fully caught up on the backlog in the first quarter of 2014. Fourth quarter incremental operating costs associated with the flood repairs are estimated to be between $6 million and $8 million.","In support of our aggressive long-term growth for the basin, we're in the midst of seeing a number of significant infrastructure projects come online, expanding capacity on both the natural gas and crude oil side. Our partner for natural gas processing has recently started up the O'Connor facility, previously known as LaSalle. This plant is ramping toward initial capacity of 110 million cubic feet per day and will be expanding to 160 million a day early next year.","On the oil side, the Wattenberg trunkline, delivering crude from the northern part of the basin to our Platteville facility with access to the White Cliffs pipeline began line sale in early October. Property -- progress on the White Cliffs expansion is moving forward for completion in the second quarter of next year. Delivery to the Plains' rail facility is anticipated to commence in the next month or so. Combined, the White Cliff's expansion and Plains' rail project are increasing oil transport out of the basin by approximately 150,000 barrels of oil per day.","Standard- and extended-reach laterals throughout the basin continue to perform well. We have highlighted on Slide 13 the standard-reach laterals that have been brought to production in 2013 in our Wells Ranch and East Pony areas. The green line represents the 2013 wells, the blue is 2011 and 2012, and the dash line is the equivalent type curve. The 2013 wells continued to be consistent or better despite having averaged 20% tighter spacing. Same is true for extended-reach laterals program, where we continue to see ultimate recoveries in excess of the 750,000 barrel equivalent type curve. This continues to highlight the quality of our inventory.","The startup of our own Wells Ranch Central Processing Facility in the third quarter is a significant milestone for Noble Energy. Slide 14 shows these facilities, including oil, gas and water processing, as well as recycled water storage. This central facility is currently capable of processing 22,000 barrels of oil per day and 50 million cubic feet of gas per day with plans to double capacity by mid next year.","In Northern Colorado, our next Integrated Development Plan is the East Pony area, where we continue to see very positive drilling results. Earlier this year, we performed a 40-acre downspacing test in this area, drilling 8 standard-length laterals and a half section. Included in the 8 are 5 wells in the Niobrara B zone, one in the A and 2 in the C bench. Results have been very encouraging, and while early, the wells are performing at or above our type curve. In addition, we have just recently commenced production on our first long lateral in East Pony with a lateral length of approximately 9,000 feet. The well has been on production for 2 months and is currently producing 800 barrels of oil equivalent per day with 80% oil.","Shifting offshore to the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Production during the quarter was 19,000 barrels a day equivalent, 90% was crude oil and natural gas liquids. Of specific note during the quarter, Ticonderoga #4 well was successfully completed and commenced production in late September. At full rate, it is anticipated to add over 3,500 barrels of oil per day net to our production.","Chuck mentioned our recent sanctions of both Gunflint and the initial phase at Rio Grande, which provides the next leg of production growth to our deepwater Gulf business. Rio Grande will initially be a one-well tieback of our Big Bend discovery with first production estimated in late 2015. Gunflint is planned as a 2-well tieback to come online in the middle of 2016. Combined, our initial net production from these 2 fields is estimated to be 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Moving to our International businesses. In West Africa, the Aseng oil field continues to perform very well, having averaged approximately 47,000 barrels of oil per day gross in the third quarter with expected decline. At Alen, our production ramp has taken somewhat longer than anticipated as commissioning of the processing and compression facilities has been extended as we worked to operate both of our large gas compression trains in parallel. This should provide for a full test of facility capacity within the next month.","I've been very pleased with the integration of production, storage and offloading, utilizing the Aseng FPSO. Alen will be a significant contributor for 2014 liquids growth for Noble.","During the third quarter, we successfully drilled an appraisal at the Diega oil field. The I-8 appraisal well came in better than expected, encountering 39 feet of vertical pay and good reservoir consistency along our nearly 1,400-foot lateral. Reservoir quality is very good, and we're currently performing a nearly month-long flow test to assist in ultimate determination of reservoir size. Diega represents the next liquids development for us in West Africa and is likely a subsea tieback to existing infrastructure at Aseng.","In the Eastern Mediterranean, Tamar continues its outstanding performance as we set a record quarterly sales volume of 255 million cubic feet net per day for the third quarter, equivalent to around a gross volume of 775 million cubic feet per day. As we mentioned in our last call, the early part of the third quarter was relatively mild summer period and September was impacted by a number of holidays. Despite these effects, we did have some periods of very high demand during the quarter with a single day max of over 915 million cubic feet gross and certain intra-day peak load periods where the field averaged over 1 billion cubic feet per day. We continue to make significant progress on our compression project at the Ashdod onshore receiving terminal, which is designed to increase capacity and deliverability into the growing Israel domestic market.","Slide 16 is a walk-through from our third quarter to our anticipated fourth quarter volumes. On the far left bar, we've adjusted the third quarter volume for the production associated with the DJ Basin acreage exchange, as well as the sale of our San Juan assets. This accounts for about 10,000 barrels equivalent per day difference from the third quarter to our anticipated fourth quarter volumes. On this slide, you can see our significant underlying onshore unconventional growth, representing a combined DJ Basin and Marcellus 10% quarter-on-quarter increase and also higher volumes in the Deepwater Gulf as well. Natural gas demand in Israel is normally lighter in the fourth quarter than the third, and sales volumes in EG, that's Equatorial Guinea, are expected to be less than production as a result of the timing of liftings. We've also shown the impact of storms in the DJ Basin and Gulf of Mexico properties for the fourth quarter.","Our updated sales volume range for the fourth quarter is 280,000 to 285,000 barrels equivalent per day, and we expect to exit 2013 with production volumes in the range of 300,000 barrels equivalent per day. As a reminder, the portfolio adjustments we have made this year, including the DJ acreage exchange, as well as the sale of noncore properties through the year, represents approximately 4,000 barrels equivalent per day on an annualized basis.","In closing, there's certainly a lot to review and discuss in December at the analyst conference. This will include our updated thinking on accelerating our growth plans in the DJ Basin and Marcellus and how we're implementing our Integrated Development Plan approach. We'll also focus on our offshore core businesses and how we have uniquely created substantial value in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and Eastern Mediterranean. In each of these positions, there's a platform from which to grow even further.","I'm also excited about our global exploration portfolio, which includes significant running room opportunities in many of our core businesses, material upside and multiple new venture projects, which have the potential to become new core areas for Noble. We look forward to the opportunity to share more about how we continue to build and unlock value as we discuss our business in greater depth in December.","With that, we'd now like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dave, I'm guessing some of these questions will be addressed in December, but I'm going to try one and one follow-up, if I may. You mentioned that you're quite pleased as -- I guess, you're encouraged by what you see on the different bench drill tests in the Wattenberg. But I just wanted to get some clarification, are you assuming the same type curve for the primary zone as you are for the different benches? And that's my first question, and I have a follow-up on activity, please.","David L. Stover","Yes. The answer to the first one is pretty easy. Doug, yes, we are. We're basing everything off the same type curve, again, tied to different lateral lengths.","Charles D. Davidson","But as a reminder, we have multiple type curves throughout the field. So you can't go from one area to another and use the same type curve. It's a broad array of type curves.","David L. Stover","And as we've also talked about the benches, they have different impacts and contributions in different parts of the field. In other words, in some parts of field, we'll concentrate on an A and a B; in other parts, we'll concentrate on a B and a C, for example, based on their geology.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it, okay. So I'll look for clarification in December. My follow-up, I guess, is can you help us with what is the limiting factor for the activity level? I think you've talked about having 1 or 2 rigs over -- in last year's presentation. But is it actually a limiting factor or is -- are we likely to see you address the pace a little more aggressively as we come up on the Analyst Day?","David L. Stover","I'd say near term, it's getting these Integrated Development Plans in place and tying everything in from an overall facility structure and infrastructure, tying everything in together. I'd say in the long term, it's going to definitely accelerate the pace of activity when you look out over the next few years, and I think that's something that we'll talk even more about here in December. But what you're trying to tie in is everything from staying on schedule with your gas plants and staying a year or 2 in front on that, along with now these big central processing facilities, tying those in together and concentrating on the pace of development that you're looking at in each different area. What it's going to enable you to do as you pull these IDPs together is really get more efficient as we go down the road here. And so our anticipation is it will allow us to accelerate activity over time here.","Charles D. Davidson","I think also, Doug, we just have to keep reminding ourselves that while it -- we can change and pick up rigs with just a few months' notice that -- especially in gas processing facilities with the permitting and everything that goes along with it, those can be 2- and 3-year lead times. So we're working with our partner, our processing partner, to not only -- as we accelerate our activity to -- for them to also be accelerating theirs. But we have to take a longer-term approach when it gets to those big pieces of infrastructure.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly. Looking at CapEx on the quarter and relative to the slide you provided that showed 2Q as well, looks like it would be running ahead of kind of the guidance you gave back at your Analyst Day last December of $3.9 billion. How should we be thinking about that for next quarter? And generally, how should we be thinking about that CapEx looking forward?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think we're actually maybe closer to on track than what those numbers would show. And the key factor is that, as we noted with the acreage exchange with Anadarko, we're getting a refund of a little over $200 million of capital. That -- it will be cash. So this will -- that capital that we'll spend for those wells, it'll stay on the books. But really when you deduct that from our year-to-date capital, that puts us closer to about $3 billion year-to-date and with a run rate per quarter of about $1 billion. So the way we're looking at it, when we adjust for the refund that we got on the acreage exchange, we're at a run rate of about $4 billion, which is, I think, pretty close to on the money from our guidance of -- I think it was $3.9 billion.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Perfect, perfect. Well, I appreciate that clarification. And maybe switching over to the Niobraras, I think you're going to be sharing more on the -- excuse me, shifting over to the Marcellus, as I think you're going to be sharing more on the Niobrara at the Analyst Day. When you look at the growth that you're showing today and you project going forward now running 5 rigs in the wet gas area, any concerns with respect to the need to blend dry gas or be able to deliver that wet gas without experiencing any kind of ethane rejections due to the high BTU content?","David L. Stover","No, Dave. I mean, that's something we looked at pretty hard. And I'd say, at least for the next couple of years, we seem to be in pretty good shape there. We're -- one of the things, we're able to blend some gas that CONSOL has from some of their legacy piece, too. So I think when you look at it and you look at the pipes we're on and where we have our firm transportation and how that's all tied together, I think we're in good shape for the next couple of years, at least.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes. Just -- you just made an earlier comment about the possibility of joint LNG development with Israel and Cyprus. I was hoping you guys could expand upon that a little bit. Is that something you think that both governments are amenable to at this point in time, or is it still kind of in negotiation?","Charles D. Davidson","It's -- I think it is an open item for discussion right now. It's one that we have brought up, and certainly, the government of Cyprus has brought it up as well. There are benefits to both countries to interconnect their gas systems. Because we have to remind ourself gas can flow 2 different directions and so, in effect, you can end up with the discoveries in each country backing up each other in terms of their domestic needs. So there's some benefits on that, but it's by no means a decided path. As I mentioned, we're looking at several options as we go forward here, and that's one of them.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess just jumping over to the Niobrara. Obviously, you guys have got some initial results there, kind of in the A to C in the Codell. In terms of how you guys think about it, I know it's probably early in the well results, but would you guys expect to see some interference between the traditional B zone or some of the other zones in terms of how you're thinking about it?","David L. Stover","We haven't seen it. I'd say, Leo, we -- at this point, we've not seen as we've gone down to 40-acre spacing and as we've gone to these different horizons. We just really haven't seen any production interference at this point.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I appreciate the update and good news earlier in the week from Israel. Just a question, if could you just provide any more color on the next steps or timing on the closing of the Woodside partnership and moving forward to development, and whether that -- the 40% export level is more reflective of the higher domestic demand? Or does that alter anyway that you think about -- a potential LNG project?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think on the latter part of the 40%, that was the adjusted policy that was issued by the cabinet and that's -- we believe that, that is supportive of all the export options that we're looking at there, which, as you know, include not only LNG, but also some regional gas sales also. So there's a lot that can be accommodated by that 40%. So I think we can certainly work within the framework, and certainly, the policy has some adjustments that allow you to move allocations between fields. And so when you go through that, it actually results in Leviathan being closer to 50% eligible for export. So that all fits with what we're planning. So as you pointed out, we received some very good news earlier in the week, and that's now allowing the parties to get back together to really see what our plans are next. I mean, this is not only the closing of the Woodside deal, which we're very eager to do, but also in moving forward with some of these projects. Again, there's a lot of work to be done. There's other government approvals that will be necessary in terms of how the fields are developed and where they will be delivered, how they will meet domestic gas needs. So we're -- we'll have to work through all those details with our partners and the government. But the big roadblock that we were facing, which was an export policy, was resolved for us earlier in the week.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great, great. And if I could, just to follow up on the DJ. And just to confirm the prior question, you were saying that you have not seen any communication, the 40-acre downspacing test in East Pony? Was that what you were referring to there? And then any color on the lower Niobrara liquid volumes in the quarter? I think it was 60% versus mid- to low-60s expected. Is there any -- I know there are a lot of moving parts in the quarter. Have you had any thoughts on how that might change the outlook or that was more of an anomaly?","David L. Stover","Yes. I'd say on the first part, whether you look at the 40-acre spacing in, say, Wells Ranch area or East Pony or any place we've tried it out there, we just haven't seen, with any extended production history here, any interference yet between -- so yes, very encouraged with all that. I'd say as far as the liquid volumes, there may have been some small impact from the flood piece and what was shut in for various pieces or whatever. But it shouldn't really have been a big difference one way or another.","Charles D. Davidson","We're not seeing any changes in trends in oil versus gas. This is -- with all the moving pieces we had in the quarter, I would view that as just...","David L. Stover","It can get influenced somewhat by where you're predominantly bringing wells on in each quarter. That's -- you remember, East Pony area is higher oil content than it is kind of in the Wells Ranch and so forth. So it's just the mix.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Arun Jayaram from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Dave, this one's for you. I know according to the '13 plan, you plan to do about 10 Codell wells and 80 Niobrara A and C wells. So I was wondering if you could maybe comment on how the Codell and A and C wells are comparing towards your B bench wells, which were the type curve in the 335 range.","David L. Stover","Yes. I mean, what we've seen -- I think the first couple of Codell -- and this one goes back to last year. We're kind of in areas that weren't quite as good as performance, but the ones we've seen this year that we've brought on have looked very strong relative to the type curves. I'd say the A and the C performance has been very similar to the B in the areas, especially where we're concentrating. As I mentioned, it varies as to what were concentrating on depending on where you are in the basin because the thickness of those 2 benches can vary somewhat. But we've been very encouraged by how well they've matched the B performance, if you will. Now we're just getting ready to bring on our first long lateral, Codell, I think, here shortly so we'll get some more long-lateral type performance on some other places. And then as I mentioned earlier, we've just started to bring on our first production on long lateral up in East Pony. So I'd say, going back to your original question or the AMC performance...","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","","[Technical Difficulty]","We'll continue with the Q&A session, and we'll go back to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Let me just ask, I think, it'll be 2 questions. One, I'm sorry if we're torturing this a bit on the East Pony 40-acre spacing, but I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this right and have the right expectations for what we can learn. Is it right to think about that you're doing something close to 80-acre spacing in the B, and then you're doing kind of a sawtooth offset with the A and C? And if that's the case, are we really going to learn more about how the A and C zones perform there versus the B?","David L. Stover","Thanks. You're right on the aspect, Charles. It is somewhat of a sawtooth piece. So they're not completed right above each other, if you think about it. They are kind of offset a little bit. But I think we are learning a lot about the ability. I mean, you think about the ultimate development of these sections, and we initially talked about 16 wells per section when we were concentrating on one interval. I think what is, again, giving us information is that, eventually, we could easily have patterns out here that provide 32 wells per section, for example, where you're combining 2 intervals, 2 different layers in that type of sawtooth-type pattern, something similar to that.","Charles D. Davidson","I think this is -- and of course, everyone is interested in -- and we've gotten the question a number of times on just the fact that we're not seeing interference. And this will be something we will certainly be talking a lot more about in December because it's really -- the prize here is in how these wells are completed and their configuration across the patterns, and so that's the key to unlocking this.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. As then as a follow up, if I look at your slide that you offered which was very helpful, Slide 16 on the walk up and the walk down on the quarter-over-quarter volumes. Just eyeballing it, it looks like that West Africa lifting aspects is -- it's roughly the same size as that DJ Basin bar on the right. So that's about 10,000 barrels a day, if I'm kind of estimating that correctly. And that strikes me as a little larger than the overlift that you had or twice as large as the overlift you had in 3Q. So I'm wondering, are you expecting to miss another lift at the end of the quarter, or is that perhaps also related to the slower ramp-up of the Alen processing.","David L. Stover","When you think about it, you've got to think about it from quarter-to-quarter. And if you were over 5 in third quarter and then you're under 5 in the fourth quarter, you got a 10 delta on quarter-on-quarter impact there.","Operator","And we'll go next to Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","All right. Maybe 2 questions. Wattenberg, what's going on in the East Pony area now that you have core up your empire towards the north? Then secondarily, maybe a little color on Nicaragua. Have you drilled your second well yet? And that's all I have.","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think, in terms of the -- you mentioned about coring up. The trade area was in the greater Wattenberg area, so it really didn't affect our East Pony acreage area. I mean, we're doing a lot of development in East Pony and things like that. I may have misinterpreted your question. But the trade was in the greater Wattenberg area, which is outside of East Pony. I think in terms of Nicaragua, what's happening there is we're just -- we're in the process of drilling the well, and we expect to have results by later in November.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","You're drilling 1 or 2 wells?","David L. Stover","We're still drilling the first well.","Charles D. Davidson","I'm sorry. I thought...","David L. Stover","We don't -- we won't have to make a decision on whether we want to drill a second well or not until after we reach TD and have a chance to look at things.","Charles D. Davidson","Yes, I apologize. I was talking about Nicaragua, and you were talking about...","David L. Stover","Yes. So we're not far enough along to make a decision on a second well yet.","Operator","And we'll go next to David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Heikkinen","Every time you drop off the call, your stock goes up. So we probably ought to just keep doing it. Thinking about the swap with Anadarko, how does that add to extended-reach laterals kind of in the Wattenberg and kind of coring up the opportunity set? Is that something that you saw as a benefit? And how should we think about that as kind of that blocking up acreage and now your success with longer laterals?","David L. Stover","Well, what it does is that you're not having to have sections that are kind adjacent to each other, where you operate one section and they operate the other and then you're trying to figure out how you're going to set that up from a development pattern. Now if you have control of the contiguous sections, then you can set that up ahead of time and plan for that. Like we said, especially these longer laterals take much longer planning. And if you know you've got this set up, you can lay that out so that you're considering both sections together.","David Heikkinen","And so do you expect to drill more long laterals as a result of the swap?","David L. Stover","Absolutely.","Charles D. Davidson","One of the real benefits of this transaction.","Operator","And we'll go next to Peter Kissel with the Howard Weil.","Peter Kissel - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Initially, I had one on the oil targets you've identified next year in the Eastern Med. And in particular, I was wondering if you could compare and contrast those versus the recent Yam wells that were drilled by another company, targeting oil down by Mari-B. Any sort of differences in source, rock, depth, location? Anything like that would be helpful.","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think, first of all, we weren't a party to the Yam wells, so all we've got is basically what you've got, which is the public information on it. We don't see the prospects as related, and I think that's kind of the most fundamental thing on it. And I think going beyond that, it's pretty hard to make any comparisons between what they were exploring for and what we would hope to explore for deep in the Mesozoic. So I think we're treating it as basically not being either a positive or a negative to what we're exploring for in the deeper Levant Basin.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Back to Wattenberg area. You seem to be on track for 32 wells per section over 2 intervals in the Wattenberg oil window, and it seems like, based on your comments, that may be where you're heading for East Pony as well. I guess, is what you're seeing in both these areas almost connect -- obviously, there are some geological features in between. But do you have now a more widespread view of the potential for this type of development between Wattenberg oil and East Pony? And how are you viewing the northern and northwest portions of your Northern Colorado acreage?","David L. Stover","Yes. I'll tell you, Brian -- just to back up on that. I said what we're testing is the potential for up to 30-some wells per section up in the northern part, in fact, you said, in the more oily part of the play, in northern part of Wattenberg and up into East Pony. So still early in the production phase of that, and we'll continue to get more information on that. But again, that's all about how do we increase the recovery out of this. When you go back to what we've talked about on 16 wells per section and you're still getting probably less than 10% of the hydrocarbon in place recovery on that. And we continue to get encouraged on just how much of a hydrocarbons there are, actually, in the interval. So I think we'll continue to test that, especially in the more oily parts of the play. As you talked about, we'll continue to test it with multiple benches here. But we're still thinking we have some running room here that we haven't fully tested. And we'll continue to expand that, and we'll talk more about that in December. I think as you look up into the north and northwest parts of the field, some of things that we haven't really tested that much yet. We haven't been in a rush to test some of that yet this year as we concentrated on kind of optimizing patterns and setting ourselves up for these Integrated Development Plans in what we call our development area. But as we continue to go, we'll continue to push out on some of that. Some of the encouragement we saw earlier this year in that Cummings area, where we did some longer laterals in an area that probably wasn't quite as productive on the normal laterals as we've seen in some of the areas we've been focusing on. That was real encouraging. And so what we'll be looking at as we move forward to test some of these areas to the north and northwest is do we want to do that with a little longer lateral program, at some point, than the normal lateral. But again, it's not a rush. It's not a hurry. We want to work with at the point that we can actually test them and actually produce them with -- in the infrastructure. We don't have lease timing hanging over our head. So we'll continue to do some of that, and we'll probably do some more of that next year that we highlight as we talk about our whole program for next year in December.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Shifting to the Marcellus. You mentioned, I think it was Slide 10, the rising lateral length. What's your target lateral length and variability we should expect around that? And when we think about the relationship between EUR and lateral length, is it 1:1, or is there some other ratio?","David L. Stover","Yes. I'd start with the latter part of that. I mean, right now, we're still assuming a 1:1 relationship, but we need to get some longer lateral wells online and see how that changes. I'd say, overall, we've seen it move from, on average, 5,000 or so that we're now -- we're probably up closer to 7,000-foot lateral length on ours. We've actually talked about a pad where we've drilled 4 or 5 wells of 10,000 foot. So it kind of varies by area. Again, that's somewhat driven by land position out there and how much room you have as far as contiguous acreage around you. So it'll depend by area. But I kind of -- our preference, as you've seen from what we've talked about, is moving to longer laterals in the Marcellus as we've implemented out in the DJ where we can.","Operator","And we'll go next to John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Yes, Societe Generale. Anyway, getting to the DJ, you have a lot of resource potential. You're doing more localized Integrated Developments Plans or a CPFs. Have you thought about plateau volumes, or how big your really could get your output to grow on the liquid side to then maintain it? Have you been thinking bigger picture?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think we're not in the -- thinking about plateau volumes. What this is really all about is managing multiple major developments and being able to do it in a fashion that you can do it in parallel as you move forward. So that you -- as we keep talking about, these Integrated Development Plans, these planning areas, which there's now several of them identified through the field, it's really -- it's all about being efficient, not only being efficient in how we develop them and the capital we use, but also being efficient in how we can operate them going forward and manage all the pieces associated with it. So it's -- I mean, it's -- I think from our view, it's a very exciting step forward in our thinking on how to develop a large resource play, such as we have in the DJ Basin. And I think it will -- as we talked about it, it will provide a lot of advantage as we go forward. But it's all about being more efficient and being able to put in place the infrastructure that will allow us, ultimately, to continue to accelerate this program.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","But, Chuck, do you think that the sizes that you're gearing for now are optimal or they could be larger in terms of the CPFs and your planning needs?","David L. Stover","Yes, John. That's the nice part about the way we're designing this is that their scalable, I guess, is the way I would put it. So with additional opportunity as we go, we'll be able to tie in and expand these facilities in segments.","Charles D. Davidson","Yes. Some have -- it's probably -- train is not the right word. But they're certainly built into their designs, a capability to, as Dave said, add additional critical facilities. When we look at Wells Ranch, we're already planning an expansion there.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. How much do the CFPs run about, just gross cost?","Charles D. Davidson","Somewhere around, oh, $35 million to $50 million. You're just talking about the basic facilities?","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Yes, that's all.","Charles D. Davidson","Or maybe about -- yes. For about -- that would probably handle about 700 wells. Hang on...","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. Last one for me on the DJ. What were the number of wells that were going to need to be completed in the first quarter? You broke up.","Charles D. Davidson","Okay, let me back up. First of all, I misspoke on the 700. It's more like, maybe 300 for a thing. And then you were -- you asked another question, John?","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Yes. You said that you're going to have some wells that weren't going to be completed, that were drilled in the fourth quarter that would be completed in the first quarter. Approximately how many will there be in the DJ?","David L. Stover","Yes. I think what the flood did, it put us back about 20 wells on the completion activity side. And that's what we'll be catching up in the first quarter. We've already brought a third frac crew in to help with that. So we're well underway on getting -- moving forward when that catch up, if you will.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. Last one for me is on Nevada. Will you have any information to discuss in December or is it still too early?","David L. Stover","If any, it'd probably be very small amount information. Our plan there still to drill 2 wells to get some actual infield information, if you will. And based on the expectation of the type of reservoir and type of play we're dealing with, this will just be some information that'll help us design how we want to test this play going forward. So until we really get into that test mode, there probably won't be a whole lot to report.","Operator","And we'll go next to Joe Magner with Macquarie.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Just a few others. In addition to the longer laterals and the tighter spacing that you're testing in the DJ, can you provide any initial details or insights into other completion designs enhancements that you're adopting?","David L. Stover","Yes. Over time, and if you look back, you've seen some of the performance improvement over the last couple of years. A lot of that has come from the optimization of, not just longer laterals, but even the tighter spacing of fracs, of stages, if you will. And so we're continuing to look at that and continuing to optimize fluid capability. I mean, that's very sensitive out here in the basin in our minds, so we keep a very close eye on that. What we had gotten to in the basin was kind of a 200-foot interval, as we had started at probably double that and got down to 200. We've tried some at a little less than that, and we'll probably continue to work on that and tweak that a little bit as to whether 200 is optimum or whether there might be something maybe a little lower or tighter spacing even stage. But that's just something we'll continue to work at.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay. And in the Marcellus, I realize you've got some firm transportation laid out, and you're not seeing any impact on being able to get volumes out of the basin. But what have you done to protect bases and how are you thinking about that issue going forward or other types of firms, sales agreements that would go alongside those firm transportation agreements you have lined up?","Charles D. Davidson","Well, I think we continue to a look at whether or not we should hedge bases, but we haven't seen the need to do that so far, again, because of where we are located in the play and the fact that we're not having to complete as much for that northeast market that has seen some larger differentials going forward. But also, there's -- we're certainly hopeful, there's been a couple of attempts of -- by the pipelines to add some additional capacity. And of course, there is a lot of capacity being built in the Marcellus, but more importantly, for areas that serve us. And I know that in the past, we have looked favorably on those, and we'll continue to look favorably on them if they're proposed in the future. But right now, we're not hedging any of that bases.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay. And just one last one, Paraiso sell down at 70% level. Is that something you're comfortable with, or should we anticipate additional farm-ins there?","Charles D. Davidson","I think right now we're pretty comfortable with -- given the transactions we've entered into. And the fact that the well is drilling, I think it's -- we're all really now just want to get the well completed and see the results and carry forward. So that's what we're comfortable with.","Operator","And we'll go next to Rehan Rashid with FBR Capital Markets.","Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just on Nevada. The path forward, so the initial program, is that just kind of vertical wells? And if so, when should we think about horizontals?","David L. Stover","Yes. That -- we're drilling -- we will drill 2 back-to-back vertical wells here. We're on the first well now, but we should finish those by the end of the year. And then we'll step back and look at -- actually the rig will go back to the DJ Basin is the most likely plan, while we take a short timeout to digest what we learned there and then decide how we want to go forward on a testing program. Do we want to come back and drill horizontal wells, concentrating on a particular interval based on what we see? Do we want to do something and actually test something, try to complete something on a vertical basis? And all depends on what we learned from these initial 2 vertical wells, but I would say we would be back in there -- with some infringement here, we'd be back in there by mid-year next year or so.","Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, okay. On deepwater, real quick. Dantzler, fine. Beyond Dantzler, are there -- kind of how should we think about kind of relatively higher impact inventory that you might have that you could test sometime next year?","David L. Stover","Yes. I would think after Dantzler, we'd probably have at least a couple similar type-sized opportunities that we'd be moving to next year. But I think it'll be a real interesting, exciting program in the Gulf here for the next -- well, through next year, from what we see. Between these wells that -- the exploration program that now probably has, actually, a little more size to it on the next couple of wells and then the development activity that's going to be going on.","Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And Dantzler, if it's a success, is there kind of close by capacity to kind of process, produce?","David L. Stover","I'm sorry, I missed the question.","Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So how would you develop Dantzler?","David L. Stover","Depending on the size, it has the potential size that it could be its own host, if you would. The nice thing, it's also in a neighborhood where you could tie back to a number of other potential opportunities. So it could go either way, depending on the size and it has the size potential to put it in either category.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Phillips Johnston with Capital One Securities.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on Brian's question. Wondering what current AFEs are running for your 7,000-foot lateral wells in the Marcellus? And I also wanted to ask just how AFEs are trending in your standard lateral wells in the Wattenberg as well?","David L. Stover","I think what we're looking at for 7,000-foot laterals in the Marcellus, when you consider pads, facilities, drilling and completion, not everybody reports those the same. But when you include all 3 phases of that, for us, it's about $8 million per well in the Marcellus for a 7,000 footer. I think in the DJ, on our typical 4,000 to 4,500 footer, you're in that $4.3 million to $4.7 million range.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And it sounds like this would be the last question on the East Pony 40-acre pilot. Just wondering what type of production history you guys are going to need on those 8 wells before we have any sort of conclusive results.","David L. Stover","Well, we've gotten a pretty good base over the first few months here. It's always nice to get out 6 months or so and see how things look. But -- and then get -- start to see some other pilot areas produce and compare results. I'd say we're -- we'll have an update in December on kind of all the activity and what we've seen. But whether you look at the pilot results in East Pony, whether you look at the continued results in Wells Ranch or even the extended laterals, we've been extremely encouraged with what we're seeing. And when you throw in the different performance from the different benches, it's -- we haven't seen anything to discourage us at this point. I'd say East Pony, in particular, will be -- we're looking through right now the programs for next year, and we'll talk more about that in December.","Operator","And this does conclude the question-and-answer portion for today's conference. I'd like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","David R. Larson","Yes. Well, I appreciate everybody's interest in Noble Energy and really want to thank you guys for hanging in there with some of the technical difficulties that we had today. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation."],"15693":["Noble Energy, Inc.

Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Operator","Good morning and welcome to Noble Energy's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Results Webcast and Conference Call. Following today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","And I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Whitmarsh. Please go ahead, sir.","Brad Whitmarsh - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Lisa, and thanks to everybody for joining us today. I hope you've had a chance to review the earnings release and the supplement that we published this morning. They are both available on our website, and later today, we plan to file our 10-Q with the SEC. I want to remind everyone that today's call contains projections and forward-looking statements, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures in our latest news releases and SEC filings for a discussion of those items.","Following our prepared remarks, we will hold a question-and-answer session. I would ask that analysts limit themselves to one primary and one follow-up. Dave Stover, Chairman and CEO; Ken Fisher, EVP and CFO; and Gary Willingham, EVP of Operations, will start us off with some prepared remarks. As we begin, I want to highlight a new accounting standard you should notice in our results and guidance. Beginning January 1, 2018, we've modified the presentation of certain revenue and gathering and transport expenses in accordance with FASB Accounting Standard 606.","This new standard also impacted the presentation of natural gas and natural gas liquids sales volumes for certain contracts. There was no impact to net income or operating cash flows and no impact on type curves or economics that we have previously provided. Guidance for the first quarter and full-year was originally provided prior to the new standard. In our press release tables for the first quarter, you will see volumes under both the old and the new methods. Our forward guidance is updated to reflect this matter.","Volumes have been increased by about 9,000 barrels equivalent per day, of which 4,000 barrels equivalent per day was NGLs and the remainder natural gas, all primarily in the DJ Basin related to percent-of-proceed contracts. And accordingly, we lowered cash operating costs, LOE and GTP, by about $0.10 per BOE. In addition, we've tightened the range on Gulf of Mexico volumes to reflect actuals through closing. As a reminder, closing occurred in April, nearly a month ahead of expectation at the time of guidance.","Results for the first quarter were very consistent with expectations and represented a good start to the year. Volumes were within our guidance range, although U.S. onshore was impacted by Eagle Ford facility downtime in March. Oil realizations were benefited by the timing of our West Africa liftings during the quarter. Costs overall were within range as well, though we did have a little higher LOE, which was more than offset by lower GTP.","With that, I'll turn the call to Dave.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Brad, and I appreciate everyone joining us this morning. Just two months ago, we visited with you about our multi-year outlook. As you may recall, our focus is on providing shareholders an investment opportunity that is competitive across all sectors, not just the energy space. We outlined the expectation of delivering leading cash flow per debt-adjusted share growth with a relentless focus on capital efficiency and corporate returns, while increasing our financial strength.","In the first quarter, we have taken many steps to deliver that plan. Our earnings and cash flow were above consensus, as we continued to demonstrate our execution capabilities and the quality of our assets. We also accomplished a number of strategic milestones important to our long-term outlook. At the same time, underlying energy fundamentals have continued to strengthen, resulting in a near-term commodity price outlook that has improved since the beginning of the year.","While this has provided increased revenue potential for 2018, it has not changed our capital activity plans that we recently communicated. It has allowed us to accelerate some of our share repurchase program and announce a dividend increase a little earlier than expected. This is a consistent step with our prior communication that we would anticipate dividend increases as cash flow grows. Taking a balanced approach to the use of cash, we also took the opportunity to pay down additional Noble debt, and Ken will provide more details on each of these items in a few minutes.","Looking at the first quarter, we delivered several outcomes that further support our confidence in the delivery of our long-term plan. From a portfolio perspective, completing the sale of a 7.5% Tamar interest and our Marcellus midstream exit were significant milestones and generated substantial cash flow for the business. Completing our Gulf of Mexico exit positions the whole organization within a clear focus on our high-margin, high-return opportunities.","2018 is a year of continued capital efficiency improvement, as we ramp up our program in the Delaware and transition our DJ Basin learnings to the Mustang area. Operationally, Gary will go into more detail, but I remain confident we are delivering top-tier results across our portfolio. In combination with Noble Midstream, we are installing new infrastructure in both of these basins that supports significant cash flow and volume growth in the second half of the year.","Our ownership in Noble Midstream and its growing position in the DJ and Delaware Basins provides strategic benefits, including access to critical infrastructure, flow assurance, as well as capital and operational synergies. This provides confidence in our ability to efficiently monetize our resources and to sustain long-term high-margin growth.","Our Eastern Mediterranean team is continuing to provide increased visibility to what is rapidly becoming near-term cash flow growth. The Leviathan project has made substantial progress on the execution front, and we continue to add incremental new contract volumes.","The execution of sales agreements to Egypt in the first quarter is significant, and we have also recently added contracts in Israel. First gas from this project is on schedule and the end of 2019 is not that far away. In the past, I've mentioned our focus on securing high-quality material exploration areas that could generate a new core area over time. I am pleased by our actions on this front. Although too early to get into specifics, we've made tangible progress in capturing opportunities to expand our portfolio for long-term value creation.","Looking back at our multi-year plan that we rolled out recently, some of the key outcomes include: compound annual operating cash flow growth of 35% over the next three years and a volume CAGR of 20%; return on average capital employed growing to approximately 10% in 2020; and net debt to EBITDA less than 1.5 times by 2020. It's worth noting that these outcomes were depicted in a price environment below what we are currently seeing.","In addition, we provided visibility for continued significant organic cash flow and corporate return growth for the three years beyond 2020. The projected cash flow ramp provides the capability to continue to return significant cash flow to shareholders, while building the business and accommodating new opportunities. Our financial, portfolio and operational accomplishments in the first quarter underpin our confidence in our long-term delivery.","Now, Ken and Gary will provide you more insights into these accomplishments and our plans. Ken?","Kenneth M. Fisher - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, we are executing very well on the long-term strategic objectives we communicated earlier this year. Specifically, in regard to the financial objectives, Noble's capital structure is well positioned to maintain strength and flexibility regardless of the commodity price environment. The financial actions we have taken have strengthened our position, and we are clearly focused on our shareholder return priorities with the commencement of the $750 million share buyback program and last week's 10% quarterly dividend increase.","Over the past few years, key financial accomplishments include maintaining an exceptional level of liquidity, well over $4 billion, throughout the commodity price cycle; eliminating almost $3 billion of gross debt acquired with the Rosetta Resources and Clayton Williams assets; significantly reducing our overall company leverage levels; and cost-effectively extending our maturity profile well into the next decade. These combined actions have helped us eliminate over $200 million a year of interest costs.","The first quarter was an action-packed quarter. We made further progress strengthening our financial position. Actions included repaying $230 million of debt, which cleared all our borrowings on Noble's corporate revolving credit facility. We also extended that $4 billion facility to a 2023 maturity. We expanded Noble Midstream Partners' revolving credit facility to an $800 million level, also with a 2023 maturity, and with a $350 million accordion feature. And very positively, S&P and Fitch both upgraded our outlooks.","And very importantly, we bought back over $67 million of Noble shares under the announced buyback program. As we discussed in February, we see an attractive return opportunity in acquiring Noble Energy stock for long-term value creation. Following the quarterly earnings quiet period, we will again continue to prioritize the share buyback through the remainder of the year.","In early April, as we moved into 2Q, we also exercised a favorable early call provision on $380 million of remaining legacy Rosetta notes. These bonds will be extinguished today, May 1, bringing our total 2018 debt reduction to $600 million, hence delivering the 2018 to 2020 target we established and communicated in February with our long-term plan.","Looking forward over the next few years, as Dave mentioned, Noble Midstream is a key strategic element of our onshore development program. It supports our upstream activities and highlights the significant value we have built in the DJ Basin and Delaware Midstream arena. Noble Midstream Partners has a leading organic growth run rate with 20% organic per unit distribution growth targeted through 2022. As sponsor, Noble Energy is focused on long-term value creation.","Given the value orientation, our value orientation and our financial flexibility and considering recent developments in the MLP sector, I would expect to see much more constructive market conditions before we would elect to engage Noble Midstream Partners in any drop-down transaction. In summary, I'm very pleased with our financial position and the progress to-date against our long-term targets.","Now, over to Gary for an operations update.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Ken. First quarter was a solid start to 2018 and execution was in line with our plans across our operations globally. We progressed infrastructure build-outs in the Delaware and the DJ Basins ahead of second half volume growth and saw record first quarter volumes from Tamar, driven by robust demand in Israel.","I'll begin today focusing on the U.S. onshore, where we've strategically diversified our operations across multiple top-tier liquids plays. This diversification offers several significant benefits. First, we've been able to accelerate the learning curve with operations experience and knowledge across multiple U.S. onshore basins. This has driven improvements in drilling times, accelerated the application of new completion methods, and delivered optimized upstream and midstream infrastructure designs.","Next, our long-term relationships with service providers have also benefited us, given our large-scale operations across multiple basins. Remaining well positioned in the queue minimizes challenges with securing the equipment and materials needed to ensure we can execute our plan. Finally, maintaining a significant depth of high-margin, high-return inventory across multiple plays provides optionality for capital allocation.","One other key area I'd like to spend some time on is the benefits our diversification has on our U.S. onshore marketing, particularly as Permian takeaway has become more of a focus for the market. Across our key operating areas in the DJ Basin, the Eagle Ford and the Delaware, we have access to multiple crude outlets. For 2018, the majority of our crude is priced at Cushing, mainly from our DJ Basin production. Our Permian crude is primarily sold in-basin to customers with firm takeaway capacity.","In addition, we've opportunistically locked in near-term Midland basis hedges, resulting in less than 20% of our total 2018 U.S. onshore oil subject to Midland pricing. As our Delaware oil production grows over time, more and more of our volumes will be priced along the Gulf Coast, as we've shown on slide 6. We're currently finalizing agreements for long-term firm transportation from the Permian via the EPIC crude pipeline, which is expected to be online in the second half of 2019.","Along with providing flow assurance, these agreements will secure access to premium-priced markets with refining and export opportunities at an attractive transportation rate. In addition, our long-term arrangements for gas and NGLs in the Permian provide firm sales to parties with significant takeaway capacity. Ultimately, we feel secure both in our ability to get our volumes to market and to maximize value.","On the operations side for the Permian, we expanded our multi-well and multi-zone development with activity across our acreage position within the first quarter. Our team continues to build upon the execution momentum from 2017. In the first quarter, we added one rig and one frac crew, bringing our operated totals to six rigs and three frac crews. Sales volumes for the first quarter totaled 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 18% from the fourth quarter of last year. Volumes will continue to grow each quarter as we bring online approximately 20 to 25 wells per quarter for the rest of the year.","We're positioned for a step change in capital efficiency in the second half of 2018, as the majority of midstream capital for the Permian is being spent in the first half of the year. We now have four central gathering facilities online, with a fifth expected on by the end of the second quarter. Combined, these facilities will increase oil gathering capacity to 90,000 barrels of oil per day, and they can be efficiently expanded to 110,000 barrels per day. All CGFs are connected through the Advantage Pipeline system operated by Noble Midstream, which delivers our crude volumes to Crane with further access to Midland.","One area I'm particularly excited about is the expansion of our produced water management program. Our teams are establishing a water pipeline network across our acreage position that will enable both produced and freshwater transport via pipe throughout the field. The ability to transport recycled water across our contiguous acreage position provides a significant competitive advantage for Noble. Longer term, our strategy to recycle produced water reduces truck traffic, reduces the need for disposal and freshwater use, and reduces operating expenses. And by the end of the year, I'd expect over 30% of the water used in our fracs to be recycled produced water.","On slide 8, we provide longer dated well performance for our seven-well Calamity Jane pad brought online right at the end of last year. We continue to be encouraged by the results, particularly for the Third Bone Spring and Wolfcamp A Upper zones. Our average 90-day production rates from these wells are approximately 80% of the 30-day IP, showing flatter declines than expected.","Within the first quarter, we continued to deliver strong well results. 9 of the 11 Wolfcamp A wells brought online averaged between 1,000 and 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the first 30 days. These included some of our first multi-well pads in the legacy Clayton Williams acreage position. We're still in the early days developing this portion of our acreage, but are certainly encouraged by the results and the value potential we've seen so far.","Turning to the DJ Basin, we had a strong start to the year with operating cash flow exceeding capital expenditures by over $100 million in the first quarter. We operated one rig and two frac crews within the quarter, and we've recently added a second rig and a third frac crew. Our sales volumes of 111,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day were in line with our expectations, approximately flat from the fourth quarter pro forma for divestitures.","We expect volumes to be down slightly in the second quarter from fewer wells online, as well as planned third-party processing plant turnaround. In the second half of 2018, we will drive volume growth as we bring online the first wells in Mustang and see processing expansions in the basin. In Wells Ranch, we strategically planned our activity around optimizing throughput to the existing facilities, where we benefit from the cash flows both at the Noble Midstream and Noble Energy levels.","On slide 11, we've highlighted the Kona Wells we brought online in Wells Ranch in the first quarter. These seven wells included some of the highest proppant concentrations we've used to-date in the DJ Basin, averaging over 3,000 pounds per foot across 10,500 foot laterals. After 65 days, the wells are still inclining and are currently averaging over 1,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day gross at about 70% oil. More importantly, this test helps provide data as we continuously evaluate the optimal design for maximizing capital efficiency.","We're currently completing our first pads in Mustang located in the southern portion of the acreage and the lower GOR area of the IDP. Our first row development will include a variety of completion designs. The majority will include our standard 1,800 pounds per foot proppant design. But we're also going to test higher and lower concentrations. Ultimately, we're looking to confirm the lessons learned from Wells Ranch on the most capital-efficient design for full-field development.","Another important highlight for the quarter is we've now secured multiple outlets for natural gas processing for our Mustang production. With Noble Midstream progressing the infrastructure backbone and our operations teams busy with completions on the first pads, we're on track to deliver our planned growth in the second half of the year. And I'd expect, by the time of our second quarter call, we'll have our first wells online in this area.","In the Eagle Ford, sales volumes averaged 81,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and were impacted by approximately 3,000 barrels per day due to facility downtime. The first quarter activity focused primarily on completions for wells expected online in the second quarter in North Gates Ranch. As we've talked about previously, we'd expect Eagle Ford volumes to decline each quarter throughout 2018, before returning to growth in 2019, as we strategically maximize cash flow from this asset.","Moving to our Eastern Mediterranean assets, March marked the five-year anniversary of first production from Tamar. The field reached a total of 1.5 trillion cubic feet cumulative gross production over the past five years. This is certainly a significant milestone that was accomplished from strong demand for natural gas coupled with extremely reliable performance. I'm also very proud of our team for reaching a momentous safety milestone within the first quarter, exceeding more than 3 million man hours and more than one year without a recordable safety incident.","As outlined in February, we signed two export contracts with customers in Egypt, a firm contract of 350 million cubic feet per day for Leviathan and an interruptible contract of also 350 million cubic feet per day for Tamar. This natural gas is anticipated to help supply Egypt's industrial and power generation demand. We also recently signed a smaller contract to sell natural gas for Israel domestic consumption. This agreement provides new quantities of approximately 40 million cubic feet per day to an existing customer beginning in the second quarter of 2018 from Tamar. This contract then transfers to sales from Leviathan upon field start-up.","These agreements continue to demonstrate the strength of the regional demand for our natural gas and provide further clarity and confidence in our cash flow profile. In total, we now have over 900 million cubic feet per day of natural gas volumes under contract for Leviathan, and I anticipate continuing to add additional contracts to fill Leviathan's Phase 1 remaining capacity by the time of start-up late next year. Our teams remain on track with the development of Leviathan nearly 50% complete. The rig arrived in March and drilled the Leviathan-3 well to total depth in April with results right on expectations.","With the closure of the Gulf of Mexico sale, we've taken the opportunity to restructure our offshore business. We've combined our West Africa and Eastern Mediterranean assets under Keith Elliott's leadership as Senior Vice President of the Offshore. There are significant benefits through the combination of these teams, as they'll focus on gas monetization efforts with extensive opportunities for our discoveries in both West Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean.","As you saw in our press release this morning, we've updated our full-year 2018 guidance to reflect the implementation of the new accounting standard, as well as the timing of the closing of the Gulf of Mexico divestiture. We now expect full-year 2018 sales volumes to range between 350,000 and 360,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with full-year capital expenditures still expected in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion.","Sales volumes for the second quarter of 2018 are expected to range between 340,000 and 350,000 barrels per day. Total U.S. onshore production is expected to be flat to the first quarter, with oil volumes expected to be higher, driven by growth in the Delaware Basin, and gas volumes down due to declines in the Eagle Ford and third-party maintenance in the DJ.","Net Israel sales volumes are expected to be lower compared to the first quarter, reflecting the impact of the Tamar working interest divestiture. Lifting schedules in West Africa are resulting in an over-lifted position in the second quarter, which is expected to reverse in the third quarter. In Gulf of Mexico, sales volumes have been adjusted down approximately 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day due to the early closing of the Gulf of Mexico sale.","For the second quarter, Noble Energy expects organic capital expenditures between $750 million and $850 million, with the majority spent in the DJ Basin, the Delaware Basin and to progress the Leviathan development. Second half 2018 capital expenditures are expected to be lower than the first half, reflecting lower U.S. onshore infrastructure and Leviathan spend.","The year is playing out consistent with what we expected. Our profile delivers a significant second half volume and cash flow ramp, benefited by the onshore infrastructure we're building out in the first half of the year. With approximately 100 new wells coming online in the second half between the DJ and the Delaware basins, our U.S. onshore oil volumes will increase by roughly 10,000 barrels a day from 2Q to 3Q and again from 3Q to 4Q. And I'm confident in our team's ability to deliver our goals this year, which puts us well on the path to achieving the outcomes of our multi-year plan.","And with that, Lisa, let's open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate the time. I guess first, I like the added color on the oil marketing in the slide deck. I guess in that context, what are the key differentiators from your perspective on the Advantage Pipeline? And as you think about flow assurance of all your volumes coming out of the basin before EPIC, what kind of details can you provide us on firm sales contracts that you have in place with the marketers that you referenced in that slide? What sort of level of volumes and what timeframe would be helpful.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Michael, this is Gary. I think even before you get to Advantage, there's certainly benefits of having Noble Midstream working with us in the field gathering crude and delivering to the CGFs and then delivering from the CGFs to Advantage. So, that allows us to pipe oil directly from the wells all the way through Advantage to Crane with access into Midland. I think that certainly provides an advantage as far as flow assurance. It's a lot easier than trying to truck everything around and a lot more certain on deliveries.","As far as the contracts that we've got in place, we're probably not going to get into the commercial details. But as we've noted on the slide, we do have some sales that are priced out of the Midland Basin currently, as well as some Midland\/Cushing hedges. That gives us a good amount of protection on Permian oil this year to the extent, as we mentioned, less than 20% of our total onshore oil is exposed to Midland basis hedges right now. So, I think that's a great plan for us, a good place to be.","As we look forward, our negotiations on the EPIC pipeline, finalizing those contracts is going to provide a lot more flow assurance and a lot better access into the premium-priced markets once EPIC starts up in the second half of 2019, allowing us to access the higher-priced markets along the Gulf Coast. So, that's the oil side. We feel really good. I think on the gas side, we haven't really had any issues. We've got firm contracts in place to sell our gas and NGLs at the tailgate of the plant to a partner that has plenty of takeaway capacity and is obviously going to be incented to move those volumes. So, I think we're in a good place there as well. I feel very good about where we're at actually in the Permian.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","That's helpful color. I appreciate it. I guess just to clarify, on the oil side, you said you, given commercial terms, don't want to necessarily provide disclosures on the oil side. I fully understand that. But should I understand it to be that there are firm agreements in place with those marketers between now and end of next year, let's say?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I would just say that we've got multiple agreements with parties that have firm takeaway capacity to sell volumes at a level that we think is appropriate to maintain the exposure we need.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Perfect. That's super helpful. And then, as you just think about your overall U.S. oil marketing strategy and as you think about, I guess, the relative risks of the Cushing market relative to Gulf Coast, is the emphasis big picture to get as much as you can to the Gulf over time? And what sort of flexibility do you have between now and the start-up of EPIC to maximize that goal?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think we certainly see the Gulf Coast and Corpus in particular as one of the best premium markets going forward, given the expected ramp of crude production out of the Permian and the access to the export markets that that affords you in Corpus. So, we're certainly planning to get a large portion of our volumes there. Our discussions with EPIC have provided us a good market for up to 75,000 \u2013 or the first 75,000 barrels a day coming off of our acreage. But certainly for anything above that, we've got flexibility to take it anywhere else that we think would be appropriate.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Great. I appreciate it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Gary, my first question is on the Delaware activity in the first quarter. There was quite a wide range of Wolfcamp A productivity, it seems, in those nine wells that you mentioned. I'm just wondering what's driving that. Is it lateral length? Is there something else going on there? And how does it play into how productivity evolves relative to what we should think about as a sort of go-forward type curve?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think it's a mix of things, Doug. There's certainly different lateral lengths. The rates we quoted were kind of gross from the laterals, and those are the Wolfcamp A wells that we completed. So, lateral length is certainly part of it. But if you look at the map on slide 8, it's also spread over the acreage position, pretty much across the entire acreage position we brought wells on. So, you've got a little bit of variation across the acreage, as we've talked about in the past.","I think for us, it's testing, continuing to test spacing in some areas, and so we're learning from that. But I think that range is a very nice range, and certainly, with the 78% oil that we're seeing from it, it's a great performance in the first quarter. I think as we go forward, we'll continue to refine our completion techniques and you'll see the same level of further improvement in the Delaware as we've shown in the DJ over the years, but this is a great start.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, if we adjusted for lateral length, is productivity moving above what your base plan assumes?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, if you adjust for lateral length, I mean again, all the lateral lengths are different. We didn't really provide the average or the individual well lengths. But I think when you look at it on a per 1,000 foot and you look at where we are in the field, I'd say we're right on track with what we expect for the plan.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, appreciate that. I realize there was a lot of moving parts in the basin as it relates to takeaway, and obviously, Michael already hit some of those points. But I wonder if we could take it just at a fairly high level and say, look, when all is said and done, what is your prognosis for Noble's sort of in-basin realizations? I know it's a tough question to answer. But when you take into account your line of sight on your productivity targets, line of sight on takeaway, but also layering in some of the export linked volumes that you're probably going to have, obviously, it's transitory, but on a go-forward basis, how do you see this evolving, let's say, relative to benchmarks?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think, Doug, what it gives us the opportunity \u2013 and I think it's laid out there pretty well on that slide 6 \u2013 when you look out in time after you get EPIC online and the ability to get down to Corpus, I think Gary highlighted we see that as a premium market, if you will. And so, it gives us an opportunity to be exposed to premium pricing over that period of time and especially as we go forward beyond 2020.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","I mean I think, Doug, if you look historically, basis differentials in the Permian are pretty small. There's certainly been times in the past when takeaway capacity has gotten tight and they've expanded, and if all of the operators do everything they say they're going to do over the next year or so, there's potential for that to happen again. That's why we've actually layered in some Midland\/Cushing basis hedges to help protect us from that. But I think that's going to be a temporary solution. And for us, the longer term view is to make sure that we're exposed to diversified markets and certainly to those that we expect to have premium pricing, which again is why we're trying to get to Corpus.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I know that's not an easy question to answer, but I appreciate the color, guys. Thank you.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bob Morris with Citi.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Gary, on the Calamity Jane, you mentioned last quarter that you'd not seen any communication between wells. I assume that's still the case. And some of your competitors have talked about optimizing the NPV per section is 30% degradation on child versus parent wells. So, as you move forward here, how are you thinking about your spacing tests, maximizing that NPV and your overall recoveries in the Delaware Basin as you look at the spacing and communication you've seen so far here?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Bob, good question. I think on the Calamity Jane, still very pleased with the results. We updated the IP-90 averages, as we talked about in the prepared comments and as we show on slide 8. We continue to be very happy with those results, given it was our first spacing test of both lateral and vertical spacing and not really seeing any impacts from interference there.","I think to your broader question on spacing across a section, I mean once you get more than a handful of wells, you've always got the potential for some interference, some drainage. The key for us, whether it's been in the DJ all these years or in the Delaware going forward, is to maximize the value per section. And we've got our spacing assumptions out there. Those have not changed at all from any of the results that we've seen to-date. And we'll continue to refine our completion designs going forward just like we still are in the DJ even. But our intent is to maximize value per section, and I feel good with the assumptions that we've laid out and where we're still headed.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. We'll look forward to that. And speaking to the DJ, you did mention that three of the wells at the Kona were at the highest proppant load that you've done so far and at 3,600 pounds per foot. Can you comment on the results of those and does that indicate that that may be then the design going forward? Or how much improvement do you see on those over the traditional 2,800 pound per foot or 1,800 pound per foot wells as far as that higher proppant load perhaps being the design going forward here?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Bob, that's another good question. The reality is I can't tell you how good those wells are yet, because they're still inclining after 65 days. So, they're obviously very productive wells. We've brought on seven that range from almost 3,000 to closer to 4,000 pounds per foot, and those seven wells are producing over 9,000 barrels equivalent right now and still inclining after 65 days and it's 70% oil. So, very happy with them. Is that going to be a design going forward? I don't know yet. With them still declining, again, we don't know how good they are.","For the Mustang, as we've said, our initial plans are to maintain our 1,800 pound per foot design. That's a design that we've developed over several years of testing in the DJ Basin and we believe is probably the optimum design. But in certain areas, we'll continue to test both higher and lower concentrations. And again, it's all targeted to how can we create the most value per section and the highest capital efficiency in our operations. So, stay tuned. Next quarter, assuming they're on decline after another 90 days, we'll see. But next quarter, we can talk a little bit more about it.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right, we'll stay tuned. Thanks, Gary.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Dave, to you and your team there.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Hey, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","I wanted to ask a question about the Eastern Med marketing, and I guess one specifically about this most recent $40 million deal, but also to ask for your comments \u2013 or 40 million a day deal.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Right.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","But also to ask for comments generally. That 40 million a day deal, is that a model for something that we could think is kind of likely going forward on your remaining capacity at Leviathan? It strikes me that perhaps thinking of different ownership groups, it might be tricky to transfer those sorts of volumes. And then, any other comments you can add about what you're seeing on the marketing front there for the remaining 300 million or so you have in your Leviathan capacity?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Charles. I think on the first point, what it really references is the fact that there's additional customers that want gas as soon as we can get it to them. And it takes advantage of the fact that we still have a little bit of capacity left on Tamar that we can move at periods of time to some folks. But longer term, they're looking to get into the queue on Leviathan. And so, we'll see some customers of various sizes that will still come into the mix here as we move forward.","The larger piece, as you reference on the larger volumes, is still the coal conversion in Israel. We still see that as a very large market. We've talked in terms before of around 400 million a day or more market. So, I think we'll see that still continue to come in play over the next year or two. Especially by the time Leviathan comes online, we'll have a lot more clarity on that. And I think the regional markets, we've always talked about the regional markets are the ones we've already tapped into or going to continue to expand. So, I think on all fronts, it's just a great story going forward and a fantastic opportunity for us.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, Dave. And then, Gary, if I could go back and perhaps dovetail off those questions on your DJ completions, I remember \u2013 I feel like I was asking this question a year ago with your new proppant concentrations, what's \u2013 what was acceleration, what was incremental EUR. And I wondered if you could talk about how that question has played out with past generations of your completion design with up proppant concentrations, and perhaps also talk about with these Kona Wells, maybe you're \u2013 whether you're flowing the back differently with a more choke back initially given the proppant loading.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Charles, I'll take the second part of that first. Certainly, given the amount of fluid that we've pumped in these things with the proppant concentrations that we've pumped at, as well as the fact that they're over 10,000 foot laterals on average, we're flowing them back fairly slow, which again is part of the reason they're inclining, but obviously very good oil rates already. I think as far as your question around incremental EUR and acceleration and \u2013 that's always an interesting question and it's something that we try and get to every time we look at different completion techniques.","For me, at the end of the day, whether it's incremental or acceleration, it still comes back to value and how can we create the most value from a section. So, obviously, we'd like to get our recovery factors as high as we possibly can, get every bit of oil out of these sections that we can, but it comes back to value at the end of the day. And if we can get more value by pumping 1,800 pounds in a certain well spacing versus a higher concentration in fewer wells, then that's what we're going to do. If the inverse is true, we'll do that. But it really comes down to value at the end of the day.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","And I guess, Gary, just to push on that a little bit more, if I could just...","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Sure.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","So, you're passive to where you are today, achieving or optimizing that value. Has it been more by adding EUR or has it been more by accelerating what you think is there?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think it's going to be a little bit different depending on where you are potentially and which zone we're talking about. Remember, we've got multiple Niobrara zones, we've got Codell zones. So, it's not as easy as one uniform answer across the field. I think obviously, if you're 8 wells per section, 10 wells per section, you're going to recover a lot more resource than you would if you were only at 4 wells per section even probably at higher proppant concentration. So, we continue to work the science. You'll recall we've done a lot of work over the years gathering real-time data from downhole as we're flowing back wells. We're continuing to do that. These larger concentration jobs that we've recently pumped is a continuation of those efforts, and as we learn more, we'll share it.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot, Gary.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning. I wanted to first ask you about the sequential improvement in the gas price in Israel and just if you could add a little bit of color around that and perhaps what you're seeing as you're marketing volumes for Leviathan in terms of the gas price.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, I think, Arun, when you look at the gas price in Israel, most of those contracts have some adjustment factor. Some of them are tied to oil price, and then others, like the large IZ contract is CPI indexed. So, you're seeing some of that impact from the oil price increase flow through on some of those contracts.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just, Dave, for the 40 million a day that you talked about, could you give us a sense of where kind of the leading edge pricing is for new contracts?","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. We're not going to get into specific contract details, especially on one that we haven't communicated or put out any release on. But I'd say when you look at contracts, we've still been talking in general in that $5 to $6 range. I think it's still the right range for everybody to be thinking about. And they all are \u2013 or at least most of the new ones usually have some type of tie to an oil price relationship.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, great. Dave, you teased us with some comments on exploration. I was wondering if you could give us maybe a little bit of color on how you're thinking about exploration, as well if you could talk about some of your plans for the gas resources in EG and Cameroon.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","No, that's great. I think on the latter portion, we're continuing to make great progress on the gas resources in West Africa, as you mentioned. I still believe there'll be a monetization opportunity for those, a very low-cost, high-value monetization opportunity for those. And hopefully, that's something that we can give a lot more color on over this coming year.","I think when you talk about exploration in general, I'm excited about what we're seeing as far as not only the progression and maturation of the opportunities that we're in, some very big material opportunities that we're in, but also things that I see that have a high likelihood of being added to the portfolio this year, both onshore U.S. and offshore. It's just having those capabilities, I think, are going to pay extremely high long-term benefits. Maintaining those capabilities and proficiency in that arena is going to benefit us for years.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Fair enough. Thanks a lot, Dave.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gail Nicholson with KLR Group.","Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC","Good morning. I'm just looking at those Kona Wells at Wells Ranch, it's exceptionally high oil cut. Can you provide any color? Was that location? Was that driven by the higher proppant loading tested? Or what's kind of driving that 70% oil cut?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Gail, that's a good question. It is a little bit higher than what our typical Wells Ranch oil cut is. Again, it's been only a couple of months and the wells are still inclining. So, we need to see, once they level off, where they end up at, but a bit higher than our average. I can't say that we were surprised by that, but it is a very nice oil cut for us.","Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC","And then, looking at the Calamity Jane pad, you mentioned in your commentary that it was exhibiting a shallow decline than you guys had initially anticipated. Do you think that is being driven by the standpoint of co-developing the zones together, completing them at one-time and kind of what's your \u2013 how do you guys look at that from a standpoint of doing the Third Bone Spring and the Lower and Upper Wolfcamp together?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. That's certainly a possibility. I think we've seen a number of places over the years where, as you're fracking a number of wells in one place, they actually benefit each other as well. So, our type curves clearly have been based on a lot of single well pad work that we've done over the years. I don't want to get too far in front of anything here, because the Calamity Jane area is some of the best acreage we've got. So, you would expect it to probably perform \u2013 outperform a type curve that's based on kind of statistics across the entire acreage position. But I think it's something we'll continue to watch as we get more data on these and see if being able to complete wells simultaneously like this does benefit their ultimate long-term recovery.","Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Kistler with Simmons Piper Jaffray.","David Kistler - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Good morning, guys.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Dave.","David Kistler - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Hey, just following up a little bit more on the DJ high proppant wells, with the controlled flow back but higher pressures, as we look at infrastructure expansion being complete and things we've seen in prior years, given the dynamics of the wells that you're seeing right now, are you starting to lean towards maybe a little bit higher uplift in second half production or will these just be pressure displacement versus existing line pressure issues?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Well, that's a good question. I think for now, until additional processing capacity starts up, they're providing a nice bump to oil. But you're not going to see that much more gas going through the system until additional processing comes on. I think longer term, once that processing starts to come on in the second half of the year, we'll just have to see how it reacts. We've certainly built in some impact from that into our forward plans, just like we've seen in past years when new plants have come on, we've tried to model that as best we can, but we'll see where we go.","I think the other thing for the DJ, and we talked a little bit about it on the slide and the prepared comments, is for the Mustang area, we have multiple outlets. And so, as we start to bring on pads there in the second half of the year and really ramp up that program, we will be much less constrained than we have been in the past with our current main provider. And so, we've modeled that as well, and that's what allows us to provide such a nice growth in the second half of the year in the DJ.","David Kistler - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Great. Appreciate that color. And then, maybe switching over to the Delaware a little bit, where you talk a touch more about the water recycling efforts, can you refresh us in terms of one, what kind of relative cost savings you think that that provides as you do more and more water recycling? And you gave us an 2018 target of about 30% utilization of recycled water. As you get past 2018, is there an ultimate target? Can we kind of flesh out a little bit about what we think we're going to be looking at from a water perspective as you continue to build out the facilities there?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, that's a good question. I think the 30% is our target for year-end, not for average for 2018, just to be clear. But we're certainly ramping up the volumes that we're using there. As far as the cost comparison, to be honest, Dave, it's not a huge difference on the front-end for capital, but where we see it show up longer term is in operating costs, being able to use recycled produced water for our fracs versus having to dispose of it is certainly a nice cost benefit in the long-term.","Plus, the reality is we just think it's the right thing to do. And given our acreage position, given how contiguous it is, given the infrastructure that we have in place, our ability to pipe both produced and fresh water around, recycled water around, we've certainly got a huge advantage to being able to do that and to reuse the produced water that we generate over time. Over time, what's the target, I don't know. We're continuing to build out the system, 30% at year-end. It'll grow from that. I'd love to get to close to 100% over time, but we'll just have to see if that's realistic.","David Kistler - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Okay. Appreciate the added color on that. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with NatAlliance Securities.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Hey, guys. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about kind of thoughts around dividend growth. Obviously, you guys bumped that recently. Clearly, you're emphasizing the share buyback. But as we continue to see robust commodity prices, was this something that's going to kind of be reviewed annually on the dividend side? Or if prices kind of continue to stay high in the second half, could we see another increase? Maybe just talk high level about your thoughts on the dividend.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Leo, no problem. I think, yeah, the dividend increase was a reflection of the outlook and the environment with increased cash flow, what we were seeing from the commodity price upturn and in preparation for our growth as a company from what we've laid out. We'll continue to review that quarterly. What we've done is consistent and what we've said is consistent with the anticipation that dividend will increase as cash flow increases, whether it's from commodity price stability and longer term stability, or more likely, the underlying growth of the business and cash flow growth of the business that we've laid out. So, I think this was an initial step in that process, and we'll just play it out as it goes here.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess I think you guys had mentioned that you have brought on a couple other wells outside the Wolfcamp A in the Permian. I guess there was a Third Bone Spring well and a Wolfcamp C well. Can you give us any color around the performance on those wells?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Leo, it's Gary. Yeah, we had one of each. We had a Third Bone Spring well on our Trigger Pad, which is kind of in the northwest part of our acreage. And then, we had a Wolfcamp C well on a pad that's on the west end of the acreage called the Black Cobra. I'd say we're very encouraged by both of those. The Wolfcamp C well is performing right in line with expectations, given other history that we've got out there in the Wolfcamp C. So, continue to be excited about that as far as a zone of future development.","Third Bone Spring is an area that we hadn't really tested yet. Given we didn't have any data in the area, I think I'm excited about what we've seen so far. We'll continue to watch the well and see if that has the potential to greatly expand the area that we've given really any thought of giving any value to in the Third Bone Spring. Wolfcamp C, similar, as we've talked about in the past, we've never really attributed a lot of value to those zones. So, continue to be encouraged. It's only one well each. Look forward to continuing to bring some on over time. But as we've talked about, most of our program for the next year or so is going to continue to be Wolfcamp A.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Okay, that's helpful. And have you guys seen anything on the inflation side, whether or not oil service costs are creeping higher on you guys, whether that's impacting you, particularly in the Permian?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I mean we've certainly seen some. We've talked in the past. We expect probably 10% to 15% this year. We think we can offset a large part of that through efficiencies. That thinking really hasn't changed, Leo. I mean I think we're kind of in that 10%, maybe a little more than 10% today. Most of that's focused on the completion side, the stimulation side, but we've got a number of things underway that will help offset that. We've talked about local sand in the Permian being one of them.","The other thing that, as we've moved from single well pads to multi-well pads is really starting to show up in the efficiencies, is just the impact that it has on cycle time on completions. So, we noted on one of the slides that our completion cycle time in the Permian has dropped 26% as a result of going to multi-pads. And so, not only are you getting more efficient, you're increasing capital efficiency, spending less dollars to complete the same number of wells, but you're getting them on a lot quicker and improving cash flow and value from that standpoint, too. All part of the plan.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jamaal Darter with PPH & Company (55:38).","Unknown Speaker","Good morning, everyone.","David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.","Hey, Jamaal.","Unknown Speaker","Just looking at that EPIC pipeline disclosure there and the pressure that the Midland diffs are under, just wondering the appetite to perhaps in 2019 defer completions towards that back half of the year timeframe and kind of ramp in line with EPIC?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Jamaal. I meant that's a interesting question. It's not something that we've really planned to do. I think again, we look at our marketing. We've been studying this for quite some time. We try and balance our exposure to different markets and protect volumes and pricing where we can, and I'd say that our plan that we laid out back on February 20, the next several years took all that into account. And so there's no need for us to adjust activity based on that.","Unknown Speaker","Okay, fair enough. And just kind of wanted to get more detail on the gas side. Could you walk through kind of how that, the firm processing would work given tightness in the basin maybe over the next year or so?","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I'm not going to get into the commercial details of the contracts, but I will say we have firm reserve capacity at the plants to process the gas, and we do sell it at the tailgate to the plants. And so, it's up to that plant owner to move it beyond that point, and they've certainly got the takeaway capacity to do that. So, not concerned about that at all. We are obviously exposed to Waha basis on that gas. But the reality is with our oil cut in the Permian and our volumes out of the Permian this year, our entire gas revenue projected to come out of the Permian this year is only about 1% of the total company revenue. So, it's really not significant at all.","Unknown Speaker","All right, thanks a lot.","Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.","The key is making sure we could move it, and we've got that.","Unknown Speaker","All right, thanks a lot.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brad Whitmarsh for closing remarks.","Brad Whitmarsh - Noble Energy, Inc.","Thanks. Appreciate everybody joining us. Megan, Lauren and I are around for questions, should you have any follow-up this afternoon. Thanks.","Operator","And that concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation."]}}
