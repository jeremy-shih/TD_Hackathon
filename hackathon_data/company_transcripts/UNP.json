At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn to introduce your host Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Koraleski, you may now begin.","John Koraleski","Thanks, Robin, good morning everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Executive Vice President of marketing and sales, Lance Fritz, President and Chief Operating Officer and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning we\u2019re pleased to report that Union Pacific achieved first quarter earnings of $2.38 per share, an increase of 17% compared to the first quarter of 2013 and another all-time quarter record. Total volumes were up 5% and the increase was broad-based.","We saw growth in five of our six business groups with particular strength in agricultural shipments, industrial products and coal.","The volume growth combined with solid core pricing and a continued focus on safety service and efficiency drove a 2 point improvement in our operating ratio to a record 67.1% for the quarter. As you all know this winter was one for the record but especially in the upper Midwest. So we're proud of the efforts of the men and women of the Union Pacific who worked tirelessly to serve our customers despite these weather challenges and helped us to achieve a solid start to the year. So with that let's get into it. I'll turn it over to Eric.","Eric Butler","","Thanks Jack, and good morning. In the first quarter volume was up 5% compared to 2013 as solid demand made up for the challenging weather conditions in much of the country. We had strong grains in agricultural products, industrial products and coal. We also saw volume growth in the automotive and in chemicals we were able to offset declines in crude oil with gains in other commodities to end up even with last year\u2019s strong first quarter results.","Corporate improved 2% which was partially offset by unfavourable mix and lower fuel prices to produce a 1% improvement in average revenue per car add in our volume growth and we increased freight revenue by 6% to a first quarter record of $5.3 billion. Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups.","At products volume grew 13%, which combined with a 3% improvement in average revenue per car throws revenue growth up 16%. We continue to see strong demand for grain with carloadings up 39% driven by last year's strong harvest. The biggest gains were in grain exports to China and Mexico and wheat exports to the Gulf. And lower corn prices drove increased demand for domestic feed grains. Grain product volume was up 5%, driven by the 11% increase in ethanol shipments as refineries replenish low ethanol inventories.","Shipment to BBG's grew 38%, driven by strong export demand primarily from China. Food and repurchase shipments were down 3% for the quarter as the winter weather impact the cycle times for equipment serving the produce and frozen food markets. Partially offsetting those declines were gains in import beer where volume grew 3%.","Automotive volume grew 2%, though average revenue per car was down 2% resulting in flat revenue for the quarter. I'll talk more about the average revenue per car decline in a moment. First, finished vehicle shipments declined 3% as winter weather impacted shipments and we had a couple of plants with unscheduled shutdowns. While automotive production was strong in the quarter, the severe winter weather contributed to year-over-year sales declines in January and February. Sales rebounded strongly in March, up 5.6% thanks to improved weather and dealer incentives. We expect that our finished vehicle shipments to rebound as the rail network recovers from the challenging weather.","From the parts side volume increased 9% with strong production and over-the-road conversions driving gains. The decrease I mentioned earlier in average revenue per car reflects a change in the way we handle per diem revenue on Intermodal containers used by our customers for auto parts. As a result in 2014 the per diem revenue is included in other revenues instead of automotive commodity revenue.","Chemicals volume was flat for the quarter with revenue up 2% on a 3% increase on average revenue per car. Industrial chemicals volume was up 7%, driven by strength in end user market such as shale related drilling, paper products and the icing materials. Fertilizer shipments were up 7% for the quarter on strong export potash demands.","Crude oil volume declined 18% compared to the first quarter of last year with price spreads negatively impacting volume. Partially offsetting the decline was an increase in our prior shipments to the Gulf Coast.","Turning now to coal, revenue increased 3% in the first quarter on a 7% increase in volume. The average revenue per car declined 4% driven by mix and lower fuel prices. Southern Powder River basin tonnage was up 2% as demand from the cold winter and higher natural gas prices offset our previously reported contract loss.","Colorado, Utah coal tonnage was up 13%, and benefitting from the increased domestic demand as well as gains in West Coast exports. We continue to see strength from other coal producing regions where tonnage was up 25% for the quarter.","Now in industrial products business, a 9% increase in volume and a 1% improves in average revenue per car produced revenue growth of 10%.","Non-metallic minerals volume was up 18% for the quarter. We continue to see strong demand for frac sand and shale related drilling which was up 22% over last year. Aggregate and cement demand were strong particularly in Texas and California, driving construction shipments up 10% for the first quarter. And our government and waste shipments were up 23%, driven by a waste customer adding short haul shipments in January and February. Additionally the winter weather increased demand for salt, while shipments were up 28% compared to the first quarter last year.","Intermodal revenue was up 4% in the first quarter, driven by 3% volume gain and a 1% improvement in average revenue per unit. Domestic Intermodal volume was up 8% in the quarter, driven by strength from our traditional IMC customers, new motor carrier customers and demand for new premium service offerings.","Headwinds from the severe winter weather were offset by business development and highway conversions. Our international Intermodal volumes declined 1% against the strong comparison from the first quarter of 2013. The winter weather impacted consumer demand and imports to the West Coast ports were down nearly 3% for the first two months of the year.","Now take a look at how we see out business shaping up for the rest of 2014. Our current outlook is for the economy to strengthen modestly this year. Last year's strong crops should provide opportunity for ag products in the second quarter with anticipated strength in both domestic and export grain markets. 2014 crop yields will be dependent on the weather.","In food and refrigerator, we expect growth in import beer, but the draught in California could create a headwind for tomato paste and canned goods.","Automotive market fundamentals remain strong with demands for new vehicles, easy access to financing, low interest rates and low fuel prices, all expected to drive increased sales. We should see finished vehicle volume rebound in the second quarter as continue to recover from the winter weather.","Most of our chemicals markets should remain solid throughout 2014. Crude by rail will continue to be impacted by spreads, a growing gulf crude supply and increased pipeline capacity. Lower inventories will continue to be a driver for our coal business in the second quarter. Weather conditions in summer will influence how things shape up for the full year.","Industrial products should continue to benefit from shale related activity with increased drilling, supporting growth in frac sand and pipe shipments. Housing starts were off to a slow start in 2014, but they are still projected to exceed 1 million units which we anticipate will drive demand for lumber shipments and we think the strength in construction products will continue.","Highway conversions and new product offerings should continue to drive growth in domestic Intermodal. International Intermodal should benefit from a continued improving economy and strengthening housing market. For the full year our strong value preposition and diverse franchise will again support business development efforts across our broad portfolio business.","Assuming the economy cooperates, we expect to deliver profitable revenue growth yet again in 2014, driven by continued volume growth and corporation's gains. With that I'll turn in over to Lance.","Lance Fritz","Thanks, Eric, and good morning. I'll start with our safety performance which is the foundation of our operations.","The first quarter of 2014 reportable injury rate improved 3% versus 2013. Progress achieved through our comprehensive safety strategy, the number of severe injuries during the quarter declined to a record low reflecting our work to reduce the risk of critical incidents, our team's commitment to the Courage to Care and the maturation of our total safety culture.","Moving to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our first quarter reportable rate finished up 7% versus the quarterly record set in 2013. However the absolute number of incidents, including those that do not meet the regulatory reportable threshold decreased to a record lows in each of the first three months of this year.","Looking forward we expect continued improvement from investments that harden our infrastructure, expand advanced defect detection technology and enhance our ability to find and address risks.","In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improvement slightly versus 2013. Driver behaviour continues to be a critical element. To make continued progress we're focussed on improving or closing high risk crossings and reinforcing public awareness.","Severe winter weather conditions were a headwind to our safety performance during the quarter, most notably where our employees faced the brunt of below zero temperatures and record snowfall. Even so the team did a tremendous job addressing the risks.","In addition to impacting safety, the most severe winter weather we've faced in quite a few years materially impacted our first quarter network performance. The impact was evident in the upper Midwest and at interchange points with other carriers, particularly in Chicago. Extremely cold temperatures and significant snowfall disrupted operations by limiting train size, curtailing switching activity, reducing the mobility to mobilize crews to crew load, change locations, elongating equipment cycles and reducing fuel efficiency. Our dedicated employees did a great job battling difficult conditions while maintaining open channels of communication with customers and our interchange partners as we managed through the challenge.","We responded by leveraging the unique value of Union Pacific. We adjusted transportation plans to use alternative switching yards and gateways. We realigned resources to where they were needed most and employed the use of our surge capacity.","This included increasing our active locomotive fleet by about 600 units since last fall and increasing our active TE&Y workforce by roughly 550 since January. While we mitigated a fair amount of winter\u2019s impact, our service performance fell short of our expectations and we are working hard to achieve a rapid and full recovery. And while that recovery is now underway, most of our first quarter operating performance metrics reflect the winter's impact. Velocity declined 7% as adverse conditions generated an 80% increase in the number of days with major service interruptions. These interruptions temporarily reduced operating capacity during the quarter, particularly in the northern region. The interruptions in subsequent limits on network capacity also drove a decline in our service delivery index, a measure which gauges how well we are meeting overall customer commitments.","On a brighter note we were able to maintain local service within a decent range, registering a 93.1% industry spot and pool. This metric which measures the delivering or pulling of a car to or from a customer also reflects the tighter service commitments we introduced this year.","In addition to surge resources, infrastructure investments have also improved our ability to recover after incidents, reducing their impact on the network. For 2014, we plan to invest around $3.9 billion which is up about $300 million from our 2013 spend. We're purchasing 200 locomotives this year compared to a 100 last year, impart due to future volume growth assumptions as well as our tier 4 emission strategy. We continue to invest in capacity across our network, including new capacity in the upper Midwest and in the South, that support expected growth.","And speaking of unit volume growth, for the first time in several years we saw solid and relatively balanced regional volume growth. While severe weather impacted our ability to fully leverage that volume, we were still able to realize meaningful productivity gains. For example the increase in regional TE&Y employees was less than our unit growth, despite the surge of crews we deployed in the North. Freight cart dwell was up 12% for the quarter, driven by a 36% weather related increase in the Northern region.","On a more positive note, we held locomotive productivity flat in the face of the headwinds. Our longer term trend of improving locomotive reliability coupled with effective utilization plans should register continued gains going forward.","Overall, we generated reasonable productivity improvement as our men and women applied their expertise to improve safety, service and efficiency using the UP way. Our primary focus was serving our customers and keeping our employees safe during difficult operating conditions. The net result was a 2 percentage point improvement in operating ratio, something our team is very proud of achieving in a very difficult quarter.","In summary, our full year operating outlook for 2014 remains positive. We are confident we are on a path for restoring operations back to normal. We're focussed on reducing variability in the network to drive service improvements and we've made progress during the past few weeks. We will continue to work closely with our interchange partners as our recovery and that of the entire rail industry is conditioned upon interchanged fluidity. And as performance improves and as demand dictates, we'll adjust our resource levels accordingly, including moving locomotives back into storage.","We expect to generate record safety results on our way to an incident free environment as network performance improves and we utilize resources more efficiently, our ability to leverage unit growth that generates solid productivity will improve and we will continue to make smart capital investments that generate attractive returns by increasing capacity and high volume quarters while also supporting our safety, service and productivity initiatives.","As a result we'll provide customers with a value preposition that supports growth with high levels of service. All combined it translates into increased returns for our shareholders.","With that I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert Knight","Thanks, Lance, and good morning. Let's start with the recap of our first quarter results. Operating revenue grew 7% to an all time record of more than $5.6 billion, driven by strong volume growth and solid core pricing. Operating expense totalled nearly $3.8 billion, increasing 3% over last year. Expenses include about $35 million or roughly $0.05 per share of cost associated with the severe weather conditions in the quarter. Operating income grew 14% to more than $1.8 billion, hitting a best ever mark for the first quarter.","Below the line other income totalled $38 million, down 5% from 2013. Interest expense of $ 133 million was up 4% compared to the previous year primarily driven by new debt issuances at the beginning to 2014. Income tax expense increased to $671 million, driven primarily by higher pre-tax earnings. Net income grew 14% versus 2013. While the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce a best ever first quarter earnings of $2.38 per share, up 17% versus 2013.","Turning to our top line, freight revenue grew 6% to our first quarter record of just under $5.3 billion, driven primarily by 5% volume growth. Lower fuel prices and business mix each drove about a half point decline in our average revenue per car.","Both in our grain and frac sands volumes were positive mix drivers, but were more than offset by negative mix in automotive and coal. Eric just pointed out the increases in lower ARC auto parts versus the decrease in finished vehicle volumes which accounts for the negative mix in automotive.","As per coal, we did see the benefit of higher ARC volumes including our prior year re-price legacy business, however this was more than offset by increases in lower ARC, shorter haul movements. Increased Intermodal and waste shipments also contributed to the negative mix. Core pricing gains totalled slightly over 2%, continuing our pricing strategy of outpacing inflation.","Slide 21 provides more detail on our core pricing trends in 2014. As you recall 2014 is a legacy light year. So we will not see the point and a half of legacy benefits which we saw in 2013. We're also seeing the impact of lower inflation on that portion of our business that is tied to inflation escalators primarily All-LF. The type table at the bottom of the slide takes a closer look at the quarterly All-LF escalator. As you can see it rebounded only slightly from negative territory in the fourth quarter last year.","While pricing is never easy, we continue to see solid core pricing gains above inflation on the business that we can touch in the marketplace today. Keep in mind also that the positive mix impact of new business or business returning to Union Pacific franchise is reflected in our margin gains but is not added to our core price calculation. We continue to be as focused as ever on pricing to market at rates that earn a fair and re-investible return.","Moving on to the expense side, Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense which increased 3% compared to 2013. Higher volumes, inflation and weather were the primary drivers, offset by productivity realized by leveraging the volume growth. Total TE&Y increased slightly, but not at the same rate as our volume growth. However this increase was more than offset by a decrease in employees associated with capital projects for the quarter when compared to 2013.","For the remainder of the year we would expect to see compensation and benefits expense to grow, but this will be largely dependent on how volume plays out. In addition we still expect to see labour inflation come in under 2% for the full year.","Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totalled $921 million, up 2% when compared to 2013, driven primarily by higher GTMs associated with increased volumes. Our fuel consumption rate was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis with the weather having come negative impact. Total fuel expense was tempered by a 3% year-over-year decline in average diesel fuel prices.","Moving on to the other expense categories, purchase service and materials expense increased 9% to $607 million, due to volume related subsidiary contract expenses, higher locomotive and freight car material costs and crude transportation and lodging costs.","Depreciation expense was $464 million, up 7% compared to 2013, consistent with our prior guidance. Looking ahead, we now expect depreciation to be up 7% to 8% this year.","Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rent expense totalled $312 million, which was flat when compared to 2013. Higher freight car rental expenses was offset by lower container lease costs. Other expenses came in at $226 million, down $11 million versus last year. Higher utility expense was more than offset by a year-over-year improvement in our freight and equipment damage costs as well as lower environmental and personal injury expenses. For 2014, we expect the other expense line to increase between 5% and 10% for the full year, excluding any unusual items.","Turning to our operating ratio performance. Pricing the business at re-investible levels and moving it safely and efficiently continues to drive results. We achieved a record first quarter operating ratio of 67.1% improving two points when compared to 2013. Longer term, we remain committed to achieving an operating ratio below 65% before 2017. We also remain committed to achieving strong cash generation and improving overall financial returns.","Turning now to our cash flow. In the first quarter, cash from operations increased to almost $1.8 billion. You'll recall that we expect the headwind of about $400 million this year due to tax payments associated with prior years' bonus depreciation. These payments will be reflected in subsequent quarters.","We invested about $900 million this quarter in cash capital investments and also returned $363 million in dividend payment to our shareholders. Also, in keeping our commitment to achieve a dividend pay-out range of 30% to 35%, we increased our declared dividend per share by 32% on a year-over-year basis.","Taking a look at the balance sheet, we issued $1 billion of new debt in January bringing our adjusted debt balance to $13.3 billion at quarter end. This takes our adjusted debt to cap ratio to 38.4% up from 37.6% at yearend '13. We remain committed to achieving an adjusted debt to cap ratio of approximately 40% and a debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1.5 by yearend. We feel our current cash outlook positions us well to execute our cash allocation strategy.","Our record profitability and strong cash generation enable us to continue to fund our strong capital program and grow shareholder returns. In addition, we continue to make opportunistic share repurchases which play an important role in our balanced approach to cash allocation.","As you may recall, our new repurchased authorization of up to 60 million shares over a four-year time period went into effect January 1st of this year. Under this new authority, we bought back 3.8 million shares totalling $683 million in the first quarter. This brings accumulative share repurchases since 2007 to $110 million shares. Combining dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned over $1 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter. It represents roughly 45% increase over 2013, clearly demonstrating our commitment to increasing shareholder value.","So that's a recap of the first quarter result.","As we look to the remainder of the year, its favourable economy and some help from the weather will combine with our commitment on core pricing above inflation and our on-going productivity initiatives to produced continued margin improvement and record financial results.","With that, I'll turn it back to Jack.","John Koraleski","Okay. Thanks, Rob.","As we put this winter behind us, we're off to a good start for the year. As always, there's going to be some challenges ahead. But we also see opportunity. In the weeks ahead, we'll be focused on restoring the fluidity of our network after the winter slowdown. We're absolutely committed to pursuing the excellent service our customers expect and deserve. It's a cornerstone of our on-going success.","Our value proposition to our customers depends on it. Strong service goes hand in hand with improvements in network in asset utilization that are so critical to our future. Another potential challenge for the entire industry is the uncertain regulatory environment, which is being played out in Washington D.C., Canada and Mexico. We're watching things closely on all fronts making sure that regulators truly understand the importance of a healthy growing rail industry.","We're also watching the weather and the economy very closely. There's still a lot of year ahead of us, so we'll have to see how the summer burn plays out for coal demand and how the 2014 crops will fair everything from planning through harvest. As far as the economy goes, a lot can change between now and the end of the year. But at this point, we're seeing some signs of gradual economic improvement. And we're encouraged by the opportunities it presents.","With the power and the potential of the Union Pacific franchise, we'll leverage these opportunities to drive record financial performance and shareholder returns this year and in the years' to come. So with that, let's get started and open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","Our first question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research","So I wanted to just first ask about the yields, particularly on the auto and coal side. So if I'm understanding this right, as finished vehicles start to grow again as whether it gets better, shall we start thinking about auto yields growing again? And then on the coal side, with yields down 4% year-over-year, they were just so strong in first quarter last year up 16%, was there anything unusual, like any liquidated damages last year that you didn't have this year that's driving that? Because I'm just not sure how to model coal yields going forward.","Robert Knight","Yes. Scott, let me talk about the autos first. As Eric mentioned in his comments, there was a process changed and affected some per diem treatment on some containers. It basically accounts for all of the decline in the autos' arc. On top of that then, as he also pointed out, the mid shift of finished vehicles and more auto parts also had an impact on arc. So we don\u2019t give guidance on what the mix is going to look like or what the arc is going to look like by commodity line, and we don't do it by the way as a company.","But directionally, yes, if we see growth in finished vehicles outpacing the growth in auto parts, you would expect that trend to move in that direction. We're not giving that specific guidance, but you're thinking about it right.","On the coal, our coal arc was down 4%, roughly half of that was driven by mix. I mean your traditional mix. If you might see, that's a great movement of shorter haul coal moves and less shipments of the higher. In some cases, repriced coal business. And the other half was made up of lower fuel prices drove lower average every car on the arc line. And year-over-year, you're exactly right, there was a small, as you recall we pointed out. It was roughly $15 million of liquidity. The damage is last year that did not repeat this year. That at this point, I don't see that our trend is continuing throughout the year. So that had a little bit of an impact on our coal arc line as well. And that piece was about 1.5, if you will, of the 1.5% of the 4% decline.","Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay. That's very helpful. And then I just wanted to take a shot at the long-term margin guidance. So if I look at historically at the first quarter OR and then the full year OR, the full year typically is about three to four points better than the first quarter, and you had weather in 1Q. I mean it feels like we're on a run rate this year around 64% for the OR. And that's just so much -- so different than the sub-65 in 2017. So I'm not sure that if the long-term guidance is just really still or is there something that you're telling us that we need to be thinking about or worried about the next three quarters that's going to dramatically change the trajectory margins.","John Koraleski","Hey, Scott, our guidance is below 65 before 2017, not in 2017. Rob, why don't you fill in the blanks on that?","Robert Knight","Yes. Scott, I mean we hope you're right. I mean there's a lot of things that have to play out. I mean we certainly hope for the economy cooperates fuel prices as you've heard us speak many times. It can have an impact directly on the margins and the operating ratio.","So as we've said all along on this financial improvement journey over the last decade, we're not looking at the sub-65% as an endpoint and we're not going to slowdown. We're going to get there safely and efficiently as we can. And if all the stars line, the economy cooperates and we move in direction that we hope everything happens, we get there as soon as we can. But our best look at this point in time is that it looks to us like it's sometime before 2017.","Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just a quick question on the volume pace, as you came out of the first quarter, things obviously ramping up. It seems like there was probably some pent up demand here that's carried into the second quarter. How do we think about sort of how long that last and maybe the pace of activity here? And how much is sort of still yet to be moved and wants to be moved and kind of when can the catch up do you think?","John Koraleski","Yes. I think you're exactly right, Chris. I think as we move towards the end of the quarter, we were catching up from some of the issues in the early quarter. But our volume outlook is still fairly decent for the year. So Eric, you want to \u2026","Eric Butler","Yes. Chris, as Jack said, clearly, there were some catch up, particularly when you think about the difficulties that the winter had on the automotive business. And then deep in coal utilities, there was a strong coal burn, and so there was some catch up there.","You can also think about our grain business and the grain harvest. There's a natural processing in the first quarter shipping the record corn harvest that we had in the fourth quarter. But like Jack said, I'm pretty optimistic about a slowly-strengthening economy for the balance of the year. Slowly strengthening economy across our book of business will have positive impacts. Plus, we continue to have a strong valued proposition. And so we're optimistic for the balance of the year.","Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citigroup","That's great. That's very helpful.","And on the coal side, when you think about the inventories of the utilities that you're serving relative to the length of haul differences that I think showed up here in the first quarter, how should we think about that? Is there any imbalance there we might suggest you have stronger volumes continuing to the shorter length of haul utilities? Any sort of color you could give there would be helpful.","Eric Butler","Yes, I would say this. Those kind of balance in and out. Inventories are quite low. As you probably know, there are about 21 days below what would be considered normal. So they're quite low. But there's no kind of imbalance between short and long haul that would have a mix change for the future.","Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. Great. Thanks very much for the time. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America","Great. Good morning. Great job working through the weather.","Just a follow up on the short haul freight that you've gained, it seems like a lot impacting the mix. Can you talk if there's any long-term impact on margins? And really, is this long-term business or is this because some competitors are having infrastructure issues as they fix that, some of that reverts back to a different network or is this more permanent business in nature?","John Koraleski","Yes. It really kind of depends on the individual markets, Ken. For instance, the short haul move that Eric referenced on the waste product is a customer of ours that just historically last year had moved for nine months, and this year really picked up a volume in the first. So that's kind of an on-going issue for us.","Rob, do you want to -- do you have any more with the \u2026","Rob Knight","Yes. Can I just say -- I mean your question is heading right on the reason why you heard me many, many times, say we're not going to get guide this fund on average revenue per car because mix is always a part of our business. And when you look as diverse as our franchise is, as diverse as all of our commodity groups are, mix is rather normal.","But as you also are questioning in terms of the margin, just because something has a short haul lower average revenue per car doesn't mean it has a lower margin. So we're not afraid of that at all. We're pricing and moving the business as efficiently as we can, driving our margins which in fact we've done. We did that in the first quarter even with this negative mix impact.","So mix will always be a part of our business, but we're focused on improving our margins regardless of the length of haul.","John Koraleski","As Rob said, if we can get our re-investability threshold met, we're happy to take the business.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America","That's great insight. Thanks.","Just a follow up on the locomotive side, and I guess demand side overall. You noted demand kind of creeping in a little bit on a gradual improvement. If we start seeing, I guess, a faster pace of improvement, what's your thoughts on your ability to handle it to take the capacity access locomotives, your infrastructure's ability to handle it? Maybe it's a Lance questions in terms of scalability of the infrastructure and available capacity.","John Koraleski","Absolutely. Lance?","Lance Fritz","Sure. So Ken, we feel pretty good about fluidly handing the volume that Eric is bringing on for the network. If you think about where we are right now, the first quarter was, what, 179,078 car loads. We've publicly said we think our network can handle 195,000 plus with a very good excellent service product. So we're looking forward to that volume.","Of course, it's dependent to some degree on exactly where it shows up. But you know, we've been putting capacity into the network in anticipation of that, and we feel pretty good about handling the volume.","John Koraleski","And our first quarter was pretty balanced, so we like that.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America","And similarity access to locomotives to handle that? Is that infrastructure still available?","John Koraleski","It is. If you think about how many locomotives we have left in surge right now. It's a little over 300. That's bearing in mind that we brought in what was at 600 locomotives since the fall with a large portion those not driven by volume, but instead driven by trying to overcome winter's impact. So we've got surgery resources that will be able to handle it.","Lance Fritz","So as we spin up volume and our operating stats improve, we'll actually be seeking some power out of the network and putting it back in storage.","John Koraleski","That's right.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America","Appreciate the time. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","William Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi there. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Rob, I wanted to ask you about pricing. When we see this inflation metrics start to rise a bit, is it logical to think that the core pricing headline starts to rise as well? Is it as simple as that or is there another element though that you have to keep in mind?","Robert Knight","I mean that part of business that is tied to the All-LF and there were timing differences. And as you've heard us comment many times, they're not all the same. Those contracts and those pieces of our business that are tied to the All-LF have different timeframes of when they trigger. So you pick that into consideration. But directionally, if inflation increases and as All-LF in fact reflects that, that part of business that is tied to All-LF will increase. Yes.","William Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Right. And then as we look \u2026 next year is a legacy. It's got more legacy in it, right? So as we look to next year, this should have a pretty good directional trend.","Robert Knight","Yes, next year, Bill, as you've heard us say several times, we've got roughly $300 million of revenue which tends to be sort of frontend a business that we will compete for in the marketplace. But it's about $300 million of legacy revenue next year.","William Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Right. And then on inflation, I think in the past you've talked about seeking to offset it with productivity. But if it's going to run this low, is there a chance that our productivity actually causes our -- so not the cost-related to the volume growth, but rather just a fix cost based in the productivity. Can that actually cost the number to go down?","Robert Knight","Lance could comment on this as well. But I would say, potentially. Again, as what you're referring to, Bill, as you know is we set the price the business to market, achieve a successful above inflation sort of pricing environment. And then in addition to that, offset, and we challenge ourselves to offset all. But if we hit 50% of offsetting inflation through productivity, that's a great model. And to your point, we're in a lower inflation area environment and a positive volume environment that gives us more options to do as well as we can on that.","John Koraleski","That's perfect. Rob is absolutely right. Mirroring what Rob says about our drive to an improved OR, there's -- we don't set a limit as just offset inflation. We look for efficiency and productivity everyday through the UP way.","William Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley","That's great. Thank you so much for your time.","Operator","And next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen & Company. Please go over with your question.","Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company","Good morning, guys. It's been well publicized that your competitors had some major, major service issues, and it seems like you guys probably got some freight from them. How much do that really stress the system in the first quarter when you saw on top of the weather, and everything else?","John Koraleski","Jason, if you look at our issues in the first quarter, it was 99% winter. The additional volume and whatever we've taken on either of our own bringing on to the network or anything that might have been diverted on a temporary or permanent basis basically just would have been handled easily by our resources or infrastructure of the investments we've made in the past. So it did not -- the additional business did not stress our network. It was just really the impact of winter weather and the impact that it had not only on Union Pacific but broad-based throughout the industry on our interchange partners.","Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company","Okay. And Jack, this is a broader question. I asked this on another call the other day. We've had issues with Chicago as an interchange in the real network, the entire topic been an analyst. I mean obviously it was great exacerbated this quarter with winter weather. And I know there's been projects around, like they create a project to try to improve that. What's really just holding the rail in street back from all giving together and really just trying to fix this interchange once and for all? Because it seems like this is something that would benefit sixth or the seventh class once going forward.","John Koraleski","My perspective on that, Jason, is Create still is a blueprint for how we can significantly improve the throughput in the Chicago area. But each railroad has its own issues that's stealing with as well. And so in our world, we're making investments. We're planning. We're working together having the centralized operating controlled group in Chicago help to mitigate some of the winter weather. But there's lessons learned here.","And I'm sure that as we come out of this first quarter experience, we'll learn from that, the industry will learn from that. We spend a lot of time working with our interchange partners on throughput and volumes, and things like that, how can we handle things more fluidly, our ability to divert to different gateways depending on the individual interchange partner, those kinds of things.","So I think there'll be lessons learned from this. But I still fundamentally think the investment and the strategy identified and Create holds a lot of potential for us. Lance, what do you think?","Lance Fritz","Yes. Absolutely, Jack. And there's something that the participants in Create have been public about, and that is since the start of Create, we've taken a half a day out of the time it takes for a car to transfer through Chicago side to side, end to end, which is real progress. It's down by about a third. And this year's winter was epic.","And in the absence of Create and the Chicago Planning Group and the coordination that the interchange railroads undertook, it would have been a much worse outcome. Clearly, lessons learned, but it was effective.","Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company","And Lance, what do you think that number can come to? You said it's down by a third. I mean will it keep down by \u2026","Lance Fritz","No. So think about it like this. We've got 17 capital projects already in place, complete. There are 20 are in designer underway, and so each one of those is going to help. So there's still fair amount of upside in terms of reducing the time it takes cars contributors.","Jason Seidl \u2013 Cowen & Company","Okay. Jim, I really appreciate the time as always.","John Koraleski","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.","John Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, good morning gentlemen.","John Koraleski","Good morning, John.","John Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I wanted to focus on the real cost escalator chart that was in Rob's, actually in the presentation. And if you look back at the trailing four quarters, that's pretty tampered inflation. And I would have thought with the labor cost, the escalation built in your contracts that certainly overtime you would've seen more than an average of less than one, which I think it probably works out to be there.","Anything that's going on there that were missing? And would you expect that to continue over the next four quarters?","Robert Knight","Yes, John. I think you're going to see it continue to be low for the next four quarters. And if you recall that our labor inflation, which as you know the way the All-LF works is a market basket of inputs from the industry. But the labor inflation for us, we think it's going to be less than 2% this year. So that is a big piece of what's in there. And so it is driving and has been for quite some time now the reduction in that All-LF number.","So it lines up, and overtime it does what it's intended to do. From quarter to quarter, there might be some timing issues. But it's done its job over multiple quarter and multiyear period.","John Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then maybe just a follow-on on the timing of the restoration of complete fluidity in and around Chicago in the northern -- into the network. One of the executives giving testimony at the STB last week suggested that Chicago should be back in normal completely within four to six weeks. Is that in keeping with kind of your expectations? And will there be any meaningful impact on the EPS line during that restoration period?","John Koraleski","Hey, Lance, why don't you handle the outlook?","Lance Fritz","Yes. Okay, John.","So we are very encouraged by what we see happening on our network right now. We're confident that sometime in the second quarter we will be back to normal. We're working to make that as soon as possible. And in terms of Chicago interchange, that's a difficult question for me to answer because it's dependent on how quickly the networks of interchange railroads come up to speed. What we see right now is real solid improvement as we've exited winter.","John Koraleski","Yes. So we're hoping it won't be a material. You won't see a lot of it in the second quarter from a cost perspective. But it really depends on how it plays itself out.","John Larkin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Rob Salmon \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hey, thanks. Good morning guys.","John Koraleski","Good morning.","Rob Salmon \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Rob, with regards to the incremental margins, as I'm taking a step back and kind of listening to what I heard on the call, it's fairly a mix work against you guys. There's a lot of incremental cause associated with winter weather which meant the network wasn't -- probably wasn't running as full as it could in constrained train lengths.","Should I think about the Q1 64% incremental margin as being a low for the year and expanding from there?","Robert Knight","Rob, as you know, we don't give that level of guidance. But as you heard me say many times, for us to get from where we are today to our sub-65, and we're not going to slow down to get there in time. We get there as efficiently as we can.","As soon as we're going to get 50% kind of number on incremental margins from here to there, there can be lumpiness from quarter to quarter depending on volumes of weather and other issue, fuel prices and other issues. So, you know, we're going to keep doing as well as we can. But I've shied away from getting specific quarterly guidance on that incremental margin number other than to get to our sub-65, we've got to continue to make good progress.","Rob Salmon \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. That's right. But we should think about the network running more fluidly, and that should obviously help overall operational performance, I would imagine.","Robert Knight","That would be a plus. Absolutely. And then we'll see what volume -- our volume actually plays out.","Rob Salmon \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yes. It's fair. I'm not sure if this question should be directed towards Lance or towards Eric. I noticed in the network productivity section, one of the slides. You guys were calling out about 4% volume growth in the north. And as recently as a couple of quarters that it had been down on a year-over-year basis, clearly, your primary competitor in the west has been having a lot of challenges in that region.","It looks like the TE&Y headcount, it increased about 6% year-over-year. Is this 6% growth with regard to expectations for future volume growth are just handling current traffic? And on a side note of that, can you give us a sense if you guys are seeing incremental competitive wins in the north, what type of traffic that's coming on, if it's coming on on the manifest network or unit train network?","Eric Butler","Yes, I think what you saw in the TE&Y buildup of 6%, Rob, was basically the impact of winter where we flooded the northern region with extra labor to help us work our way through the winter process. And it's not necessarily a reflection of what's happening in the north on an ongoing basis. Lance, you want to -- is that okay?","Lance Fritz","Yes, that's perfect. Yes, yes.","Eric Butler","And then the other thing is when you think about our northern region, think about that's where the grain is, that's where frac sand is and our model is sitting there and also our coal business. And so, those were all some fairly decent volume gains just intrinsic in the business itself.","Rob Salmon \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Appreciate the color. It sounds like more unit train there. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks. Good morning.","I just wanted to follow up with a question on coal and specifically the growth in Colorado, Utah coal versus Southern Powder River Basin. So you mentioned 13% tonnage growth in Colorado and 2% in SPRB. Was that a function of whether or easy comps? How do we think about sort of the relative tonnage growth with the respect of these two origins for the balance of the year?","John Koraleski","Okay, Eric?","Eric Butler","Yes, tonnage. When you think about Colorado-Utah coal, there was some easy comps year over year. We do continue to expect in the outlook to see a Colorado-Utah coal being a good source for export coal as the export coal opportunity strengthen in the future.","But I think if you think about it going forward, Southern Powder River Basin growth will probably outpace Colorado-Utah growth going forward in terms of upside opportunity.","Allison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. And is it fair to say that the SPRB has a longer length of haul?","Eric Butler","That depends on the origin and destination pair. But that's probably not an unreasonable expectation. But it depends on the origin of destination pair.","Allison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it. Okay. And then just -- I have a couple of questions on the frac sand business. You mentioned the volumes were up over 20% in the quarter. So I was wondering if you talk a little bit about the sustainability of this pace of growth over the next couple of years as new minds continue to come online in Wisconsin. And then could you give us some sense of how much of the frac business you are originating and terminating on your own minds? And maybe what shales you're delivering the most active?","Eric Butler","Yes. We're very excited about our frac sand franchise. We think we have the premier origination franchise and we think a significant portion of the new mines that are coming online in the Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois region actually are coming on. Our franchise, at least access our franchise. So we're pretty optimistic about the longevity and the outlook from that standpoint.","At the end of the day, it's really going to be drilling that really drives the consumption of frac sand and the drilling trends in terms of longer mines, longer drilling, deeper drilling, deeper horizontal more fracing all are pointing to significant continued growth in frac sand consumption, on those the really interesting friends in Texas in particular for Permian basin and Eagle Ford basin, I think in January I don\u2019t know, the February March numbers have come up but in January Texas had an all-time record of production of oil in terms of record just going back to the early 80s. So as long as those drilling trends continue you'll see the frac sand demand continue and we have a premier frac sand franchise.","Allison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse","And I would imagine that has a pretty good length of haul from Wisconsin to Texas. Is that correct?","Eric Butler","Turbos [ph] is north, south, it\u2019s not as long as some east west moves but it is a pretty good part of our franchise.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski \u2013 Barclays Capital","Rob, I wanted to come back to the discussion on pricing. Because I feel like there's a lot of maybe misunderstanding around the core pricing gains. Obviously you had higher levels of gains last year, but actually we're seeing better margin expansion this quarter. Can you just expand on your comment about how the new and incremental business is not necessarily captured in your metrics?","Robert Knight","Yeah, I mean you have heard me say this many times but the way we calculate price at Union Pacific is how much price do we yield in a particular time period against our entire book of business. I am very proud of the way we calculate it because it\u2019s the most conservative way of looking at it. What I pointed is that, so what that means that if we bring on a new piece of business or business that we haven't had for over a year let\u2019s say, that business might come on at great margins, of course we\u2019re very focused on bringing on at the right margins at the market level pricing. But it wouldn\u2019t show up in the new price, I mean it wouldn\u2019t show up in the year-over-year calculation of price.","So you\u2019re exactly right, when we point out that our pricing was up 2% and all the headwinds we faced, low legacy number light and All-LF impact, the reason that we were able to expand our margins is we were able to leverage the business, leverage the new volumes that came on and as new business came on, we are confident we are pricing it right but it doesn\u2019t show up in the pricing number, but it shows up in our margins.","Brandon Oglenski \u2013 Barclays Capital","And that's what we should really be focused on, to see how you are delivering on the pricing front, right?","Robert Knight","I mean clearly pricing is a tool along with productivity and other things that we do, but at the end of the day margin expansion is clearly the ultimate driver, the ultimate answer.","Brandon Oglenski \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hopefully, I can just get one follow-up in here for Lance. Lance, I think you did state that the network is designed for 190,000, 195,000 units, I believe. That's about 5% from where you've been running the last few weeks. Does that signal that we need a lot more CapEx going forward? Or are there any structural constraints in the network that make it tough to get to 200,000?","Lance Fritz","No, Brandon, what we typically say is 195, 200,000, several days we could handle fluidly and we say that because in 2006 we peaked at a number about like that very different service product at that time and since then we improved processes, we\u2019ve invested capital, we have more surge capacity and that's what gives us the confidence level. From the point of view of handling the volume that Eric\u2019s team is bringing on right now and for the rest of the year, absent some acute areas where maybe we've got a very specific capacity constraint we feel very good about being able to satisfy that with a high service product.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.","Bascome Majors \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","There's a lot of regulatory balls in the air, the STB particularly, relative to just a few months ago. And you also mentioned some things developing in Canada and Mexico earlier in your comments. I was just hoping if you look at these all at once, could you help frame what, in your mind, is the greatest long-term concern for you? And perhaps additionally what's more immediate that you're looking at today that could impact you fairly soon?","John Koraleski","That\u2019s a fairly broad question and so we treat each of those as a very serious issue and we look at them very carefully and closely. So we\u2019re watching what's happening with Needling [ph] proposals the service hearings, the Canadian directed agricultural equipments, the Mexico reform. So in each of those cases we have teams of people looking at working very hard to ensure as I said in my opening remarks that everyone understands the importance of having a viable growing and healthy rail system that\u2019s paid for by private investment and not tax share dollars. So while we consider each one of those to be a very serious and concerning development it also gives us the opportunity to position all of the great things that not only Union Pacific but the entire rail industry has done by the constant reinvestment and investment of capital dollars to build the transportation infrastructure in this country and actually throughout North America that there is today.","So we take them all one by one, if you look at the new discussion around revenue adequacy it\u2019s going to be an opportunity for us to point out the benefits of what\u2019s happened so far, the investment that\u2019s been made, the importance of having decisions that were going to change things to recognize replacement costs, those kinds of things. The service hearings, I think well I think could position us well to tell the story of how even though it was a difficult quarter for the industry, the capital investment made it a lot better than it probably would've been if it had happened five or 10 years ago. In Mexico, we've been working very hard to make sure the government understands the importance in the developments and the volumes that have improved since we took on our concession in partnership with the FXE and that if they look at the throughput and the development of transportation within the country it has certainly helped to grow the Mexico economy. If you look at all the investment from the automotive industry and things like that.","So we look at these as every one of them, well, it's a serious issue if it were to go it right, give us a great opportunity to talk about all the good things that have happened. And so we\u2019re not afraid of them, we\u2019re willing to step up to the plate and participate each and every one of them to make sure our story gets told.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.","Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","I guess my first question here is for Lance. With all the difficulty you had in the winter weather you still managed to keep your headcount under good control here and didn't really need to resource up significantly to add any redundancy. So, that's quite impressive. But I'm just wondering is that reflective of what could've been a lower headcount if you didn't have the weather? How should we look at your headcount as you go through the year and the year this year?","Lance Fritz","So Walter, we think about headcount, resourcing, for the volume that shows up where it shows up, so that we can maintain an excellent service product. I won\u2019t look backwards and guess that what it would've been if winter hadn\u2019t happened. Going forward the right way to think about our headcount is exactly as Rob states with productivity we should be able to keep headcount growth lower than volume growth and I feel pretty confident we are going to be able to do that.","Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","So there is no -- nothing that distorted that in the first quarter that you're going to significantly drop headcount now in the second quarter or anything like that?","Lance Fritz","That\u2019s correct.","Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Second question now. As you alluded to in a number of different ways in your ag business, lot of volatility. You mentioned weather, you mentioned related to that the significant drought from last year, the unpredictability of that. If we look at the current trends in the first quarter carloads, it seems to be off to a very good start, not only on a comp basis, as an easy comp basis, but also on an absolute basis. I'm just curious if, as we model this out in future years, given how important the ag business is, when we look back at historical average levels, be it on carload or overall crop size, is there any reason why your carload volumes would be any different from an average run rate level historically, or is that how we should look at it? Might we need to revert our 2015 ag estimates downwards to reflect perhaps a very healthy 2014 haul?","Eric Butler","Walter, as you recall last year or 2012 going into 2013, there was the drought which significantly impacted our volumes last year, the same time first quarter. So if you look at year-over-year the fact that there was a record corn harvest and harvest started in October and the volumes are moving through the first quarter of this year, clearly is the primary driver behind the volumes that we are seeing. There were some as we said stress in the grain network on our competitors, so there was some small portion of incremental volumes we had assisting the market due to that, those challenges that they had. But again that surrounding the bigger issue was the record corn harvest was a pretty good bean harvest, pretty good wheat harvest and in terms of going forward in the future, again the weather will determine the yields, will determine the production and that will determine the volumes that move during harvest season.","Walter Spracklin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","If I could sneak one last one in here on the regulatory standpoint. I heard all your commentary. Perhaps you could give us if, to the extent you know it, the next few catalysts for any potential changes or regulatory -- in other words, are we going to stay within the confines of the STB and their actions? Or could there be any other occurrences that might impact the STBs, any changes the STB might make on the regulatory front?","John Koraleski","At this point in time as we look at it, the regulatory model is based on railroads being allowed to earn their rate of return and be revenue adequate. And we don't see a lot on the legislative front, there is the railroad antitrust bill that has been introduced but has seen no action and so we haven't really seen a lot on the regulatory front, other than what's happening in the STB and actually as we look at the STB hearings, they are taking a very measured and thoughtful approach to it. So we are in good shape.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Long of Stephens.","Justin Long \u2013 Stephens Inc.","We've been hearing a lot lately about a tightening truckload environment. And you would imagine this should bode well for intermodal pricing as we progress throughout the year. Do think you will be in a position to get better intermodal pricing in 2014 versus what you've seen the past few years?","Eric Butler","As we said we continue to price the market and we are continuedly focused on taking advantage of strong demand. As you mentioned the CSA is having an impact on trucking capacity, had an impact in the winter because of the safety concerns that probably were, was some trucking capacity that self selected themselves out of taking trips on the most difficult portion of the winter weather, because of the concern of the risk with CSA. But we continue to think that the intermodal opportunity is strong, trucking capacity is tightening and we continue to think that that's a good outlook for our book of business.","Justin Long \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Maybe a follow-up to that. How much flexibility do you have to move pricing in intermodal? Have you already established your rates for this year or do you have the ability to raise rates throughout 2014 if the market and demand continues to move higher?","Eric Butler","As we have talked in the past, a portion of business is in different segments, some in long-term contracts, some in one year contracts that rotate or come up throughout the year, some in instruments that you can change on a relatively frequent basis. Our intermodal business has the same kind of profile and as we have opportunities based on demand and market prices we will them.","Operator","Next question is coming from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker \u2013 Morningstar","My question is for Eric. Eric, your comments remain quite positive on the 2014 economy. And I want to ask you about chemicals in particular, given the sea change in US natural gas economics from fracking. Would you share any new developments or your expectations for what industries within chemicals might lead rail volume growth? And if you think this will come on next year or further into the future?","Eric Butler","I think we have said several times in the past that with the relatively low natural gas prices, futures is still I think around 450 or something like that. You\u2019re seeing a lot of plastics development coming on a number of different plants that have been announced for expansion, I think we said in the past and in previous earnings releases that most of those will come on in 2016, 2017 that we continue to see strong upside opportunity from that. Our fertilizer business we continue to see a strong upside opportunity in our fertilizer business. So fertilizers, plastics, industrial chems, we think are long-term positive outlooks.","Keith Schoonmaker \u2013 Morningstar","And I guess just a quick follow-up on the Mexico discussion. Given this business is handed off to your US assets rather than your own operations in Mexico, and I recall the Ferromex ownership stake. Can you comment on how you believe your franchise would actually be effective if the bill proposed became law? Is this just a bad precedent for other jurisdictions or would this in itself have material impact to UP?","John Koraleski","I think overall if you look at our franchise, the Union Pacific franchise, the business is moving into and out of Mexico, it's not going to really change materially, our ability to deliver goods about to the border and also to have taken from the border and deliver them throughout the US.","Robert Knight","You heard us say this before but our interest in this is we don't want to see something that erodes commerce in Mexico and we think one of the unintended consequences of potential bill is that that it would create less commerce in Mexico. But as you know the only railroad that crosses 6 border crossings in and out of Mexico, so we just like to see commerce continue to grow and volumes continue to one across the border both ways and we are ready to handle it.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of David Vernon, Bernstein Research.","David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein Research","Just two quick questions maybe on the growth outlook. Eric, the intermodal weeklies are looking pretty strong right now. How much of that is the Santa Teresa opening versus maybe some just straight organic conversion versus share take?","Eric Butler","So we did open our Santa Teresa facility April 1 of this year and we think that, that will be a strong lever for us for that market, that market. I think we talked publicly that, that new ramp has about 250,000 less capacity, if you think about our domestic intermodal business is 1.6 million units, so we are seeing a strong growth with our products and services across-the-board, certainly new product offerings from Santa Teresa will add to that. But we are seeing strong growth across the board.","David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein Research","Should we think that that Santa Teresa opening of that terminal is going to continue this growth through the year and it laps? Or is this more -- I guess I'm trying to figure out of the current strength is more of a temporary thing that should ebb as the weather sort of eases up and other rail service improves or if we should be expecting these higher upper single-digit growth in intermodal going forward?","Eric Butler","So the current strength is, the strength that we are seeing across our book of business, when ramp opens up there is a gradual ramp up and there is going to be a gradual ramp up in Santa Teresa. The current strength in our intermodal business is depending on slowly growing economy and our value proposition and that\u2019s an across the board opportunity for our book of business rate.","David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein Research","Maybe just as a separate question. Are you guys seeing any development of terminals for handling heavy crude-by-rail, either in the western, specifically California refineries or down in Texas on your network?","Eric Butler","As we have spoken before, there are number of different terminals that are under development both on the West Coast and to the extent also in the Gulf Coast. We\u2019re working actively and part of our strategy is to strengthen franchise we cannot direct when and where crude oil will flow, that\u2019s determined by strength that our franchise wants, to, we will ensure we have a franchise that landed when and where at once they flow.","David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein Research","Would you think that western -- those western refineries might have perhaps a little bit of a cost advantage via rail relative to the Gulf?","Eric Butler","I am not really sure what you are asking, when you say cost advantage you mean lower rail costs?","David Vernon \u2013 Bernstein Research","Yeah, lower, just to move from western Canada down to the Western \u2013","Eric Butler","It will be market based and we will price to take advantage of the value of our franchise whether it\u2019s going to the west coast or to the Gulf Coast.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird.","Ben Hartford \u2013 Robert W. Baird","I think a question for Lance. If I look at cars online, cars online are call it 10% to 12% above trough levels of last year. As we think about volume growth accelerating and the cross current of the network normalizing into the third quarter, how should we think about the asset requirements of the network going forward? Can we continue to think about cars online falling as they were through all of last year? Or should we think about those 2013 levels as the trough and now that we do see volume growth accelerate that that growth number should lag, but we won't quite pierce and fall below the best levels realized last year? Can you provide some perspective there?","Robert Knight","Sure, Ben, as I look at car inventory on our railroad right now the large majority of the growth year-over-year is about winter impact and I am expecting that portion of inventory to ultimately bleed off as we\u2019re able to interchange it off to other carriers or ultimately get it to a customer on our own railroad. There is some amount of that growth that\u2019s driven by unit volume growth and what I really look at and care about is car productivity as opposed to the absolute inventory number. The absolute inventory number is important for me as an overall indicator but what we really try to drive is good utilization of the cars that are on us.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Don Broughton of Avondale Partners.","Don Broughton \u2013 Avondale Partners","Real quick, you talked about wage inflation. Looking at the comp benefit line, obviously wage inflation 2%. What are the other puts and takes, performance bonuses we hope you earn, pension tailwinds? What else is going to be pushing and\/or pulling that line in 2014?","Robert Knight","On that line, a big offset if you will to wage inflation has been the pension expense, pension side of the equation and that\u2019s been the reason why I say that our labor line for the full year is expected to be below 2%.","Don Broughton \u2013 Avondale Partners","So the wage inflation actually is higher than that, it's just that the actual line itself will be -- come in at under 2%?","Robert Knight","","That\u2019s correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research.","Jeff Kauffman \u2013 Buckingham Research","Most of my questions have been answered. Just one quick one on the locomotive CapEx you spoke about. With the tier 4 locomotive standards, this is the first time I think we're using exhaust gas recirculation to meet the standards and the experience of the truckers with this was we ended up with more expensive engines that were not as efficient. What are your thoughts on the locomotives post the tier 4 standard and does this change the economics for you in terms of thinking about natural gas as an alternative fuel in the long run for the locomotive fleet?","Lance Fritz","Sure, so first thing to note is, we have a couple of tier 4 test units that are on us, wired up so that we can fully understand with the OEM involved, what the economics and what really the overall performance metrics of those units look like. It is not certain what efficiency impact a tier four locomotive is going to have in relation to a tier 3. I know the OEMs are working very hard to make fuel consumption rates roughly equivalent and so there's more to follow there.","And in terms of will delta in that make a fundamental difference in the LNG economics? The answer is that\u2019s probably a minor impact, the major impact is utilization infrastructure costs and couple other elements.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Claire Ouzagareen with Macquarie.","Claire Ouzagareen \u2013 Macquarie","My first question relates to pricing. Could you clarify for us how much of your book is specifically tied to AII-LF or another inflation cost measure? And how much is able to take advantage of improving demand fundamentals for example, in intermodal?","Robert Knight","I mean roughly a quarter of our business is tied to an escalator, AII-LF being the major driver of the escalations that we use. I would also then add to that, Eric responded earlier to the intermodal question of what capability does it to have to take pricing up throughout the year and we\u2019ve got a mix of long-term contracts, we\u2019ve got a mix of short-term contracts, we\u2019ve got a mix of annual quotes if you will. So we look to take advantage and move and price to market wherever we can. We don't give specific guidance by commodity as to how much we can touch with any particular timeframe but across our entire book of business. We look to price to market where we have the opportunity.","Claire Ouzagareen \u2013 Macquarie","Would you be able to comment to what verticals are offered most opportunity this year in your opinion?","Robert Knight","No, we don\u2019t get into that.","Claire Ouzagareen \u2013 Macquarie","And then my second question relates to [indiscernible] rail opportunities specifically tied to the Permian, would you be able to share with us what kind of growth or infrastructure development projects you are looking for there to enable it to take advantage of production growth, and what kind of commitments you are looking for in the supply chain from a pure capital to developing an area?","Eric Butler","As we have said previously, the Permian basin has great coverage, pipeline coverage and that's where most of the production growth has taken in the state of Texas. So if you look at our crude by rail volumes from the Permian they actually had decreased significantly, we have said that in the past. And they are really nominal and going forward there may be some spot opportunities for crude by rail in the Permian but the Permian has great pipeline coverage, we don't expect that to be a driver of any crude by rail volumes going into the future. It is a driver of our drilling materials volumes like frac sand and pipe.","Claire Ouzagareen \u2013 Macquarie","So you are not contemplating maybe laying some new rail into California refineries or that's more science fiction than feasible future?","Eric Butler","Yeah, so we are, as I mentioned before, looking at the destination franchise, for crude by rail into California. At this point in time, the market is suggesting a lot of that will be sourced from Canada or the Bakken. There are those in the market we believe that Permian will go to California. If that happens we will be prepared for it but I think the market today is suggesting majority of crude by rail in California will come from Canada or the Bakken.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jack Koraleski for closing comments.","John Koraleski","Well, great, thank you everybody for joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking with you again in July.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time."],"20614":["Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) Q2 2015 Earnings Conference Call July 23, 2015  8:45 AM ET","Executives","Lance Fritz - President and CEO","Eric Butler - EVP, Marketing and Sales","Cameron Scott - EVP, Operations","Rob Knight - CFO","Analysts","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital","David Vernon - Bernstein Research","Tom Wadewitz - UBS","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group","Brian Ossenbeck - JPMorgan","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company","Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs","Justin Long - Stephens Inc.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities","John Larkin - Stifel Nicolaus","Matt Troy - Nomura Asset Management","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Research Equities","Ben Hartford - Robert W.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may now begin.","Lance Fritz","Good morning, everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Cameron Scott, our Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.2 billion, or $1.38 per share for the second quarter of 2015. This is a 3% decrease in earnings per share compared to the second quarter of 2014. Solid core pricing gains were not enough to overcome a significant decrease in demand. Total volumes in the second quarter were down 6%, led by a sharp decline in coal. Industrial products and agricultural products also posted significant volume decreases.","As you recall, first quarter volumes were down 2%, and we began realigning our resources early in the year, storing locomotives and furloughing employees. These efforts continued throughout the second quarter. We've made meaningful progress right sizing our resources to current volumes, and I'm encouraged to report that we've made these improvements while posting strong safety performance. But, our work is not finished. We'll continue to become more agile with our network and our resources. We remain focused on providing safe and efficient service for our customers, and strong financial performance for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it over to Eric.","Eric Butler","Thanks, Lance, and good morning. In the second quarter, our volume was down 6%, with gains in automotive and intermodal more than offset by declines in coal, industrial products and Ag products. We generated solid core pricing gains of 4%, but it was not enough to offset the drop in fuel surcharge and the mix headwinds, as average revenue per car declined 5% in the quarter. You'll see the impact of lower fuel surcharge revenue as we discuss each business group. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 10% decrease in freight revenue.","Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups. Ag products revenue was down 7% on a 7% volume decrease in flat average revenue per car. Grain volume was down 19% in the quarter. Our domestic feed grain shipments declined 6% as we return to more normal seasonal shipping patterns compared to the strong demand last year. Export feed grain was impacted by the strong US dollar and abundant global grain supply, driving our export shipments down 36%. In wheat, our export shipments also declined, but were partially offset by moderately better domestic shipments. Grain products volume was down 3% for the quarter.","Ethanol volume declined 6%, driven by extended plant maintenance downtime following a record year of production. Partially offsetting the ethanol decline was increased demand for soy bean meal exports to China and an increase in bio-diesel shipments. Food and refrigerator shipments were down 2%, driven primarily by fewer potato shipments and also due to lower frozen meat exports.","Automotive revenue was up 3% in the second quarter on a 7% increase in volume, partially offset by a 3% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments were up 8% this quarter, driven by continued strength in consumer demand. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for North American automotive sales was 17.1 million vehicles in the second quarter, up 3.6% from the same quarter in 2014. This is the first quarter with the SAAR rate above 17 million vehicles since the third quarter of 2005. In auto parts, volume grew 5% this quarter driven primarily by increased vehicle production.","Chemicals revenue was down 1% for the quarter on a 1% reduction in average revenue per car and flat volume. Plastics shipments were up 11% in the second quarter. Stable resin pricing led to strong buyer confidence in the market, and we also saw a strength in export volume. Petroleum and liquid petroleum gas volume was up 10% in the second quarter, driven primarily by strength in several LPG markets. Our volume gains were offset by a 29% decline in crude oil shipments, which continued to be impacted by lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads.","Coal revenue declined 31% in the second quarter on a 26% reduction in volume and 7% decrease in average revenue per car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 28% for the quarter, as demand for coal continued to be impacted by mild weather and lower natural gas prices. In addition to soft demand, volumes were also impacted by heavy rains in June that flooded coal mines in the Powder River Basin and damaged our main line. Colorado Utah tonnage was down 31% for the quarter, driven by both the soft domestic demand and reduced export shipments. I'll talk more about our outlook for coal in just a minute.","Industrial products revenue was down 14% on a 13% decline in value and 1% decrease in average revenue per car. Construction products revenue was down 5% for the quarter. We experienced higher than normal rainfall in the southern part of our franchise during the quarter, which led to construction delays that impacted both cement and rock volume. We still think the construction market is fundamentally strong, particularly in Texas, and that our construction products business will rebound.","Minerals volume was down 24% in the second quarter. The reduction in drilling activity led to a 28% decline in shipments of Frac sand. Finally, metals volume was down 27% as lower crude oil prices reduced drilling related shipments by nearly 50%. Also, the strong US dollar continued to drive increased imports, which reduces demand from domestic steel producers.","Intermodal revenue was down 5% as a 2% volume increase was more than offset by a 7% decrease in average revenue per unit. Domestic shipments grew 3% in the second quarter, as we continued to see strong demand from highway conversions and for premium services. International intermodal was up 1%, as our recovery from the west coast port labor dispute was muted by the strong comparisons from 2014. You'll recall that the second quarter 2014 results included free shipments ahead of the west coast port labor contract expiration.","Additionally, we experienced a slowdown later in the quarter due to relatively high retail inventory levels and softer than expected retail sales. I'll update you on our expectations for peak season in just a minute. To wrap up, let's take a look at our outlook for the rest of the year. In Ag products, overall crop conditions in our territory appear favorable at the moment. However, low commodity prices and abundant global supply creates uncertainty in our volume outlook for grain. In grain products, we expect demand for soybean meal to remain strong in the near term, and ethanol production should return to seasonally normal levels.","Automotive should continue to benefit from strength in sales, and we expect growth in finished vehicles and auto parts shipments. In coal, while the weather has been closer to seasonally normal temperatures recently, we expect lower natural gas prices, higher inventories and low export demand to continue to be head winds in the second half of the year. Although we anticipate continued year-over-year declines in the back half of the year, we expect that volumes will sequentially improve from second quarter levels.","Most chemical markets remain solid for the remainder of the year, with strength expected in LPG and plastics. We continue to expect crude oil prices and unfavorable spreads will remain a significant headwind for crude-by-rail shipments for the rest of the year. Lower crude oil prices will also continue to impact some of our industrial products markets. Rig counts are down roughly 50% from their peak in 2014, but seem to have stabilized in recent weeks. We expect our Frac sand shipments to level off as well, though they will be significantly lower year-over-year, given the strong comps. The reduction in new drilling activity, along with the strong dollar, will continue to be head winds for our metals business. The housing market continues to strengthen year-over-year, and we believe our lumber franchise is well positioned to grow with demand. In construction products, we anticipate to return to growth as weather conditions normalize.","Finally in intermodal, the relatively high current retail inventory levels could moderate our growth in the second half of the year in both domestic and international. However, many of the consumer confidence and spending indicators are still positive, so we're preparing for a normal peak shipping season, though it could be muted. As always, highway conversions will continue to present growth opportunities in domestic intermodal.","Overall, while there is uncertainty in some of our markets, we continue to see opportunity in several others. We will continue our focus on solid core pricing gains and business development across our diverse franchise.","With that I'll turn it over to Cameron.","Cameron Scott","Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Starting with our safety performance. Our first half reportable injury rate improved 23% versus 2014 to a record low 0.82. Successfully finding and addressing risk in the work place is clearly having a positive impact, as we improve towards our goal of zero incidents.","In rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate increased 17% to 3.46, driven by an increase in yard and industry reportable. To make improvement going forward, we will continue to focus on enhanced training to eliminate human factor incidents. We will also continue making investments that harden our infrastructure to reduce incidents.","In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 11% versus 2014 to 1.97. We continue to drive improvement by reinforcing public awareness through channels including public safety campaigns and community partnerships. Moving to network performance, we continue to face a very dynamic environment. Significant volume swings and business mix shifts have led us to more frequently adjust our transportation plans. Add to it the numerous flooding related outages we faced during the quarter, and it was a challenging operating environment.","During the quarter, we experienced 64 weather interruption days, caused by more than 100 weather-related track outages, including a significant interruption in the Powder River basin during early June. We define interruption days as more than 50 hours of train delay associated with weather or incident events. The strength of our franchise and investments we have made in resources and infrastructure have enabled us to mitigate the impact of these events. We rerouted trains where possible, while our engineering crews worked around the clock to restore operations. I'm very proud of the men and women of Union Pacific who faced these challenges head on, enabling us to generate year-over-year improvement in both velocity and terminal dwell.","That said, we know there is more work to do and we're working diligently to improve service and reduce costs. Throughout the year, you have heard us discuss the importance of resource alignment as a key lever to reduce cost. While we strive to be as real-time as possible, the reality is that there is a time lag in adjusting the resource space, especially during periods of volume swings and business mix shifts.","As you can see in the charts on the right, we have made meaningful progress right sizing our TE&Y workforce and active locomotive fleet throughout the first half. Our total TE&Y workforce was down 4% in June versus March. More than half of the decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline. We expect a further reduction in the third quarter. By the end of June, we had around 1200 TE&Y employees either furloughed or on alternative work status, and had about 900 locomotives in storage. This is up from the end of the first quarter, when we had around 500 TE&Y employees furloughed or on alternative work status, and 475 locomotives in storage. While we still have some work left to do, we are now getting closer to having our resources aligned with demand. But as always, we'll continue to monitor and adjust our work force levels and equipment fleet as volume dictates.","Moving to network productivity. Even in the face of less than optimal operating conditions and lower volumes, we're able to generate some efficiencies during the quarter. We ran record train lengths in nearly all major categories, remaining agile and adapting our transportation plan to current demand. We were also able to generate efficiency gains within terminals, as productivity initiatives led to record terminal productivity despite a decline in the number of cars switched.","Growth capacity investments whether it be in the form of sidings, double track, or terminal infrastructure have enhanced our ability to generate productivity and have increased the fluid capabilities of our network. However, as was also the case in the prior quarter, the associated time lag in adjusting resources to lower volumes continue to lead to inefficiencies in other areas. This was particularly evident in efficiency metrics such as locomotive productivity, which is measured for gross ton miles per horsepower day. While lower coal and grain volumes did create a mix headwind, this suite productivity metric was down 8% versus the second quarter of 2014.","To wrap up, as we move into the back half of the year, we expect our safety strategy will continue yielding record results on our way to an incident-free environment. We will continue making operational improvements by leveraging the strengths of our franchise to improve operational performance. While our resources are now more closely in line with demand, we will continue our focus on other productivity initiatives to reduce costs. Ultimately, safety and service will drive our ability to run an efficient network, all of which creates value for our customers and increases returns for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Rob Knight","Thanks, good morning. Let's start with a recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue was just over $5.4 billion in the quarter, down 10% versus last year. A significant decline in volume and lower fuel surcharge revenue, along with a negative shift in business mix more than offset another quarter of solid core pricing.","Operating expenses totaled just under $3.5 billion, decreasing 9% when compared to last year. Drivers of this expense reduction where significantly lower fuel expense, along with volume-related reductions and cost-saving initiatives. The net result was an 11% decrease in operating income to $1.9 billion. Below the line, other income totaled $142 million, up from $22 million in 2014. Included in this amount is the previously announced Fremont, California land sale, which contributed $113 million to pretax income or $0.08 per share to total earnings.","Interest expense of $153 million was up 11% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during the last 12 months. Income tax expense decreased 7% to $734 million, driven primarily by reduced pretax earnings. Net income decreased 7% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combine to produce a quarterly earnings of $1.38 per share, down 3% versus last year.","Now, turning to our top line, freight revenue of about $5.1 billion was down 10% versus last year. In addition to a 6% volume decline, fuel surcharge revenue was down about $400 million when compared to 2014. All in, we estimate the net impact of fuel price was a $0.06 headwind to earnings in the second quarter versus last year. This includes the net impact from both fuel surcharges and lower diesel fuel costs. Of course this is a turnaround from the first quarter, where we had the benefit of surcharge lag and more favorable spreads.","Assuming fuel prices and associated spreads remain at current levels, we estimate that fuel will be a slight headwind to earnings for the remainder of the year. Business mix, as we guided on our first quarter earnings call, was a negative contributor to freight revenue for the second quarter. The primary drivers of this mix shift were significant declines in bulk grains, Frac sand, and steel shipments, along with an increase in intermodal volumes.","Looking ahead, business mix will likely continue to be a headwind to freight revenue for the remainder of the year. A 4% core price increase was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter. Slide 21 provides more detail on our core pricing trends. Core pricing continued at levels that are above inflation and reflects the value proposition that we offer in the marketplace. Of the 4% this quarter, just under a half percent can be attributed to the benefit of the legacy business we renewed earlier this year, and this includes both the 2015 and 2016 legacy contract renewals.","Moving on to the expense side, slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which increased 5% versus 2014. Lower volumes were more than offset by labor inflation, increased training expense, and operating inefficiencies. Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count was up 4% when compared to 2014. About half of this increase was in our capital-related workforce. Excluding our capital-related employees, our force level grew by about 2.5%, but is down 500 sequentially from the first quarter.","As Cam just discussed, we are continuing to adjust our TE&Y workforce levels to better align with current demand. While we have made progress, we continue to look for every opportunity to right size our workforce and focus on labor productivity. By year end, we now expect our net overall workforce levels to come in somewhat lower than the 48,000 that we reported at the end of last year.","Labor inflation was about 6% for the second quarter, driven primarily by agreement wage inflation. Remember, the first two quarters of this year include the 3% agreement wage increase effective the first of this year on top of the 3.5% wage increase from last July. For the full year, we still expect labor inflation to be about 5%, including slightly higher pension costs.","Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $541 million, down 41% when compared to 2014. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with a 10% decline in gross ton miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate deteriorated 2%, largely driven by the decline in coal volumes, while our average fuel price declined 36% to $1.99 per gallon.","Moving on to the other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense decreased 6% to $600 million. Reduced contract service expenses associated with our subsidiaries was partially offset by an increase in locomotive material expenses. Depreciation expense was $497 million, up 6% compared to 2014. We still expect depreciation to increase about 6% for the full year.","Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $312 million, which is down 1% when compared to 2014. Lower locomotive lease and freight car rental expense were the primary drivers. Other expenses came in at $225 million, down 1% versus last year. Lower personal injury expense was somewhat offset by higher state and local taxes. Year-to-date, other expense is up 7%, consistent with our full-year expectation of a 5% to 10% increase, excluding any large unusual items.","Turning now to our operating ratio performance, the quarterly operating ratio came in at 64.1%, an increase of 0.6 points when compared to the second quarter of 2014. The operating ratio benefited just under a point from the net impact of lower fuel prices in the quarter.","Turning now to our cash flow, cash from operations for the first half increased to just under $3.8 billion. This is up 17% compared to 2014, primarily driven by the timing of tax payments and changes in working capital. We also invested more than $2.1 billion this half in cash capital investments.","Taking a look at the balance sheet, our adjusted debt balance grew to $16.6 billion at quarter end, up from $14.9 billion at year end. This takes our adjusted debt to capital ratio to 44.2%, up from 41.3% at year-end 2014. We continue to target an adjusted debt to cap ratio in the low-to-mid 40% range, and an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5 plus. We have made meaningful progress towards our targets as we continue to execute our cash allocation strategies.","Our profitability and cash generation enable to us to continue to fund both our capital program and cash returns to shareholders. Since the first of the year, we have bought back about 15 million shares totaling $1.6 billion. Between the first and second quarter dividends, along with our share repurchases, we returned $2.6 billion to our shareholders in the first half of 2015. This represents roughly a 15% increase over 2014, demonstrating our commitment to increasing shareholder value.","So that's a recap of our second quarter results. As we look towards the back half of the year, we will continue to focus on achieving solid core pricing gains. However, we expect volumes to be down somewhat year over year in the second half, given the market dynamics we are experiencing in many of our business segments. Also, as we discussed earlier, business mix will continue to be a head wind on freight revenue.","On the expense side, we noted on our first quarter earnings call that inefficiencies cost us as much as 2 points on the operating ratio. We've made good progress since then. We estimate that these extra costs added just under a point in the second quarter. In the third quarter, we expect to reduce these costs even further. While we continue to improve, it is not likely at this point that we will achieve record earnings on a full year basis, given this year's challenges.","Longer term, however, we expect to be on track to achieve our long term financial guidance. As always, we remain committed to providing our customers with safe, efficient service, and our shareholders with strong financial returns.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.","Lance Fritz","Thanks, Rob. With the challenges of the first half now behind us, our focus is on the remainder of the year and beyond. Clearly, there are still a lot of moving parts. We'll keep a close eye on crude oil and natural gas prices, the upcoming grain harvest, the strong dollar impact on balance of trade, as well as the continued demand for autos and the outlook for the consumer economy. All of this leads to a fluid demand picture across many of our business segments.","While the volume outlook is uncertain, we remain laser focused on operating safely and efficiently no matter what the market environment. We will continue to reduce costs and productivity as we further align resources with demand. While we've made some progress, there is more to be done. Longer term, we continue to be optimistic about the strengths of our diverse rail franchise. We remain committed to providing excellent service for our customers and strong returns to our shareholders in the years ahead.","So with that, let's open up the lines for your questions.","Rob Knight","Lance, if I can make one comment before we take the first question?","Lance Fritz","Sure.","Rob Knight","We just understand here recently that some of you have had trouble accessing the slides on our web site. They are back up and running now. So if you have any difficulty, we suggest you log out and log back in, and they should be up and available for you. We apologize for that.","Lance Fritz","Thanks, Rob.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.","Chris Wetherbee","Good morning. I wanted to touch on, Rob, what you wrapped up there with. When you think about earnings progression as we go through the rest of the year, clearly we had the pinch point here in the second quarter with resources relative to volume. Volume gets better a little bit sequentially, and resources are still adjusting. Do you feel like getting back to year-over-year earnings growth is something that can be achieved by the fourth quarter of this year? I don't want to get too specific in terms of guidance, but I just want to get a rough sense of the puts and takes about trying to get back up to a positive trajectory and then thinking out into 2016?","Rob Knight","We're focused on obviously improving earnings as best we can. You're exactly right, we're going to be laser focused on continuing to align the resources and be as efficient as we can on the costs. But what we're calling out in my comment to suggesting that it's not likely that we will beat last year's record earnings is the reality of what we're seeing in the business mix, particularly the coal volumes. We're not calling for any dramatic turnaround in our coal volumes. As Eric pointed out, while we are seeing some sequential improvement as we speak right now, we are anticipating that that will be a challenge.","The other thing I would just point out Chris in the way you're looking at it, is recall last year actually is a very tough comp for the fourth quarter in particular. So we've got that headwind, if you will, in terms of getting back above that level. So we're focused on taking advantage of every opportunity we can, but we just see some continuing softness in some of our key markets, and that's going to be the key driver.","Chris Wetherbee","That's helpful. Just a quick follow-up on the coal that you mentioned there. As you see that sequential improvement into 3Q, any sense you can give us on how to think about that specific commodity group in the back half, or just maybe the third quarter? And maybe where stockpiles are, so we can get some rough sense there? Thank you.","Lance Fritz","Eric, can you take care of that for us?","Eric Butler","It all depends, Chris, as we always say, depending on weather. Inventory levels are still higher than the 5-year average. They have come down about three or four days. The burn is increasing, but they are still higher. The volumes will depend on whether; it will depend a lot on natural gas pricing. At current natural gas levels, it remains a difficult comparison for coal to remain coal. It's about a 30%, 32% market share today, versus the 39%, 40% last year. A big change in that is natural gas pricing.","Chris Wetherbee","Thanks for your time.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your questions.","Allison Landry","Thanks, good morning. So, I just wanted to talk a little bit about the mix head wind that you mentioned going forward. So based on some of your comments, if grain volumes do end up materializing, you do see a rebound in construction products and potentially some muted growth on the intermodal side. Is there a scenario where mix could be flattish? I'm just trying to understand maybe some of the puts and takes, and the magnitude of the negative mix in the back half.","Lance Fritz","Rob, do you want to take that?","Rob Knight","If what you just outlined, Allison, came true, those would certainly be positive contributors to the mix. As you know, I don't give guidance on mix. It's rare that we do. This year is unique in that we are confident that the mix head winds are in front of us. So we're giving that directional guidance. I would just remind everyone that, because of the great diversity of our business mix, which is a strong attribute of the Union Pacific franchise, we tend to have a lot of mix swings in our business from quarter to quarter. So the points that you are making would certainly contribute. Would they be enough to overcome some of the other head winds like the coal, the shale, the sand, et cetera? Perhaps not, but every opportunity we have to, you know, narrow the gap, if you will, and improve on the mix, we'll certainly take advantage of it.","Lance Fritz","I'd like to add to that. This is Lance, our commercial team has a robust business development pipeline. They're pursuing business opportunity that presents itself to us because of our wonderful diverse franchise. So to Rob's point, it's hard to be precise in making a future call. There are opportunities and puts and takes. The guidance we've given you is what we think is our best guess.","Allison Landry","Okay. Just a follow-up question. Could you give us a sense of how much the inefficiencies cost you in the second quarter?","Rob Knight","Yes, Allison, just to rephrase that, remember we said it was up to about - call that $100 million in the first quarter. It was closer to just under a point in the second quarter. From a dollar standpoint, we'll call that a $50 million improvement, from first to second quarter in those efficiencies. Again, we're focused on continuing aggressively to remove those efficiencies as quickly as we can.","Allison Landry","Sorry, I missed that last part. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe research. Please go ahead with your questions.","Scott Group","Thanks, good morning.","Lance Fritz","Good morning.","Scott Group","Just want to clarify one quick thing first. Rob your comments about earnings growth, what are you assuming for the second quarter? Is that based on $1.30 or $1.38?","Rob Knight","In the second quarter, $1.38. I guess what you are getting at is the land sale. Yes, all in.","Scott Group","Okay. So a question on coal. We understand some of the pressures, but seeing so much more weakness in your volumes relative to BNSF, is there any color you can provide on - maybe there is a big market share loss or customer loss that we should be thinking about, and when that began? Are you starting to see any pressure from the utilities on a pricing standpoint?","Lance Fritz","I'm going to let Eric answer that question.","Eric Butler","As we mentioned at last quarter, Scott, we do think we came into this year a different place than our western competitor in terms of inventory levels of our key customer utilities, and we do think that that has had an impact. We also think, as we mentioned in our comments, that some of the flooding and track outages that we experienced particularly in June, had an impact that you probably won't see in the numbers of our western competitor. One of the other impacts that we have seen is that there are probably a couple of specific customers that have had outages, that have had challenges in their energy markets in terms of them competing that are probably disproportionately impacting us than our competitor. We think over time, that kind of works its way out. Certainly in the second quarter it had an impact. We always compete for business. We think we have a market value. We are continuing to focus on the strong price in terms of the second part of your question. You know, we feel good about the market value, and the price for our services, and that is reflected in our results in the second quarter.","Scott Group","Thanks. The last question, I want to ask about share buybacks. It seems to me for the past several years, you have had this really unique story with the legacy pricing. That's behind us now, but it seems to me, you still have a unique opportunity in terms of having by far the least leverage of any of the rails. Given the weakness in the stock and maybe tougher to grow earnings. Do you start to think about using that optionality more aggressively? And why not?","Rob Knight","Scott, you know the guidance we've given in terms of the metrics that we're comfortable with. To your point on the share buyback, if you look at the first half of this year compared to last year's first half, we're up about 10% in terms of our share buyback, and we will continue to be opportunistic, and at the prices that we're seeing right now, we think those are nice entry points. So we will - we are certainly, as we always have, buy more when it's down, less when it's up. Your longer term question, I think is answered in our comfort with our longer term metrics that we've given.","Lance Fritz","Scott, this is Lance. I want to react to something that was in your question, which said tougher to grow earnings, going forward. I want to reemphasize what we've constantly focused on with our investors, and that is we've got an industry best franchise. It's got plenty of opportunity for a growth and business development. We've got plenty of opportunity to continue to improve the productivity and efficiency of operations. For the very long term, we feel very good about our long-term guidance.","Scott Group","Thank you.","Rob Knight","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please go with your question.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Good morning. Just a little follow-up on the coal just for a second. I want to go back to last quarter, you thought coal was going to be down 5%. At that point it was already running down in the mid-teens. I just want to think back to the inefficiencies, as you noted. Have you been slower to cut costs in addition to the inefficiencies? Lance, the question would be, what gets to you move quicker? Thinking about how to balance cutting costs and staying ahead of that, but then if you get that inflection on volumes at some point to still be prepared? How do you think about how quickly you want to cut out some of those additional costs?","Lance Fritz","Sure. So Ken, putting this all in context, right? This time last year, second quarter last year, we were behind in resources, experiencing substantial growth, and as rapidly as we could, filling our pipeline with new employees. We came into this quarter or this year and then in the first quarter, as you note, declined 2%, which was not our expectation and then further declined in the second quarter. So as soon as we recognized this year that we need to make adjustments, we've been doing so. The big thing that has us mismatched right now is really two parts, and Rob hit both.","One is our capital program and the type of capital we're spending is demanding that we have more capital head count. So there's a head count imbalance there that grew year-over-year, and our training pipeline where we were just filling it up in the second quarter last year, and we're now emptying it out in the second quarter this year. As we move into the third quarter, all of that is happening at a rapid pace and will continue to happen. I expect by the end of the third quarter, much more balance as regards to training and as regards overall head count and resources targeted on the transportation product.","You know, answering your question, could we do things faster? Hindsight is a luxury we typically don't have in planning the business. I certainly wish we had better clarity in what our markets would be doing, what the mix would look like. We certainly would be making adjustments more rapidly if we did. However, in the pragmatic world we're in right now, there is an opportunity for us to be better. We're working very hard right now in trying to figure out ways to be more agile with our resources, to be quicker in recognizing market shifts and being quicker and being able to take those actions. So I think it's a fair question.","Ken Hoexter","I appreciate that seems tough to see with some more volatility on the volume side. On the follow up, maybe just throwing it to Eric. On, I think the question before was talking about more on the coal side and the competition. If you are seeing that impacting pricing? It seems like with your positive 4% pure pricing. But I want to understand, are you seeing across the other commodities, as Burlington has improved their service levels, are you seeing increased competition on the volume side? And any thoughts on pricing and what that may do outside of your legacy renewals.","Eric Butler","Ken, we always say we have a tough competitor. They always have been. Always will be. Not only is the Burlington a tough competitor, but we compete with other railroads and other markets. We also compete with trucks. Trucks are also a tough competitor, and lower fuel prices are helping them. That being said, we feel good about our value proposition we're continuing to focus on the strategies and initiatives to improve our value proposition. It's our goal to have the best service and value proposition in the industry. If we do that, we think we'll be able to price appropriately for our value.","Ken Hoexter","Thanks for the time and insight.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Brandon Oglenski","Good morning, everyone.","Lance Fritz","Good morning.","Brandon Oglenski","Rob, can I follow up on this line of questions, here? Just thinking about your OR or your margins in the back half of the year. I think if we look back the last couple of years, you've had quite a bit of sequential improvement and profitability. We're talking a lot of pluses and minuses here. Business mix should be negative, still lower volumes year on year, but sequentially improving. Still getting price. Then you talked a lot about the fuel impact in the second quarter and how that could be incremental headwind. You have wage inflation, but head count reduction. So as you balance all of this out, with the best view right now, how do you feel about the operating ratio heading into the second half of the year?","Rob Knight","Yes. There's a lot of moving parts, as you point out. Fuel being a big one, in terms of the impact that that has on the operating ratio itself. But our focus would be that that is an opportunity still for to us make year-over-year improvement. The way things look at this point in time, fuel would probably help in that regard unless it dramatically changes and spikes up. We are focused on, for all of the efficiencies that we plan on taking, the continued focus on price, the diverse opportunities that still will present themselves. We are focused on still improving the operating ratio year-over-year.","Brandon Oglenski","That's helpful. Eric, can you comment a little bit on grain markets? There is a big discussion that, if we have another big harvest or relatively large harvest, which I think the government is calling for right now, how much of that can we actually store if folks decide they don't want to sell into a lower commodity price environment? Or is there just not that much storage? Are we going to end up having to move the volume anyways?","Eric Butler","The outlook right now is that the yields look strong. Still relatively early in the growing season, so anything could happen from a weather standpoint. Right now, the projections are, while it may not be a record crop like the last two years, it still will be a pretty strong corn and bean crop. As you suggest, storage of crops are relatively high because US grain has not been able to compete as effectively, because there have been strong world grain crops and the strong US dollar. So there is a speculation that says if it is a strong crop, there will have to have the current products or the crop move, and so that would be a positive for us in the second half of the year. You know, there's always uncertainty in our markets, but that is one of the scenarios that could be positive for the transportation system.","Operator","Next question is coming from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein research.","David Vernon","Rob, with the weather events that we had this year being a lot worse than last year, is there any estimate for the costs that you may be incurred this quarter that wouldn't be there if weather would have been a little more favorable, or is that too hard to call?","Rob Knight","I think it's just too hard to call, David, to be honest. It would be rolled up in those inefficiencies that I called out.","David Vernon","From a mix perspective, the revenue tonne mile was - tonne miles were down 14% relative to the car load decline of mid-single digit. Where in the business, Eric, do you see the biggest negative mix on the length of haul right now?","Eric Butler","As Rob said there's a lot of ins and outs in terms of mix, and we actually have had ins and outs in terms of mix across the business line. Coal certainly is a negative mix item, as you might imagine, but we have grown our intermodal business, which is a longer haul, so that would be positive. There's always lots of ins and outs.","David Vernon","Is the fall off in Frac sand, for example - were those sort of longer length of haul than your average industrial product shipment?","Eric Butler","Frac sand is right around the average length of haul for industrial products. Certainly the fall off from that has had a revenue mix impact, as Rob talked about.","David Vernon","Alright. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz, with UBS. Please go ahead with your questions.","Tom Wadewitz","Good morning. I wanted to ask you about volumes in second half, and I know that, you know it's a directional question. I know it's hard to have tons of granularity on this stuff, but volumes are down 6% year-over-year in second quarter. I think the comparison's maybe just a touch easier in third. The way we should look at this is less worse year-over-year in third quarter. Is that a pretty reasonable assumption? When you look at fourth quarter, a little bit less worse? And how would you - any broad comments on just thinking about modeling volumes, year over year, third quarter and fourth quarter?","Lance Fritz","Before I let Rob speak to it in perhaps more detail, the way we're thinking about volumes in the second half, and we said it is - We're expecting a normal seasonal pattern, so seasonally, we see a peak in the second half and the third quarter. But there's a lot of reason for to us think that it's a muted peak. So I think that's sequentially better, but there's head winds against the year-over-year. Rob?","Rob Knight","I would just reiterate what we said earlier. And that is, we expect them to be down somewhat in the back half. We're not giving quarterly guidance on the volume, but the thing I would just point out is that I'd like to think that the sequential improvement that we're starting to see that Eric pointed out in coal will help in that third quarter year-over-year look. Then the fourth quarter is a little more of a challenge for us. So we're not calling it. But we're certainly focused and hopeful that things from a year-over-year perspective don't look like a 6% down kind of number, but we're not giving precise guidance on that.","Tom Wadewitz","That's good. I appreciate the comments. Then the follow-up question, on the expenses. Obviously, there's a lag on some of these items, so I suppose training expense and maybe in some of your materials expense and some others. How would I look sequentially at some of these categories where you have seen improvement. You know, if I look at purchased services, you are down quite a bit sequentially. Is that down more in third quarter versus second? Another category, rents was kind of flat sequentially. Are some of those categories down more in absolute terms in third quarter versus second?","Lance Fritz","Rob?","Tom Wadewitz","Thank you.","Rob Knight","This probably won't shock you, but you're going to stump me in terms of trying to get into individual expense categories. But I would just say that all of the categories are stones that we are uncovering and looking for opportunities. Labor, of course, shows up across the board, and that I would say, as a large position, is what we're really focused on. That might show up of course in multiple expense categories. As I pointed out, remember we took the $100 million of inefficiency or misalignment in the first quarter down to let's call it $50 million-ish in the second quarter, and we're focused on going after that $50 million, and then some. Our focus is to not just stop there, but continue to achieve as efficient of operations as we possibly can, matching against demand. So long answer to your short question, but would I say it's across the board that we are going to expect ourselves to make improvements.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors, with Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your question.","Bascome Majors","Yes, thanks for taking my question here. So clearly, there were a lot of volatility and low visibility in the second quarter relative to where you thought you were in earning the quarter from a demand perspective. I'm curious, now versus two or three months ago, what's your sense from your customers? Are they seeing more stability and low visibility? Is there any conviction that things have stabilized on top of the comments you made on coal earlier?","Lance Fritz","Let me start with that, and then we'll get it to the expert in Eric. When you look at our top line, the story that we talked about in the first quarter really is the same in the second quarter, just more acute. That is there are areas of the economy that feel pretty stable and pretty good. It's reflected in the consumer side of the economy and specifically in things like our automotive shipments in the domestic intermodal product, a couple of things like that. This acute impact in the energy side of our business, specifically coal and shale energy-related product, is largely driving that top line problem. Eric?","Eric Butler","That's right. I'm not sure there's much to add, but the economy feels pretty good. Most of the macroeconomic indicators are going in the right direction. You know them as well as I do, and we're seeing that in our business. The issue we have is a significant shortfall on coal driven by natural gas, mild weather, and some episodic issues with some large customers of ours. And, frankly, the falloff in our share-related business. But aside from that, the economic indicators and the economy - customers are feeling pretty good. Trend's already up the correct direction.","Bascome Majors","Thank you for that. If I could just get one more in on the margin front. You mentioned that the headwinds from operational inefficiencies were about a point less in 2Q versus 1Q. But if I net out the impact of fuel surcharge, you'd have to go back quite a ways to see the net year-over-year margin decline as steep as you saw this quarter. As we try to directionally understand the drivers here. Can you rank order; mix, demand related, and simply a function of what the marketplace is giving you, versus you know, whether it's a timing lag between the shifts you've seen in the marketplace, and you have addressed the resource resizing already, to some extent? How significant is the net fuel headwind for the year that you alluded to in your prepared remarks earlier?","Lance Fritz","So Rob, you want to take this one?","Rob Knight","Let me try to answer that simply by saying they're all contributors, and they're all challenges that we deal with in our delay daily lives. But I would say, if you look at the second quarter, the biggest hit, if you would, would start with volume driven by coal. Second on the list is the mix impact, which obviously is impacted by the coal fall-off as well. But the mix impact of changing within our business mix, the sand, etcetera; the grains, etcetera, those would be the big drivers.","Lance Fritz","What's part disappointing and part encouraging - and Cameron walked us through this. We had areas of real productivity improvement that our team drove, both the commercial and the operating team, from the standpoint of train size improvement to near record levels on almost every product. Continued improvement, and switching efficiency, and it was overwhelmed by this mismatch, this imbalance in resources. We're aggressively going after that, we'll get that right.","Bascome Majors","Thanks for that color. I really appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Clearly a lot going on in the volume aspect. I wanted to talk more about the regulatory front, where there's also a lot going on. I got two transportation spending bills in congress. When you look in the senate version, which may or may not make it, there's actually a whole lot of stuff about rail, PTC, hazardous materials, recording devices, etcetera. So with that and the recent challenge put on the - [Technical Difficulty] standards - if you could give us a high level view - [Technical Difficulty] it's always there; that's always something to look at and be cognizant of, but anything that you are especially focused on for the remainder of the 2015 into next year?","Lance Fritz","Brian, you broke up a little bit when you were asking the detail of your question. Let me tell you what I think I heard and you tell me if that's right. You are asking, broadly, there's a lot going on in the regulatory environment, and what do we see coming out of that in the rest of the year and next year?","Brian Ossenbeck","Yes that's good. Thanks.","Lance Fritz","Okay. Our first primary focus in Washington is an extension on positive train control, or PTC. We've been crystal clear with our regulators and elected officials that we need that, that Union Pacific is not going to make the deadline. There is really no railroad that will make that deadline. The industry needs an extension. I believe everybody understands that. It looks like there's an opportunity to have that happen as maybe part of a highway bill or some other vehicle. The hard part of that is we've got to start making plans in case a PTC extension does not occur. And we'll then have to start communicating to our affected customers and commuter agencies what those plans are and what the timing is. That probably starts up sometime in September. There is a bit of a clock ticking on that.","The second thing we're focused on intently is HAZMAT regulation, as you pointed out. We are in that dialogue. We think the regulation as published by the DOT has a couple of flaws. More broadly, we're very supportive of a new tank car standard. We've been asking for it, both as a company and as an industry for years. We are working diligently to get that standard right, to make it more safe than it currently is. The last thing we're working pretty hard on is different issues in front of the STB which is our commercial regulator. We're active in that dialogue, and trying to navigate that for the best of our company.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay, thanks. That was a good overview. Hopefully I've found a better spot for cell signal for the quick follow-up. I was wondering with all of the stuff going on with coal, as you look into next year, anything - this is another regulatory question, with the Mets ruling being kicked down to the circuit court by the Supreme Court a couple of weeks ago. Do you think that - one, every really had any impact in your service area. And two, if it did, you see any potential benefit from that rule being thrown back for reconsideration.","Lance Fritz","I'm going to let Eric answer that specific question on coal emissions regulation. I'll just start with a broad statement. We believe coal needs to continue to be a robust part of electricity generation in the United States. It's low cost, it's abundant, and it can be clean in terms of its emissions. That's very important for the US economy and for the US manufactures to be competitive on a global scale. Eric?","Eric Butler","In terms of the specific question, we don't think that the - while we applaud the ruling, we don't think it's going to have a significant impact. Either entities were already planning for it and\/or they might still plan for it just because they don't know what might happen on the inevitable appeal that will occur. Or it wasn't going to have a significant issue anyway. So the fact that it was remanded, I don't think is going to have a significant impact one way or the other.","Brian Ossenbeck","Alright, Lance and Eric, thank you for your time.","Lance Fritz","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","Bill Greene","Hi, good morning. Lance and Rob, I want to just explore a little bit the relationship between OR and the coal franchise. As you know, a lot of investors think of coal as being highly profitable. If coal weren't to come back, or even to go down further from here - in a longer term sense, like a secular decline, does it impede your ability to achieve your long term OR? Or do you feel like productivity and price alone can allow you to achieve that, even if the coal franchise ends up much smaller than it is today?","Lance Fritz","I'll let Rob answer more specifically. I'll give you an overarching reaction, and that is, there are lots of puts and takes in our business, over the long term. Our franchise is such that we've always been able to find growth opportunities and take advantage of them, and I'll remind you that our overall business strategy is predicated on an industry best - a demonstrably better service product and pricing for that value. Along with productivity, all of that tells me I am confident in our long-term OR guidance. Rob?","Rob Knight","I would reiterate what you just said. First of all, we're not calling for the death of coal as a business unit for us. We're experiencing a bit of a hiccup here. But I would say first of all, obviously that size of a business is a positive contributor to our OR. As it shrinks or any business shrinks, we have, as we've talked and as you know, we have a lot of diverse opportunities in front of us that give us a lot of confidence. That's what keeps us as confident as ever that we could still meet our long-term OR guidance. If we were to see it take a step down, any business unit take a step down, we would have to do the things that we have done over the last decade. That is right size our organization and make sure we are being smart about adjusting our costs accordingly so that we can continue to make progress on our financial results.","Bill Greene","Okay, fair enough. A follow-up question is on the dollar. A lot of investors sort of ask me about whether rails were really sort of pseudo commodity plays, and a weak dollar effectively caused a lot of stuff in North America to move, not just sort of by rail, but a broader industrial implication. So do you feel like a strong dollar impedes your ability to get the car loads back to let's say over $180,000 a week? Is this sort of a real risk factor that we need to keep in mind when we think about longer term volumes?","Eric Butler","I don't think so. You know, certainly as you know, when you have strong currency moves one way or the other, it could affect commodity flows. We see that in all of our commodity markets. But long term, North America is still kind of a strong, productive, secure, relatively low cost place of production. It's also a huge consumption market. Those things will continue to drive us being in the sweet spot for our transportation services, whether it's export or import. Long term, it doesn't move the needle.","Bill Greene","Thanks for the time.","Operator","Our next question is with Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.","Rob Salmon","If I could shift it back to the core pricing, I was a little bit surprised that it actually was stable, sequentially, at that up 4% with half a point coming from the legacy, with weaker coal volumes. Robert, could you talk more about what drove that? I would have thought with less coal, it would have been a head wind to core pricing. So any additional color, if it's coming from the 2016 renewal that you got a little bit more of a benefit this quarter, and you are just getting stronger pricing across the franchise?","Lance Fritz","I'm going to throw it to Eric, but I'm very proud of the team for their results in the second quarter and a very difficult environment. The effectively priced for the value of the product, and that was a good outcome.","Eric Butler","Rob can talk about the legacy impact. But, we are doing what we said. We have a value product, and we're pricing for it.","Rob Knight","Specifically to the legacy question, I would say that was comparable to what we saw in the first quarter, where we said about a half point of the four was legacy, roughly. But you are also pointing out, and again, I'm as confident as Lance and Eric, and pleased with that performance. I think it shows that we're getting value in the marketplace. As you are also pointing out, and just to reiterate for others, the way we calculate our core price is if it doesn't move, we don't count it. We're hopeful that if and when coal resumes, some of the volume pick up, that some of those repriced contracts will be positive contributors to our margins as we move forward.","Rob Salmon","Rob, can you give us a sense, had coal either been flat or the decline in line with Q1 in terms of overall car loads, what core pricing would have looked like, this past quarter?","Rob Knight","I really can't give you that size. And there's a big mix even within the coal line. I'm not giving that level of specificity, but suffice it to say there was some value left there by not moving it.","Rob Salmon","Fair enough. Appreciate the time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company.","Jason Seidl","Good morning. I want to talk a little bit about the intermodal franchise. Can you focus on, going forward, just how much you think the competition has increased from the truckload side, as some capacity has crept back into the marketplace? And also longer term, given the issues that the west coast ports have had, do you feel there's a chance that the west coast could lose some permanent market share to the east coast?","Eric Butler","Jason, in terms of the first question, clearly lower fuel prices will incrementally, nominally make truckers more competitive, and clearly as the shale play has gone down, there appears to be what we think is a temporary alleviation with some of the driver shortages or a temporary reduction, I should say. There still are long-term driver shortages out there, but some of the move of labor from that to truck drivers has alleviated some of the shortage. So trucks continue to be a competitive option. I would point out in the second quarter, we set, again, another all-time domestic intermodal record. Our volumes set another record. We continue to see huge conversion opportunities, and we think as we have the service, value proposition, we'll continue to be able to penetrate and take advantage of that.","In terms of the west coast port, clearly that had an impact. Certainly in the first quarter and the second quarter, as some of the backlogs were cleaned up, that had a positive impact. But as we said, we had a tough comp year-over-year because of the free shipping that occurred the previous year. I think one of the things that are instructive is kind of the spread rates, the ocean spread rates between east coast and west coast. The east coast ocean rates have actually increased about $250 on a spot basis over the last couple of months, which basically is making the west coast ports even more competitive than what they were before the strikes.","So we think that there's some risk that there might be some nominal temporary rerouting as a supply chain risk management approach. I think there's some surveys out there that says companies might move 5% of the supply chain, risk management. We're not really seeing that, and we still think the west coast ports have an economic and a time value for product going pretty deep into the east.","Jason Seidl","Thank you for the details. For a follow up, Rob, maybe this is for you. Looking at all of the puts and takes in 2Q and looking forward, barring any other volume, unexpected volume shocks, do you view 2Q as sort of the low water mark for your margins?","Rob Knight","There's a lot of moving parts. I would answer that by saying we're focused on making that statement true. Of course we're going to go after, and we are making progress as we pointed out, the inefficiency misalignment, but what we'll have to wait and see is exactly how the volumes play out, and all those variables and what fuel does, et cetera. But, I'd like to believe that that statement will become true.","Jason Seidl","Okay, fair enough. Gentlemen, thank you for your time as always.","Operator","Our next question is from Tom Kim, with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Tom Kim","With regard to domestic coal, were you impacted at all by coal fire utility plant retirements in the second quarter? Then also, if Nat gases remain stable, would you expect any further coal-to-gas switching for the second half of the year?","Eric Butler","There's no impact from coal plant retirements. There's still significant surplus capacity. Both coal and other sources. So there was no impact on the retirement. We do not expect significant incremental switching. I think all of that can switch is switching, given current natural gas pricing.","Tom Kim","That's helpful. Then just on the intermodal yields. Can you talk about what drove the sequential Q-and-Q and then year-on-year deterioration in your average intermodal ARPU's?","Lance Fritz","ARC. Intermodal ARC.","Tom Kim","Yes.","Eric Butler","As for all of our businesses in the second quarter, the ARC was really dominated by the fuel surcharge reduction.","Rob Knight","I would also say, Tom, and mix - mix within each commodity group can also show up in there. There was no other marquee driver of that change.","Tom Kim","Okay. So no change of length of haul, or anything like that. Just mostly that surcharge part.","Eric Butler","Right.","Tom Kim","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.","Justin Long","Thanks, and good morning.","Lance Fritz","Good morning.","Justin Long","With your coal volumes down substantially right now, I was curious, does that change your approach to pricing in your non-coal businesses? In other words, do you have the thought process that non-coal pricing now needs to move higher to maintain the return profile of the consolidated business, or do you view the pricing dynamics between coal and non-coal completely separately?","Lance Fritz","I'm going to let Eric answer in more detail but our team prices every single move on the value of that move to the customer. Eric?","Eric Butler","Nothing else, that's it.","Justin Long","As a follow up, as we look into next year, if coal does continue to weaken and you are losing that high margin business, how are you thinking about where CapEx as a percentage of revenue needs to go in order to maintain or improve the current return profile of the business?","Rob Knight","This is Rob. As you know, the long-term guidance that we've given on our capital spending is in that 16% to 17% of revenue, and we're not calling for the fall off or significant further declination in coal. But, if it did, we would - as we always do with our costs, we would right size. I would also just point out, your question reminds me that, given what we're seeing this year, we expect that metric of capital spending versus revenue to be a little bit higher this year, given what we're seeing in this fall off. But if you look longer term, we would right size the organization both from an OE and from a capital standpoint. But, that's not the guidance I'm giving, because that's not where we are at this point in time. But we would take those steps.","Lance Fritz","Something else to keep in mind, Justin, is we've got plenty of capital capacity already built for the coal network. It's not really driving CapEx today.","Justin Long","Thanks. Appreciate the time today.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham research group. Please go ahead with your questions.","Jeff Kauffman","Thank you very much. You know, a lot of my questions have been asked, but let me come back to the capital question. Just given the realignment of resources, how are your capital priorities changing, ex-PTC?","Lance Fritz","Ex-PTC, we do our capital planning in a similar fashion year after year after year. We take a long term view of what we think markets are going to look like; we see how that lays in the existing network; we find where the hot spots exist from the standpoint of line of road constraint or terminal constraint, and then we target capital on that. There is a little bit of capital that gets spent on things like a specific project or a specific piece of business development, and then of course, there is a very large piece of capital that gets spent on consuming the existing network and maintaining it. And of course, that's driven by volumes and consumption. Cameron, is there - what else do you want to add to that?","Cameron Scott","I think you covered it all, Lance. Our focus continues to be on the southern region with a lot of our capacity CapEx. That's being driven by Eric's forecast.","Jeff Kauffman","Alright. A little follow-up to that. An unusual outage on the I-10 freight corridor, with the rains in Southern California. Is this an opportunity for the intermodal franchise? Is this forcing a lot of trucking capacity from LA to Phoenix to find alternatives?","Eric Butler","That is one of our franchise corridors, as you know. It has been. We've invested in that corridor over time. We are growing, and will continue to grow. The temporary flooding that is happening out there because of the rains - As you know, trucks always have lots of ways to reroute. So there would be no significant incremental impact due to that. That is an area and a market that we're going after with our franchise. We have and we'll continue.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay. Thanks so much.","Eric Butler","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne, with TD Securities. Please go ahead with your questions.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thanks very much, and good morning. Most of my questions have been asked. I was just curious, in terms of the resource imbalance, can you just give a bit of color as to how much of that is head count, and how much is locomotives and other equipment?","Lance Fritz","Yes, so, we are balancing locomotives real-time to match the transportation plan, which matches what demand is telling us. So local motives from a storage count are very close to being about the right size. Right now, we have something like 900 locomotives in storage. The head count issue, again, is a little bit part capital, which is all about whatever our capital plan is, and part we have too many in the training pipeline, and too many kind of coming out of the training pipeline. That furlough count, which, I think we said was about 1200 at the end of the quarter. You know, depending on what happens with attrition and demand, that will continue to ebb and flow. Right now, it's growing. So we can make the fungible side of headcount, the individuals that are actually working and productive match real-time. It's the mechanism to get qualified trained employees that are taking us a little bit more time to get right.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Okay, that's helpful. That's all for me, thank you.","Eric Butler","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please go ahead with your questions.","John Larkin","Thanks, gentlemen, for taking my question. I wanted to bore into intermodal a little bit more, one of your shining stars in the quarter, volume wise. The truckload carriers on the contract side of their business, at least, are getting in quite a few cases 6%, 6.5% yield improvement, and anecdotally, I've heard from a number of mostly privately held IMC's that you all are putting in some pretty aggressive price actions also, that would in theory still maintain that cost advantage, vis-a-vis, truckload. The pricing is obscured by that fuel surcharge that Eric talked about a minute ago, which depresses the ARC. Can you talk a little bit about whether this is one of your strong initiatives on pricing, and whether you are really getting a lot of follow through with that, or pushback from customers and whether that has moved the profitability of intermodal so that it is on par with the other commodity groups?","Eric Butler","No customer ever wants to take a price increase. They are always very tough discussions. We are taking market price increases across our book of business, every segment of our business, based on our value proposition. And we're going to continue to do that.","John Larkin","Are the price increases in the vicinity of what the truckload carriers are getting, or are you not going to share that with us?","Eric Butler","We reported the 4% core price increase, and we're focused on getting appropriate price increases.","Rob Knight","You know we don't break it out by individual commodity group, but as Eric and the team - they are laser focused on improving the profitability in the intermodal group, as they are across the board. We're going to continue to do that.","John Larkin","As a follow on, can you talk a little about intermodal service, which had a lot of hiccups in 2014 due to weather congestion in Chicago, growth in the new energy markets, at least. How is intermodal service tracking this year, and when would you expect it to be back at, say, 2012 or early 2013 levels? Once it reaches that level, do you think there's some latent demand out there that will come back onto the railroad once you have more of a truckload-like service product.","Cameron Scott","Our first OS - that's our on-time origin departure for intermodal product, continues to increase. We're not quite back to 2013 or 2012 levels, but we're making very good progress. Particularly in Los Angeles and in Chicago. Over the road performance, we're still looking, as you can tell by our AAR velocity metric. We're still looking for a mile an hour. We're properly resourced, we've got great initiatives to go find that mile an hour and deliver it. We just don't have a stake in the ground as to when that will be achieved. We expect to make that improvement throughout the course of the year.","Eric Butler","I would say, our goal was to be the best. So, we're clearly not satisfied with where our service is, and we're going to focus where Cam and his team, my team, we're working on. How do we improve the overall customer experience? And it's an intense focus, and I think as we go into the future, our goal is continuous improvement to improve what we take to the market.","John Larkin","Thanks very much.","Eric Butler","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura Asset Management. Please go ahead with your question.","Matt Troy","Just given the time of year typically from an accounting perspective, people revisit incentive comp and stock based accruals in second and fourth quarter. I was wondering, on a run rate basis, was that a help during the quarter, as we've seen at other railroads, as everyone struggled with the lower volume environment and stock prices, which have declined. If not, when might we expect, in light of the guidance for the lack of earnings growth this year, that that might flow through and help the comp line? I just want to make sure we avoid some of the lumpiness we've seen in other railroads.","Rob Knight","I would say that it's a little bit in the second quarter. I'm not calling out or guiding that you are going to see anything lumpy in our numbers. I would say there was a little bit of an impact that showed up actually in our second quarter.","Matt Troy","The second piece would be to revisit it in the fourth quarter? Is that typically how it runs? Or how does it go?","Rob Knight","Yes, we always look at - each quarter, we look at what is the performance? So we'll stay tuned in terms of what impact that has in the back half. I don't envision it being lumpy, as you are citing.","Matt Troy","Okay. And my follow-up - thank you for that, Rob. In light of the $0.01 rally in natural gas today, could you just refresh us, in terms of the switching friction or switching capability of your utility customers? Obviously there's not a singular point or price in Nat gas, let's say, $3.50, where everyone just cuts back. It's more gradated than that. Just wondering if we buck the consensus that gas is going to stay low, and vision or dream that one day gas prices might start to march north? Could you just help us understand what is the band at which people begin to contemplate going back to coal, and where coal might take some share back on the grid, relative to your customer base?","Eric Butler","Matt, as you say it is a wide continuum. There are probably utilities that Coal looks favorable as low as $3, some $3.50, some $4. It is a wide continuum.","Operator","Our next question is from Cleo Zagrean, with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your questions.","Cleo Zagrean","Good morning and thank you. I will follow up on prior questions in terms of pricing for coal and intermodal. Could you help us explain if maybe fuel is a better headwind such that, overall in terms of coal price, performance was close to the average of 4% for the company? Any insight you could help us with would be appreciated.","Rob Knight","This is Rob. Let me reiterate that we don't break it out, what pricing we're actually getting within each commodity group. But I would just point out that, to your point on the impact that fuel might have had, we have some 60-plus different fuel surcharge mechanisms. So they do vary from group to group, and the timing of those can be different, and can impact from quarter to quarter what the recorded ARC number looks at. Again, our overall pricing success was 4% core price. We're confident that we're doing all of the right things in all of the commodity groups to improve that.","Cleo Zagrean","Okay. Then my follow-up relates to the outlook for coal and your network, longer term. You were saying that it's tough to adjust the network from one quarter to the next, understandably so. But, are you seeing any significant challenges to coal volumes from upcoming gas capacities in 2017, 2018? And since you would have time to prepare for that, how can you adjust the networks to mitigate that potential negative impact? And you are saying also the diversity of the franchise allows for your long-term goals to be maintained. What would be the one main positive offset to a decline? So a continued secular decline in coal? Thank you.","Eric Butler","As we said before, the big factors for coal, again, will be the cost of natural gas and weather. Today, there is surplus capacity on coal; there's surplus capacity on natural gas, today. The capacity isn't really as much as a driver as it is the point at which one dispatches versus another. It's different for different utilities. Again, I think $3 to $4 depending on utilities is probably the range that most utilities see today.","Cleo Zagrean","Okay. So you're not seeing the need to significantly adjust resources longer term on account of what you see in coal?","Lance Fritz","We are adjusting our resources constantly to match both what near-term demand looks like and what we think long-term demand looks like. We'll make those adjustments as the marketplace dictates.","Cleo Zagrean","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Ben Hartford, with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.","Ben Hartford","Thanks. Quick question, Eric. If I look within industrial products and the 35% of the volume that is construction, what is the split between res and non-res construction within that? Do you know?","Eric Butler","Yes, so I don't have it, in terms of the overall construction number. If you want to just split out lumber, historically, lumber was two-thirds, one-third. Right now, it's probably closer to half to half. But again, housing starts are improving sequentially. The housing start number for June just came up that was significantly improved, I think 10% improved over the previous month. There's still more multi-family than single family, but the split here recently has probably been more 60%-40% versus 65%-35% or 55%-45%.","Ben Hartford","So if I look at the 5% volume contraction within construction, can you help me rectify that in the context of some of the improvement that we have seen, as it relates to housing starts recently?","Eric Butler","As I said in my prepared comments, the majority of that was in our rock and our cement, most of which goes on the commercial side. That was really weather-related. The demand is really, really strong. We're seeing that sequentially here, even in the recent weeks. The second quarter there were some heavy rains that impacted the volumes that we saw.","Ben Hartford","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Barnes with RBC. Please go ahead with your questions.","John Barnes","Hey, on the resource side, is there anything in the labor contracts that prevents you from right sizing the labor force faster or more aggressively than what you've done already? And are there any prohibitions about shifting that labor around to spots where it might be in more need?","Lance Fritz","So I'm going to start and then I'll pass it to Cam. The short answer is, not really. Our collective bargaining agreements dictate things like rates of pay, what exactly the work needs to look like. Some work environment issues. Typically doesn't have much headwind to us when it comes to right sizing. When we talk about, again, having the training pipeline fatter, if you will, than it was second quarter last year, that's about us making decisions about continuing to train, because we will graduate them into work either immediately or in the near term, and it would be just more disruptive and more costly to take them out of training, and then start over again from scratch two or three or four months from now. Cam?","Cameron Scott","I think you answered that perfectly. There is great flexibility, to answer your second question, on flexing appropriate resources to the network as required. So no issue, there.","John Barnes","To go back to the intermodal question earlier. If I go back to my notes on your last analyst meeting, you were already talking about the potential for a couple of more percentage points of market share movement from the west coast to the east coast. I understand what you are saying about ocean shipping rates and that kind of thing, but the ILA is already out talking about doing a ten-year labor deal in order to provide, you know, labor certainty to the east coast ports, where the west coast laborer contract is a year shorter, still leaves some very large issues like the Cadillac tax out there, left unnegotiated as of yet. Is there any concern that the severity of the downturn this last time has more permanently impaired the west coast ability to attract that volume back, and is some of that volume shift we've seen more permanent than maybe you would originally have expected it to be?","Eric Butler","Yes, so it's always a concern. It's in our franchise interest to have the proportion of business go through the west coast. So that's always something we look at. At the end of the day, we do believe economics win out, and today and we believe in the future, unless there's some substantial change, a difference between east coast, west coast. Today, the west coast option is the economically better option to go deep into the east. We've historically said that the Appalachian mountain chain was a crossover point. Things west of that, typically it's clear. The west coast is a better economic option. Things east of that, the east coast is a better competitor. You know, we'll always look at that. We do not believe anything substantial or significant has changed economically from the historical equation. There may be some minor adjustments for supply chain risk management issues in the short term, but we're not seeing anything significant or sustainable.","John Barnes","Okay. All right. Just a follow up on that. If there's any pressure on your international intermodal volumes, are you in a position to more aggressively grow the domestic intermodal piece as a means of offsetting any of that weakness? Thanks for your time.","Eric Butler","I'm not sure I would connect the two. The domestic market is where we have been growing. I mean, if you look at it, the international market has been - has had a much smaller slope. The domestic market shares huge truck conversion. You're still going to have a huge investment needed for highways. You can talk about we're not really investing in the highway trust fund. You can talk to getting agreement. You can talk about the driver shortages. You can talk about the economic and the environmental benefit of intermodal versus over-the-road trucks. It's a story that we've been talking about for the last half dozen years. We still think that there's a growth opportunity story, there, on the domestic intermodal side. Again, the second quarter was an all-time record for us on the domestic intermodal side. We think that on a volume basis, we think that there is still opportunities.","John Barnes","Okay. Thanks for your time.","Eric Butler","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker, with Morningstar. Please go ahead with your questions.","Keith Schoonmaker","I'd like to ask about a sector I believe there is a little more cause for optimism. And Chemicals are material high ARC segments in the franchise. Excluding crude, I think some classes of chemical carloads do nicely, maybe even double digits in the period. So while natural gas hurts coal, but could you look a little further out, comment on the flip side of cheap natural gas and share some of your expectations for chemical product manufacturing development?","Eric Butler","We've talked in the past, and continue to talk about the huge plastic expansion that we're going to see in this country with the low natural gas prices. We think that you are going to see it even with natural gas going up to as much as $5 - $4.50, $5, we think that's still the sweet spot for the expansion that's happening in the Gulf. We have a great franchise. It's a franchise strength of ours to take advantage of it. There's billion, multi-billion dollars of investments going on. And, I think we've said publicly that we think we'll see the benefit of a lot of that starting in 2017 and 2018. But we think that is a franchise strength of ours.","Keith Schoonmaker","I'd like to ask a question about operations, on the subject of right-sizing the locomotive fleet. Could you discuss how you think about the value of removing one locomotive from the fleet? Are most of these removed assets going to surge capacity storage rather than being sold or divested, or do they show up in lower lease expense? So just the value of removing a single locomotive, please?","Rob Knight","This is Rob. Let me jump in. If Cam wants to add, he certainly can. Keith, I'm not going to break that out, but I would just say that, of course, when we get a new locomotive and we have an opportunity to put another locomotive in storage, or just through efficient operations we have an opportunity to put a unit in storage, we're putting the least efficient of the fleet in. We're always looking at - are there opportunities? For the most part, those go into our storage, and they are there, available for surge. Where there are opportunities for us to discontinue an existing lease or something, we'll do that, but that's not a big driver at this point in time. I think it's safe to assume that, as we free up a locomotive, it's going to be our least efficient from a fuel standpoint, from a maintenance standpoint, and from a DPU standpoint, that goes into that surge category.","Cameron Scott","There's an aggregate benefit, that the fewer locomotives we have active in the fleet, the less maintenance we have to do, in aggregate.","Keith Schoonmaker","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question and answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments.","Lance Fritz","Thank you all for your questions and your interest in Union Pacific today.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz, you may begin.","Lance Fritz","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everybody. And welcome to Union Pacific's first quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Jim Vena, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, Union Pacific is reporting record 2019 first quarter net income of $1.4 billion or $1.93 per share. This represents an increase of 6% in net income and 15% in earnings per share compared to 2018. Total volume decreased 2% in the quarter compared to last year.","Quarterly operating ratio came in at 63.6%, a 1 point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2018. Severe winter weather and flooding across our network adversely impacted volumes and added incremental operating costs in the quarter.","In spite of these headwinds, we still achieved year-over-year margin improvement as a result of our G55 and Zero and Unified Plan 2020 efforts. I am extremely proud of the men and women of Union Pacific and applaud their heroic efforts to safely restore our rail network.","Our ability to quickly recover operations after severing the east-west artery of our network is unprecedented. I also want to thank our customers for working with us during these historic weather challenges. With these incidents behind us, our operating performance is rapidly improving, enabling us to provide a safe, reliable, and efficient service product for our customers.","We've largely completed our initial transportation plan changes associated with Unified Plan 2020 and well ahead of schedule. But these changes are really just a foundation for the great opportunities we see going forward like our terminal rationalization initiative that Jim will touch in later.","With that, I'll turn it over to Kenny to provide more details on our results.","Kenny Rocker","Thank you, Lance, and good morning. For the first quarter, our volume was down 2%, largely driven by weather related hurdles. Volume decline in our energy and ag business groups, with a partial offset in industrial and the premium. However, we still generated positive net core pricing of 2.75% in the quarter. Freight revenue was down 2%, driven by a decrease in volume as average revenue per car was essentially flat.","Let's take a closer look at the performance of each business group. Starting with Ag Products, revenue for the quarter was down 3% on a 7% decrease in volume and a 5% improvement in average revenue per car. Grain carloads were down 7%, driven by reduced grain exports to China.","This was partially offset by strength in feed grain shipments to our southern region. Volume for grain products was down 6%, predominantly due to weather-related challenges impacting soybean and ethanol shipments.","Partially offsetting these declines was the same demand for biofuels and other related products. And lastly, food and beverage volumes were down 10% driven by a mix of weather-related impact, role [ph] reproduction changes, and the foreign policy effects on dry foods and export proteins.","Moving on to Energy. Revenue was down 16%, as volume declined 15%, coupled with a 2% decrease in average revenue per car. Coal and coke volume was down 14%, driven by ongoing headwind of retirements and contract changes as well as fewer shipments from the Powder River Basin due to the historic Nebraska flooding in March.","Sand carloads were down 45%, largely due to the impact of local sand within the Permian Basin. However, on a positive note, favorable crude oil price spreads drove an increase in crude oil shipments, which was the primary driver for the 18% increase in petroleum, LPG, and renewable carloads for the quarter.","Industrial revenue was up 5% on a 4% increase in volume and a 1% improvement in average revenue per car during the quarter. Construction carloads grew 12%, primarily driven by increased market demand and favorable weather conditions in the South for rock shipments. Plastics volume was up 8% due to higher production. In addition, metals volume increased by 6%, due to the continued strength in the energy, construction and manufacturing markets.","Turning to premium. Revenue for the quarter was up 3% with a 2% increase in volume, while average revenue per car remained flat. Domestic intermodal volume declined 5% during the quarter, as severe weather negatively impacted service and intermodal terminal operations.","Additionally, truck capacity and more competitive truck rates provided fewer opportunities for spot over-the-road conversions. Auto parts volume was negatively impacted by North American auto production.","International intermodal volume was up 15% in the first quarter, driven by strong volume from the tariff pull ahead earlier in the quarter, coupled with new business wins. And finally, finished vehicle shipments declined 3%, as first quarter U.S. auto sales were down approximately 3% from 2018. While light truck and SUV sales were actually up, the offset was not enough to overcome the decrease in car sales. In addition, weather impacted fluidity, creating higher inventory and reduced shipments.","Looking forward to the rest of 2019. For Ag Products, we anticipate continued strength in bio shipments due to the increase in market demand for renewable fuels, which will offset the headwinds in the ethanol marketplace.","In addition, we expect stronger beer shipments, along with long-term penetration growth across multiple segments of our food and refrigerated business. Furthermore, we expect uncertainty to persist in the grain market due to the tariff -- foreign tariffs.","For Energy, we expect favorable crude oil price spreads to drive positive results for petroleum products. Local sand supply will continue to negatively impact sand volume. We also expect coal to experience continued headwinds throughout 2019. And as always with coal, weather conditions will be a key factor for demand.","For industrial, we anticipate an increase in plastic shipments, driven largely by plant expansions coming on line later this year. In addition, we expect continued strength in industrial production, which drives growth in several commodities under this business segment.","For premium, domestic intermodal volume could be impacted by a softer truck market in 2019, which may limit the opportunities for over-to-road truck conversion. However, longer-term fundamentals still provide a bullish outlook for over-the-road conversions.","The U.S. light vehicle sales forecast for 2019 is 16.8 million units, down about 2% from 2018. Consumer preference for SUVs over sedans will continue to create some opportunity. We will continue to watch the OEMs as they implement their rationalization plans to their production plants.","And finally, for our international intermodal business, we expect volumes to normalize back to seasonal levels. As it relates to international trade, there still remains uncertainty and we will continue to watch the U.S. economy, which could also present headwinds as 2019 progresses.","So before I hand this off to Jim, I want to give a shout out to the operating and engineering teams for their tireless effort to get our network back in service from the historic weather events that we've encountered over the past several weeks.","Both our commercial and operating teams worked closely together to minimize our impact on our customers, and thanks to our customers for being patient and understanding, while we worked to restore service back as quickly and as safely as possible.","And with that I'll now turn it over to Jim.","Jim Vena","Okay. Thanks, Kenny, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to slide 11. As you heard from Lance and Kenny, our operations were challenged during the first quarter by a series of significant weather events. Heavy snowfall and harsh winter conditions in the Midwest and Pacific Northwest were followed by widespread flooding that washed out our east-west main line in Nebraska for 13 days.","In addition, our ability to reroute the 50 trains per days that normally travel in this corridor was limited due to the widespread nature of the flooding. As a result, fluidity and asset utilization were impacted as we deployed additional people and equipment to operate the railroad.","We took some bold actions this time around to help us restore operations. And while impactful to the business in the short term, these actions allowed us to quickly return to normal operations. Our terminals are current and we are moving traffic as presented. The new operating mindset of Unified Plan 2020 is clearly working and I'm extremely proud of our employees who worked safely and efficiently to restore operations.","Turning to slide 12. I'd like to now take a minute to update you on the six key performance indicators I am focusing the team on going forward. Despite the weather, nearly all of our metrics improved year-over-year. This is a testament to the work we are doing as part of Unified Plan 2020 to improve network efficiency and service reliability.","Our continued focus on asset utilization and minimizing car classifications led to a 19% improvement in freight car terminal dwell and a 7% improvement in freight car velocity compared to the first quarter of 2018. Train speed for the first quarter decreased 6% to 23.3 miles per hour as network disruptions impacted fluidity.","Turning to slide 13. We improved locomotive productivity 6% versus last year as efforts to use the fleet more efficiently enabled us to park units. As of March 31st, we had approximately 1,900 locomotives stored. And even with a 4% decrease in the total workforce, our productivity was down 2% year-over-year as daily car miles declined 6% in the quarter.","In addition to improving productivity, delivering a great service product is an equal goal of the team. Car trip plan compliance improved two points versus 2018 as customers benefited from increased freight car velocity and lower dwell. And we expect our customers to continue seeing a more reliable service product going forward. I know many of you watch our weekly dwell and velocity numbers and how we already noticed our improvement over the last few weeks.","Turning to slide 14. The last time I spoke with you I had only been on the job about 10 days. Since then I've spent a lot of time in the field getting familiar with our network and evaluating Unified Plan 2020.","As Lance mentioned, we completed our initial transportation plan changes and they are delivering good results. But I will tell you there's a lot of opportunity ahead of us to further improve asset utilization and network efficiency.","Slide 14 highlights some of the recent network changes including our initial terminal rationalization results. We stopped pumping cars at Hinkle and Pine Bluff and curtailed yard operations in Salt Lake City, the Kansas City complex and Butler Yard in Wisconsin to name a few.","And we continue to look for additional rationalization opportunities. For example, we have multiple intermodal facilities in the Chicago complex, which provides an opportunity to reduce operational complexity while improving our service.","We also decided to pause construction of Brazos Yard. The remaining capital dollars planned for Brazos in 2019 will be reallocated to siding extension on the Sunset Corridor and a block swap yard in Santa Teresa, which will add to our network flexibility. These projects directly support our productivity initiatives, which are off to a great start as illustrated by the graph on the right.","By putting more product on fewer trains, we have increased train length 7% the last couple of months and I expect to see continued improvement in this measure as the year progresses.","Turning to Slide 15 and to wrap up. It's been a very busy first 90 days for me at Union Pacific. I'm having a lot of fun, and I'm excited about what's ahead. Our network showed tremendous resiliency in the face of significant weather during the quarter and we're already seeing it in our key operating metrics.","As we move forward improving safety, efficiency and service reliability across our rail network, customers will benefit from an end-to-end service product that enables greater supply chain efficiency.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Rob Knight","Thanks Jim and good morning. Before I jump into the results, I thought I would level set everyone on some of the ins and outs that we experienced in the quarter. Unprecedented weather events negatively impacted volume growth while driving additional operating expenses. These weather challenges resulted in a 1.6 point negative impact to our operating ratio and $0.15 earnings per share compared to the first quarter of 2018, which I'll detail more in a minute.","You also saw the 8-K that we filed in March where we recognized a $42 million payroll tax refund along with $27 million of associated interest income. This refund had a 0.8 point favorable impact on the operating ratio and a $0.07 EPS tailwind in the quarter compared to last year.","The combined impact of lower fuel price and our fuel surcharge lag had a favorable impact for the quarter of 0.9 points on our operating ratio and $0.06 of EPS compared to 2018. Taken together, the positives in the quarter from fuel and the tax refund were essentially offset by the negative weather impact. The good news is that despite the weather challenges, our G55 and Zero and our Unified Plan 2020 efforts drove core operating margin improvement of about one point or $0.27 of EPS compared to the first quarter last year.","To give you a little more detail on the weather impact in the quarter, the combination of the winter storms in February and flooding in March were the primary drivers of a 2% year-over-year volume decline in the quarter or roughly $150 million. Although our car loadings are starting to rebound, we do not expect to make up much of this lost revenue with the possible exception of some opportunities in coal and grain.","We also incurred around $40 million of weather related costs in the quarter primarily in the compensation and benefits and the purchased services and materials cost categories. Given that we still have a couple of minor outages today, a small amount of cost will likely carry over into the second quarter. And finally, capital expenditures associated with the flooding are estimated to be around $30 million.","And now let's recap our first quarter results. Operating revenue was $5.4 billion in the quarter, down 2% versus last year. The primary driver was a 2% decrease in volume. Operating expense totaled $3.4 billion, down 3% from 2018. Operating income totaled $2 billion, a 1% increase from last year.","Below the line, other income was $77 million, an increase of $119 million compared to last year. The increase was driven by interest income of $27 million associated with the previously mentioned payroll tax refund and a favorable year-over-year comparison.","And as a reminder, first quarter of last year 2018 those results included a bond redemption cost of $85 million resulting in a favorable quarterly comparison. Interest expense of $247 million was up 33% compared to the previous year. This reflects the impact of higher total debt balance, partially offset by a lower effective interest rate.","Income tax expense was flat at $399 million. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 22.3%. For the full year, we now expect our annual effective tax rate to be slightly north of 23%. This is primarily driven by the benefits related to stock option exercises and a recent tax legislation in Arkansas to decrease its corporate income tax rate. And as a result of the legislation, we will decrease our deferred tax expense by $21 million in the second quarter of 2019.","Net income totaled $1.4 billion; up 6% versus last year while the outstanding share balance decreased 8% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. As I noted at the start, these results combined to produce a first quarter record earnings per share of $1.93 and a one point year-over-year improvement in the operating ratio to 63.6%.","Freight revenue of $5 billion was down 2% versus last year. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $398 million, up $45 million when compared to 2018. Business mix had a meaningful impact of negative four points on the freight revenue for the first quarter.","Decreased sand and agricultural products volumes along with an increase in lower average revenue per car intermodal shipments drove the negative change in mix. Core price was 2.75% in the first quarter, which represents one quarter of a point sequential improvement compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.","Slide 20 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense decreased 5% to $1.2 billion versus 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by the payroll tax refund that I mentioned earlier and headcount reductions, partially offset by wage inflation, employee severance costs and weather related expenses.","Total workforce levels were down 4% in the first quarter versus last year. Productivity initiatives and lower volumes enabled a 2% decrease in our TE&Y workforce while our management, engineering, mechanical workforces together declined 6%.","Fuel expense totaled $531 million, down 10% compared to last year. Lower diesel fuel prices and gallons consumed were the primary drivers of the decrease in quarterly fuel expense. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our average fuel price decreased 3% to $2.07 per gallon. Our fuel consumption rate increased about 1% during the quarter, primarily due to mix and weather impact.","Purchased services and materials expense, was down 4% compared to the first quarter of 2018, at $576 million. The primary drivers of the decrease in the quarter were reduced mechanical repair costs and less contract services and materials, partially offset by weather and derailment related expenses.","Turning to slide 21. Depreciation expense was $549 million, up 1% compared to 2018. For the full year 2019, we estimate that depreciation expense will increase about 2%.","Moving to equipment and other rents. This expense totaled $258 million in the quarter, which was down 3% when compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by lower equipment lease expense and less volume-related costs, partially offset by weather-related challenges.","Other expenses came in at $305 million, an increase of 15% versus last year. Higher casualty costs including destroyed equipment and freight loss and damage were the primary drivers of this increase. For the full year 2019, we expect other expense to be up in the 5% to 10% range compared to 2018.","Productivity savings yielded from our G55 and Zero initiatives and the Unified Plan 2020 totaled $120 million during the quarter, which was partially offset by additional costs associated with the weather and derailments. As a result, net productivity for the quarter was approximately $60 million. With these incidents behind us, we are still confident in our ability to deliver at least $500 million of productivity in 2019.","Looking at our cash flow, cash from operations for the first quarter totaled $2 billion, up about 3% when compared to last year, due primarily to higher net income. Free cash flow before dividends totaled $1.2 billion, resulting in free cash flow conversion rate equal to 84% of net income for the first quarter.","Taking a look at adjusted debt levels, the all-in adjusted debt balance totaled $27.6 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $2.5 billion since year end 2018. This includes, the $3 billion debt offering that we completed in February partially offset by repayment of debt maturities. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.6 times, up from the 2.3 times that we reported at year-end 2018. And as we have previously mentioned, our target for debt-to-EBITDA is up to 2.7 times.","Dividend payments for the first quarter totaled $626 million, up from $568 million in 2018. During the first quarter, we repurchased 18.1 million shares at a cost of $3.5 billion. This total includes the initial 11.8 million shares that we received as part of a $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we initiated in February of 2019. We expect to receive additional shares under the terms of the ASR, with final settlement to be completed prior to the end of the third quarter of this year. Between dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned $4.1 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter.","Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, our guidance for 2019 remains unchanged, which is a testament to our belief that the weather challenges of the first quarter are behind us. We expect volumes for the full year to increase in the low single-digit range. And as Kenny mentioned earlier, we should see strength in a number of business categories, along with some uncertainty in others. Our pricing strategy remains unchanged, as we continue to price our service product to the value that it represents in the marketplace, while ensuring that it generates an appropriate return.","We are confident the dollars we yield from our pricing initiatives will again well exceed our rail inflation costs in 2019. Although, our planned capital spending is shifting somewhat as a result of the reallocation that Jim walked through, the weather-related capital that I discussed, we will expect capital expenditures to still be around that $3.2 billion range for 2019. Importantly, we remain confident in our ability to achieve a sub-61% operating ratio in 2019 on a full year basis, and we still expect to be below 60% by 2020. And our commitment to reaching a 55% operating ratio beyond 2020 has never been stronger.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.","Lance Fritz","Thank you, Rob. As discussed today, we delivered record first quarter financial results driven by improved operating performance, while dealing with significant weather challenges. Unified Plan 2020 created a more resilient and robust network, allowing us to quickly return to normal operations.","For the remainder of 2019, we look to build on the momentum we had prior to the weather challenges and provide a consistent reliable service product for our customers, while at the same time improving our operating efficiency. We remain focused on increasing shareholder returns by appropriately investing capital into the railroad and returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","With that, let's open-up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So Jim, now that you've been here for more than 10 days, it looks like you've been pretty busy going back to slide 14 with the terminal rationalization and network changes. And I was just hoping if you can give us a bit more context as to what could come next, you have Chicago circled here, on the map. You've done what seems like a few hump yard closures. How many more, do you think you can close? How early in the process do you think you are when you look at redesigning service and then maybe making some of these terminal changes?","Jim Vena","Well, good morning, Brian. I appreciate the question. And I'll tell you I did not have my feet up on the desk, okay? So there's been a lot of very interesting \u2013 first of all, I wanted to make sure I understood how this network worked. It's very important to \u2013 that you don't make some big mistakes when you're out there trying to change a network. The last place I was at, I worked for 40 years. And after 40 years, you get a real good feel of the way the place is.","So this is what I've found so far. And I don't like to put a guess about what I'm going to do. But I'll tell you I think we moved very quick. We got set back with the weather that we had in end of February and the floods that were unprecedented. In fact, I've been railroading for a long time, and I'm impressed with what the team was able to do to turn this thing around and get us back to normal operation very quickly.","But \u2013 so what I'm looking at is real simple. It's \u2013 we're trying to take touch points out of the cars. We speed the cars up and you can see what we did first quarter. We rationalized the locomotives, so we don't have excess out there, and we parked a lot of locomotives and are able to handle the same traffic with substantially less. I think there's more opportunity there. We'll continue to do that.","In the terminals, we have our eye on a number of terminals that make sense for us. We'll do it through this next quarter. And as we do, we'll do them cautiously. I want to make sure I don't disrupt the service too much to our customers. And slowly, but surely we'll work through this. We're not \u2013 when I'm saying slowly, it doesn't mean that, I'm going to still be looking at the terminals. So, I've got a plan written down of which ones we're going to go after next, and we'll announce them as we do them. Hope, I answered your question, Brian.","Brian Ossenbeck","Yeah. Thanks, Jim. Just as a follow-up and I don't know, if I'm reading too much into this but on the KPIs, which I think are really quite helpful, we don't have the goals there anymore at least from what we had before. So, I just wanted to see if these are still the ones you're thinking of moving forward, if the goals are under consideration. Anything else you can provide around that would be helpful? Thanks.","Jim Vena","Brian, listen, year-end goals are important when you're trying to do some budgeting. But for me, this is the way I look at it. So let's take a look at \u2013 look more to productivity up 6%. I was going to blow by the goal real early in the year. So do we want to stop? I don't think so. The way I look at it is there's a lot more left in the locomotive productivity. I'm going to see how fast we can get to the best number that we can the least amount of locomotives to work. I think there's still some action there, and we would have blown by that end goal before the middle of summer. So for me, it's how fast what do we need to do, do it in a smart way, and we'll blow by all the goals we had setup for the end of the year.","Lance Fritz","Yeah. Let \u2013 Brian, this is Lance. So, we have not changed any of those goals that we had showed in the KPIs that we had up in the January analyst call. It's just at this point, it looks like there's upside and we're just going to move through to the upside.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. Thanks guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group","Hey, thanks. Good morning guys.","Lance Fritz","Good morning.","Scott Group","So Jim I was wondering if you can help. When we look at the service issues, is there a way you can isolate some of the weather impacts versus maybe some of the natural growing pains that we typically see with PSR? Do you think you're also having some of those?","And then maybe more specifically on headcount, can you give us any sort of directional color on how you think about headcount next quarter for the year? I think you had a 10% labor productivity target. Is that also one of the KPIs you think you could to use your term blow by?","Jim Vena","Maybe that wasn't the way best way to describe it right, Scott? So let me be more tempered. So, on the labor productivity, we see labor continuing to drop. And it'll drop through the year as we become more efficient in handling our product. So I'm not concerned about it that we don't see adding. We see dropping and will continue to drop on labor productivity.","The weather, what was interesting about the weather was just the magnitude of the place. So if you think about it, we talked about the 50 trains a day that we run on our east-west corridor. But it also went down towards Kansas City. We lost sub-divisions. And we still have one of our lines and impact on a couple of others where we're cut off rebuilding a bridge and we're still working around.","So there's still some impact today. But nice part is, is we recovered quickly. PSR or when you change things, if I wanted to, I guess, I could have come on and parked 500 locomotives first day and that would have impacted. It takes a while to grow into that. But we're doing it a little smarter. We're down the number that we need to be, but I didn't do it first day. We're doing it strategically. You shut down a hump yard like when Pine Bluff got -- was shut down as a hump operation, it does take a while.","And if I would have done three or four of them at the same time, we would have impacted more the network. So we're being smart about it. So that's what we're trying to do Scott.","Scott Group","Okay. That's helpful. And then just maybe secondly for Kenny. The last couple quarters you guys have been talking about the competitive pricing dynamic with BN, more the same. Is anything changing there? And big picture are you seeing any changes in behavior from BN?","Kenny Rocker","Yes, I don't want to get in commenting specifically about another carrier. But I'll tell you the competitive marketplace is still very strong. There's still a lot of pressure. There's a lot of pressure on the trucking side. I feel like our commercial team did an excellent job of pricing to the market. I also feel like as Jim and the operating folks get us back to the reliable service that we saw before the flood and the snow that that's an opportunity for us to price to the value.","Scott Group","Okay. Thank you guys.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Ari Rosa with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter","Hey. It's Ken Hoexter. Lance, Jim and Kenny great job showing the resilience of the network. Just Jim on the 1,900 locomotives you parked, is there a need for those to keep around for growth? Or do you go take a impairment charge on those? Can you give some thoughts on the future of your locomotive fleet?","Jim Vena","I think both answers. We're going to keep some that make sense. They're good locomotives. And if we have some excess, we're going to return some, we're going to get rid of some, but we're working through that. But Rob maybe you have a\u2026","Rob Knight","Yes. Yes, this is Rob. Yes. I mean we're going to work through that as Jim says and we'll look at it and uncover any opportunity we think we have for our locomotives as appropriate, but there's no imminent impairment charge plan here.","Ken Hoexter","Okay. And then if I can just get a follow-up on your normal sequential operating ratio improvement. Can you give thoughts on the cadence as we move through the rest of the year Rob just given the kind of some of the charges in the quarter and maybe what -- if we look at normal sequential, what you've done in the second quarter versus first, but then think about the weather? Just to try to understand your path to get to your full year targets and relationship to Jim's kind of commentary about maybe blowing by certain targets up to that point, but if you can still make up that target or if you -- there's still kind of the ability to beat those prior targets that would be helpful. Thanks Rob.","Rob Knight","Yes. Ken, I mean as you know the first quarter is generally a little bit higher operating ratio and that's traditionally true. There was a lot of ins and outs as we walked through in the first quarter. Fuel as an example was a tailwind in that we don't know exactly how that's going to play out through the balance of the year.","But to answer your question without giving specific quarterly operating ratio guidance for us to get to our confident guidance of a sub 61% that obviously implies that we're expecting to make great progress, which we all feel really good about great progress from here on out for the balance of the year.","Ken Hoexter","All right. Appreciate the insights. Great job on the snapback stuff. Thank you.","Rob Knight","Thanks Ken.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison Landry ","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask another one on the yards. So obviously you talked about the -- in addition to the two closures, can you talk about whether you have or you're expecting to convert any of the humps to flat switch?","And then any sort of sense that you could give us in helping us to try to quantify the potential or improvement or maybe if you could tell us how much of the overall initiative is baked into the $500 million?","Lance Fritz","Okay. Rob, you want to start?","Rob Knight","Let me see, if I -- I'll take the second part of that question first. And that is without -- again without giving specific numbers, I would just tell you that it is a part. I mean, these initiatives that Jim is talking about and others are all going to be critical contributors to us achieving that $500 million plus of productivity this year.","So without giving you a specific numbers, it is a part of that. And of course, as you've heard me say before, we're not going to stop at just the five -- if we get an opportunity to go to the plus, we're going to take advantage of that as these initiatives continue to play out this year.","Lance Fritz","And Allison, this is Lance. So Jim can add more technicolor. But as we've stopped humping in a place like Pine Bluff or Hinkle, we did not tear out the hump. And they do continue to switch cars. They flat switch cars right now that are meant to be there. We speak in terms of cars that are naturally meant to be in those yards. That's either because that's where they fit in the network for where they're trying to go or where they came from or they're literally local cars. So Jim you got anything else in that?","Jim Vena","Yes, listen, Allison. For me, I don't look at it as I need to shut a hump yard down. What I look at is, is how do I speed up the railcars? And as a team, how do we get more utilization of the railcars, better utilization of the locomotives, better utilization of the people? So you can see what we did in the first quarter even with the impact.","Our train size jumped up 7%. That's key. That tells us that we're moving more railcars on the same number of trains, and you can do the math, what that does on people starts.","You see an increase in locomotive productivity up 6% first quarter. And we will continue to look for opportunities. And I know there's opportunity there. So -- and we do that. We have less locomotives and it impacts the whole system on how we do it from mechanical engineering, we removed a number of trains. So we have started.","So the terminals is a subset of what we're trying to do. And maybe I'm getting too long on this, but it's real important. I don't wake up in the morning, and say, I'm going to shut down another hump yard. If they can save on the touch points, if it speeds up the railcars and if it makes sense that it's a cheaper model to shut down the hump yards. That's why Hinkle went as a hump yard. That's why Pine Bluff has gone as a hump yard. And that's why Brazos we looked at and said, we don't need it right now with the mix of traffic that we have and the efficiency we can do with the terminals we have.","That's the way I look at it. So hopefully, Allison I explained it to say, I'm not looking for the next one. Now let me finish this. Is there a next one? Yes, there is. But we'll announce it when we pull the trigger.","Allison Landry","Okay. That was really helpful. Thanks for that color. And then yesterday KCS was talking about the severe congestion issues that have plagued the Houston area. And I know historically, it's been probably an even bigger pain point for you guys, but I wanted to get your perspective on how PSR can help to improve fluidity there? And whether you think there could be an opportunity to scale back the elevated CapEx you've had to put in the region in the last several years? Thanks.","Lance Fritz ","Yes, I'll start Allison. So Houston is a very complex terminal complex. It's got a number of different class 1s operating in a ton of industry with a lot of local service attached. So to your point, I mean, historically, it's been a -- it's one of the more difficult areas of the railroad to operate reliably and efficiently.","Having said that, implementing Unified Plan 2020 down there has shown it makes a difference. We're providing more frequent local service. We're touching cars less frequently. And as a result, we're becoming more reliable in our service product.","We're a big footprint in the area, but we're not the only one and we have rely on smooth coordination with the other railroads in the area which we work on every day and are getting a little bit better at every day. Jim?","Jim Vena","Allison what I can say is, is we are current and we're very fluid in Houston. There's a lot of traffic. There's multiple railroads that operate on each other's tracks and we've got to work close to make sure that we get all the traffic as I want us all to be successful.","And it's nice that the other railroads are also looking at how they improve the efficiency of their operation. And I think we've got to work together to make sure that we've got a clean operation through Houston.","But if you take a look at what we've been able to do, we've been able to increase the productivity and the number of cars put through in our Houston complex and we have to switch from all the customers and we'll continue to look for opportunities to make a much more fluid so we turn the cars quicker.","Good number to look at is our terminal dwell which we were able to drop substantially in the first quarter from last year. You drop terminal dwell by 20% which started before I got here. So, I give a lot of credit to Tom Lischer and the whole operating group and the whole company. But at the end of it we drop that by 20% we're more fluid.","So, I think we have a solution. We've all fairly current right now and we'll work with the rest of the parties as we move ahead to make it as fluid as any other place in the railroad.","Allison Landry","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Jim Vena","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Mehrotra","Thanks operator. Hi everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Jim just a follow-up to the previous lines of questioning. Are there I guess any large quick payback types of projects that are happening today? Because there's not -- there's just not that many quarters left between now and the end of 2020 and the implied incrementals are quite heroic to get to the target in 2020. And it's obviously -- it gets incrementally harder every quarter we progress.","So, I'm just wondering if we're going to see this breakout in operating results. I know the weather was an impact in the quarter. Or is this more like a 2020 event given the types of changes you're addressing? Or some of the changes that are being implemented maybe had quicker paybacks that we could see in the next two to -- one to two quarters? Thanks.","Jim Vena","Listen if we look at it we've said that we're going to be sub-61%. So, we've got everything in place to be able to beat sub-61% and we're going to deliver it. And there's a lot of projects that we have in operations and through the whole company. It's -- this is not just an operations delivered product this is an entire company delivering leadership from the whole company.","So, I think the simple answer is we're going to deliver under 61% And I can't use that word about go buy it anymore, okay? But I'm very comfortable that we've got the right product in place operationally in the rest of the company to deliver that.","Rob Knight","Maybe if I can just chime in there. This is Rob. It is -- you obviously can tell from our results and our tone that we feel really, really good about the early innings of the implementation of the PSR the Unified Plan 2020 and G55 + 0 initiatives, et cetera in the face of the very big challenges that we faced in the first quarter with down volume.","So, if you look at the balance of the year and our guidance is that for the full year volume will be on the positive side of ledger. So, we think we're in a great position to leverage not only the great work that Jim just walked through, but the added positive volume that we are projecting for the balance of the year. The combination of that is what gets us to that sub-61%.","Amit Mehrotra","Right. Okay, that makes sense. Thank you. And then just one follow-up maybe on the other side of that question. 60% OR -- 61% are under OR is well below what obviously CSX is reporting. At what point does Union Pacific's profitability targets I guess better reflect the structural advantages of the business especially from the length of haul perspective?","Lance Fritz","Yes. Amit so first things first we're focused on executing our current goals which is sub-61% this year, sub-60% next year. Of course we're not going to stop and pause there. And we've for quite some time said we think we're capable of a 55% and we think sometime after 2020 we are more confident than ever that we're capable of a 55%.","So, without using anyone else's yardstick just looking at what we're capable of doing, we are very, very confident we're going to hit our near-term goals and then later we'll talk about other goals.","Amit Mehrotra","Any sense on when that 55% the timeframe -- I know you've been resisting on talking about it, but is it early next decade, mid-next decade, any better kind of refinement around what the time frame of that is?","Lance Fritz","Yes, Amit, let's get below 60% first and we'll talk about it.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay, I had to ask. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Kenny I guess I wanted to come back to this issue of inventory pull-forward because you guys mentioned that in your prepared remarks. Have you pulled your customer base and just thought about the idea that maybe we pull-forward a lot in 2018 early 2019 and we could see a prolonged dwell in intermodal demand throughout the summer?","Kenny Rocker","Yes, we've been talking to our customers and we do know that there's still some inventory out in the warehouses out on the West Coast. And I think the best thing is to let us get through April and into May and we'll get a little bit more clarity on that, but we are seeing some of that being worked off right now.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. Appreciate that. And then Jim I want to come back to your prepared remarks as well because I think you mentioned that you stopped capital work at the Brazos Yard, which if I'm not mistaken I think was a key tenant of the prior operating plant. So, can you talk about where you see maybe more opportunities on the capital side of the budget?","And I think Lance in the past you talked about capacity and the network being around 190,000 or 195,000 units per week. Is that still the same or should we be thinking we're unlocking a lot of potential capacity in the network here?","Lance Fritz","I'll start on capacity and I think you've got it right at the tail end in part and that is we are unlocking terminal capacity predominantly through Unified Plan 2020 and the implementation of PSR.","Having said that we've always talked about capital is put where we find constraints that keep us from executing the plan. And so there are some targeted capital areas remaining and there probably always will be where mixed shift or volume shift or how we're running a railroad tells us we can get real benefit with a rightful shot of capital.","I'll also mention at Brazos, so for a little while now, we've been talking about the implementation of UP 2020 could very well either change the way we use Brazos or change its timing.","And by unlocking capacity and touching cars fewer times around Brazos, we found that we have an opportunity to pause that capital that we don't need to increment yet in the network. So, Jim do you want to talk about where capital might be spent?","Jim Vena","Sure. One example is we have a network and we're blessed that we have a lot of capacity in areas where we can run trains to where other people have been running them and where we've been running them. So, that being able to tie in we're going to spend some money that some of the money that we reallocated from Brazos to put long sidings in between L.A. and El Paso, so we can continue to run trains at the length that we the capability that we have.","We started with a few trains that helped us on our length but we think that we hardened that capability will be later on this year. Third quarter we'll be able to really bump-up and safe train starts and run trains at the size that we have the capability of operating.","So, we're smart that not only -- I don't want to be short-term focused. I think we're building this railroad for the long-term and invest in the right places that helps us to be able to keep this railroad running efficiently two, three, four, five years down the road. Rob anything on the capital?","Rob Knight","I think you covered it.","Brandon Oglenski","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, good morning. I wanted to ask one about the train schedule. I think that UP in September announced they were moving to PSR approach and develop the three corridors and plans to rolling those out. Jim you didn't start till I think mid-January or so.","So, with the framework that a big part of PSR or a big component is reviewing and changing the schedules, it seems like a lot of that was done before you got there. So, is it possible that you have kind of another round of reviewing the schedules resetting? Or how should we look at it given a lot of the plan seem to be in place before you even got there?","Jim Vena","I think the team -- Tom, great question. The team did a great job of speeding up the railcars getting rid of some touches. I think the next step is we get to refine that. We -- when I look at the network we have trains that are operating that we have opportunities to be able to speed them up make -- to be able to start less trains so that's the next piece that we're doing.","So, great foundation built on by the entire team before I got here on January 14 and we're building on that, but lots of opportunity from what I see in how we operate our trains and yards.","Lance Fritz","And Tom, let's also be clear that Unified Plan 2020 when implemented was perceived and that's one of the reasons we brought Jim on. It's perceived to be an evergreen process. So, we -- getting Jim's perspective, his fresh eyes on that first round of implementation, we're going to find more and we'll continue to find more year after year after year. So, it's meant to be an evergreen process that continually gets fine tuned.","Kenny Rocker","And Tom, the other thing I'll add is that Jim and I our commercial teams are working together, so our envision of a more reliable product. And again, we think that will help us grow in the marketplace.","Tom Wadewitz","But just to be clear on that. So, do you think there is another significant review of this schedule, or is it more kind of tweaking things?","Lance Fritz","No, it's still significant.","Tom Wadewitz","It's still significant? Okay. Appreciate that. And a quick one for you Kenny, just on the coal and grain side, I mean, I guess, when you have the corridors is there a shot you prioritize trains typically. I would think of coal and grain being lower priority than merchandise and intermodal.","So, I mean, is there a pent-up demand for coal and grain where you have probably some -- the network starts running you can handle some more volume in those areas? Is that a reasonable thing to consider in the near-term that you might have some pent-up coal and grains to handle?","Kenny Rocker","Well, first of all, I debate you on the fact. We really appreciate the coal and the Ag business. So, I need to clarify that. It's a small upside to that and we're working with the receivers and the shippers on both sides of both the coal and the Ag side.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you for the time.","Lance Fritz","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long","Thanks and good morning. So, to start, I just wanted to clarify on the productivity target. Is the $500 million plus guidance a growth productivity number? And if so, could you share your outlook for net productivity this year?","It sounds like the $60 million of operational challenges we saw in the first quarter isn't going to zero in the second quarter, but it should be down significantly. So, I just wanted to get some more color around that.","Rob Knight","Yeah, Justin, this is Rob. That's a great question. Our $500 million plus productivity guidance goal is a net. So, we achieved $60 million in the first quarter to your point.","And yes, there will be some lingering carryover weather related cost in the second quarter, but significantly less than what we experienced in the first quarter. But that does imply for us to get $500 million plus for the full year when you consider we have only $60 million of it which was great work considering the conditions that shows our confidence and our ability to continue to make progress as the year progresses.","Justin Long","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, going back to the terminal rationalization and network changes, are you expecting this to generate any gains on sale as you look out the next couple of years? And if so, were any gains getting baked into that 2019 or 2020 OR guidance?","Lance Fritz","Hey, Justin, no gains other than normal annual gains which we talk about all the time. We always have our real estate team looking for opportunity to monetize assets, we no longer need. That's a normal flow of business. There's nothing unusual that has been baked into our guidance for 2019 and 2020. And we'll just keep evaluating our property as it makes sense.","Rob Knight","If I can just make one other comment, just a clarification. At Union Pacific, we do not count real estate sales in our operating ratio calculation.","Justin Long","Okay. That\u2019s good to clarify. Appreciate the time.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee","Thanks. Good morning. Kenny, maybe a question on the volume outlook. Just is my understanding what we've seen so far in the first quarter, obviously, there's some weather disruptions and some softer numbers and then you maintained the outlook for the full year. Obviously, there's been some profound of activity, inventories maybe a bit on the high side. It sounds like we're working through that now.","Is there something else that you're seeing that makes you a little bit more confident that we can hit that? There's obviously an implied sort of acceleration as you move into 2Q, 3Q and 4Q. It seems like maybe there's still some lingering impacts on the network. I just wanted to get a sense of sort of how you're looking at it? And what you're hearing from the customers about sort of the demand environment to get you comfortable and certainly a little bit of that acceleration as we go through the rest of the year?","Kenny Rocker","So, yeah, just I want to reiterate the low single digit volume forecast for the year. And yeah, we are talking to our customers. The economy looks stable right now, and there is sort of a mixed bag with it. I'll tell you that there are commodities like our metals business. I talked a little bit about our petroleum. We talked for a while about plastics. Industrial production is still on the positive side even though it was revised downward a little bit and the uncertainty is around international trade.","On one end you've got the Ag business that we export out that we've talked about. And then the other piece that we're looking at is, will there be an impact on the trade coming from Asia? And how will that demand look. But overall, we feel like it's a pretty stable economy for us to grow in.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate it. And then you touched on this earlier in the call. Just on the headcount and how we think about maybe that flowing out over the course of this year. Obviously, there's a big sequential step down in the first quarter and presumably volumes come back in a better way as the rest of the year progresses.","Any sort of incremental color you can help us with in terms of how we should be thinking about that as 2019 progresses. Can you make further progress sequentially from where we are as we see some natural sort of variation of volume going forward?","Rob Knight","Hey, Chris, this is Rob. I mean, you know, we're not going to give a specific headcount number. But when you look at our confidence coming out of the first quarter where our headcount was down a total of four with some challenges. Obviously, that impacted that number and our commitment of a $500 million plus productivity number, which is going to be a -- a big chunk of that is going to come from the labor line.","It does imply that we are confident in our ability to continue to drive headcount down and hopefully with positive volume that is our plan. So, the combination of that is powerful and that's what gets to the sub-61%.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Rob Knight","Yeah.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ravi Shanker","Thanks. Good morning everyone. Just a follow-up on the planned CapEx shift. You guys have always been adamant that you guys still need to pursue growth while implementing PSR. I think, there's been some skepticism about whether that's possible or not. But kind of just given some of the CapEx shifts in Brazos and such, is there like a slight shift in that plan?","Lance Fritz","No. So, Ravi, two things. One is, we continue to view capital the same way we always have viewed capital, which is it's got to generate an attractive return. We'll put it where we need it. We plan capital from the bottom up, but we still think we're going to be at or below -- I think below is our guidance, 15% of revenue. Where that capital is going is shifting around as Unified Plan shifts traffic and puts emphasis on some areas of the network where maybe it hadn't been before.","The second part of your question, which was can you grow when you're implementing a PSR railroad? And we think absolutely you can. We think the end game is a consistent reliable service. Our customers want that. As we demonstrate we delivered that. We believe there's upside to the volume that is available to us. So, we think growth is achievable.","Ravi Shanker","Got it. And I also, I believe you guys filed with the STB for trackage rights agreement with Norfolk Southern. Can you give us a little more color there? Is that just temporary thing to get past the weather issues, or is it more of a longer term solution?","Lance Fritz","Ravi, I'm not sure exactly what you're referencing there. I will say that we have coordinated with other railroads through these weather events and are still doing some of that with peer railroads. That's just part of the normal course of business when we face significant traffic disruption.","Ravi Shanker","Okay. I can follow-up offline. Thanks so much. ","Operator","The next question is from the line of David Vernon with AllianceBernstein. Please proceed with your question.","David Vernon","Hi. Good morning, guys. So, Jim and Rob maybe a question for you guys on the redeployment of some of the existing CapEx, since sort of capacity producing initiative as you're pushing some of the CapEx from Brazos and extending sidings in the Sunset.","Jim, are there areas that you see additional work needing to be done to sort of unleash further productivity? Can you give us a sense for how much runway there might be here not to just change the scheduling and the operations, but also to change the physical plant a little bit?","I guess, the real question here is, how constrained are you by the setup of the existing network right now and when do those constraints lift?","A \u2013Jim Vena","David, good question. So I think we've got a great network. I think we have -- we can operate in a real very fluid manner. As we implement PSR, we actually get more capacity. So we're going to spend capital only in places where it allows us to be more efficient than we are today and deliver a better product to our customers. So with this whole -- at the end of the day when we're done with this PSR, done meaning that we've got most of it implemented, because it's a continuous view.","We want to be able to give our customers the best service so that they can compete in the marketplace against everybody else and we win and they win. And that's what we want to build. So this is not -- I don't feel constrained anywhere, but down the Sunset there was an opportunity for us to be able to improve our service to our customers, to be able to be more efficient ourselves. We can get into Chicago quicker if we can. All the better. We're real strong in Texas. We want to continue that and we want to build on that. So our customer wins, they win more business we win. So that's what's it all about.","David Vernon","And then maybe as you come out of that process, as you think about -- in your prior experience as far as kind of the way capital is deployed the management at MOW function, when you come out of this thing, where do you think the long run CapEx isn't coming? I know you guys have been saying sort of sub-15%, but with a layer mix of traffic kind of running over the network could it be -- can you help us understand kind of how below 15% that long-term CapEx number could be?","Lance Fritz","Rob, would you handle that for us please?","Rob Knight","Yes. David I'll just reiterate what you heard us say and by the way we're very proud of the effort that has been under way for several years to get us to the -- where we are today in terms of a sub-15% of our revenue in terms of a confidence level of our ability to spend capital where the returns are there and still be at that 15% or lower number. That's a pretty good progress. So I would just say that, we totally understand the value and the impact of capital dollars both on the positive side in terms of investing where growth and opportunity and returns are there, but also on the cash side of being as disciplined as we can and not spending capital where we don't need to spend and freeing up capital dollars where we can. We're all about that. But at this point in time, our guidance remains 15% or less of revenue under capital spending and a lot more to play out as you've heard from Jim all morning today, as he looks at different opportunities going forward.","David Vernon","So there's no sort of commentary on whether the PSR or post-PSR world would be even better than sub-15% number or...?","Rob Knight","At this point no.","David Vernon","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Walter Spracklin","Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning everyone. Kenny, I'd like to come back on international intermodal. You obviously had a very nice increase year-over-year and you called out some business wins. Can you give us a sense of the timing of those wins? And how much left of the comp spaces that that's going to drive? And if there's any -- when you look at your pipeline of what might be coming up, do you feel good about any upcoming potential new business wins that will allow you to keep growth going forward?","Kenny Rocker","Yes. So we lap those here within the next couple of quarters -- next couple of months here. And yes, I do feel very bullish about the pipeline that's out there our business development pipeline. And as I've stated, the beauty of what we're seeing with this more reliable service products, we saw that before the floods is that it opens up rail-centric market for us. And as we get more confident, we're expecting that to open up truck-centric type opportunity. But we've got a good cadence of opportunities that we can compete on and we just want to make sure that we can win those at the appropriate levels for us.","Walter Spracklin","When you look at the pricing environment, you're kicking up nicely every quarter it seems. And I just wanted to understand if that's due to some of the prior weakness or lower trucking or higher trucking prices and therefore may slow? Or is it more of a better rail pricing environment than what you've seen previously? I just want to get a handle on how much more pricing trends we can anticipate? Or do we start to see it dip down as pricing in the trucking market starts to come back down a bit?","Kenny Rocker","Yes. So we -- you're right we saw a stronger pricing environment during the second half of last year. I'll tell you this year, we are seeing some softness in the spot market. So we still think that the overall contractual truck market is a stable market. I'll call that stable. So the expectation really is that the commercial team they're just going to price to the market that's out there and we're expecting that a more reliable service product will also help us in that.","Walter Spracklin","Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And just a housekeeping if I may. The tax rate that you called out there just north of 23%. You indicated that Q2 might be a little lumpy. Do you have a guidance for the Q2 tax rate relative to the full year tax rate that you guided?","Rob Knight","No. Other than Walter I did call out the $21 million Arkansas item that will show up in the second quarter. So that will show up in the second quarter and the full year as lower rate than what we previously were projecting based on that and the impact of equity exercise of options on our tax rate.","Walter Spracklin","And should we use $24 million longer term, which is was what you kind of guided to before these kind of lumpy items. Is that in a good number for...","Rob Knight","Beyond 2019, that's probably a reasonable assumption.","Walter Spracklin","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions.","Tyler Brown","Hey, good morning. Just one question here. So the IMCs has had a strong call it 12 months on the pricing front. Your competitor is obviously in discussion with their IMCs. You got a 55 OR goal and I would be presumptuous, but I would say intermodal is going to play a significant role in achieving that. So my question is, why don't you guys push harder on domestic intermodal price to really catch up with what the IMC saw? Or is it that you're under some multi-year contracts with the IMCs and we could see that maybe when those contracts reset or am I missing something altogether?","Kenny Rocker","Yes. What I'd say is that you've see our price come up sequentially. I get -- I have a guess that I can see how we're pricing this business and we are pleased that we're pricing to the market. I won't go into any details on how we're differentiating the pricing instead of our domestic versus our international intermodal business. But I can tell you that as the market shows out, we price to that market. And I'll continue to say that as we get our service product more reliable and also in our intermodal network that we'll expect that we'll be able to price accordingly.","Tyler Brown","All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO. Please proceed with your questions.","Fadi Chamoun","Good morning. And thank you for squeezing me in here. Just one lingering question for Jim. Jim, when I look at the kind of classification assets relative to the size of the manifest network of Union Pacific and compare it to some of the other railroad the Canadian railroad, -- kind of -- the other railroad that implemented PSR. You still have significantly larger classification and network relative to the other railroad with PSR. So is there a specific reason why maybe because of mix or other issues, you would have that larger classification network? Or is it fair for us to kind of interpret that as a potentially long-term strong opportunity for rationalization?","A \u2013Jim Vena","Fadi, it's a good question. Every railroad is different and intermittently knowledgeable of one another okay to the point where I understand how the setup is. So we have to be careful in that -- a hump yard there is nothing wrong with a hump yard. It's the most efficient way to handle 1,800, 2,000 cars a day. There is nothing better. It's low cost. It works well. So if the business is such that you need it, it would be remiss to start pulling around by moving cars to other places.","My focus is you take the touch points out. You go longer haul trains. You have trains that can handle more cars. And if we need a hump yard, then we put it in place. I think there's opportunity, but never judge one railroad over the other, because of the traffic mix and the kind of flow of traffic that we have. So I know how many CN has and I know how many of the other railroads have. And I can tell you that we will get to the point where we have just enough hump yards to handle the cars most efficiently.","And it's -- in some places, it's more important for us to shut down multiple yards that we have in a city where we go down from three to two or to one. Just like we're looking at the intermodal that we mentioned in Chicago. We've got a number of work sites in there and we think, we can give our customers a better product by dropping and consolidating and be able to operate in a smoother manner in Chicago and give a better product to our customers and be more efficient. So that's what's it's all about Fadi. Hopefully I explained it.","Q \u2013 Fadi Chamoun","That's great. And maybe one close follow-up, so you've talked in the past about trying to remove the level of maybe a customization that has been built over time and inherited this manifest network. Is this process still ongoing? Or have you changed the service and the design of the service to the point where that's becoming more active I guess?","A \u2013 Lance Fritz","Fadi, this is Lance. Yes, that process is still under way. So if you go back, the way we would describe the network prior to Unified Plan 2020 was, really an accumulation of unique train service designs. Automotive network and a coal network and a grain network and an ethanol network and rock network and et cetera et cetera. As the first phase of Unified Plan 2020 happened, we consolidated a number of those unique services into manifest service, so that a train was handling more than one type of commodity. There's still work to be done there. There's still plenty of opportunity to be done there.","And at the same time Fadi, there are still going to be parts of our network that are specialized unique trains. For instance, the coal network makes all the sense in the world. In most cases to remain in a unit shuttle train network, as do green shuttles, as do some of our rock network. But we have just taken that too far I think in our previous design and we've unwound a good part of it and there's still more to be done.","Q \u2013 Fadi Chamoun","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Q \u2013 Cherilyn Radbourne","Thanks very much and good morning. It has been a long call. So I thought I just ask one on the 7% increase in train lengths. Just wondering, if you can give a bit of color on where that was achieved in the network either by line of business or by geography and talk about how much higher you're able to take that based on the current siding infrastructure?","A \u2013 Jim Vena","Well we do it across the company. Actually, we did in our east-west northern flow from the West Coast all the way to Chicago. We did it on the Sunset. We were able to do it on the mid-America north-south from Texas up to Chicago and up into Minnesota. And we also were able to do some of it and we're just starting there on our bulk capability. We think there's capability to be able to operate those trains in a much more efficient manner. So we'll continue to do it, Cherilyn. So it was spread out through the whole company.","A \u2013 Lance Fritz","Yes. And Cherilyn, in terms of what's feasible? You're exactly right. Different routes on the network have different train length capability, but there's -- that's not a hard and fast rule, right? We've talked historically about -- it's about where can you meet and pass traffic? And that doesn't mean every train on that corridor has to be built to the length of the sightings. You can always dictate that some of the traffic exceeds siding length and that means the pass for -- the opposing train has to take the siding. So there's a lot of moving parts there. We've got plenty of upside from where we are right now.","Q \u2013 Cherilyn Radbourne","Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Would that 7400-foot train lengths achieved their mark would that be a record for the company?","A \u2013 Lance Fritz","I don't know. We'd have to look at that.","A \u2013 Jim Vena","I wish it was because I have records. But Cherilyn, we'd be guessing. So -- but if there is a record better than that Cherilyn, I want to go by it.","Q \u2013 Cherilyn Radbourne","All right. Thank you. That\u2019s all from me.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your questions.","Q \u2013 Adam Kramer","Hey guys, this is Adam on for Jason. I guess I'll try and keep it quick here with just a single question for you guys. And this may be more for Jim. But I just want to ask about the challenges of implementing PSR at UP versus CN and taking a much longer outlook, much longer in terms of time. Is there anything that would inhibit similar outcomes over time at UP versus CN?","A \u2013 Lance Fritz","Hey Jim, would you also -- when we answer that question reflect on timing of implementing.","Q \u2013 Jim Vena","I think sometimes people forget that it took a while at CN to really get it moving and get it to the place where it became the most efficient railroad in North America. It wasn't a quick fix and go. And I think it was -- it took some time and lessons learned. There's some things you can do quicker, but you also don't want to impact your service to customers and lose a lot of business because of it. So I'm doing it and we're doing it as quick as we can. We think we have a great plan and we'll move ahead.","What I found here at Union Pacific was -- it's a brand-new company. I didn't know a lot of people when I showed up. But I tell you the quality of the group right through the whole company and I've visited a lot of places. I flew into every one of the locations, major locations that we have in this company and I found people at the front line that want to be. There their goal is the same as my goal. They want to have the best operating efficiency in the industry. So when you start with that as a base, it's a wonderful place to be and it goes from the top to the bottom of the company and back up. So it's truly an exciting place to be.","Q \u2013 Jim Vena","Thanks Jim, appreciate the time.","A \u2013 Lance Fritz","You are welcome.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Q \u2013 Ben Hartford","Hello, thanks for taking the time. I just want to circle back on -- in international intermodal you included a question mark here in the slide and obviously you talked about the inventory overhang to start the year. As you think about international for the balance of the year and adding some of the uncertainty, due to the fact that inventories are a bit elevated? Or is it a bit more structural? And if we look at the west -- the port data in March East Coast were stronger than West. Is there something structural going on as it relates to diversion away from the west? Or is the uncertainty just due to the fact that inventory levels here at the beginning of the year are elevated?","A \u2013 Kenny Rocker","I think it's easy to forget that the -- hopefully have started back in 2018 and so -- and they carried all the way into 2019. So we're talking about a pretty long period of time here. So yes it is about the inventory levels. We do need to see how they work off. As I mentioned we'd have a lot more clarity as we get through April and May. Now on the second half of the year, we'll have tougher comps but we're expecting that a stable economy will still provide a positive number there.","Q \u2013 Ben Hartford","Okay. And maybe this is as a follow-up on the domestic intermodal side for you and Jim as well. As you think about domestic intermodal, I think you talked about pricing to the market, but also helping that -- or hoping that a more reliable service product would help that sales the value proposition. As you think about the next three to five years as PSR takes hold, the market is going to do what it's going to do. Spot pricing was weak. But as you think about the conversion opportunity over the road, over the next several years that was removed as -- on this outlook supply as well. How do you see the domestic intermodal conversion opportunity stripping out sterilizing some of the cyclical noise right now? As you get service where it needs to be is this still a product that can grow at a multiple of US underlying let's say U.S., IP or GDP growth?","A \u2013 Kenny Rocker","Yes. So I've stated in my comments and I reiterated. I'm bullish. We're bullish on the fact that there is upside on the domestic intermodal business and yes a more reliable service product will help us out there. And I got to emphasize this, as we're talking about it. Also in our manifest business, there's still a room for us to grow in our rail-centric business. And for us to capture manifest business that's moving truck. So it's not just domestic intermodal piece we're bullish across-the-board here.","Q \u2013 Ben Hartford","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments.","Lance Fritz","Thank you very much Rob and thank you all for your questions. We're looking forward to talking with you again in July.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Welcome to the Union Pacific Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today\u2019s presentation are available on Union Pacific\u2019s website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may begin.","Lance Fritz","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everybody. And welcome to Union Pacific\u2019s third quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Jim Vena, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. I have also asked Jennifer Hamann, our newly-appointed Chief Financial Officer effective January 1st, to join us for the Q&A portion of the call.","So before we get started today, I want to take a moment and thank Rob for his service and contributions to Union Pacific over his 40-year career, particularly the last 16 years as CFO. Rob\u2019s been a critical member of our senior team and was instrumental in driving Union Pacific\u2019s financial success. We wish him all of the best in his upcoming well-deserved retirement and thank you very much, Rob.","I also would like to welcome Jennifer to the CFO role. She and Rob are doing a great job working through the transition and I am confident that Jennifer is the right choice to lead our financial initiatives into the future. ","This morning, Union Pacific is reporting 2019 third quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.22 a share. This represents a 3% increase in earnings per share and a 2% decrease in net income compared to 2018. Our quarterly operating ratio came in at a 59.5%, a 2.2 percentage point improvement compared to the third quarter of 2018. ","Once again, this represents an all-time record quarterly operating ratio, beating our previous low established last quarter. That\u2019s quite an achievement when you consider the fall-off in volume during the quarter.","We are continuing to drive productivity through our G55 + 0 and Unified Plan 2020 efforts, which are also producing a safe, reliable and consistent service product for our customers. The work our employees are doing as part of Unified Plan 2020 is foundational to the company\u2019s success and there are additional improvement opportunities going forward for both our customers and our shareholders.","With that, I will turn it over to Kenny to provide more details on our results.","Kenny Rocker","Thank you, Lance, and good morning. For the third quarter, our volume was down 8% as gains in our Industrial business group were more than offset by declines in Ag Products, Premium and Energy. At the same time, we generated a positive net core pricing of 2.5% in the quarter as we continue to price our service product to the value it represents in the marketplace while ensuring it generates an appropriate return.","Freight revenue was down 7%, driven by the decrease in volume partially offset by a 1% improvement in average revenue per car. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the performance of each business group.","Starting off with Ag Products, revenue for the quarter was down 1% on a 2% decrease in volume and a 2% improvement in average revenue per car. Grain carloads were down 3%, primarily driven by continued reductions in export grain shipments, partially offsetting feed grain declines with strength in wheat. Volume for grain products was flat as sustained demand for biofuels and supporting products was offset by reduced exports. Fertilizer and sulfur carloads were down 5% primarily due to soft global demand for potash.","Moving on to Energy, revenue was down 20% as volume declined 15%, coupled with a 5% decrease in average revenue per car related to negative mix with the loss of long-haul sand volume.","Sand carloads were down 45%, largely due to the impact of local sand. Coal and coke volume was down 17%, due to the softer market conditions resulting from lower natural gas prices and weak export demand. In addition, contract changes and retirements also impacted volumes in the quarter.","However, on a positive note, favorable crude oil price spreads drove an increase in crude oil shipments, which was the primary driver for the 18% increase in petroleum, LPG, and renewable carloads for the quarter.","Industrial revenue was down 1% on a 2% increase in volume and a 3% decrease in average revenue per car due to negative mix with increased short-haul business. Construction carloads increased 16%, primarily driven by a strong market demand in the south for rock shipments. Plastics volume increased 7% due to higher production. Forest product volume decreased 11% driven by softness in the lumber and paper markets.","Turning to Premium, revenue for the quarter was down 9% on an 11% decrease in volume, while average revenue per car improved by 2%. Domestic intermodal volume declined 11%, primarily driven by an abundant truck supply coupled with softer demand during the quarter.","International intermodal volume was down 12% during the quarter, reflecting weak market conditions related to trade uncertainty, escalating tariffs, and challenging year-over-year comparisons, driven by accelerated shipments seeking to avoid tariff in September 2018.","And finally, finished vehicle shipments were down 4% for the quarter. Third quarter U.S. auto sales were down approximately 2% from 2018. Strong light vehicle and SUV sales did not fully offset declining car demand.","Looking ahead for the rest of 2019, for Ag Products, we anticipate continued strength in advanced biofuel shipments and associated feedstock due to an increase in demand, which will help offset challenges in the ethanol marketplace.","We also expect stronger beer shipments along with long-term penetration growth across multiple segments of our food and refrigerated business. And furthermore, with the recent outlook with China to take more Ag Products, we hope to see some relief as those exports resume. However, we will continue to keep a watchful eye on foreign tariffs within our Ag market.","For Energy, we expect favorable crude oil price spreads to drive positive results for petroleum products. Local sand supply will continue to impact volume, although the comps should improve over the long term. We also expect coal to experience continued challenges with volume throughout the balance of the year and weather conditions will always be a key factor for coal demand.","Looking at Industrial, we anticipate an increase in plastic shipments driven largely by plant expansions coming online later this year coupled with continued strength in the construction market in the South, but we continue to watch housing starts and the projected softness in the overall market.","And lastly, for Premium, the light U.S. vehicle sales forecast for 2019 of 16.8 million units, down about 2% from 2018. Although, we remain encouraged by the tentative agreement between General Motors and their autoworkers, we are still keeping a close watch on it and the associated volume impact. Domestic Intermodal volume is sequentially strengthening, but when compared to 2018, it is expected to be impacted by truck competition in the fourth quarter.","In addition, we expect international intermodal to return to its normal seasonal flow but face tough year-over-year comparisons due to accelerated shipments seeking to avoid tariff increases in 2018.","And now, I will turn it over to Jim.","Jim Vena","Thank you, Kenny. Well, we finally had a clean quarter from a weather perspective, and I think our results speak volumes for what is possible. Our operating metrics continue to improve and as a result, we are seeing a better service product for our customers.","Furthermore, I couldn\u2019t be more proud of how the team has responded to the challenge of rightsizing our cost structure in the face of declining volumes while driving significant productivity.","For example, crew starts were down 15% in the quarter and outpaced the 8% decline in carloads we experienced. This, along with our Unified Plan 2020 actions drove an all-time best quarterly operating ratio of 59.5%, which truly was a remarkable achievement.","While we are continuing to drive productivity, these gains are overshadowed if we aren\u2019t simultaneously improving safety. Our incident experience has not improved, but we are committed to getting better, as always safety remains job one at Union Pacific.","I\u2019d like to turn over to slide 11. I\u2019d now like to update you on our six key performance indicators. We continue to see substantial year-over-year improvement in our metrics. In fact, earlier this year, I said, we would blow by some of our goals and we are doing just that. It is a direct result of our relentless focus on improving network efficiency and service reliability as part of Unified Plan 2020.","Continued improvement in asset utilization and fewer car classifications led to a 20% improvement in freight car terminal dwell and a 10% improvement in freight car velocity compared to the third quarter of 2018. Our train speed for the third quarter as a whole decreased 1% to 23.7 miles per hour compared to 2018. We turned the corner in September and saw year-over-year improvement and the trend has continued into October.","As I have mentioned in the past, our train speeds continue to be affected by additional daily work events being performed as part of Unified Plan 2020. While these work events are helping us increase train size and drive asset utilization, there is an opportunity to execute these work events even more efficiently and drive faster train speeds.","Turning to slide 12, continuing our trend from the second quarter, locomotive productivity improved 18% versus last year as efforts to use the fleet more efficiently enabled us to park units. As of September 30th, we had around 2,600 locomotives stored. Driven by a 13% decrease in our workforce levels, workforce productivity increased 4% year-over-year.","In addition to improving productivity, delivering a great service product is of equal importance to the team, car trip compliance improved 10 points year-over-year driven by increased freight car velocity and lower terminal dwell. While we are pleased with our progress, we do expect our service product to improve going forward. In fact, we are already seeing sequential improvement in October.","Slide 13 highlights some of the recent network changes we have made as part of Unified Plan 2020. By shifting classification work to surrounding terminals we are able to reduce operations at our Roseville hump yard resulting in increased car velocity for associated manifest business.","In addition, we reduced switching operations at our yard in Alexandria, Louisiana, moved the work to a more efficient terminal in Livonia. We also stopped humping cars at Neff yard in Kansas City.","As a result, we will now build overhead blocks to drive cars deeper into the network and leverage existing flat switching terminals in the Kansas City Complex. Going forward, we will continue to look for ways to reduce car touches, which undoubtedly will lead to additional terminal rationalization opportunities on our network.","Currently, one of our main areas of focus is to utilize our existing network capacity, and we are making excellent progress on this front as illustrated by the train length graph on the right. By putting more product on fewer trains, we have increased train length across our system by over a thousand feet or 15% since January of this year.","In fact, we have specific initiatives up against the Sunset, Central, and North-South corridors on our network and they are paying big dividends. Earlier this year, we discussed investing capital in our Sunset Corridor for siding extensions to support productivity initiatives. Through a collaborative team effort, that work was completed in record time. As a result, I am pleased to report the train length in the Sunset Corridor has increased 18% since January 2019.","Furthermore, operational changes in our North-South Corridor between Chicago and South Texas have driven train length up over 21% since the start of the year. Looking forward, I expect to see continued improvement in train length through a combination of transportation plan changes and targeted capital investments.","To wrap up, on slide 14, we have made a number of changes to our operations in the last year and the results have been outstanding. However, there are still a lot of opportunities ahead of us to further improve safety, asset utilization and network efficiency.","As we move forward, look for us to continue pushing the envelope and taking bold steps as we transform our operation, running a safe, reliable and efficient railroad for both our customers and our shareholders is nonnegotiable, and our team is committed to making that happen. ","And with that, I will turn it over to Rob for the last time.","Rob Knight","Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Today we are reporting third quarter earnings per share of $2.22 and a 2.2 points of year-over-year improvement in our operating ratio to 59.5%. This represents an all-time best quarterly operating ratio for Union Pacific and the second consecutive quarter with a sub-60% operating ratio. This is once again a testament to the great work that we are doing with G55 + 0 and the Unified Plan 2020. Our quarterly results were affected by some one-timers, so before I jump into the details, let me set the stage.","An increased frequency of rail equipment incidence resulted in approximately $25 million of added operating expenses in the quarter. These excess costs for cleanup, destroyed equipment and damaged freight resulted in a 0.5 point negative impact to our operating ratio and subtracted $0.02 of EPS compared to the third quarter of 2018.","The combined impact of lower fuel price and our fuel surcharge lag had a favorable impact for the quarter of 0.9 points on the operating ratio adding $0.04 of EPS compared to 2018. The good news is that despite lower volumes, we drove core margin improvement of almost 2 points compared to the third quarter of last year.","Now let\u2019s recap our third quarter results. Operating revenue was $5.5 billion in the quarter, down 7% versus last year. The primary driver was an 8% decrease in volume. Operating expense totaled $3.3 billion, down 10% from 2018. Operating income totaled $2.2 billion, a 2% decrease compared to last year. Below the line, other income was $53 million, up 10% from 2018 driven by lower benefit plan costs and increased rental income, partially offset by higher environmental costs.","Interest expense of $266 million was up 10% compared to the previous year. This reflects the impact of a higher total debt balance.","Income tax expense decreased 4% to $466 million. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 23.1% and for the full year we expect our annual effective tax rate to be around 23.5%.","Net income totaled $1.6 billion, down 2% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance decreased 5% as a result of our continued share repurchases. As I noted earlier, these results combined to produce third quarter earnings per share of $2.22 and an operating ratio of 59.5%.","Freight revenue of $5.1 billion was down 7% versus last year. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $393 million, down $89 million compared to 2018. Business mix had almost a 1 point negative impact on freight revenue in the third quarter, driven by increased shorter-haul rock business and decreased agricultural product volumes, along with reduced sand carloadings, somewhat offset by fewer intermodal shipments.","Core price was 2.5% in the third quarter, similar to the pricing that we achieved in the first half of 2019. Although, the reported yields are slightly lower, this is not indicative of any quarterly pricing actions.","As you have heard me say many times before, in order to get credit for price under our methodology, which we believe is the right way to calculate price, you have to move the volumes. In the third quarter, the fall-off in volumes negatively impacted our price yield.","Having said that, beginning with our fourth quarter results, we will no longer report detailed pricing numbers. We are making this change solely for commercial reasons as Union Pacific is the only Class 1 railroad to publically report detailed pricing results, which we now believe disadvantages us in the marketplace.","This should not be read in any way as Union Pacific becoming less disciplined or less focused on pricing. Of course, price will continue to play a key role in achieving our financial goals and our guidance is unchanged, and rest assured, we will continue to yield pricing dollars above our rail inflation costs.","Slide 19 provides a summary of our core -- of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense decreased 10% to $1.1 billion versus 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in total force levels, which were down 13% or about 5,700 FTEs in the third quarter versus last year. Productivity initiatives along with lower volumes resulted in a 13% decrease in our TE&Y workforce, while our management, engineering and mechanical workforces together declined 15%.","Fuel expense totaled $504 million, down 24% compared to 2018 due to lower diesel fuel prices and fewer gallons consumed. Average diesel fuel prices decreased 12% versus last year to $2.09 per gallon and our consumption rate improved 3% through more efficient operations.","Purchase services and materials expense was down 9%, compared to the third quarter of 2018 at $574 million. The primary drivers of the decrease in the quarter were reduced mechanical repair costs and less contract services and materials, partially offset by reduced foreign car repairs.","Turning to slide 20, depreciation expense was $557 million, up 2% compared to 2018. For the full year 2019, we still expect that depreciation expense will be up 1% to 2%.","Moving to equipment and other rents. This expense totaled $236 million in the quarter, which is down 13% when compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by lower equipment lease expense and less volume related costs.","Other expense was down 3%, compared to the third quarter of 2018 at $277 million, driven by lower environmental expenses partially offset by an increase in costs associated with damaged freight and destroyed equipment. For the full year 2019, we expect other expense to be up low-single digits compared to 2018.","Productivity savings yielded from our G55 + 0 initiatives and Unified Plan 2020 totaled approximately $170 million in the quarter, which was partially offset by the additional costs that I mentioned in my opening remarks.","As a result, net productivity for the third quarter was $145 million, with year-to-date net productivity now sitting at $375 million. This is a remarkable outcome when you think about the challenges that we have overcome such as unprecedented flooding and a weak volume environment. In fact, we continue to gain traction with our productivity initiatives and are confident that we will still deliver at least $500 million of net productivity in 2019.","Looking at our cash flow, cash from operations for the first three quarters totaled $6.3 billion, down slightly compared to last year. Free cash flow before dividends totaled $3.8 billion resulting in free cash flow conversion rate equal to 83% of net income for the first three quarters of 2019.","Taking a look at adjusted debt levels, the all-in adjusted debt balance totaled $28 billion at the end of the third quarter, up $2.9 billion since year end 2018. We finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.6 times. As we have previously guided, our target for debt-to-EBITDA is up to 2.7 times.","Dividend payments for the first three quarters totaled more than $1.9 billion, up $209 million from 2018. This includes the effect of 10% dividend increases in both the first quarter and third quarter of this year.","During the third quarter, we repurchased 6.4 million shares at a cost of $1.1 billion. We also received 3.2 million shares in the third quarter associated with the closeout of the $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we initiated in February. But between dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned $7.1 billion to our shareholders in the first three quarters of this year.","Looking out to the remainder of 2019, with the current softness in rail volumes and the underlying economic uncertainty in the marketplace, we expect fourth quarter volumes to decline year-over-year at a similar level to what we experienced in the third quarter.","Clearly, we would love to have additional volume, with a more consistent and reliable service product we are poised to grow our business. Going forward, we will continue to price our service to the value that it represents in the marketplace, while ensuring that it generates an appropriate return. We remain confident that the dollars we yield from our pricing initiatives will again well exceed our rail inflation costs in 2019.","With respect to capital investments, we now expect full year 2019 spending to be around $3.1 billion or about $100 million less than our previously announced $3.2 billion plan. Although, we are continuing to invest in projects that support the Unified Plan 2020 productivity initiatives, we have scaled back some of our growth capital spend in light of current business volumes.","As it relates to our workforce, strong productivity initiatives and to a lesser degree lower volumes have resulted in a 9% year-to-date reduction. For the balance of the year, we expect continued combination of operating efficiency gains and lower business levels should result in fourth quarter force levels to be down at least 15% versus 2018.","As a result, full-year force levels should be down slightly more than 10%, which positions us nicely going into 2020. Importantly, with improving margins in the second half of the year, our guidance of a sub-61% operating ratio in 2019 on a full year basis remains intact, despite the fall-off in volumes. Furthermore, an early look at next year\u2019s productivity lineup gives us confidence, with our ability to achieve an operating ratio below 60% for 2020.","As you have heard me say many times before, we have to play the hand that we are dealt when it comes to volumes. But let me assure you, our commitment to achieving our financial targets is unwavering and we are moving aggressively to improve regardless of the economic environment.","Before I turn it back to Lance, if you can indulge me for just one minute. As was said, this is my final earnings call and I want to thank all the men and women of Union Pacific for the dramatic improvements in safety, service and financial results over the last 16 years.","I am very proud that we have improved our operating ratio 28 points, increasing our market cap by over $100 billion over that time and I am confident that the team will continue to drive great results as we drive to a 55 operating ratio.","I have never felt better about the path that we are on operationally and I also know that Jennifer will be an outstanding CFO. And finally, I would like to thank everyone listening today for all the professionalism and support that you have given me and Union Pacific and I wish you all the best.","With that, I will turn it back to Lance.","Lance Fritz","Thank you, Rob. As discussed today, we delivered solid third quarter financial results and we made tremendous strides to improve our productivity and service product as part of Unified Plan 2020.","For the remainder of 2019, we look forward to building on our successes and we provide a highly consistent and reliable service product for our customers. Although, there are some unknowns looking ahead at the economy, confidence in our operational capabilities, as Rob just mentioned, has never been greater.","As always, we are committed to operating a safe railroad for our employees and the communities that we serve and we have some work to do there. We remain squarely focused on driving long-term shareholder value by appropriately investing in the railroad and returning excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","With that, let\u2019s open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long","Thanks. Good morning. And I will start with a congrats to Rob and Jennifer on the announcement. Maybe to start on headcount, if we just look at the guidance for the fourth quarter and take the exit rate this year and hold that steady, it seems to imply another 6% reduction or so in the headcount in 2020, if you just hold things flat sequentially throughout next year. I know it\u2019s somewhat volume dependent, but should we be thinking about a 6% reduction in the headcount at a minimum for next year, and can you just speak to the opportunity beyond that level as you continue to implement PSR?","Rob Knight","Yeah. Justin, this is Rob. We haven\u2019t finalized our 2020 plan, and so volume will obviously have a role in what the headcount actually ends up being, but we are confident in that and we are hopeful that volume is positive, and we will grow that very efficiently from a productivity standpoint.","Having said that, you are right, we are exiting at a very efficient level. We are gaining momentum with the Precision Rail Unified Plan 2020 initiatives that Jim talked about. So, directionally, I think you are thinking about it right, we are not guiding to that number, but that directionally is exactly what we are thinking.","Justin Long","Okay. And then maybe secondly more of a near-term question. Last couple of years, we have seen the OR stay fairly flat sequentially third quarter to fourth quarter. Should we be thinking about the OR staying flattish sequentially in 4Q of this year as well or is there something that could cause a divergence from that trend we have seen in the past couple of years?","Rob Knight","Yeah. We are not giving quarterly guidance on that, but I think directionally also there you are thinking about it right and I gave you sort of an early look at what we expect to see on the volume front, which I think would be a similar decline in the fourth quarter that we saw in the third quarter.","So there\u2019s nothing unusual outside of that. We are obviously going to continue to implement the Unified Plan 2020 initiatives and do as good as we can, but you are thinking about it directionally right.","Justin Long","Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the time.","Lance Fritz","Thank you, Justin.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee","Hey. Thanks. Good morning and congrats to Rob and Jennifer. Rob, it\u2019s been great working with you. Wish you all the best in your retirement. I guess I wanted to come back to the headcount dynamic, certainly a 15% reduction in the fourth quarter is dramatic and a big, big number. I guess when you think about sort of when you set the target for 10% decline earlier this year relative to what we have seen from a volume perspective, you can make an argument that obviously volume has sort of disappointed I guess. So, how do you feel about sort of the balance between your resources and what we are seeing from a volume perspective? Is there opportunity, I am coming at this question, I guess, slightly similarly to Justin, but kind of a little bit different. Is there an opportunity to kind of get a little bit more aggressive on the headcount as we kind of go through this 4Q, 1Q kind of hopefully bottoming in volume?","Lance Fritz","Yeah. Chris, this is Lance. Without putting a really fine point on it, the short answer is largely yes, right? We have been a little disappointed in the topline versus what we were hoping to see when we came into the year. As a result, we have adjusted headcount more aggressively to match that drop in volume. You see that happening in the third quarter as we had headcount lower than volume, and I expect we will continue that. Jim, do you want to add a little technicolor in terms of some of the opportunities that you see in the operations?","Jim Vena","I think the numbers speak for themselves. Lance, I think, the team did a great job of taking into account where the volume ended up this quarter and what we were able to react, and we are going to do the same thing. We are going to react to -- on any volume. Hopefully, the volume goes up. But at the end of it, we will react in the right way and we see a sequential drop in the number of people that we have as we move forward against the flat line business model.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. Okay. That\u2019s helpful and I appreciate that. Can we talk a little bit about the topline and yield specifically. I guess from a yield standpoint, some sequential deterioration here. Can you talk a little bit about sort of the competitive pricing environment that you are dealing with in your markets, and then maybe some of the mix dynamics that are kind of working their way through? Is there any predictability to the mix as we look out to 4Q or maybe 1Q, can you sort of highlight that, but those kind of dynamics around yield would be very helpful. ","Lance Fritz","Before I turn it over to, Kenny, I just want to remind everybody, Rob said this, that we calculate yield in the most conservative way, and so when you get a 10% or an 8% drop in volume in the quarter, it has a real significant impact on our ability to generate yield. And Rob, again, had said very specifically that there was nothing specific in the quarter that drove yield sequentially to decline just a little bit. But with that, Kenny, do you want to talk about the pricing environment that you are in right now?","Kenny Rocker","So, first of all, I just want to give a shout out to Jim, wishing the operating team for creating an environment where we can price to a really strong service product out there. So our commercial team is doing a really good job of keeping pricing discipline and aligning our price consistent with that service offering that\u2019s improving.","Having said all those things, there is a very competitive truck environment that is out there. I think all of you are aware of what\u2019s taking place in the marketplace and we complete -- compete daily with a number of rail carriers in North America.","But I think the important thing for you to hear is that we are going to maintain pricing discipline especially as our service products is improving and as that service product improves, we also expect that to help us grow.","Lance Fritz","Rob, do you want to touch on mix?","Rob Knight","Yeah. Chris, as you know, we don\u2019t give guidance on mix and the reason for that is we have such a diverse product mix that we have mix within mix. You have heard me say that many times. Having said that, the challenges, and perhaps, to some, the surprise in the third quarter mix was I think largely explained by the increase in the shorter-haul rock shipments that we called out. I mean, intermodal, I think, everybody gets that. Most of the other moves like Ag everybody kind of gets that. The shorter-haul rock shipments that increased I think were perhaps a little bit of a surprise to some on the mix.","Having said that, I see no reason why the fourth quarter wouldn\u2019t -- would be materially different from what we saw in the third quarter. Again, I am going to stay away from specific mix guidance, but directionally I would envision it looking similar.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate it. Thanks very much.","Lance Fritz","Thank you. ","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz","Yeah. Good morning, and Rob, yeah, also congratulations, wish you the best, pleasure working with you over the years and congratulations to you as well, Jennifer. The -- let\u2019s see, the volume trend, I mean, obviously there are a lot of moving parts and the weakness in volume. But I think it\u2019s notable that there\u2019s a pretty big delta in volume performance for Union Pacific versus Burlington Northern. And just wanted to see if you could shed some light on what might be driving that, in particular, I am referring to the intermodal where it looks like kind of four-week moving average you are down about 13%, BN is down about 2% and there is a pretty wide gap in the coal side as well. So just wondering if you could offer some thoughts on what\u2019s driving that and whether you think that might change over the next couple quarters?","Lance Fritz","Kenny?","Kenny Rocker","Yeah. I will tell you that we would have appreciated a stronger economy to help us compete for more opportunities. But the fact that the service product on the intermodal side is actually strengthening is something that we appreciate. And yes, we have seen a lot of competition out there from both the trucking side, and as always, we compete with the western rail carriers and the North American rail carriers. So that has going to be around for us and we will continue to compete there.","Lance Fritz","Yeah. One thing that I would add, Tom, is we are very happy with our service product and the trend that it\u2019s on. So it\u2019s currently a very good service product and it\u2019s showing itself to be reliable and consistent, and I think it\u2019s going to continue to improve. So from that basis, we are in a great place to compete for business.","Having said that, we are also continuing to be a very, very disciplined on our price. So we are not trying to chase market share, we are not trying to chase the market down against loose truck, and we will just compete based on the service that we provide, we will price for that. And as the economy strengthens, which it will at some point and as truck capacity tightens up, which it will at some point, we are in a great place to take advantage of that.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay. Just, I guess to follow-up on that a little bit further, are there contract shifts in the intermodal and coal side that might account for part of that and I guess in terms of the PSR impact, sometimes you make big changes to, as an example, in Chicago, the terminals you are using and you can cause some initial disruption to the customer but then obviously you hope to run better in the future. But is there an impact from contracts or kind of initial disruption from PSR?","Jim Vena","Yeah. Chris, I will take that, a mix of questions. The short answer is in terms of design of our network in the intermodal space. There has been small single-digit impact on intermodal volume from rationalizing low volume lanes, low density lanes. That made sense in the book of business. It still makes sense. And when you aggregate that back up to the entire railroad, it\u2019s really largely an asterisk. ","When you get into the other parts of your question about contracts, we don\u2019t talk specifically about customers, but I -- but we did call out both in the first quarter, and I think, Kenny mentioned it again this quarter that, we did have a coal contract change hands that is impacting this year to a degree and we haven\u2019t talked about any other contracts precisely.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay. Great. Thanks for the time.","Lance Fritz","All right.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Scott Group","Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. So want to ask a couple on the cost side, comp per employee a little higher than we thought, any thoughts on how to model that going forward and rail inflation next year? And then purchase services were flat sequentially given the weak volumes and PSR. I would have thought there would be some opportunity there, maybe can you just talk about the opportunity that is left on purchase services cost?","Rob Knight","Yeah. Scott, this is Rob. Let me take the cost per employee. The -- kind of delta, if you rose, as to why it was up above what we would expect in terms of the inflation was really some of the overtime which a lot of changes going on in operations but the overtime is something that did inflate that cost per employee up a little bit.","As we look to 2020, again we haven\u2019t finalized our planning assumptions yet, but I would say, it\u2019s probably overall inflation for 2020 is going to be in the neighborhood of 2%, with labor probably in the 2.5-ish range again.","And on the purchase services, I guess I wouldn\u2019t call out anything unique there, obviously, as we pursue the Unified Plan 2020 initiatives there will be opportunities we think for us to continue to rationalize and be as efficient as we can on that line as well.","Scott Group","Okay. And then we got the sub-60 OR guidance for next year. Rob or Jennifer or maybe Jim, if you want to comment, the street is already well ahead of that. Given the macro, does that seem reasonable or -- and then maybe asking it a little bit differently. So when we have looked at past instances of rails doing PSR, you have seen better margin improvement in the second year than the first year. Does that seem like a reasonable way to think about it or not?","Lance Fritz","Yeah. Let me start, Scott, and then I will hand it over to Rob and Jim. So the bottomline for next year is we have got guidance out there sub-60, but we have constantly said we are going to be as sub-sub-60 as we possibly can be.","As we enter next year, we have got good momentum, right? If we can get a little cooperation from the economy, that would be very helpful. We have had some puts and takes this year. We have discussed those through the quarter, so we know what those are. But we are going to get as sub of 60 as we possibly can. And with that, I will turn it over to Rob and Jim to fill in.","Rob Knight","Yeah. Scott, I would just add to that that, as you know, every step on the ladder of efficiency that we have had over the years we have always tried to get there as safely and efficiently and quickly as we can, and frankly we have. So I would say that\u2019s similar to the numbers that we have out there.","I feel, as I said in my comments, I feel as good as I have ever felt in my career about where we are operationally. So the things that I feel like we can control to get to that sub-60, I feel extremely good about.","So the variable right now as I look to 2020 is really the economy, and as we sit right here today, we are certainly hopeful and thinking that the volume will be on the maybe slightly on the positive side of the ledger, but that\u2019s still an unknown at this point. So I think that\u2019s really the big variable as to how sub, sub can be on that sub-60 guidance for next year.","Jim Vena","Listen, the only thing I can add, I think, Lance and Rob have done a great job of giving the macro view of it. Operationally, we are just starting. I think, there\u2019s lots to do. I think, I have been here for nine months, a couple of days ago. I think what the team has been able to deliver and you see it in the metrics that are real key.","I think -- I don\u2019t think, I know, next year is going to be a great year operationally. We will take whatever business. Hopefully it\u2019s an increase in business, and Kenny, a substantial increase. And we will show what this team can do, and if not, we react to it properly. I see lots of headway and I am excited by what I see coming forward for the end of this year and next year.","Scott Group","Jim, can I just clarify one thing with you? So, you -- at the beginning of the year you laid out a 10% labor productivity target. We are getting a lot of headcount out, but because volumes are down so much, like, we are getting maybe half of that on the labor productivity. So does that imply that there\u2019s a big opportunity left next year, are we thinking about that right?","Jim Vena","I think, we are headed in the right direction. You are thinking right. We are -- the more we can put, the less train starts, put more product on the trains, make it more efficient, adjust our yards just like we did in Kansas City, we drive productivity better, we will see that improve as we move ahead, Scott. So nothing wrong with the way you are thinking.","Scott Group","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ravi Shanker","Thanks to everyone. And Rob, good luck on your retirement and congratulations, Jen, from me as well. So it was pretty that you are no longer going to announce core price. I think that now makes every Class 1 rail that doesn\u2019t disclose price. That\u2019s a pretty dramatic change from five years or six years ago, where that was kind of key to the rail kind of bouquet as investment pieces. Why do you think that\u2019s changed, I mean, is that because it\u2019s just gotten more competitive to get price, is it because of a tougher regulatory environment? Why have you seen that shift do you think?","Lance Fritz","So I can\u2019t speak for other railroads. I can speak for us. And that is by publishing a yield number every quarter. We work against ourselves commercially. I mean, in the simplest way, when Kenny is talking to a customer and trying to maximize that price discussion, our conservative yield calculation frequently works against us in that conversation. It\u2019s as simple as that for us. Rob?","Rob Knight","Yeah. Ravi, I would just add, Lance nailed it, but I would add, as I said in my comments, you are right, it is a shift. But I think, as I exit the company, I also have never felt better about the understanding and value of understanding the impact that the pricing has on our financials.","And you combine that with the continually improving service product, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that Kenny and the marketing team completely understand that it\u2019s our objective to drive as positive a price and earn the adequate returns that we can in the marketplace.","So rest assured, I guess, the point is, rest assured that, because we think commercially it\u2019s not to our advantage to be talking as precisely as we have about price, don\u2019t interpret that to mean that we are not aggressively going after pricing opportunities, which we think are still there and we are going to aggressively pursue that.","Ravi Shanker","Got it. Just a follow-up. Lance, I think, you said earlier that, you guys are very clearly not chasing share and going after volume over price. Just given some of the volume delta this quarter between you and your chief regional competitor, do you feel like there is some of that going on in the marketplace?","Lance Fritz","Our marketplace, as we relay to you every quarter, it remains very competitive and it remains competitive specifically in the intermodal space not just against rail competition, but specifically against truck competition.","Trucks are pretty darn loose right now, which means the capacity is readily available and widely reported that truck pricing has been dropping. So we are looking forward to seeing a bottom of that and then an upturn.","And I anticipate that will occur. I don\u2019t know when. But you see truck orders substantially down, you see production starting to turn negative and that all bodes well for competition as we look forward.","Rob Knight","And the best way to combat that is an improved service product and that\u2019s what we are getting right now.","Ravi Shanker","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question, and again, congrats, Rob and Jennifer. Just going back to the volume side for a minute, we have easier comps here in 2020. What do you feel, Kenny, about the absolute activity levels and maybe some of the key areas to talk about? You just mentioned truck, but honestly, I am a little surprised that that\u2019s been such a factor, so maybe you can help expand on that? And then while we have talk about sand for a long time, it continues to go down. I just wanted to see when you mentioned the long-term comps get easier, is there still a big shift in local sand that\u2019s coming up that you think is going to be a mix headwind as well?","Kenny Rocker","Yeah. So, first of all, it\u2019s a little premature for us to talk about the plan for the following year. But, yeah, I would expect that we would be on the slightly positive side of the ledger. As we look towards the future and the fact that we have got a good service product really helps us out.","When you look at the sand business, yeah, that local sand penetration has been with us now for a good 18 months. I will tell you that I would expect that those comparisons to slow over time. So maybe not the immediate near-term, but over the longer term, it certainly should, those comparisons should get easier for us.","Brian Ossenbeck","And then to follow-up on the trucking side, because I feel like you didn\u2019t get as much benefit when the cycle was tight, so a little surprised to hear that it\u2019s a bit of an overhang here in some of the markets?","Kenny Rocker","Yeah. We are keeping an eye on the trucking market. Over the last couple months and even over the last couple weeks, we are seeing it firm up a little bit. We are also keeping an eye on what will happen in terms of a peak season out there because there is some interplay between our domestic business and our international business. But right now, we would really appreciate more help from the overall economy.","Brian Ossenbeck","Got it. Then just one quick one for Lance. Can you just give us your view on regulatory environment and do you see, it still feels like it\u2019s a little more active, not necessarily active from that perspective. But are we certainly seeing a lot of movement in a few different areas than we have with labor negotiation that\u2019s starting up, which I appreciate you probably can\u2019t say too much on that. But just want since there\u2019s a lot coming between now and the end of the year just kicking off here, I just wanted to get your thoughts on topics more generally? Thanks.","Lance Fritz","Sure. So let\u2019s take them in two pieces. I will start with the regulatory environment. So the STB is poised to be fully staffed with five Board members in the not too distant future. And they have already started getting more active on a host of items that they are pursuing, either old items on the docket that just weren\u2019t handled over the course of the last five years and in some cases new items.","Our posture is we are continually engaged with the STB to help them understand what some of the negative impacts could be of some of the regulations that are being considered and also help them understand that each regulation can\u2019t really be taken on its own. It forms a mosaic of regulatory impact.","And the end game for the railroads for the STB is to make sure that the railroads are healthy and can continue to invest capital in the railroads so that we have a robust infrastructure to support the United States.","So we constantly are having dialogue and communication about current state of the railroad. How good the service product is? What we are working on? And what the risks are of some of the regulations that are being considered.","In terms of our negotiation with labor, you did see that there was a lawsuit filed against the Smart TD. That was to compel that specific union to negotiate on crew consist or at least consider that through arbitration as a negotiating item. That it was -- it\u2019s a technical matter and I look forward to that being addressed through the courts. The end of the current moratorium is November 1.","So sometime around that time frame, unions are free to put demands on the railroad management teams and railroad management is free to put demands for negotiating on unions. I anticipate that\u2019s going to happen. I anticipate it\u2019s going to be a robust negotiating season and I look forward to that, and I look forward to be able to work with our unions to continue to position Union Pacific as a competitive strong supporter of the U.S. economy.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. Thank you, Lance. Appreciate that.","Lance Fritz","Yeah.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.","Amit Mehrotra","Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask firstly about the profit potential, as volumes and revenue get better, some of the huge progress you have made on the cost side is, obviously, being masked a little bit by the revenue environment. So just in that context, when we do get back to revenue growth, hopefully, as soon as possible, probably, next year, can all of that incremental revenue drop to the bottom line, just help us think about the cost in the business whether structural or variable and how those -- which of those would have to increase once revenue growth kind of moves from negative to positive?","Rob Knight","Amit, this is Rob. I think you are spot on. We would love nothing more than to see volume be as positive as possible and there obviously are some direct volume variable costs that would come on Board with that, but at a very productive level.","But I think you hit the nail on the head, and that is we are well-positioned now as volume does return for the incremental margins to be impressive, because there is no, I mean, we won\u2019t have to add back the costs that we have been able to right-size and achieve through the Unified Plan 2020, so the efficiencies and the incremental margins, to your point, from the incremental volume that comes on Board should be extremely efficient.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay.","Jim Vena","That\u2019s where that work that the operating team has been doing on train size really pays off and when we talk about train size opportunity into the future, volume growth is just going to be our friend.","Amit Mehrotra","Right. And that\u2019s a good segue into my next question or follow-up question on the operating stats. The train length progress has been really impressive. I think it\u2019s like 8,000 feet or maybe a little bit more now. What -- I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a question for Lance or Jim, but what\u2019s the upper limit there, I mean, can you get to 10,000? How quickly can you increase that and have you made enough -- I know you made a bunch of investments reallocated some capital towards extending sidings earlier this year. Is that all done where now you can continue to grow that, just talk about how quickly you can continue to grow that because the progress there has obviously been impressive?","Lance Fritz","Well, thanks for the feedback, Amit. Listen, the team has done a great job. You don\u2019t change from a 7,000 foot railroad to an 8,000 foot railroad in nine months without touching a lot of places. We have a great network.","So that\u2019s what\u2019s nice about as business comes, which it\u2019s going to come, we drive more of it to the bottomline because the costs are not going to go up 1 to 1. In fact, I\u2019d be very interested to see what happens when the business goes up next year. ","Second is we will invest -- we found some places in this network that we need to invest and we will invest and make sure the same as we have done on the Sunset to increase train size and be more fluid and have less trains running with more product on it.","The upper limit, I don\u2019t guess. It\u2019s a traffic mix depending on what kind of traffic you have. We have some traffic that is very tough to build big trains with just because of origin and destination and others we have the possibility to be able to increase them.","So I continue to see improvement. I know what other railroads have had the capability of doing, one that I worked at. So I think we will buy that number that they have had without an issue next year as we build this infrastructure even better and harden it.","Rob Knight","There is one last thing to note here, and it\u2019s lost on a lot of people. It\u2019s a benefit of the train design that we have got Unified Plan 2020 and that is much more of our volume is running in mixed manifest traffic now.","Kenny talks about it from the perspective of that\u2019s enabling us to win business that we used to pass on because it wasn\u2019t conducive to a unique boutique train. Well, in the old days, if 40% or 45% of our network was in the manifest world, that number is looking more like two-thirds and three-quarters, which means volume can grow across different segments and we can leverage it into train size, whereas that opportunity to do that historically was probably a little more limited. So that\u2019s a big benefit of the Unified Plan 2020.","Amit Mehrotra","Yeah. That\u2019s helpful. Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Rob, congrats. I hope you don\u2019t miss these calls and our questions too much. Thanks so much.","Rob Knight","Actually, I will miss it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Jordan Alliger","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. A question for you, I know the network is in good shape for the incremental margin next year, volumes snapped back. Question, though, on the headcount front, can you gear up quickly or would you need to gear up quickly given how much reduction you have had so that you can ensure the operations from that perspective will run smoothly?","Lance Fritz","Yeah. I am going to at the highest level say, yes. We have changed a number of things that make our ability to be more agile on both the upside and the downside. But on the upside, our time to hire and train and bring out a crew, a conductor, has been cut dramatically. We are actually looking forward to the next time we have to add conductors to exercise that new muscle. Jim, there are some other things we have been doing. What are your thoughts?","Jim Vena","Lance, I think, you hit it right on the nail. The bottomline is, is I don\u2019t think we have to increase. We have an increase in business. We are not going to increase on a same percentage as we go up or going to become more efficient. It helps us become even more efficient.","I think we have shown what we could do this quarter. When you have this kind of an adjustment in volume and for us to drop 5,700 FTEs in the third quarter shows that we have got the capability to make the right adjustments when the business level is and a lot of that cut was because of the efficiencies that we built into the system. So I am looking forward to what happens the next few months and into the next year and I am very excited about it. I think the numbers will dictate a great result for this company moving forward.","Jordan Alliger","Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on intermodal, we keep hearing that service is much better from various folks out there on the rails. You guys as well intermodally. So when you talk to your customers, I mean, is it truly a price spread between what you offer versus trucks that\u2019s going to get the needle to move back to positive volumes, and if so, what sort of -- pick a length of haul, what sort of spread versus trucks percentage wise, let\u2019s say, induces a shipper to move the volume to rail, especially given the service and what have the discounts narrowed to now, if you have any input on that? Thanks.","Jim Vena","Yeah. You are right on that service has improved and our customers are realizing that and it will take a while. I mean, we are talking about a few months now where our service has really turned a corner from the weather event. The spot rates have now lowered. They are less than 20% from the highs where they were over 25% last year in terms of being depressed.","In terms of where we need to be in that delta, we have always said that we would like to be from the contracting rates anywhere from 10% to 15% lower than the contracted rates and so we will continue to see what happens in the marketplace going forward.","Lance Fritz","Hey, Jordan. This is Lance. Two points, one that the truck capacity, overcapacity of truck supply really needs to get adjusted for those spot rates and contract rates to start going back up. And then the second thing to note is, our service product consistent, reliable, over a period of time will start convincing customers who have historically split their book of business but would have benefited by putting more on rail to put more on rail. So over time, theoretically, I think, we should see more opportunity as opposed to less even in the status quo environment.","Jim Vena","I think the important thing is that we are already seeing wins. The commercial team is already putting together some wins out there that are specific to UP 2020 and so the expectation is that that will continue as we move forward in the next year.","Jordan Alliger","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your questions.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Good morning. And Rob, obviously, congrats and really enjoyed working with you through all the years, and to Jen on your new role of finding a way to talk to analysts again. Just a great call so far on the big picture, but maybe, Kenny, if I can just drill down maybe a little nearer term here, looks like we have started off the quarter even worse than the run rate that you are highlighting that the fourth quarter should look like third quarter, particularly at Energy and Premium, which are down 18%, 13% with the quarter now down 11%, so a bit worse than third quarter. Is there anything you would put that on flood, snow, anything you look to turn around on easier comps as we move forward?","Lance Fritz","Yeah. If you look at it, clearly we have some tough comps. I think we all remember some of the pull aheads that we were faced on the intermodal side especially with our international intermodal, and clearly, natural gas is in a different place than it was around the same time last year. So structurally those are two fundamental issues that are there.","We will continue to also keep an eye on what\u2019s going on in the automotive industry. Our Detroit team is working with GM, and although, we didn\u2019t see a significant impact in the third quarter, we are going to be working with them and all the auto players to see the impacts that it\u2019s having early on in the fourth quarter.","Ken Hoexter","Okay. But just to, I guess, understand that, the pull ahead would make it even tougher comps. So you are saying that was maybe an earlier quarter event so it gets easier as the quarter rolls on?","Lance Fritz","No. What I am saying is that those comps are impacting what you are seeing in terms of the delta that we are down.","Ken Hoexter","Okay.","L","For this quarter. Yeah.","Jim Vena","Since start\u2026","Lance Fritz","Since start\u2026","Jim Vena","Since start of the quarter.","Ken Hoexter","Yeah. All right. And then, Jim, great slide on kind of the newer moves on kind of continued rationalization. Are there maybe your thoughts on additional yards or is it incremental from this point forward as you have cleaned out the humps, just trying to see if there are any more step function improvements that you see as you move into 2020?","Jim Vena","I think, if you look at what we are trying to do, it\u2019s a great question, because I look at it holistically for the whole company, not just looking at numbers of what we are doing. All we are trying to do is move cars as fast as possible, remove the touch points and give better service product and that\u2019s what we are doing. And this is a winning game, so we drop our operating, we have become the most efficient railroad in North America, we are able to then compete against everybody. ","So what I see out there is we just started. We are truly baseball season, great time of the year, maybe not if you are a Yankee fan right now, a little tough, but at the end of it, I think, that we are early innings and we still have a lot to do productivity-wise in this company, and stay tuned, and we will move ahead and I will announce them as we are ready to go.","Ken Hoexter","All right. Great. I think the Yankees would say it\u2019s still early. So thanks a lot, guys.","Jim Vena","I was waiting for that. I was waiting for that comeback. Appreciate it.","Ken Hoexter","Appreciate the time, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.","Allison Landry","Thanks. Good morning. And congrats to Rob and Jennifer. Maybe, Jim, just following up on your recent comments about productivity. Could you maybe give us your initial thoughts on what this could look like in 2020 given that the improvement in the key metrics have really accelerated here recently? And maybe without asking you to put a specific number on it, because there a reason to think at least directionally that it should be bigger than the $500 million or plus this year?","Jim Vena","I am not going to put a number on next year. Let\u2019s wait and see what we -- where we end up with and where we want to put the place mark for next year. But operationally and what I see in this company and what I have seen from my history is that we will continue to improve our efficiency.","We will be able to draw more business on because we win in the marketplace with a better product. We look at it end-to-end. I am going to try to make Kenny\u2019s job easier moving forward. So I think it\u2019s a win-win for us moving ahead and that\u2019s about as close as I will get to giving you any numbers.","Allison Landry","Okay. Fair enough. And as you go through the network rationalization process, have you seen any meaningful opportunities for line sales?","Jim Vena","Stay tuned. We will just work through it as the business mix and what we look at. I think we have already got a pretty good plan of what we look at our network. But at this point nothing to announce.","Allison Landry","Okay. Thank you.","Jim Vena","You are welcome. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.","David Vernon","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the time. Kenny, I wanted to ask you a long-term question about the Energy franchise, obviously, you have got coal and sand challenges right now. You have got a plus signup of petroleum products. I\u2019d like to understand kind of what kind of flows near-term are driving you positive and what do you think is the risk that that positive could shift negative as we get into 2020 and the pipeline complex gets closer to being built out up in the Bakken?","Kenny Rocker","Yeah. So longer term, again, we think the comps for the sand will improve. We will see what happens there. On the crude oil side, we feel very optimistic about that market and we -- I look at that as a couple to a few years type of opportunity and we are gearing up, and we have got the resources out there, and I think you have read where the government has increased the curtailment, so we are expecting more volume to come along.","David Vernon","Is that predominantly Canadian origin stuff, or is that also some stuff coming out of the Bakken?","Kenny Rocker","That is the Canadian origin that we are looking at into the Gulf.","David Vernon","Okay. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the growth near-term?","Kenny Rocker","Correct.","David Vernon","Okay. And then, maybe just as a quick follow-up in the Industrial Products sort of segment, the average RPU [ph] came in a little bit softer. Can you talk a little bit about what the mix dynamic is going on inside of that segment and what the outlook is there sort of over the next couple quarters?","Kenny Rocker","Yeah. So Rob talked about this a little bit earlier, and we really have got some strong double-digit growth on the construction products. Our rock shipments have a shorter length of haul. That\u2019s there. You could possibly make the -- as you look at a lot of the Petrochem business, it\u2019s also a lot that moves inside and interchange into the Gulf. So you have got a strong mix there of growth that is not as longer haul as say some of the other pieces of business like our lumber that\u2019s down.","David Vernon","And will that -- will those sort of mix trends sort of continue for the foreseeable future or do you see any sort of major shifts ahead or it\u2019s just kind of this shift continuing?","Kenny Rocker","We would expect both the Petrochem and the Construction Product business to continue to grow. I think the economy will help us out with the housing market right now, it\u2019s been pretty flat, and again, that\u2019s also truck susceptible. So a stronger economy will help us compete better in that housing market and we would hope for a little bit more help with the overall side there.","David Vernon","All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for getting my question in, and Rob, congrats as well. I am just going to ask one, but this may be a longer term question. When you guys look at the Intermodal business, if we comp you relative to industry growth, I think, Union Pacific has probably fallen behind there over the last decade, but obviously you guys have improved returns and margins in that time period. So I guess looking forward with the new operating plan, I mean, is Intermodal a now more attractive business than maybe it was in the past or you guys have been calling out for a couple of years here competitive pressures. I mean, is that more competition from north of the border that Jim might know very well or how do you think about it looking forward?","Lance Fritz","Yeah. So let\u2019s talk about the Intermodal business broken into two pieces, international and domestic. They are both attractive. Our work on cost structure has made growth in both attractive to us presuming it\u2019s in the right price.","And from a domestic Intermodal perspective, we have got a track record of growing domestic intermodal up until about the last call it 18 months and I think that has more to do with the flip on truck capacity than almost anything else. Once overcapacity happens in trucks, there\u2019s just a lot of behavior that breaks out the marketplace that makes it difficult to grow in an attractive return.","Our current cost structure has changed the playing field for us in terms of what\u2019s an attractive piece of business and our current service product has changed the playing field so that customers look at us and think, boy, they are a viable alternative to my truck network. So both of those I think should be positives for us to get back on the path of growing domestic Intermodal. That still needs to also occur in the context of truck capacity getting right-sized.","Internationally, there is no doubt that Southern California ports have lost some market share both to Canada and to a smaller degree the East Coast ports and that is troubling. And that I think has less to do, I know it has less to do with our service product from California ports to, let\u2019s say, places like Chicago and more to do with the overall cost and infrastructure of landing a box and paying fees at ports.","So we are really trying to help the port of -- ports in California along the West Coast of the United States understand those dynamics and understand that it\u2019s a very competitive environment and the whole supply chain has to be involved in winning that business back to the West Coast ports.","Net-net, our service product is being designed on an end-to-end game. So it\u2019s not just the transit over the road we are worried about, what dray looks like around our facilities in Chicago, what grounding looks like, how quickly we can turn our equipment with stripping and reloading, all that is moving in the right direction, and I think, all that is going to create opportunity in the future. We need to do that in partnership with our ports as well and we are.","Brandon Oglenski","And well, I said, I was only going to ask one, but I guess, Lance, in that regard, I mean, have you guys changed your marketing efforts on the Intermodal side to address some of these challenges?","Lance Fritz","For sure we are having those conversations. You have seen our product design change. We de-market it and got out of low density lanes. We have changed the layout of our Intermodal ramps in Chicago so that they are much more focused and dedicated. For instance, G4 in Joliet on international, G2 in Proviso on domestic, G-- the yard center on North-South on automotive parts and that\u2019s helping.","So, yeah, I would say, we are addressing the marketplace in a different way to have a service product that wins. And it\u2019s a good looking service product right now. And right now it\u2019s basically up to the marketplace, and Kenny\u2019s team to make those matches happen and to get essentially the truck overcapacity back into the right box.","Kenny Rocker","Yeah. We have turned on things like the Intermodal reservation terminal reservation so that our customers have really good visibility on which containers or which boxes they are going to move on what date. So it takes out any confusion or ambiguity there, which the customers love.","Brandon Oglenski","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.","Walter Spracklin","Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone, and yeah, congrats, Rob, Jennifer, on the new roles and the new retirement. Best of luck. I want to come back on your answer to the intermodal difference between you and BN. When I see a company that is implementing PSR the way Jim is doing it at Union Pacific, ripping out that level of workforce and locomotives and so on. I would expect some service disruption, and I would argue that these declines relative to your closest peer would be par for the course here. Is there any of that going on. I mean, that would suggest that the disruption and the decline is temporary and that when you are completed your PSR, you can use it as a weapon rather than a cost reduction tool. You can use it as a share gain weapon and just stay tuned for more rather than your commentary about a real competitive environment. I mean, that doesn\u2019t leave -- that\u2019s a much more negative, I think, if you are pointing at a more competitive or a competitor, I guess, is a little less encouraging than if it was just due to temporary disruption on service, any comments on that?","Lance Fritz","Yeah. Walter, so let me put a little finer point on the answer that we gave a little while back. Specific to Intermodal, specific to rationalizing our lanes, that impact might be a couple of 3 percentage points. So you are right, there\u2019s a bit of that and I would expect us to grow back through that.","But there is still a piece in that particular marketplace that is both truck overcapacity that has to get back in the box and it will. Those always ebb and flow over time in business cycles and I think those are the two big moving parts.","Walter Spracklin","Okay. And then just following up on the pace, Jim, of PSR adoption, in the past we have always noted it to be very fast, very significant early on. This quarter compared to Q2 was effectively flattish, obviously, we were expecting a little bit better given you had a lot of flood impacts in the second quarter, hoping for a bit more of a improved third quarter relative to the second quarter. I don\u2019t want to answer it for you, but obviously prior PSR implementation generally has been done in a nice strong economy and growth environment. Is that the reason why we are seeing a bit more of a muted pace in the early execution or is there another reason?","Jim Vena","Son of a gun, I am telling you, Walter. So 5,700 FTEs, 13% drop versus volume 8%, train length up 16%, dwell time dropped, freight velocity up, workforce productivity on a dropping business model better, so if that\u2019s average, son of a gun, I want average again next quarter, okay? That\u2019s the way I look at it.","I think we have got to be smart about it. We don\u2019t want to blow up the place. I could have park a thousand locomotives the first day I showed up. I am not going to do that. I think it\u2019s a long game and I don\u2019t mean long by years, but it\u2019s a long game, do it right. Get the right product and this whole intermodal discussion, it\u2019s a great question, and this is where we want to be.","We want to be where we have a very efficient railroad. We are able to open up new markets. We are able to beat the competition which is other railroads and truck and bring more product in without dropping our price. So that\u2019s the game we are playing. I am excited about it, Walter, and you are a tough, your kids must hate coming home with their score cards, you are a tough marker.","Walter Spracklin","Appreciate the color. Thanks.","Lance Fritz","You are welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Seidl","Thank you, Operator. Rob, I have to offer, one, my congratulations on your retirement. I think sitting in my chair for as long as I have I am definitely jealous of seeing somebody retire. Also, it\u2019s been a pleasure to work with you over the years. You have been extremely generous with your time and always gracious with your responses. Jennifer, welcome back. All I can say if you are going to work with us analysts again you must be a glutton for punishment. Two quick questions here, one, Jim, clearly there\u2019s been a lot of success here in PSR. But train speeds are the one thing that I would call out that I am a little bit surprised at. I knew there were some puts and takes, but relatively flat in a declining environment. Can you talk a little bit about that and what we should expect going forward and then I have one more follow-up.","Jim Vena","Okay. So let\u2019s talk about train speed. People want to worry about train speed. I look at car velocity which is the end-to-end measure that the customer looks at. It\u2019s not just a subsection. So what we have done is we have taken some of our trains that used to run through and been able to not stop and get end-to-end, and we have added work events for them. We get them at 3,000 or 4,000 cars instead of running extra trains.","So at this point, we are looking through that. What I see moving forward is, we will have the fastest train velocity of anybody in the railroad network that we compare ourselves to. So we are working towards that and I expect some noise some more.","If I have a choice of increasing the train speed by a tenth of 1% and running the car velocity quicker and being able to drop the number of cars I need by 5,000, I will take the car drop and car velocity over the train speed. So that\u2019s where my mind is with it.","Jason Seidl","Okay. Fair enough. And my last question, Rob, I am going to go for you for old time\u2019s sake. You talked a bit about rent expense dropping. You mentioned volume is one of the reasons it was off over 13% in the quarter. Given that volumes are going to be down on a similar fashion in 4Q, would you expect rent expense to be about down the same in 4Q as it was in 3Q?","Rob Knight","Yeah. Without a fine point on it, I can\u2019t see any reason why directionally it wouldn\u2019t look similar to the third quarter.","Jason Seidl","Okay. I appreciate the time as always.","Lance Fritz","All right. Thanks, Jason.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.","Fadi Chamoun","Yes. Good morning and thanks for squeezing me in here. Congratulations, Rob and Jennifer, on the announcements. One question for Jim, I mean, the operating ratio will have a pace that is also influenced by some of the topline dynamic we are seeing. But if I think in terms of actual progress on redesigning the operating plan and rationalizing the classification assets and all the kind of Unified Plan 2020 you are doing. Does less volume help you get more things done, and hopefully, as we come out of this volume downturn we can see a stronger payback than we would have otherwise?","Jim Vena","No. Fadi, in fact, it\u2019s the other way the way I see it. I would love to have increase in volume come on. Volume helps us in that we are able to really run the place more efficiently and more -- as cars come on on the same trains that we are operating on. So I see volume as a helper. It helps us both topline and bottomline. But on top of that efficiency wise it helps us even better. So that\u2019s exactly what we want, Fadi.","Fadi Chamoun","Okay. And maybe one quick follow-up. Thanks for that, Jim. If we do see next year another challenging volume environment down mid-single digits, is there any constraint or any roadblock that would prevent you from taking another 10% plus out of the headcount?","Jim Vena","I hate to be negative but the answer is no. We will react on what the market gives us. What the competition gives us and what is available for the economy. So we will react in the right way up or down and I am hoping that it\u2019s up and everything that we see is with the floods and everything we have we see a good year starting next year. So that\u2019s where we are, Fadi.","Lance Fritz","We are looking forward to volume presuming the economy stays healthy. I would love to see a little bit of growth. That would be welcome. But whatever the economy is, Rob says this, it\u2019s probably a fitting ending to the call. Rob says that every time we get together and that is the economy is what the economy is. We deal with the hand that we are dealt and we don\u2019t use that as an excuse and we won\u2019t.","Fadi Chamoun","Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.","Lance Fritz","Thanks, Fadi.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments.","Lance Fritz","Thank you, Rob, and thank you all for your questions. In closing, we have made really good progress in the third quarter delivering a more consistent reliable service product with a fundamentally smaller cost structure. And although, I\u2019d much prefer a growth environment, our operating performance gives us a lot of confidence that as volume returns to the network, we are going to leverage it very efficiently and return even stronger results. With that, I look forward to talking with you again in January to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."],"20611":["Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) Q3 2014 Earnings Call October 23, 2014  8:45 AM ET","Executives","John J.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you Mr. Koraleski, you may begin.","John J. Koraleski","Thank you, Rob and good morning everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Lance Fritz, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, we're pleased to report that Union Pacific achieved third quarter earnings of $1.53 per share, an increase of 23% compared to the third quarter of 2013 and another quarterly record. Total volumes were up 7% and the increases were nearly across the board. We saw growth in 5 of our 6 business groups with particular strength in Agricultural Products, Industrial Products and our Intermodal shipments.","Coming out of the first half, we were pleased to see the strong volume growth continue through the third quarter. These strong volumes along with solid core pricing drove a 2.5-point improvement in our operating ratio to a record 62.3% for the quarter. And as we continue to focus on improving our service, we are encouraged by the accomplishments that we achieved in the quarter.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Eric.","Eric L. Butler","Thanks, Jack and good morning. Volume was up 7% in the third quarter as solid demand across our franchise led to volume gains in 5 of our 6 business groups. We continue to see strong gains in Ag Products, Industrial Products and Intermodal. We also saw gains in Automotive and Chemicals, and Coal volume was flat for the quarter.","Core price improved over 2.5% to help average revenue per car improve 3.5%. The volume growth and improved average revenue per car combined to drive freight revenue up 11%, which set an all-time quarterly record of over $5.8 billion.","Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. Ag Products had another strong quarter and once again led our volume growth. Revenue was up 19% in the third quarter on a 14% increase in volume and a 4% improvement in average revenue per car. Grain carloadings were up 34% this quarter as we continued to benefit from a strong U.S. supply and lower commodity prices. Export feed grain demand to Mexico, China and Southeast Asia were strong, and domestic feed grain shipments were solid across most of our franchise. We did see softer wheat exports this quarter, which partially offset our volume gains.","Grain products volume grew by 6%, driven by another strong quarter in ethanol shipments. We also saw strength in canola, meal and DDG [ph] shipments.","Finally, food and refrigerated segments were up 3% for the quarter, as volume increases and import beer more than offset declines in frozen foods, canned goods and import sugar shipments.","Automotive revenue was up 3% in the third quarter on a 5% increase in volume. Average revenue per car was down 1%, driven again by the previously reported change in the way we handle per diem revenue and also by mix. Strong consumer demand drove finished vehicle shipments up 5% this quarter. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for North American Automotive production was 16.7 million vehicles in the third quarter, up 1 million units from the same quarter in '13 and the highest level since 2006.","On the parts side, strong production and a continued focus on over-the-road conversions drove a 3% volume increase.","Turning to Chemicals, our revenue was up 6% for the quarter on a 2% volume increase and a 4% improvement in average revenue per car. We continued to see strength in our Industrial Chemicals volume, which was up 7% in the third quarter. The demand was driven by a variety of end-use markets such as shale-related drilling and various housing-related applications.","Liquid petroleum gas shipments were up 12% for the quarter, driven by new business to an LPG storage facility on our franchise. We also saw an increase in demand for fuel additive imports in Canada and propane exports to Mexico. Partially offsetting our volume gains in Chemicals was crude oil, which declined 10% in the third quarter. As previously discussed, increased production in Texas limited shipments of Bakken crude oil to the Gulf region. However, we were able to partially offset the decline from Bakken with gains from other origins.","Coal revenue increased 2% on a 2% increase in average revenue per car and flat volume. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 2% for the quarter. Strong demand from lower inventories mostly offset volume headwinds from our previously reported legacy contract loss and a relatively mild summer. Volume was also negatively impacted early in the quarter from flooding in Iowa that interrupted service along our east-west main line.","We continued to see increased demand in the Western part of our network, which drove Colorado\/Utah tonnage up 13%.","In our Industrial Products business, revenue increased 19% on a 12% increase in volume and a 7% improvement in average revenue per car. Once again, nonmetallic minerals led to growth in Industrial Products with volume up 30% for the quarter. Frac sand shipments were up 39% as we continued to see strong demand to most shale formations.","Our lumber shipments were up 15% in the quarter. While steady improvement in the housing market increased demand, we're also seeing over-the-road conversions in many markets as order sizes increase and truck capacity tightens. And we continued to see strength in construction product shipments where volume was up 11%, driven by demand for aggregates and cement.","Finally, in Intermodal, revenue was up 15% driven by a 10% increase in volume and a 4% improvement in average revenue per unit. Domestic Intermodal was up 13% in the quarter. Continued demand for new premium services and highway conversions contributed to a best-ever quarter for Domestic Intermodal volume. Our International Intermodal volume was up 8% as continued economic strength and new business volume carried over into the third quarter.","Similar to the second quarter, we believe some of the portion of this strength can be attributed to cargo owners advancing peak-season shipments in anticipation of a possible impasse during the renegotiations of labor contracts at West Coast ports.","To wrap up, let's take a look at how we see our business shaping up for the remainder of 2014. In Ag Products, all signs point to another record crop for corn and soybeans this year. Although the harvest got off to a slow start, we're optimistic for a strong finish to the year in grain. Though remember that our comp gets much more difficult starting in the fourth quarter. We also think ethanol shipments will be strong and we expect continued strength for import beer.","In Automotive, finished vehicles and auto parts shipments will continue to benefit from strength in production and sales.","Most of our Chemicals markets should remain solid for the remainder of 2014, though crude oil will likely continue to be a headwind. Low inventory levels should drive demand for Coal in the fourth quarter. We are hopeful that the weather cooperates as we continue to improve operational efficiencies.","In Industrial Products, we expect the strength in frac sands to continue and we remain cautiously optimistic about the construction and housing markets. New product offerings and highway conversions will drive demand in Domestic Intermodal, and we continue to believe that the International Intermodal will benefit from an improving economy. But we expect growth to moderate in the fourth quarter as we believe the international peak season is largely behind us.","Overall, the U.S. economy continues to show signs of strengthening, but we are keeping a close eye on softening economies in various parts of the world. Our diverse franchise and strong value proposition will continue to support business development efforts across our network and we expect a strong finish to the year.","With that, I'll turn it over to Lance.","Lance M. Fritz","Thanks, Eric and good morning. Starting with safety. Our team continues to address risk in the work place and to generate record safety results. The performance is noteworthy given our current network variability. Training and deploying thousands of new employees introduces risk as the new hires get a feel for their work. We rely on each team's commitment to risk reduction, Total Safety Culture and the principles of Courage to Care to counter that risk.","As a result, our year-to-date employee personal injury rate of 1.09 was 4% better than 2013 and a year-to-date record low. On a technical note, we have restated our employee personal injury rates for 2011 through 2014 year-to-date due to an overstatement of employee hours during this period. The absolute number of injuries reported was not affected.","In rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate improved 7% to 3.04 and also set a year-to-date record. Continued investments in our infrastructure and advanced defect detection technology drove a reduction in track- and equipment-induced derailments. We also made progress on human factor incidents through enhanced skills training and standard work.","In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased slightly versus 2013. To make continued progress, we are reinforcing public awareness through targeted safety campaigns in local communities and businesses. We are also developing analytics to assess crossing risks, which will enable us to target those with the greatest safety impact. Overall, we've made real progress on generating safety improvements on our way to an incident-free environment.","The third quarter was a challenge for the operating team with significant weather events, robust volume growth and interline connectivity issues. During the third quarter, flooding and subsequent washouts on several key routes materially impacted operations. The 84 days with major service interruptions resulting from weather and incidents were the most we have ever recorded in a quarter since we first started tracking the measure back in 2005. In comparison, the average for the third quarter since 2005 has been 37 weather and incident interruption days.","Variability also resulted from the construction of major capacity projects, most notably the Tower 55 project in Fort Worth, Texas. This public-private partnership, completed in late August, created operational efficiencies and additional capacity by reconfiguring and adding additional track through a key bottleneck in our network. However, a project of this magnitude required us to reroute significant train traffic to facilitate installation. Given the more-than-100 trains per day that traverse through this intersection, the reroutes placed additional pressure on the network during the quarter.","Reflecting this variability, our service performance fell short during the third quarter. As reported to the AAR, third quarter velocity was down 10% and freight car dwell up 13% when compared to 2013. We have maintained velocity around 24 miles per hour while addressing these operational challenges in moving growing volumes. The team has adjusted transportation plans to use alternate switching yards and gateways, realigned resources to where they are needed most, and employed the use of our surge resources.","The interruptions and their subsequent reductions on network capacity also drove a decline in our Service Delivery Index, which gauges how well we are meeting overall customer commitments. On a more positive note, we were able to maintain local service within a reasonable range, registering a 93.3% Industry Spot & Pull. This metric, which reflects the tighter service commitments we introduced this year, measures whether a car is delivered to or pulled from a customer's facility on time.","Our team is working very hard to handle customers' growing volumes while improving service and we remain focused on making it happen. To support our customers' volume growth, we have increased our total TE&Y workforce by more than 1,100 employees and our active locomotive fleet by around 900 units since September of last year. And we've stepped up our resource plan throughout the year to handle growing volumes and provide the level of service that our customers have come to expect.","As to our workforce, we are now planning to hire around 3,600 TE&Y employees to cover growth and attrition, up from the 3,200 we discussed back in July. Approximately 2,500 of these 3,600 have already been hired. And while some of these employees are already active in day-to-day operations, a good portion of these new hires are still in our training pipeline. Around 1,100 will be moving into active operations in the fourth quarter.","We also have plans to acquire an additional 32 locomotives this year, bringing our new total to 261 units, up from 229. Around 200 of these units are now on property and deployed across the network.","And a quick update on CapEx. We still plan to spend around $4.1 billion this year, including the additional 32 locomotives I just mentioned. While we are largely on schedule, timing issues on a few projects keeps our overall projection unchanged. And while we still haven't finalized our overall 2015 capital program, we do plan to acquire around 200 new locomotives next year. Our capital investments help maintain a safe, strong and resilient network and include investments in service, growth and productivity that allow us to handle growing rail volumes.","Moving to productivity. The volume trends we saw in the first half of the year were largely sustained in the third quarter, with volume growth in each network region. We generated solid productivity with the volume growth despite the operational headwinds we faced during the quarter. So while we incurred some incremental costs associated with congestion, we improved network productivity by increasing average train lengths in nearly all major categories and by adjusting the T-Plan to reduce work events.","The chart on the lower right demonstrates our ability to leverage growing manifest volumes through UP's terminal infrastructure. During the quarter, we switched 7% more cars with a 5% increase in yard and local employee days versus 2013. The result was an all-time quarterly record in terminal productivity. Our employees are bringing their expertise to bear on improving service, safety and efficiency by standardizing work and reducing variability to drive our operating ratio to an all-time record.","Wrapping up. Our first order of business is to safely improve network performance while satisfying customer demand. We are working hard to provide customers with a value proposition that supports growth with high levels of service. As I've previously mentioned, our recovery is partly dependent on interchange fluidity, so we continue to work with our connecting railroads to improve performance at key gateways. We expect to generate record safety results on our way to an incident-free environment. We will continue to make sound investments in resources and network capacity to overcome congestion and service interruptions and to handle increased demand. Our focus on reducing variability in the network has never been more important to generating sequential improvement. Ultimately, running a safe, reliable and efficient railroad creates value for our customers and increased returns for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert M. Knight","Thanks, Lance and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue grew 11% to nearly $6.2 billion, driven by strong volume growth and solid core pricing. Operating expenses totaled just under $3.9 billion, increasing 7% over last year. And even though our network continues to run at suboptimal levels, our operating income still grew 19% to $2.3 billion.","Below the line, other income totaled $20 million, down $8 million from 2013. Interest expense of $144 million was up 4% compared to the previous year. Primary drivers were increased debt issuance during the first 9 months of this year.","Income tax expense increased to $836 million, driven primarily by higher pretax earnings. Net income grew 19% versus 2013, while the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce best ever quarterly earnings of $1.53 per share, up 23% versus last year.","Turning to the top line. Freight revenue grew 11% to over $5.8 billion. This was driven primarily by volume growth of 7% and core pricing gains of just over 2.5%. A positive lag impact on our fuel surcharge program added approximately 1 point in freight revenue growth. Business mix added another 0.5 point as the positive mix impact in grain and frac sand volume more than offset the increase in lower average revenue per car Intermodal shipments during the quarter.","Other revenue increased 12% in the quarter. Primary drivers included revenue associated with the per diem on auto parts containers as well as subsidiary-related volume growth. Recall that beginning last year, per diem revenue on auto parts containers is now reported in other revenue as a result of a change in how we are compensated for this service.","Slide 22 provides more detail on the impact of changing fuel prices on our fuel surcharge revenue. Represented by the blue line, you can see how diesel fuel prices declined in August and September. Remember, there is about a 2-month lag before the price of diesel fuel actually flows to our surcharge revenue. The dashed line reflects that 2-month lag.","In periods of falling fuel prices, earnings benefit from the surcharge lag. On a year-over-year basis, the surcharge lag added about $0.04 per share to our third quarter 2014 earnings. This includes $0.02 of positive impact in the third quarter of this year as well as $0.02 of negative impact during the same period last year.","As we look ahead, it's hard to say what might actually happen with fuel prices. It's a little like trying to predict the economy. So whilst we've been seeing a modest benefit to start off the fourth quarter, much can change between now and near the end of the year.","Slide 23 provides more detail on our core pricing trends in 2014. Third quarter core pricing came in at just above 2.5%. This is up slightly from our first-half average, reflecting continued core pricing gains. And our commitment to a strategy of pricing to market at re-investable levels that are above inflation remain solidly intact.","Moving on to the expense side. Slight 24 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which increased 8% versus 2013. Higher volumes, inflation and increased training expense were the primary drivers of the increase along with some increased costs associated with running a less-than-optimal network.","Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count was up 2% when compared to 2013. However, the reduction in the number of employees associated with capital projects helped to offset some of the increase in noncapital-related workforce levels. If you exclude capital-related employees, our workforce was up over 3% with the majority of this increase coming in our TE&Y ranks.","For the full year in total, we are now revising our previous estimates. We now plan to hire over 5,500 people to cover growth and expected attrition of just under 4,000. This total does include the increase in TE&Y hiring, which Lance just discussed. From a timing perspective, about 30% of this hiring is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of this year. Going forward, you should expect to see our workforce levels grow with volume, but not at the same rate of increase. Labor inflation is still expected to come in under 2% for the full year in part reflecting favorable pension expense.","Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $882 million, up 2% when compared to 2013, driven primarily by higher gross ton-miles associated with increased volumes and lower diesel fuel prices. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 1% while our average fuel price declined 5% to $3.01 per gallon.","Moving on to the other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense increased 11% to $650 million due to higher locomotive and freight car material costs, volume-related contract and subsidiary expenses, and crew transportation and lodging expenses. Depreciation expense was $481 million, up 8% compared to 2013, consistent with our 7% to 8% full year guidance.","Slide 27 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $310 million, which is flat when compared to 2013. Higher volume-related freight car rental expense was offset by lower freight car and container lease costs. Lease costs are lower as a result of exercising purchase options on some of our leased equipment.","Other expenses came in at $242 million, up $37 million versus last year. Higher state and local taxes, damaged freight and equipment costs and personal injury expense contributed to the year-over-year increase. Year-to-date other expenses are up 5%, within the range of our full year guidance of an increase between 5% and 10% excluding any unusual items.","Turning to our operating ratio performance. We achieved a quarterly record operating ratio of 62.3%, improving 2.5 points when compared to 2013. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we achieved a 64.2% operating ratio, an improvement of 2.3 per [ph] points over last year. With 3 quarters now complete, we are in a solid position to achieve our long-term guidance on a full year basis of a sub-65% operating ratio this year.","Turning now to our cash flow. Year-to-date cash from operations totaled nearly $5.4 billion. This is up almost 10% when compared to 2013. Recall, this amount is tempered by the headwind this year in bonus depreciation and the timing of cash tax payments. Capital invested totaled $3.3 billion year-to-date.","In addition, we returned about $1.2 billion in dividend payments to our shareholders. Taking a look at the balance sheet, we increased our adjusted debt by approximately $1.7 billion since the first of the year, bringing our adjusted debt balance to $14.5 billion at quarter end. This takes our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio to 40.2%, up from 37.6% at year end 2013. This puts us in line with our target of an adjusted debt-to-cap ratio of approximately 40%. And we continue to work towards our target of an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.5.","We also continue to be opportunistic in our share repurchases. Since the first of the year, we've bought back over 24 million shares, totaling about $2.3 billion. This brings our cumulative share repurchases since 2007 to 237 million shares. When you combine dividend payments with our share repurchases, we returned more than $3.5 billion to our shareholders in the first 3 quarters of this year. These combined payments represent a 47% increase over 2013, continuing our focus on rewarding shareholders with increased cash returns.","So that's the recap of our third quarter results. As we look to close out the year, we are well positioned to report a record year in many of our key financial measures. Of course, we still need the economy to cooperate, but the business fundamentals remain strong and are supported by our solid core pricing initiatives.","I would also like to remind everyone that as we have previously announced, we have an Investor Day coming up in a couple of weeks on November 5 in Chicago. So as we look past 2014 and into next year and beyond, we look forward to providing you our thoughts and views at that point in time.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Jack.","John J. Koraleski","Okay. Thanks, Rob. Well, as you've heard from the team today, we're feeling pretty good about the remainder of the year. Assuming that the economy and weather cooperate, we are well positioned to finish up the year with record results. We continue to see tremendous opportunity across our diverse franchise and we remain focused on improving our network velocity and fluidity so that we can leverage these opportunities by safely providing our customers with excellent service and our shareholders with strong returns.","So with that, we're going to go ahead and open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jack, just given that I'm the first here, I guess I'm going to ask a question that you probably know is coming. There's been some discussion around M&A in the industry right now and definitely proposals to fix the service issues facing the carriers. So I know you talked about it in the last call, or said effectively you don't think M&A can happen. But do you believe that combinations of the east-west carriers could potentially alleviate some of the congestion that you're seeing right now?","John J. Koraleski","Brandon, I am not convinced that merging is the way you solve service issues in this industry. And particularly right now, I don't think mergers make sense and I still believe that. I think, when you look ahead to the regulatory hurdles that are out there, the STB, the new rules basically say that any combination is going to have to enhance competition as opposed to the past when it was just maintain competition. And secondly, that they will consider the triggering effects of additional consolidations. So that really does add a whole layer of concern for me as I think about the prospects of future mergers. So I'm not a fan and I really don't believe that's the best way to fix the service situation.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, when you look at the overlap, though, of the networks, do you believe there's a lot of competitive overlap in some of these combinations? Or are there, potentially, combinations that could help some of these bottlenecks where you wouldn't have significant competitive concern?","John J. Koraleski","When we come across bottlenecks, we work really hard with our interline partners to solve them. And I don't see that merging is the way to eliminate bottlenecks.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe just a question on pricing. I want to get a rough sense of sort of how you think about the pricing environment, particularly when you're looking out to 2015. Obviously, volumes are sort of getting back up towards previous peak levels. Just kind of want to get a rough sense about how you feel about that and a potential re-acceleration, if we could see one, in 2015 up from about the 2.5% you've been doing the last couple of quarters.","John J. Koraleski","Chris, we like to -- what we're seeing in the marketplace today in terms of the volume that's taking place and the demand and clearly, when a market reacts that way, the pricing environment gets better. I don't know, Eric, you want to put some technical around that?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, Jack, you're right. We've said in the past that as demand strengthens, we see our ability and our strong value proposition to continue to allow us to take price and we're excited about the future opportunities.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that is helpful. And then if I could just ask a follow-up question, specifically as it pertains to Intermodal. You've had some fairly strong results on the Intermodal side. Just want to get a rough sense, maybe if we can parse out is there-- how we think about sort of the core business and then the competitive potential opportunities that maybe you've seen over the course of this year. And maybe if it's just sort of a mix dynamic that's playing into that Intermodal average revenue per car. Just want to get a sense of how that is trending because it seems to be a bit of a standout.","John J. Koraleski","Okay. Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. I think we've been saying the whole year, talking about our new products and services, and as we're rolling out our new products and services, it's really driving our value proposition and our ability to convert truck, particularly long-haul truck, to the rail. And again, that value proposition continues to allow us to price to market and strengthen our prices and it's just a continuation of the trend that we've had.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And the fourth quarter, that's sort of the same dynamic, potentially, with international being a little bit maybe softer and then the domestic side continuing to do what it's been doing.","Eric L. Butler","Yes. As you know, there's always kind of a cycle throughout the year in terms of the volumes quarter-to-quarter, and we expect that cycle throughout the year to be similar this year as it was previous year. But given that, yes, we see our strong value proposition and the trend to continue.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Just had a question on whether or not you all have estimated the cost of the network performance issues that you incurred in the third quarter. You were able to put up, obviously, just spectacular numbers. But I suspect that if things have been more fluid, you would've done even better than that. Any estimates on the cost of that set of challenges? And also, was there any revenue missed due to performance issues or interline issues?","John J. Koraleski","Hey, Rob, why don't you take a shot at that?","Robert M. Knight","Yes, John, that -- it's difficult to kind of nail that down, as you know. Roughly -- clearly, there was some cost. I'd say, it cost us probably $0.01 or so on the cost. But as we pointed out, we recognize that we didn't meet all of the demand in our Coal business, for example. So there's some revenue that, clearly, we hope to continue to make up as we move forward, but that had an impact as well.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","And then on the reduced year-over-year crude volumes, is there any hope for making up some of that by connecting with the Canadian carriers and hauling some of the heavy sour out of Alberta down to the Gulf Coast?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, John, as we've said in the past, our strategy is to strengthen our franchise to provide optionality between origins and destinations. We're still doing that. We're heading down that path. As you know, we don't control the flows. The spreads are going to drive that and the price of oil is going to drive that. In terms of the Canadian perspective, I certainly think that as oil goes to $85, $80, the Canadian heavies probably have more headwinds than they do at $100 or $110 price of oil. So those are all factors that will go into our crude oil opportunities in the future.","John J. Koraleski","I would just add to that, John. The trade-off of a 10% down on our oil business but a 39% increase on the frac sand business is pretty darn attractive to us.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So Jack, I think the company used to speak about the capacity on the network being somewhere in that 190,000, 195,000 carloads at a 4-week moving average basis. Obviously, you guys have been doing a lot in terms of double trucking [ph] parts of the network to the Tower 55 project. Can you sort of help us understand where you think the capacity situation is now with all the resources you're adding? Are we -- or do you guys feel like you're in a good position to accommodate volume growth? Do you feel like there's the potential for a more drawn out potential for service issues as the volume outlook continues to look pretty strong?","John J. Koraleski","David, I actually feel pretty good about our positioning right at the moment. And I'm not backing down from the 195,000 to 200,000 kind of a range. Our capital spending on infrastructure has been excellent. Our railroad is really in the best shape it's been in, in a long time. We are adding crews I think, as you've seen in the presentation today, pretty aggressively here in the last quarter of the year and actually even into the first couple of months of next year. Our locomotive take for this year is solid and we're protected for next year. And I like all of that. We're running the 100,000 -- between 190,000 and 195,000 cars a week, week-to-week, and we are continuing to see improvement in our internal measures and our velocity and things like that. So I feel good about the fact that we're getting better even at these very strong volumes. And I think I'd stay in that 195,000 to 200,000. I think we'll be okay.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","All right. And the results definitely support that. So Eric, maybe just as a follow-up, it looks like the growth in premium traffic, the trailer growth in the Intermodal segment there, you're picking up some business. Would you think that there's more runway to grow that? Or do you think that this is going to be sort of 1 or 2 premium accounts where you're getting a nice hit on the RPU? Or do you think that there's more potential to grow that premium service product over a longer period of time?","Eric L. Butler","As you know, and as we've said in the past, we're continuing to put new products and services in the marketplace. I think we spoke at the last quarter about some of the new premium services that we put in the marketplace between Chicago and the West Coast and the TMNW [ph]. And so we certainly saw a benefit from putting those new products and services in the marketplace. We're going to continue to look at opportunities to do that, and we expect to continue to drive growth across our Intermodal book of business, including our premium business.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Real quick here. You talked a little bit about pension being a minor help this year. Given current interest rates, what are you expecting for '15?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. I mean, obviously, we don't have all the full numbers nailed, but Jason, I think it's a safe assumption that it'll be higher next year. And as I pointed out that pension and other health and welfare items are what drove our comp inflation number to be, as I stated, below 2%. We would expect that's going to obviously drive that to a higher number next year, probably closer to 3-ish, all in.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","3-ish, all in. Okay. Now given that and you said your core pricing was just -- I guess, just over 2.5%. Is that something that we should look to trend up, that 2.5% next year, to try to keep up with some of the additional costs that are coming on?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. I mean, I -- our philosophy, Jason, has not changed at all. And that is to price to market at re-investable levels and above inflation. So we're constantly taking advantages there, talk to where it make sense for us to bring on business at the right terms and right conditions and that -- we're not giving more detailed guidance on that other than our tenet and our focus and our belief achieving those goals has not changed.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Has it been a little bit more difficult given the service levels on some of the pricing discussions with your shippers this year?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Jason, we operate in a very competitive environment and lots of competitive options. And getting price is always difficult, but we believe we have a value proposition and we are going forward in selling our value proposition and gaining a price for it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to ask about -- and Jack or Eric, really, the addressable market. So when you look at what's kind of going on with your operating ratio, it's getting to very impressive levels. And I realize you haven't quite gotten to low 60s on a full year basis, but you're getting to levels where I think all of us are going to sort of rightfully conclude that, well, there's probably more opportunity to go, but that opportunity set is diminishing. So could you talk about how you weigh the pros and cons of using some of that operating ratio to try to grow revenue faster? Is that something that you started thinking about, that you want to kind of start to try to win business using maybe price where appropriate? Or how do you think about this changing dynamic?","John J. Koraleski","You know Bill, I don't think about my opportunities as diminishing. As I look ahead for the next 4, 5, 6 years, and we'll talk about this more on November 5, I think the Union Pacific franchise is loaded with opportunities. And I think Eric and his team are doing an outstanding job of business development. Part of our capital investment strategy, like Santa Teresa, part of it in terms of the announcement we made about moving ahead with a new facility in Robertson County down in Texas. All that's focused on growth and development. There's still huge potential for us in Mexico. I'll stop. I'll let Eric...","Eric L. Butler","The only other thing I would add, and again, Jack and Rob said we'll talk more about this at the Investor Day, if you think about the shale play and the lower energy prices in this country, there is really a resurgence of activity, business activity, investment activity, manufacturing activity. And we see that continuing to be just a strong propellant for growth in the future. I mean, talking about price, using price to grow is not even in our vernacular at this point.","Robert M. Knight","Bill this is Rob, I just got to add. We'll try not to have 3 people answer each question. But, I have to add that focus really for us is on returns. Operating ratio has got a shorthand target, that gives us -- brings it all together in terms of efficiency, and we use that as a measure of success, if you will. But at the end of the day, we really are focused on driving returns.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","No, that's very hopeful. Let me just clarify, because I just kind of wanted to make sure I kind of asked this in the right way. And what I'm basically getting at is I think most people would say that a long-term organic growth rate, in volume terms for rails, is probably GDP-like. Pricing will be inflation-plus if you put that at 2% or so, we'll talk about maybe a 3% number. And that kind of puts you in the mid single-digit revenue growth rate range. And I think what I'm trying to get at is, is there a way to push that higher or are what you -- maybe what you're saying is, listen, our network has much greater opportunities than that organic GDP-like level of growth. But that's what I was kind of trying to get at.","John J. Koraleski","I think 2 things, Bill. One is you're right. I think we believe that our franchise has greater opportunities than that. And number two is it's not just about market and inflation. It's also about the value that you provide for the customer. How do you differentiate your service package, the options that you provide customers, the relationships that you build with them. And we think that gives us an edge.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz at UBS.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Let's see, so I wanted to ask you about how would you compare the current environment for -- rail environments, not just UP. But current rail environments, 2004 through 2006, I guess the shoe is on the other foot, so to speak, among the western carriers in terms of maybe who has greater capacity challenges. But is it fair to say that this may be similar where it really takes a while to recover for the industry and velocity, but that supports some positive things in terms of price and perhaps a couple of years of pretty favorable pricing?","John J. Koraleski","I think, Tom, that's not a bad assessment. Having been the poster child of what not to do in 2003, '04, '05, it feels better that we're where we are at the moment. But I do think, when you look across the rail industry, you're seeing incredibly strong capital investment. Almost uniformly across every property. You see operating teams that are experienced, that are working diligently to get these things working. There's a lot of interline activity between carriers that's looking at improving service and things like that. So I think it'll -- while there are some similarities to that, I'm hopeful that you're going to see a quicker return to kind of a more normal velocity than what we saw back in those days.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Let's see, in terms of the, I guess, getting to your own pricing opportunity, how much of your book is available to get repriced in 2015? And I guess how much of that have you already taken up, already set the repricing?","John J. Koraleski","Eric.","Eric L. Butler","So we've said in the past, Tom, that at any one given period of time, roughly 70% of our book of business is tied up in contracts of a year and longer. We're rolling those over at -- all the time. So I think that's a good rule of thumb to continue to use.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. But I mean, if you said tariff, one-year letter quote plus the multi-year that rolls over, is it maybe 50% of the book you could touch for next year or is there a broad brush number you can give us for what you actually [indiscernible] next year?","John J. Koraleski","If you look at it, Tom, it hasn't changed very much over the years. About 30% is in tariff, about 30% is in one-year letter quotes. But those all come up and due at different times during the year. So I think you kind of stick with what Eric told you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just want to revisit your answer then, on kind of the volumes here. To David's question before, you talked about 190,000 to 200,000, and you said you felt good about 195,000 to 200,000. But if you're growing at these levels and you're already running at 190,000, 195,000 carloads per week, do you start to face congestion if you get -- if the Ag business stays strong or what-have-you in terms of volumes? I just want to understand, do you see tightness, just given on the volume side? Understanding what you're doing on the crew and locomotive side. It just sounds like the network, at some point, hits that max or is it just based on where the volumes are coming in from?","John J. Koraleski","I don't think that, that's a max for us, Ken. I think we have potential even beyond those numbers. It really does depend. I don't know, Lance, why don't you take a shot at it.","Lance M. Fritz","Sure. So right now, we'd love to have more crews in our network to spool up our speed. That's probably the starting point of where current service product gets back to what we would consider an acceptable level. As we look forward, we're constantly making investment decisions in all the critical resources to be able to handle growth where we anticipate growth is going to occur. And I don't see any reason why we would say future growth is going to be retarded because those investments aren't happening in the right spots.","John J. Koraleski","Nor do we think it's going to take anything more than what we've stated, which is a 16% to 17% of revenue kind of capital trend to keep us ahead of that game.","Lance M. Fritz","16% to 17%.","John J. Koraleski","Yes. We're not saying it's going to take an exceptional capital infusion to keep us good.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","No, that's encouraging because it sounded like you were saying before it was kind of a max, at least for now, but that's encouraging on the ability to grow. And then maybe, Eric, thoughts on the Ag business in terms of this record crop we've had. It looks like we've got another strong crop. You said there was a delay in getting the harvest started. Can you maybe delve into that and talk about business there and what you're seeing in terms of congestion and the infrastructure there and kind of the pace of growth we should expect on the Ag side?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. So last year was a record corn harvest and a good soybean harvest. This year, all indications is that it's going to be another record corn harvest. I think last year was 13.9 billion bushels. This year might be -- I think the estimates are 14.4 billion bushels. And likewise, soybeans I think are going to be up close to 4 billion bushels, which would be a record. The delay that's occurring is really the delay of farmers harvesting in the field, it's not a transportation supply chain delay. Variety of reasons for that. Some parts of the country, it's been wetter than usual. Other parts of the country, the farmers are making the decisions in terms of when they want to bring their product to market. So a variety of reasons for that. So we expect this record harvest to still -- record corn harvest to still be ahead of us in terms of harvesting and the farmers looking to put that into the supply chain, the transportation process.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's helpful. I appreciate the time and great results. If I could just get a clarification though, Eric, on something you said earlier. The oil that you mentioned was declining. Is that because it's moving east and west, and -- because your frac sand is going up. So I just want to understand why that downshift in the crude on your network when we're seeing such strong growth on all the others.","Eric L. Butler","Yes, the crude reductions for us have been the Bakken to the Gulf and Louisiana. And if you look at the flows of the Bakken crude, that is flowing east and west and not north and south. And one of the reasons it's not flowing north and south is that there's such huge production of crude in Texas, in the basins in Texas, that it's predominantly moving by pipeline to the refineries. We have some spot rail moves but predominantly by pipeline. There really is not a need to move the Bakken crude to Texas. So that's the dynamic that we're seeing.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So following up on frac sands. So volume growth clearly accelerated in Q3. And in spite of the uncertainties surrounding crude prices, do you have any opportunities to take up price on this business, given the very tight supply? And it looks you took up some of the public tariff rates on this business. I was wondering if you could comment on what percentage is contractual versus spot.","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","So we don't give kind of percentages of contracts versus public by individual business segment. But we are focused, again, on our value proposition. We're focused on the demand, the strong demand that's going on in that marketplace and we are pricing it appropriately. If you look at that marketplace, there's huge new production coming online, of sand facilities in Wisconsin and Minnesota. We're excited about our franchise and the ability that we're giving the disproportionate amount of that new production on our line, which we think is a great opportunity for us in the future. So we think that as long as the drilling continues and oil prices sustain drilling, we have nice growth opportunity ahead of us in the future.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then you mentioned earlier your longer term view of a resurgence in industrial activity in the U.S. Within that context, how are you thinking about the new ethane crackers coming online, maybe in terms of the size of the opportunity? And has there been any talk from customers about potential delays from either labor or the recent slide in crude prices?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, as you know, Allison, that there's huge number of new capacity coming online. A lot of that will come online in '16 or '17. Those were the plans. But as long as natural gas kind of remains where it is, in the $3.75 range, it's going to be a huge financial incentive for those projects to go forward. There's been public reports of some spot shortages of skilled laborers. As far as we could tell, it's not significant or material to the timetable of any of those projects.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Wanted to follow up on that question about comparing this to that '04, '05 timeframe. If I go back and look, when you guys were having those significant service issues, it really kicked off a 3- or 4-year period of pretty material share losses to be in. This year we're seeing the opposite. Do you think this is the beginning of a multiyear period of share gain or do you think this is going to be more of just a one-off?","John J. Koraleski","That's really hard for us to tell right now, Scott. So I got to tell you, the BNSF is a great railroad. And they're going to come back, and they're going to come back strong. So we have seen some opportunities, probably the strongest we've seen have been in grain and in Intermodal, but those can move back very quickly. And our goal is to impress those customers with our value proposition and doing business with Union Pacific such that when the competition is stronger than what they are today, they won't think about shifting back. But it is a tough competitive marketplace out there and we recognize we will have to compete.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Are the tenor of the conversations suggesting that next year could be another year of share gain or could some of that go back in your mind?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","As Jack said, the BNSF is a tough competitor. I think they have publicly stated in different forums that next year, the full year, will be a full recovery year for them. We see them working hard to recover and I would not be surprised to see them recovering in different parts of their markets as you go through the year and they will continue to be a strong competitor.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, that makes sense. And then one for you Rob. If I look back at last year when you had legacy pricing, it looked like it was about 1 point, 1.5 point boost to the core pricing gains. Is it realistic to think next year could be similar to that? And is there any update on what percent of the legacy you expect to retain? Sometimes you can give us an update around that.","Robert M. Knight","Yes. I mean, just to kind of reiterate what I think you already know Scott. You're right, we achieved about 1.5 point of benefit last year from legacy contract renewals. Coming into this year, we said \"legacy light.\" So basically 0 this year. Next year, we have about $300 million worth of revenue that we will compete for in the marketplace. We don't give guidance in terms of what the pricing's going to look like on that. But we're going to be in the marketplace competing and we're in those discussions as we speak. So no further update on that, other than it will -- we would expect there would be some contributor next year on legacy versus this year, 0.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just have one question here on Intermodal. We mentioned the BNSF issues and there was obviously some labor volatility. A few of the other railroads are talking about the potential that shippers will start to diversify away from the port of L.A., Long Beach. And I see you have a question mark on your Intermodal growth outlook. Do you think that this diversification is possible and to what extent it might impact your operation out of those ports?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","So, Walter, great question. The market is aware and we are aware of the difficulties that are occurring right now in the Port of L.A., Long Beach. They are experiencing backups. A variety of reasons for that. Probably some of it is due to some of the labor uncertainty with the West Coast ILWU workers. Some of it's probably related to the fact that you have larger ships going into the terminals and they're dwelling longer as they're trying to unload those ships. Part of it is due to the fact that as the alliances, the steamship alliances, are changing. It's having different impacts on different terminals within the Port of L.A. and Port of Long Beach. So a variety of issues. Those issues, frankly, are impacting some of our transportation operations. We're doing some things creatively to overcome those. But if you look at it, the Port of L.A., Long Beach is still such a huge driver of West Coast imports. It's unlikely to see significant long-term material diversions. Last month, September, the Port of L.A., Long Beach, hit volume levels that they hadn't seen since probably '06 or '07. So they're seeing huge volume growth. There might be some nominal diversions to some other ports, whether up or down the U.S. West Coast or in Canada. Some of those ports have similar capacity challenges that they also have, that they're also working through. So there might be some nominal short-term diversions. But long term, if the Port of L.A., Long Beach can get their issues worked through, they're still in a pretty good place to maintain and grow their segment of the business.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And as you see some of that capacity tightening along the Western U.S. and Canada, as we approach a more full -- approach Panama fully up and running, as time gets closer, are you hearing your shippers talk more and more, looking harder at what they're going to do with Panama? I know there's still a lot of question marks around the rates around there and all that, but any update on what the potential impact, longer-term, of Panama could be?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, so, as you know, there's still a whole rate question out there in terms of if it's going to cost more money and you have a longer transit time. There is actually a construction delay question still out there with the Panama Canal. I think what we've said in the past is still what we think today, that you might have 1% or 2% that gets diverted today. About 30% of the business is all water. That might grow to 31%, 32%. But we don't see, nor are we hearing from shippers, anything significant beyond that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","With regard to the -- you guys have historically talked that the train size performance isn't kind of the end-all be-all, particularly when there are growth opportunities. I think we saw that with the Intermodal results this quarter. Could you give us a sense how much more volume the Intermodal network could handle on average, if volumes continue to pick up here?","John J. Koraleski","Sure. Lance?","Lance M. Fritz","Yes. Rob, so you're right. Train size is not the be-all end-all. Intermodal was impacted this quarter by new products that, on average, were smaller than the rest of the network. And if you think about train size opportunity on Intermodal trains as it exists today, to get them up to average train size in the routes that they go, there's plenty of upside. Not putting it in a percentage, but dozens and dozens of boxes.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And then, Lance, as I'm thinking about the Intermodal growth, particularly on the expedite trailer side, you guys have clearly taken market share in the PNW down to Chicago. How much of the growth has been driven by some large customers you guys took on there versus just overall network gains that you're seeing across the network due to a tight trucking marketplace?","Lance M. Fritz","It's probably more a question for Eric. But I will tell you, we do not speak to specific customers. We do have a new product in that lane that's performing well and it is attracting new business.","Eric L. Butler","Yes, that's the answer. And I mentioned that earlier, we put in some new products both to the PNW and to California. And those new products are attracting business, particularly as some of our competitors are struggling in that corridor.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And, Eric, as we think about that business, should there be a significant peaking factor to the RPU in the fourth quarter associated with that or is the third quarter a pretty good run rate looking out kind of for the Intermodal product?","John J. Koraleski","I think overall, Rob, we're not going to give specific pricing guidance on that. I think we'll have to just wait and see how the business materializes and hopefully it's going to continue to be positive.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I had a question with regards to Mexico. It's been sort of around 10% of your revenue days. And I'm wondering, is that changing materially? And if not, when do you anticipate the growth or potential outsized growth in Mexico to start to contribute or a little bit more of the overall book of revenue.","John J. Koraleski","Overall, Thomas, it was 10% again in the quarter. Volume was up about 9%, so it's a great piece of business with us. In terms of future growth, Eric, you want to take a shot?","Eric L. Butler","We continue to think Mexico has nice future growth opportunities on the auto side, the grain side, the industrial product side. A 9% growth trend is pretty good.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm curious as to what the point when -- one would think, with all the newer sourcing opportunity, that it should be a bigger percentage of the book to business. And I guess if you can maybe frame out, maybe even how Santa Teresa fits into that picture and when you anticipate that potentially adding maybe 1 point or 0.5 point in terms of the overall revenue contribution. Will you be able to frame out perhaps maybe the medium- to long-term?","Robert M. Knight","This is Rob, maybe I can answer that for you that Thomas. I mean we're not going to give specific guidance on that. But I would just say that if look out over the last several years, our volumes in and out of Mexico -- and of course as you know, we're the only railroad that crosses the 6 rail crossing points. But our Mexican-related business has been growing faster than our overall enterprise business has. So it's been contributing. And we're not going to break out in terms of what the margins are on that business. But I would just tell you that it's good business that we're bringing on the network. So it has been contributing and continues to contribute as we move forward.","Eric L. Butler","And your Santa Teresa growth is meeting expectations. And just as a data point, that would be considered domestic business.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right, great. Can I just ask a question with regard to the labor inflation? Obviously we're hearing sort of recurring, sort of comments about the challenges recruiting labor and obviously -- just in particular, with regards to certain markets where labor's extremely tight. Should we be a little concerned? Is wage inflation possibly a headwind into 2015 that we should be thinking about or are there other mitigating factors that could dampen that sort of concern that we might be having here?","John J. Koraleski","You know, we have a solid pipeline of talent. We have a great organization out getting us new employees. And right now, we're not seeing a concern. Rob, do you have any insight on inflationary [indiscernible]?","Robert M. Knight","Yes, Thomas. I would just say that's all wrapped in to -- I agree with Jack's comments. In the inflation, we expect it to be higher next year. And as I said earlier 3 plus-ish versus the less than 2 all in this year. For lots of reasons.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I wanted to follow up on how you're thinking about the potential pricing environment in Intermodal. Do you think it should mirror some of the contractual rate increases we're seeing in the truckload market? Or given you've been pushing price in this business to get back to re-investable levels over the past few years, do you think the pace of increases could be below what we're seeing in truckload?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Again, we feel very good about our value proposition. And as the truck market tightens from a variety of issues, the new CSA rules, truck driver, the cost of fuel, the cost of cabs, we think that just strengthens our value proposition and strengthens our ability to get price as we go into the future.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And another one on Intermodal. It's obviously a lower RPU business, but is there any way you could speak to the incremental margins that you're seeing in Intermodal today? Just given the opportunity to build into the -- add the train lengths, et cetera. Do the incremental margins in Intermodal look pretty similar to your other commodity groups?","Robert M. Knight","This is Rob, let me answer that. We don't break out specific margin by business. But you have heard me, perhaps, say many times, that our Intermodal opportunities -- Intermodal has typically been on the lower end, if you will, of our very diverse business group and it's been moving up fast. All of our business has been moving in the right direction. And as Eric said, we still have confidence that we can continue to move it directionally correct.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. But to clarify, today it's still a bit below the other businesses?","Robert M. Knight","It's probably below average, but improving nicely.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Research","Two follow-ups on previously asked questions. The one just before me on pricing and Intermodal: could you please help us understand the outlook for continued sustained improvement? And maybe the main drivers, whether it's narrowing the gap to trucking, given your enhanced value proposition, whether changes in the road mix or the mix of domestic versus Intermodal, new relationships that you are building. Please help us understand what we should look for, long-term, for Intermodal pricing.","John J. Koraleski","You know, Cleo, you did a pretty good job of answering that question. I think it's a combination of all those things. It's, first of all, getting our service back into the zone where it absolutely needs to be and we're committed and we'll get there. So that's a good thing for us. Secondly, it is the relationships, the new business opportunities. Thirdly, it's when you look at the business proposition that Intermodal offers compared to the trucking industry, the opportunity for highway conversion, when you think about environmental friendliness, when you think about the fuel efficiency, when you think about the whole package of the beauty of Intermodal, which combines the best of both truck and rail. That's an opportunity for us. You add to that the capital investments that we're making in places like Santa Teresa, that's part of our opportunity pipeline. So all of those things that you've identified continue to keep us excited about the growth opportunity. And then the other thing that I would add is the pressure on the trucking industry, the additional regulations they're seeing the increased insurance cost. And eventually, you're going to find out that they're going end up with driver shortages. We're back now to where the housing market's getting back into what would be considered normal. What we saw originally was all those guys that went out of construction went into driving trucks. And right now they want to stay home with their kids. They're all shifting back into the construction zone. So I would expect that, at some point in time, the trucking industry is going to have driver shortage issues. All that plays into our book. Anybody want to add?","Unknown Executive","No, good.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Research","And the second question also goes back to the issue of capacity. Can you please help us understand why just looking at the past peaks in terms of carloads on your network may not fully reflect your new capacity and flexibility. I don't know if it's just because the cars themselves are getting bigger or there are changes with your manifest versus unit train mix. Any other change in the base of your resources that really enable you to support growth more than we appreciate right now.","John J. Koraleski","Okay, Lance?","Lance M. Fritz","Sure, yes. Actually, Cleo, if you go back to the same volume levels, historically we're running about 1.5 mile to maybe even 2 miles an hour faster than we were at equivalent volume levels. That's a direct reflection of improved network capacity. And so when we look forward, our current utilization of that network capacity is not what we want it to be, we're retarded by lack of crews and a handful of other things. As we get on top of that, moving forward, which we are doing, we anticipate that those service levels improve at these current volume levels and give us plenty of runway for future growth.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Research","How about maybe infrastructure investments by your customers, whether it's Energy or Chemicals. Do those also help you carry more growth with the relatively efficient use of resources on your end?","Lance M. Fritz","Absolutely they do, Cleo. And our customers are making significant investment to support themselves in the marketplace and help us serve them better all the time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of MorningStar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I'd like to return to the strong frac sand growth you mentioned and its divergence from the quarter's crude volume trends. Could you share some color on broad customer behavior? For example, what portion of sand shifts to wet versus dry wells. And are you seeing changes in driller behavior, such as more sand per well?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","So the second question, more sand per well. Absolutely. There's a lot of technology changes that's allowing the drilling services industry to do longer laterals, more laterals, and that has been a driver of our sand growth all year long. And we've talked about that in the past, we'll continue to talk about that in the future. In terms of where the sand is going to, I think it's really being driven by the economics of the well. Today, you see lots of drilling in the Permian Basin, lots of drilling in the Eagle Ford. You see growing drilling in the Niobrara. You see the Marcellus kind of resuming the levels of drilling that they had a couple of years ago. And you see sand flowing to all of those places. It's really driven by the economics of the shale play.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","A significant portion of it is going to dry gas. Is that correct here?","Eric L. Butler","If you look at where the sand is flowing today, I think the shales that I just listed are the common places where the sand is flowing today.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. The capacity improvements you've outlined, which is the biggest, earliest lever to improve congestion. Is it mode of power, employees or infrastructure? I suspect you'll say all of the above. Is it crew the biggest constraint?","John J. Koraleski","I wouldn't say all of the above. First thing we're focused on is crews. There are other constraints but crews is the primary one right now.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt Trey [ph] with Nomura.","Unknown Analyst","I had a question. Given the systemic issues in truckload and driver shortage which, by all appearances, look like it's going to be a multi-year thing. Is this an opportunity to examine your marketing strategy with Intermodal internally and potentially your usage of IMCs? I was just wondering if you're thinking about that.","John J. Koraleski","Matt, we evaluate our marketing strategy constantly. And up until this point in time, we continue to see IMCs as our primary carrier in the marketplace. We think that model is solid and we are working very hard to work together with our IMC customers to improve service and to help them succeed in their marketplace. I don't know, Eric, do you have anything to add to that? Okay.","Unknown Analyst","I guess, as a follow-up, short haul versus long haul. Traditionally we've kind of thought of about a 10% to 15% spread versus truck. And in short haul, Intermodal, 40%, 50% north in long haul. Is that relationship still true? Are those numbers accurate? Have they narrowed? And if not, is there an opportunity to narrow them given the issues in truckload?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. I think what we've said is that the spread actually kind of depends on lanes and it could range from 35%, 40% spread, which is large, so as narrow as a 10% or 15% spread. And we think, with our value proposition, we'll continue to be able to narrow that spread and price closer and closer to truck as we improve our service and value propositions.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just to follow on that final point, in terms of the IMC partners. How do you think about the strategy going forward? The trend over the past 10 years, it seems, has been fewer number of IMCs as opposed to more. I'm just wondering how you think about that going forward, given the fact that you do think that, that strategy is a healthy and viable one. Would you prefer to see a continued reduction in the number of IMC partners and really focus on scale and throughput and productivity to solve some of the constraints and to pursue market growth in Domestic Intermodal? Would you prefer more to help alleviate or kind of continue to strengthen your bargaining power? I'm just trying to think about that strategy over the next 5 years with regard to IMCs.","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, Ben. One of the things we realize is that it is a big, wide, broad market out there and you have lots of different customers, and customers opportunities. You have large customers, the large retailers that probably will be managed with a small set of large IMCs. But you have a large group of midsize and smaller customers that we believe, at least at this time, that you'll continue to have a broad base of smaller IMCs that will assist in servicing and addressing those channels. And that's the reason for the strategy that Jack talked about, where we continue to see the IMCs being a large portion of our go-to-market strategy.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back to Mr. Jack Koraleski for closing comments.","John J. Koraleski","Great. Thanks, Rob, and thank you all for joining us on the call today. I was going to say we look forward to speaking with you in January, but hopefully we'll see you November 5 in Chicago at our meeting. And if not, again, we'll see you when we wrap up the year in January. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Rob Knight, CFO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Knight, you may now begin.","Robert M. Knight","Good morning, everybody. This is Rob Knight, and welcome to the Union Pacific Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Unfortunately, Jack Koraleski is ill with the flu today and will not be joining us. But here with me in Omaha are Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Lance Fritz, Executive Vice President of Operations.","This morning, we're pleased to announce that Union Pacific set a new fourth quarter earnings record of $2.19 per share, an increase of 10% compared to 2011. This record also tied our best-ever earnings performance set in the third quarter of 2012. Our diverse portfolio of business, solid core pricing gains and efficient network operations drove these results despite significantly weaker coal and grain markets. Although it was a challenging year on many fronts, 2012 was Union Pacific's most profitable year in our 150-year history. It's a testament to the strength and diversity of our franchise, with the dedication and commitment of our employees and our unrelenting focus on creating value for our customers. The results are reflected in record achievements that we've made this quarter in both employee safety and customer satisfaction. Putting it all together, it translates into an increased financial returns for our shareholders.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Eric Butler.","Eric L. Butler","Thanks, Rob, and good morning. Let's start with a look at customer satisfaction, which came in at 93 for the quarter, a 1-point improvement over last year. That continued the strong performance we saw throughout 2012, with customers' evaluation of our value proposition up 1 point from 2011 to 93 for the full year, setting a new best-ever mark. We appreciate this recognition from customers and remain focused on driving further improvement in our value offering going forward.","As expected, some of our key markets were challenged in the fourth quarter. And as a result, overall volume was down 2.5%. While Chemicals, Automotive and Intermodal group and Industrial Products was flat, it wasn't enough to offset the tough market conditions that drove deep declines in Coal and Ag products. The softening of coal demand continued to significantly impact growth, cutting into [ph] the 17% decline in Coal loadings aside, the other 5 groups grew 2% despite the shortfall in Ag. Coal price improved 4%, which combined with increased fuel surcharge revenue produced nearly a 5% improvement in average revenue per car. With price-driven average revenue per car gains outpacing the volume declines, freight revenue grew 2% to $4.9 billion.","Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 groups, starting with the 2 that saw declines. Coal was down 17%, as high coal stockpiles created by a sluggish economy and low natural gas prices continues to dampen the demand. A 12% improvement in average revenue per car held the revenue decline to 7%. With the weakened demand, Southern Powder River Basin tonnage declined 19%. Also contributing to the decline was a continued impact of contract losses, which more than offset business wins. Strong global demand for high BTU coal drove a 6% increase in Colorado\/Utah tonnage despite a softer domestic market due to natural -- due to low natural gas prices. New business also provided a boost. Late in the quarter, much publicized low water levels on the Mississippi curtailed some shipments from both of these origins, but with relatively small impact on the overall volume shortfall.","Before we move on to Ag, note that this slide clearly shows the challenging comp we have in coal volumes year-over-year in the first quarter.","Ag Products volume was down 9%, mix-driven average revenue per car was flat, and revenue declined 8%. A 22% decline in carloadings was driven by last summer's drought, which unfortunately had its greatest impact in UP-served territories. The resulting tight supply of corn has reduced livestock count and lowered the domestic feed grain shipments, with increased reliance on local crops in East Texas and Arkansas also impacting our volume. Feed grain and wheat exports also declined with improved world supply and higher U.S. prices. Grain product shipments declined 6%, with reduced demand for gasoline and high corn prices curtailing ethanol production, driving a 17% decline in ethanol shipments. Food and refrigerated shipments offered some good news, growing 8%. The 78% increase in sugar shipments, driven by spot opportunity, was a big contributor, while malt and barley carloads increased over 40%.","Our Automotive volume grew 9%, which combined with a 5% increase in average revenue per car produced a 14% increase in revenues. Pent-up demand and improved credit availability again drove sales in the fourth quarter, with year-end incentives also providing a boost as the auto industry's growth rate continued to outpace the overall economy. With consumer confidence reaching a 54-month high in November and new vehicles offering more features and improved fuel efficiencies, many continue to find in a compelling time to buy. For the quarter, UP finished vehicle shipments grew 7%, with parts volume up 13%.","Chemicals volume increased 14%. Mix-impacted average revenue per car was flat, and revenue grew 15%, leading the way again with petroleum products, where a 69% increase in volume was driven by over 160% growth in crude oil. As has been the case all year, while crude oil has seen substantial growth, other chemical segments continued to put up solid if more modest numbers. Industrial chems grew 8%. Plastics, boosted by new business and solid export demand, was up 7%. And soda ash grew 4%, with growth in the export market. Dampening the good news was an 8% decline in fertilizer, primarily driven by soft international demand for potash.","Industrial Products revenue grew -- increased 3% even as volume remained flat, driven by a 3% improvement in average revenue per car. Rock shipments grew 14% with increased construction activity mostly in the Houston area, which also contributed to a 16% growth in cement volumes. Lumber shipments were up 17%, as housing starts showed solid year-over-year improvement. Nonmetallic minerals saw modest growth, up 2%. But a number of other investor markets faced some challenges in the quarter. Hazardous waste volume fell 48% as the ramp-down of government funding again impacted our uranium tailing shipments. Excluding this decline, our Industrial Products volume would have been up 2%. A drop in gas-related drilling activity, lower steel mill utilization and softer demand for export scrap was reflected in a 9% decline in steel and scrap. Continued mine production issues hampered export iron ore shipments, leading to a 28% drop in metallic minerals.","Intermodal revenue grew 6%, as a 5% improvement in average revenue per unit combined with a 2% increase in volumes. International Intermodal was flat, with a relatively weak peak season. A November strike at the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports had minimal impact. Domestic Intermodal shipments grew 4%, with continued success in converting highway freight to rail in both containers and trailers.","A closer look at how we see our business shaping up in 2013. Even with an uncertain economic outlook, our diverse franchise still provides opportunities to grow. As in the fourth quarter, the biggest challenges are expected to be tough market conditions in Coal and Ag Products. High coal stockpiles are expected to hamper recovery in coal demand. And a loss of one legacy contract beginning this year will also have an impact. That combination will likely drive a slight decline in coal volume for the year despite expected continued growth in export volumes as global demand remain strong. We expect the first quarter to see a steeper decline likely in the mid-teens, driven by the high stockpiles, with some additional impact from continued low river levels.","Diminished 2012 grain crops should impact Ag Products throughout the first half, with first quarter volume expected to be down in the high single-digit range. Hopefully, we'll see a trend -- a return to trend line yields when the crops come in later in the year, which could offer some opportunity. Food & Refrigerated is expected to see slow growth.","Automotive volumes should keep pace with the auto industry's expected growth. Crude oil is expected to continue as one of our strongest growth markets, but the pace will ease against 2012's larger base.","Most other chemicals markets should remain solid, and we're expecting fertilizer to start growing again.","An improved housing market should boost lumber shipments, and growth in construction is expected to support increases in rock, metals and other related markets, with metals also benefiting from the projected growth in the auto industry. Anticipated shale growth will also give our metals and minerals a boost. On the downside, we expect the falloff in wind business, reduced military shipments, and the diminished federal funding should again impact hazardous waste.","Highway conversion should continue to drive Domestic Intermodal. International Intermodal may be challenged in the first half by the economy. But a stronger economy and improved housing market are expected to produce opportunities in the second half of 2013.","Our strong value proposition will again support business development efforts across all 6 groups, with highway conversion opportunities playing the role in both our carload and Intermodal businesses. Across the groups, we'll continue to develop opportunities in Mexico, where our unparalleled ability to link their stronger economic growth with U.S. origins and destinations is the strength of our franchise.","I mentioned the 2013 legacy contract loss, but we successfully retained and repriced 80% of the $350 million we competed for, providing a solid foundation for our 2013 price plan. As a result, while we're cautious, we expect a slight volume increase to combine with price gains to drive profitable revenue growth.","With that, I'll turn it over to Lance.","Lance M. Fritz","Thank you, Eric, and good morning. So let's start the operating update with safety. We achieved another all-time record low reportable personal injury rate in 2012. It was 12% better than 2011 and our fifth consecutive year of improvement. Training, process improvements, capital investments and total safety culture combined to further reduce our environmental and behavioral risks. We've also reduced the severity of injuries to a record low this year.","Moving to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our full year reportable rate improved 2% compared with 2011. Yard and industry track derailments, a major focus of the operating team, improved year-over-year. Track-caused derailments declined considerably, reflecting the investments we've made in maintaining our infrastructure.","In public safety, the grade-crossing incident rate increased 13% in 2012. As I've mentioned before, the combination of increased rail traffic in the south, which has a higher grade crossing density than our overall network, and growth in highway traffic, which is driven by increased economic activity in parts of our network, has increased our grade-crossing incident exposure. On the positive side, we've made progress identifying and isolating high-risk locations and improving or removing crossings of concern. We are starting to see a turning point. And although we still have a significant amount of work to do, I think we're moving in the right direction.","Our safety strategy helps keep our network strong and resilient. And as a result, we're operating an efficient and fluid network, which is reflected in the 4% improvement in velocity compared to 2011. In fact, we came very close to matching our fourth quarter record set in 2009 despite running 9% higher volumes. This year, we've clearly demonstrated agility and resiliency in managing through the shifts in mix, including growth in manifest and premium volumes in the South and lower coal shipments in the North. Our improved network performance has been driven by a combination of process efficiency gains and capacity and expansion projects. The process improvements reflect our execution of Lean manufacturing principles, which we call the UP Way, which engages our entire labor force in the design and implementation of standard work.","Our service scorecard illustrates UP's customer value proposition. The local operating teams continue to provide great service, as reflected by Industry Spot & Pull, which set a best-ever fourth quarter record of 95%. The fourth quarter Service Delivery Index, which is a measure of how well we are meeting overall customer commitments, also improved from 2011. The Service Delivery Index is leveraged by the fact that we periodically improve service commitments to our customers. In other words, the 89% in 2012 is measured against a more difficult standard than the 89% in 2008, reflecting our commitment to constantly improve the service product for our customers.","Moving on to network productivity, fourth quarter slow order miles improved to an all-time record low, down 31% from last year. Our network is in excellent shape, reflecting the investment in replacement capital that has hardened our infrastructure and reduced service failures. As we exited 2012, over 99% of our railroad was free of slow orders.","Moving to the upper right, car utilization improved 5% year-over-year, reflecting the improvement in network velocity and fluidity, and just shy of our all-time quarterly record set in 2009.","In the lower left, Intermodal train lengths grew to a fourth quarter record of 174 boxes per train, improving 2% compared to 2011. Manifest train length is also holding strong given that much of the manifest growth occurred in the South, which is the most constrained area of our network.","We've used the UP Way to reduce variability in our operations while increasing the role every employee plays on their work teams. Employee engagement is critical to our operating strategy and has had a significant impact. Our employees are utilizing their expertise to standardize their work and to remove variability. To expand a bit more on growth in the South, fourth quarter volumes in the South were up 3% versus 2011 and up 5% for the full year. Traffic in the South has returned to pre-recession levels. We've met the challenge with agility, repositioning horsepower and manpower to adapt to shifting demand. We have adjusted car routings to leverage available terminal capacity and modified train starts to maintain fluid operations and to increase local service frequency. While the UP team is successfully managing the carload surge in the South, we have growth capacity in other parts of the system, with about 800 employees per load and around 1,000 locomotives in storage. In addition, the capital investments we continue to make in the South are generating an excellent return and are having a positive impact. They support our diverse book of business, including increased shale-related volumes, Gulf Coast chemical traffic and growing Mexico and Intermodal business.","Moving on to this year's capital plan. For 2013, we're planning to invest around $3.6 billion, which is down slightly from the $3.7 billion mark that we spent in 2012. Our spending for 2012 was slightly higher than our $3.6 billion projection as we took advantage of mild weather conditions during the fourth quarter to further advance some projects. More than half of our planned 2013 capital investment is replacement spending, while approximately $1 billion will be invested in service growth and productivity projects. Capacity, commercial facilities and equipment are the primary drivers. Major projects include work on the Santa Teresa, New Mexico facility, which should be completed by early 2014, and continuation of various projects in the South to support our diverse and growing book of business in that region. We're buying 100 new road locomotives under our long-term purchase commitment, which is part of our Tier 4 strategy. We also plan to acquire around 900 freight cars to serve as replacement for older assets and to meet expected business growth. In addition, we're increasing our Positive Train Control spend this year to approximately $450 million. For 2012, we've invested nearly $750 million of our estimated $2 billion projected spend. Although it's unlikely the industry will meet the 2015 deadline, we're making a good-faith effort to do so and working closely with regulators as we implement the new technology.","In summary, we feel very good about our overall performance in 2012 and the improvements we've made in light of the dynamic market and geographical shifts. Our network is strong, fluid and resilient. I'm going to carry that momentum forward and continue to focus on those critical areas that will drive further improvement, achieving record safety results driven by the commitment to value safety above all, driving year-over-year service and productivity improvement by engaging all of our employees through the UP Way and providing customers with a value proposition that supports growth with high levels of service. We'll take advantage of growth where it shows up but effectively manage the network and resources if it doesn't. And we remain well positioned to handle dynamic shifts in volume while generating continued productivity gains and great returns on our invested capital going forward.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Rob.","Robert M. Knight","Thanks, Lance. Let's start by summarizing our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue grew 3% to a fourth quarter record of more than $5.2 billion, driven by core pricing gains and increased fuel surcharge recovery. Operating expense totaled $3.5 billion, increasing 1%. Operating income grew 7% to $1.7 billion, also setting a best-ever fourth quarter record. Below the line, other income totaled $43 million, down $11 million compared to 2011. Interest expense of $128 million was down 9%, driven by lower average interest rates and some capitalized interest. Income tax expense increased to $604 million, mostly driven by higher pretax earnings. Net income grew 7% versus 2011, while the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce a fourth quarter earnings record of $2.19 per share, up 10% versus 2011.","Turning now to our top line. Freight revenue grew 2% to $4.9 billion. Volume was down about 2.5 points. Revenue mix was also unfavorable, driven by lower grain shipments and growth in shorter length of haul stone move [ph]. Higher fuel prices and a positive lag impact on recovery drove higher fuel surcharges, adding roughly 1 point in freight revenue growth. In addition, we saw the benefit from legacy contracts renegotiated in late 2011 and early 2012 that expanded our fuel surcharge coverage. This generated an additional 0.5 point of revenue growth. The impact in the fourth quarter was less than 1 full point of revenue growth that we saw earlier in the year, as we lacked some of those legacy renewals during the fourth quarter. We also achieved solid core pricing gains of 4%, which was a key contributor to our fourth quarter financial performance. Lower coal volumes again hindered further pricing gains.","Moving to the expense side, Slide 23 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 2% from 2011. Lower volume costs and solid operations more than offset higher training costs and modest inflationary pressures. In addition, we received an IRS refund of around $20 million of payroll taxes, which also drove costs lower in the fourth quarter. Workforce levels increased 2.5% in the quarter, mostly driven by more employees in the training pipeline and increased capital and Positive Train Control activities. As you recall, we tempered hiring a bit in the fourth quarter of 2011 based on expected volume levels and mix shifts. In 2012, labor inflation came in around 2.5%. For 2013, we expect it to be a bigger hurdle, around 3%. Also, our workforce levels, excluding capital, should grow in 2013 if volumes increase but not at a 1-for-1 rate.","Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $920 million, decreasing $15 million versus 2011. Cost reductions driven by a 5% decline in gross ton miles more than offset the impact of a 3% increase in our average diesel fuel price versus 2011. In addition, our consumption rates increased 1%, driven by lower coal volumes.","Purchased services and material expense increased 5% to $533 million due to higher contract expenses incurred by our logistics subsidiaries. The revenue generated from these expenses is reflected in our other revenue line. Joint facility maintenance expense and locomotive repair expense also increased this quarter. Depreciation expense increased 10% to $453 million, mainly driven by increased capital spending program. In 2013, depreciation expense will continue to increase but not at the 9% rate that we saw for the full year 2012. The combination of a favorable rate study and lower gross ton miles will result in an increase of around 3% to 4% versus 2012.","Slide 26 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $302 million, up 4% from 2011. Growth in Automotive volumes drove higher freight car rental expense, which was partially offset by lower locomotive lease expense. Other expenses came in at $182 million, down $9 million compared to 2011. It was a little bit better than what we have projected in October, in part due to lower-than-expected volumes. Lower equipment, property and freight damage expense, as well as other cost control measures, also contributed to this decrease. Conversely, personal injury and property tax expense increased compared to 2011. For the full year 2013, we expect the other expense line to be more in the neighborhood of $225 million a quarter, barring any unusual items. Higher property taxes and challenging year-over-year comps in personal injury expense will add upward pressure, in addition to any volume-related expenses.","Now let's turn to our operating ratio performance. We achieved a record fourth quarter operating ratio of 67.1%, improving over 1 point compared to last year. On a full year basis, we generated a best-ever 67.8% operating ratio, the first sub-70% performance in our history. Our performance highlights the positive impact of solid core pricing gains, growth in attractive new businesses and continued focus on productivity initiatives. And this improvement was accomplished without the benefit of any volume growth. Looking ahead, we remain committed to achieving our sub-65% operating ratio target by 2017.","Slide 28 provides a summary of our 2012 earnings with a full year income statement. I'll walk through a few of the highlights from our record-setting year. Operating revenue achieved an all-time record of $20.9 billion. Operating income also set a new best-ever mark of $6.7 billion, topping 2011's record by over $1 billion or 18%. And net income of $3.9 billion and earnings per share of $8.27 also set new historic annual records.","Union Pacific's record full year earnings generated strong free cash flow of $1.4 billion, which reflects over $560 million more in capital spending and a 37% increase in cash dividend payments versus 2011. In addition, cash from operations of nearly $6.2 billion includes more than $900 million in higher cash tax payment. Over half of that was driven by the catch-up of prior year's bonus depreciation programs and a lower bonus depreciation rate in 2012 versus 2011. On a positive note, we'll see the benefits from a new bonus depreciation program in 2013, which will drive an added boost to free cash flow of around $400 million this year from what we've previously discussed with you in October. The net benefit, which includes the impact of prior year's programs, will be roughly the same in 2013 as it was in 2012.","Our balance sheet remains strong, supporting our investment-grade credit rating. At December 31, 2012, our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio was 39.1%, lower than this year's trend due to the pull ahead of $450 million in debt maturities from the first quarter of 2013 to the fourth quarter of 2012.","Slide 30 shows our full year 2012 capital investment of $3.7 billion. Our preliminary capital plan for 2013 is around $3.6 billion, down slightly from the 2012 levels. While spending on Positive Train Control is growing, we'll be spending less on locomotive acquisitions this year. The chart on the right reflects our achievements in generating returns on these investments. Return on invested capital was a record 14% in 2012, up over 1.5 points from 2011. Returns must continue to improve to support the significantly higher asset replacement costs and investments required to achieve our safety, service and growth initiatives.","Beyond funding our capital programs, our record profitability and strong cash generation have enabled us to grow shareholder returns. After increasing our dividend per share 58% in 2011, we raised it an additional 15% last year. For 2012, our declared dividends totaled $2.49 per share, achieving our target payout ratio of 30%. In addition, we continue to make opportunistic share repurchases, which play an important role in our balanced approach to cash allocation. In the fourth quarter, we bought back over 2 million shares at an average purchase price of around $122 per share. Full year purchases totaled 12.8 million shares, averaging $115 per share. Combining dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned over $2.6 billion to our shareholders in 2012, up 16% compared to 2011. Looking ahead, we have about 15 million shares remaining under our current authorization, which expires March 31, 2014.","So that's a wrap-up of 2012. We're now focused on the opportunities and challenges of 2013. As we discussed in our October Investor Day Conference, we're cautious on the economic outlook for this year. We're expecting many of the same challenges that we faced in 2012. We'll be working through these issues, including the dynamics of the domestic energy markets and the carryover impact of the drought. We're also focused on Washington as they work through the various fiscal challenges. We'll be watching to see how it impacts what we currently see as a gradually improving economy. But if industrial production grows at around 2% as projected, we would expect strength in other areas to offset the shortfall in coal, driving slightly positive volume growth for us this year. That said, we successfully navigated through the complexities of 2012, and we'll continue to follow that same strategy in 2013. We remain agile and leverage the strengths of our diverse franchise. As we look out over the year, we're expecting to see a stronger second half relative to 2012. We're clearly going to have our challenges in the first quarter with very tough year-over-year comps in coal and grain volumes, as Eric described. Despite the challenges on the volume side, we continue to target inflation plus pricing gains. We should also realize the benefits from continued productivity and network efficiencies. Assuming the economy takes a positive step forward and fuel prices are stable, we expect to achieve another record financial year, generating best-ever marks in operating ratio and earnings, which will drive increased shareholder returns.","So with that, let's open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm going to surprise you here with a question on coal. I guess, I'm sure you'll get a lot on that, but anyways, can you give us some thoughts around what might drive upside or downside to your -- your view on coal volumes? I think you're saying coal volumes are probably full year down a little bit. What would be the scenario, maybe gas price level, natural gas price level that would drive some upside? And also in terms of risk to the downside, how are you thinking about the impact of the Edison Mission bankruptcy and whether you're factoring in lower volumes there into your comments on coal?","Eric L. Butler","Thanks, Tom. As you say, there are a lot of uncertainty in terms of the coal outlook and environment, certainly, on the downside, regulatory environmental changes in Washington that could have continued negative impact on the Coal business and the coal market share. Certainly, the natural gas, the price of natural gas can also have impacts on the downside and the upside. Right now, we're expecting natural gas prices to remain in the $3.54 range for the year and -- but on the upside, as natural gas price goes up, that will drive more business to coal. If you look at the coal market share, full year market share for 2012, we're not expecting substantially higher coal market share vis-\u00e0-vis natural gas for 2013, maybe 1 point or 2 higher but basically flat in terms of overall market share, but there would be upside and downside to that. In terms of the announced bankruptcies that are out there, we are working closely with our customers, we work with them as they're working through those difficult times. We also are doing what we need to do to ensure that we are protecting our corporate interest. As we're going through the process, as you know, the way the bankruptcies work, customers have the right to look at contracts. And we're working with them as they're going through that process, and we'll continue to work with them.","Robert M. Knight","Tom, if I could just add a couple of more points to Eric's comments on the drivers of coal. Remember, we said in October at our conference, there was about a 10 million-ton contract loss, so that's factored, obviously, into our 2013. And the other variable, I'd remind everyone, that can impact our coal volumes up or down is weather. That's always the case. The biggest driver is when we have a deep cold winter season and more importantly, how early, how long and how deep will the summer season be, and that can always influence our volumes.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was curious, what do we make about when you mentioned these contract losses, it seems like that happened last year with some of the legacy repricing, same thing this year. Does that suggest that some of the competitors are being a bit more aggressive on price than you'd expect? How do we sort of take that?","Robert M. Knight","If I can just make a comment and then I'll turn it over to Eric. I mean, Bill, that's -- we're negotiating contracts every day of the week. There's a lot of visibility given probably to the legacy renewals, but I would just say that we compete vigorously every day of the week on whether it's a legacy contract or non-legacy. So it doesn't strike us as unusual. That's the business we're in, that there's constantly negotiations taking place, and there are factors like price and service, et cetera, that go into those equations. But Eric, do you want to elaborate?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, I'll add to that, Bill. Price negotiations, as Rob said, I mean, they're always difficult. We always compete in the marketplace. We expect to win some, we expect to lose some, but our strategy remains the same. We're going to be reinvestable. We have had that strategy for many years now, and we remain dedicated to that strategy and focused on it. I mentioned that for 2012, we had about $350 million in legacy. We retained about 80% of that, and we feel pretty good about that retention rate.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Is return on capital metrics now up around 14% CapEx coming down? Is there sort of something to think about there, where the returns have gotten better, you slowed the growth in the CapEx? I'm not sure sort of if that suggests kind of maybe limited opportunity to keep taking up price because the way the returns are getting from a regulatory standpoint, is there -- maybe, Rob, you can sort of comment on how to think about that.","Robert M. Knight","Yes, though I wouldn't read too much into that connection in terms of the slight lead reduction, the $3.6 billion planned spend this year versus 2012, $3.7 billion and the ROIC. I would say that, as we've said all along and we walked our talk here over the last several years, is we have to improve our returns to justify those kinds of capital investments, and that's the takeaway here, and that's how we look at every capital investment. In terms of there being a slight reduction from year-to-year in capital spend, that's really more timing issues. We expect to spend more, as I mentioned and as Lance mentioned, on Positive Train Control spending this year but less on locomotives. We'll take 100 locomotives this year. And last year, we did 200. So those are all factors. Replacement spending remains strong and hasn't changed. That's a key investment that we spend every year. And the other thing that we talked about last couple years and we'll continue into 2013, as we direct more capital spending in the southern part of our network because of the growth prospects that we are seeing there and the return expectations, so that would be my answer in terms of how we look at our capital spending. And I wouldn't read anything in the slight reduction this year. Lance, you want to add?","Lance M. Fritz","I'll just add, Bill, that we're not at a loss for excellent projects to invest in.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess on the contract -- the legacy contract dealings this year, I wanted to -- maybe asking Bill's question a little bit differently. Of the 20% that you did not retain, is that business that went to a competitor or is that business that is no longer existent and it wasn't really up for renewal?","Robert M. Knight","Justin, as I said before, we compete against both our direct rail competitors. We compete certainly against alternative sources of fuel. The 20% that I'm referring to went to a competitor. And as I said, we are -- we compete [ph] all the time, we're comfortable with the 80% we retained. And our strategy is we want to move our business at reinvestable levels.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then a follow-up, I'm curious, you talked a little bit about the crude growth rate declining as we look out in 2013, albeit staying [ph] at a relatively high level. How much of that is pipeline supplanting some of the movement of crude-by-rail along the Bakken south line? And then also if you could talk a bit about some of the opportunities that you see as we move through this year or maybe into next year, that'd be helpful. You gave some good guidance last year around what kind of shale-related carloads you expect this year. Maybe an update on how you see that trending in 2013.","Robert M. Knight","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, our -- as we mentioned all throughout last year, our shale-related business grew tremendously. I think we've mentioned possibly about 80% [ph] last year. Just because of the size of the base, we certainly are not going to see that same growth rate in 2013. We are expecting to see solid growth. As I mentioned in my comments, the crude oil side of our business will be one of the strongest part of our business, so we're still excited about that. In terms of your pipeline comment, there are -- there is additional pipeline capacity coming on. We did mention at our Dallas discussion, when we were there, that the number, as the capacity of pipeline is coming on, I think probably are barely keeping up with the production increases. So production increases are growing rapidly, that even the pipeline capacity increases, so we still see a place for rail type or crude-by-rail in the market for the foreseeable future.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just because it sounds like nobody's touched on coal yet, one more on coal for you. But on the -- can we read into that lost contract that this was one of those that was won before the pricing paradigm kicked in? Was this kind of naturally on somebody else's network that is shifting over, or is competition increasing on some of the baseload operation given the lighter volumes?","Robert M. Knight","Ken, I would just say, and Eric can expand on this, that we always have, we always will compete vigorously in our business. Coal's no different, but coal clearly is an area where we do. But Eric, want to comment on this?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, the contract, Ken, that we're referring to was a legacy contract. I mean, we've talked about our legacy contracts for many years. It was one of our legacy contracts. And as we've been saying for years, our strategy is to ensure that we price at market rates and that we attain reinvestable rates.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I understand it was legacy, but was it one that had been won during kind of the heated battles of before the legacy pricing contract kicked in, before like '03, '04? Was that a contract that had been won maybe based on price and therefore, you viewed it as not a core part of your network or was this just a competed [ph] business?","Robert M. Knight","Ken, let me just say I wouldn't get too hung up on the timing of when those discussions took place or when the decision was made. And of course, we don't have visibility absolutely to when they made the ultimate decision. We know when we were informed. But I would also just say the piece of business we're talking about in October and November we called it out, it was about 10 million tons of coal, it fits nicely with our competitor, and that's all we're probably getting into on that.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This question is I think for Jack, but when we think about 2013, a slower economy, and maybe a little bit less year-on-year tailwind from those legacy renewals that you had early last year, how should we be thinking about the OR expansion? I mean, you had a lot in 2012. Is it going to be diminished from those levels of gains but still a pretty positive turn?","Robert M. Knight","I'm sorry, could you repeat your question?","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'm just asking with a soft economy, less contribution from legacy renewals that you had last year, how should we be thinking about OR expansion in 2013?","Robert M. Knight","Yes, let me -- this is Rob. Remember, we gave guidance of hitting a sub-65% operating ratio target by 2017. We've previously given a 65% to 67% by 2015. And if we can't keep backing it up, we had previously given a lower -- the low 70s, and we previously gave 75%. But we've always said, we're going to get there as efficiently, safely as we can. We're not using that as a hard stop. We're going to get there as early as we possibly can, assuming markets cooperate. But we're going to focus on safety, service, productivity, and with that service comes our confidence that we're going to be able to get core real pricing gains. We define that as inflation plus. Those are still the same principles that are driving us forward. To your point, does the tail sort of get a little slower as you get into the 60s, where we are today, as you head to that 65%? Sure. The slope of the line, coming from 87% to 67%, is a pretty dramatic slope. Going from 67% to that sub-65% target is a little bit different slope, but our focus and our commitment and our confidence of making progress hasn't changed at all. So we're going to continue to drive the same principles that got us to where we are as we move forward.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, and how do we think about core pricing gains this year? You've been running in the 4%, 4.5% range. And I understand that with coal coming off last year, obviously, you didn't get the full benefit in your calculation of those coal contracts that were renegotiated. But should we be assuming something similar to 4% throughout '13?","Robert M. Knight","We don't give specific guidance on the pricing numbers other than to say that it's going to be inflation plus or real pricing gains. The other thing that I would remind you is as we look backwards, we're not giving guidance going forward on this. As we look backwards, remember that we've obtained from legacy renewals 1.5% to 2% from legacy in our core pricing gains. So depending on the timing and how much legacy you have in any particular period will influence certainly how much pricing you get. But even ex-legacy, that can be lumpy from the time that contracts come up for renewal in the legacy front. But non-legacy, we're confident that we'll get that inflation plus overall pricing number, and that's the guidance that we're giving as we look forward.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Trahan.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So another one on coal. When I look at the 13.5% decline in 2012, how much of that do you think is structural of plants closing or losing business? And then if at some point we get to gas prices back above $4 or $4.50, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years from now, whenever, how much of this 13% decline in coal do you think comes back?","Robert M. Knight","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, Scott, we attempted to say back in Dallas, we attempted to separate the market drivers from the plant closures. Today, there is surplus plant capacity versus the demand. So plant closures aren't necessarily going to impact the volume of tons. It's really the demand for electricity generated by coal. So if you look at it on that metric, coal historically has had about a 50% market share; was probably in the high 40s, 18 months ago; for 2012, it's probably call it 37%, 39% market share. Coal electrical generation, we think that's about where it's going to be at a $3.50, $4 natural gas price. As natural gas prices go up, that percent of market share will grow, and the potential for coal volumes will grow. Additionally, if you look at the mix of where the coal is being produced, certainly, Southern Powder River Basin coal is a cheaper coal to produce than Central Appalachian coal. So we think you will continue to see a migration of market share from Central Appalachian coal to Powder River Basin coal for the amount of coal that's moving.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So it sounds like you think that a lot of what you lost in '12, you can make up at some point, not in '13, but at some point in the future if gas prices get back to more normalized levels.","Eric L. Butler","As we were saying, if gas prices stay at $3.50, $4 or above, we think that the coal market share and therefore, our potential to participate in that coal market share vis-a-vis natural gas will be positive going forward.","Robert M. Knight","That and weather and the economy or more electricity demand, all those are factors that would be a positive for us.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. And then one on the Intermodal side, so better domestic volume growth than we've seen in a little while, and then the yields growth slowed a little bit to what we've seen. Wondering if there's any changes in the strategy when it comes to domestic Intermodal to focus a little bit more on growth and less on pricing, or am I not reading that right?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, I don't think you're reading it right. If you think about our domestic Intermodal strategy, our strategy has been consistent and firm, and we're going forward with the same strategy in the future that we've had in the past. Domestic Intermodal has huge opportunities in terms of conversion, over-the-road conversion, and each year for the last 3 years, we've had excessively high domestic Intermodal volumes driven by over-the-road conversions. We still think that there's a large market out there. We estimate there's probably $7 million to $10 million of over-the-road truckloads that can be penetrated by the Intermodal market. And so we --- our strategy is to go after those over-the-road truckloads. We're going to continue to go after that. We're going to continue to do it as pricing through the market and strong reinvestability in that business.","Robert M. Knight","7 million to 10 million units.","Eric L. Butler","Yes, 7 million to 10 million units, yes.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research","I wanted to ask a question, first, just about the growth that you've experienced in your southern region. You've mentioned a number of times the volumes in that region are at pre-recession levels. I just wondered if you could give us some context on where volumes are relative to prior peak levels in that region.","Robert M. Knight","Lance?","Lance M. Fritz","Yes, sure. So our pre-recession levels were, relatively speaking, historic peaks. So the South right now is at historic peaks, and we're seeing a lot of that volume show up in carload traffic in terminals.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research","Is that a function of the growth in crude-by-rail primarily, or are you seeing a lot of the other traffic routes also back at prior peak levels?","Lance M. Fritz","It's part a function of crude-by-rail. It's also part a function of Texas booming from the standpoint of oil production, the shale plays and all of the related activity with that. It's also reflective of the auto strength to and from Mexico.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research","Okay. If I could sneak one last one in, I was sort of intrigued by your comment that you expect a stronger international peak in 2013. And I was just curious whether that is a general comment on the expectation of a stronger economy or whether, in fact, you're becoming more optimistic that the housing upturn will translate into a ripple effect into things like furniture and that sort of thing.","Eric L. Butler","Yes, I would say it's both. We certainly -- there's a lot of economic uncertainty. And as Rob said and others have said, there's a lot of things that are happening in Washington that could take us in a lot of different directions. But we're certainly hopeful there will be a stronger economy in the second half of the year. And of course, as housing strengthens, as the global insight projections are suggesting that it will continue to strengthen, the things that you build housings with, so whether it's furniture and other internal items, will ride our Intermodal outlook for the second half of the year.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe just a question on the legacy coal volumes from 2012 that maybe didn't move, when you look at the scenario, maybe $3.50 to $4 natural gas, is there amount of that legacy business on the coal side that you would expect to move in 2013 that maybe you would see that coming through in either core pricing or, I guess, maybe incremental margins? Just want to kind of think about that a little bit in this natural gas kind of environment.","Robert M. Knight","Let me just make a comment, and then Eric may want to elaborate, and I'll come at it from the pricing standpoint. It's kind of a difficult question to answer from what's normal, but you kind of roughed up the impact we had on pricing. As we increased the terms and conditions in pricing on some of those legacy contracts and did not then get all the full volume compared to what we might have in the past. That hurt us in our pricing calculation about 0.5 point in the quarter. So to your point, there's clearly a drag there. I guess, the mystery or the question then would be how much of that will come back, and I guess it's dependent upon all the other factors that Eric walked through. Eric, if you want to add?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, and the only thing I would add to what Rob would say is as the coal business comes back for that -- for those repriced legacy contracts, we will not consider that price going forward. But to your point, Chris, it will be in our margins going forward.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And when you think about maybe what the breakpoint on -- can you give us any help, I guess, on maybe what the breakpoint on natural gas is for a portion of that business? I mean, is this something in the neighborhood of $3.50 or maybe is it a little bit lower? I guess I just want to get some rough kind of guidelines maybe to use there.","Eric L. Butler","We -- our best assessment is the market kind of currently is at $3.50, $4. And as the price of natural gas goes higher, coal becomes much more competitive. As it goes lower than that, natural gas becomes much more competitive.","Robert M. Knight","Chris, I would just add that we're certainly in unchartered territory here just that we were on the downside, that at what point exactly will utilities switch back and what gas price, and one of the factors to consider, which we don't have visibility on, is how long has the utility contracted for the gas. That's a variable also that -- we'll see how that plays out.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Jason Seidl of Dahlman Rose.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","I'll bring up an old question but ask it in a different way since I've covered you guys for an awful long time. I do remember when you battled with your western partner for a small percentage of market share. It doesn't seem like this is the case, it seems like this is normal back and forth in terms of contracts that might move. Am I right in my interpretation?","Robert M. Knight","Jason, you're absolutely right. I mean, one of the lessons learned that you know well and we've communicated and we're still driven by is we're not in this for market share. And I think where we walked our talk, as much as anything, is we turned in this record financial results without the benefit of positive volume for the year. If you go back to when we started this whole turnaround effort, if you will, and the returns and focus on the right fundamentals of the business, we were running higher levels of volume in the high 80s operating ratio. So we learned that lesson, and we understand that it's not a market share game. We're certainly aware of what's happening in the market, but we're focused on competing, providing good service, pricing it right and generating returns.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. My next question is going to actually look out a little bit further than actually being able to be focusing on, but as I look at your Auto business, I looked at a lot of growth in the plants in Mexico. Even if they don't happen to go on firm [ph] as much as they go [ph] on cashew, cashew [ph] does distribute them to other railroads, including yourself. Talk a little bit about some of the new plants online and how might that impact UNP in 2014?","Eric L. Butler","You're right, Jason, there's an immense amount of auto construction new capacity coming on in Mexico. Vast majority of that is coming on for export to the U.S. or actually export to Europe and Asia. And some of the manufacturers are adding capacity in Mexico and just not enough export back to Europe and Asia, but the large portion of that is going to be dedicated to North America, particularly the U.S. We have the best franchise crew from Mexico. We have the best autos franchise. We have, as we've said, publicly about 75% market share in the autos market. A large portion of our autos business is to and from Mexico. We work with both the KCSM and the FXE equally. And so our perspective is no matter where the auto plants are located in Mexico, whether they're still served by the KCS, served by the FXE or dual-served by both of them, we want to work effectively with the partners and provide an effective service and take it to destinations in the U.S. And we have the best franchise, and we're going to continue to build on that franchise.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to focus a little bit. I understand your core pricing's intact at that inflation plus. But looking a little bit at the mix effect from some of the length of haul moves, I noted your Coal volumes and Ag volumes most, are hardest hit here this quarter. But in one, the average revenue per car was up 12% in Coal and flat in Ag. I was wondering if you might be able to, Eric, perhaps give us some color as to the difference in length of haul there and what implication that might have on mix effect going into 2013 on those 2 -- those areas.","Robert M. Knight","Eric, you want to?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, our coal mix of length of haul really did not essentially change in 2012. The ARC affect, as we've been talking about, are focused on legacy pricing and repricing on legacy contracts. If you look at our Ag side, we did have a length of haul with the drought and the very small corn crops. Our length of haul in taking corn to destinations was significantly shortened. Our California feeders used a lot of local feed as opposed to long-haul corn, which is relatively high priced. So our length of haul was impacted and our Ag business significantly primarily due to the corn drought factor.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy of Susquehanna.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","A longer-term question on coal. If I think about some of the sourcing differentials between the eastern franchises and the western franchises, obviously, PRB coal is in an advantageous position long term. It's cleaner burning, it's more economical, it's more competitive with gas at a lower price. So more than at least the academic, you would think it's more fungible or might back-fill lost production, that's environmentally viable, eastern mines, but that's more of an academic observation. I was just wondering if you could give a realistic assessment in terms of -- do we see sourcing shift over the next 3, 5, 7 years, to what extent might you be a continued share gainer and might that make your coal franchise grow more quickly than the market, whatever the market is going to be?","Robert M. Knight","Matt, let me make a couple of comments, and I'll turn it back over to Eric. I think all the academic -- the positives, as you repeated, we would agree with all those. The other thing that, if you recall, that we gave some guidance on October, was our export opportunity, albeit relatively small compared to the eastern routes but still a nice growth opportunity for us. Eric, if you want to...","Eric L. Butler","Yes, I would just add to what Rob said and kind of repeat what we've said before, if you look at the coal overall market share, natural gas prices being in the range that they're in, the market share will probably remain high 30s, perhaps low 40s, vis-\u00e0-vis natural gas. We do continue to see a shift from Central Appalachian coal, which probably needs to be at $5.50 natural gas prices versus the Powder River Basin coal -- sort of $5, $5.50 versus Powder River Basin coal at $3.50, $4. So we will, do expect to see a natural shift in the share from Central App to Western coal.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Ceraso, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on a comment earlier about your returns, and I'm just wondering what your view is. Do you think that given that you're generating 14% returns on capital, do you see an increased risk that you'll face more rate cases?","Robert M. Knight","Chris, that's something that we'll continue to communicate our message as broadly as we can in terms of -- we have to earn adequate returns. We have to grow our returns to be able to make the kinds of capital investments that we are making and that we hope to make going forward as long as the returns are there. I think what it does introduce is more discussion on, which I know you're well aware of and others as well, the whole replacement costs way of looking at your returns. I mean, if you factor that in rather than a 14%, hard numbers would look more like call it a 7-ish. So that's a message that we'll continue to communicate and continue to work on, but we have to earn adequate returns in order to make these kinds of capital investments.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Makes sense. And then just a follow-up on the revenue per car in the Chemical division. Can you just explain why that was flat in the light of such big growth in crude? I would have thought that, that would have had a positive effect on your revenue per car. So maybe explain where the offsets are and if that's something that, going forward, you think the growth in crude will help improve revenue per car.","Robert M. Knight","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","If you look at our Chemicals business overall and kind of look at it historically, our revenue per car in our Chemicals business has been some of the best over all of our businesses. As we talked in previous earnings releases, our crude oil business, the majority, if not all of that, is underlying business [indiscernible] moving from our interchanges with our CP [ph] partners and BN Santa Fe, where we interchange also substantial business with them in terms of the crude oil market. If the crude oil business -- because our Chemicals business has such a good revenue per car, the crude oil business is not substantially different than what our -- the remainder of our base Chemicals business is. And so we don't necessarily see a big driver of that in the future.","Robert M. Knight","Chris, I would just add to that, that arguably, the right way to look at it, the benefit that we're talking about that we're in fact achieving here, is not spelled out in the ARC analysis but it's more in our returns. And I would say that the new business growth that we're seeing, while it's not changing significantly the chemical line arc, it is a very positive contributor to our overall margin expansion that we're experiencing.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Larkin of Stifel, Nicolaus.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","On the issue of train size, I know it's difficult, with all the growth being focused on the southern part of the network, to really get a lot of traction there. But as you put more capital to work in the South, how do you think you're going to be able to leverage train size over the next, say, 2 to 5  years as presumably traffic continues to build down in that part of the country.","Robert M. Knight","Sure. Lance?","Lance M. Fritz","Yes, sure. So across the system, we have opportunity on train size. We continue to demonstrate that quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year. When you look at the South, everywhere that we see significant volume growth and have seen significant volume growth, we've got capital being invested that helps us continue to grow size. So if you look at the route between El Paso, Dallas, Shrieveport, we call that the Texas Pacific route, or TP route, we've had some substantial investment going there for siding extensions in new sidings. That helps us grow train size. We're doing the same kind of investments on the north\/south route that supports crude oil, as well as Ag to the Gulf. Once that kicks back up, as well as the chemical industry franchise. And then we've been making incremental investments around the state of Texas end points north, that help us on our Intermodal and Autos business to and from Mexico. So virtually everything that's shipping to and from Texas has an opportunity for train size in the next [indiscernible].","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Very good answer. And then maybe a longer-term question on International Intermodal. Haven't really talked too much about the new Panama Canal locks that are opening up, I think, in early 2015. Has your view changed at all in terms of how much, if any, of the transpacific traffic might shift to the all-water route to access some of the ports on the East Coast that presumably by then will be able to handle the larger ships, what might your response be? Is there a way to preserve some of that traffic over the West Coast ports?","Robert M. Knight","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, John, our view hasn't changed from what we've said before. Today, there's about 30% of the business that is all-water route to the Panama Canal. And the rough dividing line is roughly the Appalachians, to go east of the Appalachian, typically go all-water. West of the Appalachian, you [ph] can have a land bridge, a rail product. This is kind of the rough rule of thumb. We think that might change by 1% or 2%, so you might go from 30% to 31%, 32%. But as we've pointed out before, the Panama Canal also has to get a return for the significant amount of investments that they're making. The other thing that we pointed out publicly before is that if you look at the supertankers, the Panama tankers, they really have a route to the East Coast now, particularly as the production goes further and further into Southeast Asia. And so to the extent that the business that makes sense to go into those big tankers and go to the East Coast, they can do that now, not going through the Panama Canal but going the opposite direction. And we do see some of those flows going in now, which is why we're not sure we're going to see much beyond 1% or 2% change as you go forward. And last point I would make is we still think that international trade and economic growth is going to grow the pie. So we still see upside volume growth on the long term as the pie grows.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Eric, I think this question is for you. I was wondering where you ended the EMP and UMAX fleet count at the end of the year, and what net growth expectation there are for 2013.","Eric L. Butler","Yes, we don't typically give our explicit kind of container fleet count publicly. We're excited about our MCP programs, and we do have a large container ownership. We, with our partners, have the strongest container ownership position in the industry, and so we think that that's a competitive advantage for us long term. And the way we're using that with our MCP program, we think, is the right strategic direction we've been, pleased with the success, and we're going to build on it.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess directionally, could you give us some sense whether you would expect total fleet count to grow in line faster or slower than what Domestic Intermodal growth would be in 2013.","Eric L. Butler","Yes, that's a good question. As you know, the last couple of years, the total industry fleet count grew significantly and substantially. We added to our fleet, IMCs added to their fleet, and so there were large fleet additions over the last several years. I do not expect to see significant, if any, fleet additions from an industry perspective. This year certainly, each company will make their own decision, but I think if you look at it, the industry probably has enough capacity to absorb at least growth in the next year or 2, but we'll see what happens from a capacity standpoint.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","In the current trucking capacity and fuel price environment, can you comment on your ability to close some of the historical discount between Intermodal and trucking price [ph].","Eric L. Butler","That's a good question. If you look at tracking capacity, it's narrowing. If you look at the driver shortages, they are increasing shortages. There's some evidence that as the construction industry is coming back, it's more difficult for the trucking industry to get qualified drivers. And mid-year, the new hours-of-service law will come in place, which will also be an impact on the available drivers. So we think that the trends remain strong, that Intermodal will increase its value proposition vis-\u00e0-vis over-the-road truck as we go throughout this year and future years.","Lance M. Fritz","And Eric, don't forget our service products' port side as well.","Eric L. Butler","Absolutely.","Lance M. Fritz","An outstanding service product. It's very competitive with truck right now.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Maybe just a follow-up for Eric. Eric, considering shifts in manufacturing to North America from other historically lower-cost regions, Union Pacific is perhaps uniquely positioned to capitalize on either location where products are made. Are you sort of ambivalent as to whether products are made in Mexico versus Asia, or is there an advantage to Mexico and perhaps you can haul raw materials and finished goods as well, or lower average rate per Intermodal car perhaps a disadvantage to Asian imports? Maybe you could just give some color on if you have preference given those 2 options.","Eric L. Butler","Yes, that's a great question. I'm not sure I would phrase it as a preference. What I would say is that there is a very strong trend with Mexico having a very quality-effective, low-cost workforce and not having the supply chain issues and potential other issues that you may see in some of the Asian countries. You are seeing the trends, and you're also seeing a trend of near-sourcing actually even from Europe due to lower energy prices in the U.S. driven by the shale plays. I think over the next several years, we're going to see -- and we're actually starting to see it now in terms of inquiries from companies for rail sidings, so to speak, so the actual opportunity is still several years in the future. But we're seeing a growing trend in near-sourcing to North America, both in Mexico and the U.S., that we think will be upside for the rail industry.","Robert M. Knight","I would just add that because of the strength of our network, we're in the position to leverage both opportunities because of our strength of both the ports and our unique strengths in and out of Mexico being the only railroad that serve [indiscernible] the border crossing point.","Eric L. Butler","And the other thing is that as we have these manufacturing opportunities come, they typically bring good jobs, which helps unemployment, which again helps -- as the driver for the economy, which helps our transportation outlook.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Don Broughton of Avondale Partners.","Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Looking at this kind of just to 100,000-foot kind of a question here, I'm looking at all of your operating metrics, and they just -- every one of them continues to get better and better and better. Obviously, you've more than adequately invested in the infrastructure. So when I look at capital investment and I look at your outlook for 2013, and you need the economy to participate, that makes sense, to what level is there flexibility? I understand PTC, that's going to be what it is on mandate. And you got infrastructure replacement budgeted at $1.675 billion. How much of the other is flexible in your mind if you didn't get the economy you're looking for and could be trained towards other items such as share repurchase?","Robert M. Knight","Don, let me say a couple comments, and I'll refer to Lance to elaborate. First of all, remember that every capital dollar we spend, we are very focused on hitting the return base. So we go through the calculations based on what we think the projection of the economy is going to be in volumes and service, safety and returns from that business. And that's not going to change. So if there was ever a point where we didn't feel confident in making those investments, rest assured, we would back off making those capital investments. To the point, I know you know this, that in our capital spend, about $2 billion each year is for replacements, so a few points above and beyond that, we've got other spending decisions. Lance, you want to elaborate?","Lance M. Fritz","Yes, you got that just right, Rob. And like in every year, Don, we know going into the year what our on-ramps and off-ramps are, depending on what the economy does. So as we stand right now, we've got a good, robust plan that will be able to match capital spend with what is happening in the economy or what our needs are.","Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","So it's fair to say that your CapEx outlook is much more dynamic than most people assume it to be or understand it to be. Is that a fair statement?","Lance M. Fritz","I think that's a pretty fair statement, absent the -- what Rob reminded you of, and that is over 1\/2 is keep the store open in capital spending.","Robert M. Knight","And of course, we have Positive Train Control in our current numbers, and we have that still in front of us. But Lance is right, we will -- the rest is flexible, if you will, and that's based on returns.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Sterne Agee.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","It's been a long call, most of my questions have been answered. Just a quick one here. When Coal does normalize -- I'm referring to the question you had about what could come back once Coal does normalize. When we add that in with the new crude carriage, the frac sand, the piping that's going up, do you think the net effect of this, if I look at it on a total energy universe basis, will be long-term positive growth, or will the crude be able to offset the structural coal losses?","Robert M. Knight","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","So when you talk about coal, again, I don't think we are projecting, I don't think the market is projecting, that coal is going to return to the levels that it needs to be at. I think what we're saying is that given a natural gas range, again, $3.50 to $4, coal will probably stay in that round number, 40% share in the market. So I'm not sure we are projecting that to be significantly [indiscernible] return back to its historical levels, unless we have an assumption about natural gas prices being significantly higher.","Robert M. Knight","And to add to that, to your point, the shale opportunities and all the related moves, we're very optimistic that our network is really well positioned to continue to serve those growing markets. So when you add it all up, I mean, the energy story for us, we think, is a very positive story.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","With regard to labor costs, I was just taking a look at the annualized average rate for the fourth quarter, which was down about 4% year-on-year, and then compared to the full 2012, it's down about 3%. And I'm just wondering, as we look forward, is the fourth quarter a good guide for the average rate for 2013?","Robert M. Knight","No, it's not. I would expect that that's going to increase. Remember the tax refund I mentioned in my comments certainly was a factor in that. There was also a greater percentage, if you will, of growth in our capital spending program as it relates to labor. So I would expect that, as we move into the first quarter, to be more normalized, if you will, at a call it 3% range.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So just a follow-up on that, would the 2012 -- with that incremental increase that you mentioned did then -- if we just make minor adjustments around that, would the 2012 annualized number then be sort of this figure we should be looking at based on 100,000 or 200,000 [ph], roughly give or take.","Robert M. Knight","Yes, I mean, sort of a 3% growth assumption in there, that's probably not an unreasonable with inflation.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Anthony Gallo of Wells Fargo.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","If you pull together all of your unconventional energy business, what's the -- roughly the mix right now between the inbound, frac sand, pipe, et cetera, versus the outbound take away? And what does that mix look like, 2013, 2014, how might that change?","Robert M. Knight","Eric, I'm not sure we have that.","Eric L. Butler","So I just want to make sure the question that you're asking. You're asking how much of our business is inbound versus outbound, recognizing it is in different regions and different origins and destinations?","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Eric L. Butler","So our frac sand and pipe business predominantly is going from kind of Minnesota, Wisconsin, down to South Texas and West Texas, so it's going inbound that way. And our crude oil business is coming from the Bakken going to the South. It's probably a 55-45, 60-40 kind of a split.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And does that change materially as you get into 2013, 2014? I guess, just the take away [indiscernible].","Eric L.

That will grow faster than the inbound opportunity in 2013.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. Time for 1 final question. That question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just 2 quick follow-ups just to clarify on guidance, you said your -- the potential for quite positive volume growth overall, if you could just kind of clarify that a little bit. And then specifically with Ag, kind of what you're expecting for the full year, kind of first half, back half, that would be great.","Robert M. Knight","Yes, just to remind everyone, what we said on the volume guidance is we said assuming the economy cooperates, and let's define that as an industrial production number of around 2%, we would expect when you add it all up that our overall volumes in the face of slight decline in coal, is what we call that also, we expect our volumes to be on the positive side of the ledger, overcoming, if you will, that slight falloff in Coal. Ag, we said we got challenges in the first half of the year. We expect that things will hopefully improve in the back half of the year, but we didn't give any further clarity beyond that.","Operator","I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Rob Knight for closing comments.","Robert M. Knight","Okay, great. Again, we're very proud of what we've accomplished here and look forward to continuing to meet the challenges in 2013. And thanks for joining us on the call, and we look forward to speaking with you again in April.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants' lines will be in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.","It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may now begin.","Lance Fritz","Thank you, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me her today in Omaha are Beth Whited, Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, our Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2018 or $1.98 per share. That is an all time quarterly record for Union Pacific even without the benefit from corporate tax reform. This represents an increase of 29% and 37% respectively when compared to 2017.","Total volume increased 4% in the quarter compared to 2017. Premium and Industrial carloadings both increased 6%, while agricultural products and energy volumes were both down 1%. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 63.0%, which was up 1.1 points from the second quarter of 2017. Higher fuel prices had a 1.1 point negative impact on the operating ratio.","Strong top line growth was offset by an increase in volume related costs and higher spending due to lingering network inefficiencies. Network performance improved significantly for the first two months coming out of the first quarter.","However, service interruptions from a tunnel outage on our Western region and challenges caused by localized train crew shortages created graded a significant headwind in the month of June. The tunnel disruption is now behind us and operations should continue to improve, as graduates from the training pipeline enter productive train service in the coming months.","I am confident that we have the right plans in place to drive improvement in our operation and a better service experience for our customers. The team will give you more of the details on the second quarter starting with Beth.","Elizabeth Whited","Thank you, Lance, and good morning. For the second quarter our volume was up 4% driven by strength in our Industrial and Premium business groups with offsets in both agricultural and energy. We generated positive net core pricing at 2% in the quarter with continued pricing pressure in our coal and international intermodal markets.","The increase in volume and the 4% improvement in average revenue per car drove an 8% increase in freight revenue. With that let's take a closer look at the performance of each business group.","Ag products revenue was up 5% as the 1% volume decrease was more than offset by a 6% average revenue per car increase. Grain carloads were down 4% driven by weakness in wheat due to a low quality crop and reduced US competitiveness in a world export market. This was partially offset by strong corn and soybean shipments both domestically and for export.","Grain products carloads were up 6% due to continued demand for ethanol exports and other biofuels, coupled with strength in animal feed products as a substitute for soybean meal. Fertilizer and sulfur experienced a 5% decrease in shipments as a result of new local production capacity.","Energy revenue increased 5% for the quarter on a 1% decrease in volume and a 6% increase in average revenue per car. Coal and coke volume were down 10% driven primarily by a contract change and retirement, coupled with lower natural gas prices. Natural gas prices fell 10% versus the second quarter 2017 and PRB coal inventories continue to be below the 5 year average.","Sand carloads were up 24% due to increased crude production from major shale formations and favorable crude oil prices. Furthermore, the favorable crude oil price spread also driven increased in crude oil shipments, which was the primary driver for the 19% increase in petroleum LPG and renewable carloads for the quarter.","Industrial revenue was up 8% on a 6% increase in volume and a 2% increase in average revenue per car during the quarter. Construction carloads increased 8%, primarily driven by rock and cement due to pent up demand and dry weather in the south.","Metals volume increased 18% for the quarter driven by strong pipe demand in West Texas and Oklahoma for shale drilling. In addition, strong industrial production drove growth in various other commodities, including industrial chemicals, plastics and forest products.","Premium revenue was up 14% with a 6% increase in volume and 8% increase in average revenue per car. Domestic intermodal volume increased 7%, driven by continued strength in parcel and stronger demand from tight truck capacity. We also saw an acceleration in price per load in this segment during the quarter.","Auto parts volume growth was driven by over the road conversions and growth in light truck demand which minimize the impact of lower overall production levels. International intermodal volume was up 7%, as new ocean carrier business win began to ramp up in the second quarter.","Finished vehicle shipments were up 1% due to stronger second quarter sales increased, production at UP serve plant and strong production and shipments from Mexico.","As we look ahead at the second half of 2018, our Ag products group will continue to face challenges in the export grain market from high global supplies, foreign tariffs and a low protein wheat crop. However, we are seeing positive indications in a market due to crop uncertainty in South America.","We anticipate continued strength in ethanol exports driven by value as an octane and oxygen enhancer. We also expect growth in food & beverage shipments due to Cold Connect penetration tightening truck capacity and continued strength in Import Beer.","For energy, we expect favorable crude oil price spreads to drive positive results for petroleum products. But tougher year over year frac sand comparisons coupled with an emerging local sand supply will continue to generate a level of uncertainty.","We expect coal to continue to experience headwinds in the third quarter with natural gas prices. And as always, for coal, weather conditions will be a key factor for demand.","For industrial, we anticipate upside in plastics as production levels increase, as well as continued strength in industrial production driving growth in several commodities.","For premium, over the road conversions from continued tightening and truck capacity will present new opportunities for domestic and auto parts growth. Despite challenges within the international intermodal market we anticipate year-over-year grow for the remainder of the year resulting from new business opportunities.","The US light vehicle sales forecast for 2018 is 16.9 million units down about 2% from 2017. However, production shift in some new import business will create some opportunities to offset the weaker market demand.","With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance.","Cameron Scott","Thanks, Beth. And good morning. Starting with safety performance, our reportable personal injury rate was 0.76 flat compared to the first half of last year. With regards to rail equipment incidents and derailments, our reportable rate improved 3% to 2.93.","In Public Safety a Grade crossing incident rate increased 19% versus 2017 to 2071. While this is disappointing from a year-over-year standpoint, we did show incremental improvement from first quarter to second quarter. We\u2019re optimistic that our continued partnership with communities will improve over Public Safety numbers.","Moving onto network performance. As reported to the AAR, velocity declined 3% and terminal dwell increased 4% compared to the second quarter of 2017. During the first two months of the quarter, we made excellent progress working through our operational challenges, improving our network fluidity and associated service metrics. The tunnel on I-5 corridor in Oregon collapsed in late May, filling it with dirt and rock, which required extensive repairs.","Traffic was rerouted through Salt Lake City incurring additional transit time of 4 to 5 days which negatively impacted our network performance. With the tunnel disruption now behind us service metrics are starting to rebound and we should continue to see further improvement going forward.","The tunnel outage meant more cars spending additional time on the network thus consuming greater locomotive and crew resources. From a locomotive perspective, our surge capacity gave us the flexibility to meet both the network challenges and an increased demand. At quarter end, we had about 200 high horsepower road units and storage. Going forward, we are confident we have ample resources to continue improving service and keep pace with demand.","On the TE&Y front, a PNW reroutes, peak vacation season and holidays made June a challenging month. But we continue to maintain a strong recruiting pipeline to meet current and future TE&Y requirements. Our TE&Y workforce is at 8% when compared to the second quarter of 2017, primarily driven by an increase of approximately 900 employees in the training pipeline.","We graduated about 225 individuals in July and plan to graduate approximately 250 trainees per month in August and September. While crew supply has been fairly tight this summer, it should improve later in the quarter as we realize the benefits of our recruiting and hiring initiatives.","Although we have made substantial improvements in our operations, we are not where we need to be on achieving productivity. As we right size our resources, we had significant opportunity to reduce train crew costs and maintenance spending associated with the larger locomotive fleet.","We will also refocus our efforts on driving fuel efficiency across our network. Train size performance however continues to be a great spot. We achieved best ever results in our grain category and a second quarter record in our manifest network.","In productivity and other areas like renewable capital projects remain strong. While setback - while setback happen they have not stopped us from working hard as we can to bring service back to normal levels. As service improves we will continue to optimize our network and adjust resources accordingly.","Our goal is to generate solid productivity savings and operational efficiencies that provide an excellent service experience for our customers, while driving margin improvement.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert Knight, Jr.","Thanks and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue was $5.7 billion in the quarter, up 8% versus last year. Positive core price increased fuel surcharge revenue and a 4% increase in volume were the primary drivers of revenue growth for the quarter.","Operating expense totaled $3.6 billion, up 10% from 2017. Operating income totaled $2.1 billion, a 5% increase from last year. Below the line, other income was $42 million compared to $50 million in 2017.","Interest expense of $203 million was up 13% compared to the previous year, and this reflects the impact of a higher total debt balance partially offset by a lower effective interest rates.","Income tax expense decreased 39% to $429 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower tax rate as a result of corporate tax reform and was partially offset by higher pre-tax earnings.","Our effective tax rate was 22.1%, which came in lower than what we were anticipating. Tax rate reductions were enacted in two states during the second quarter, resulting in a reduction in our state income tax liability. For the full-year, we expect our effective tax rate to be closer to 24%.","Net income, totaled $1.5 billion, up 29% versus last year while the outstanding share balance declined 5% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce an all time quarterly record earnings per share of $1.98.","The operating ratio was 63%, which was up 1.1 percentage points from the second quarter last year. The combined impact of fuel price and our fuel surcharge lag had a 1.1 point negative impact on the operating ratio in the quarter compared to 2017. And fuel had a neutral impact on earnings per share year-over-year.","Freight revenue of $5.3 billion was up 8% versus last year. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $412 million, up $178 million when compared to 2017 and up $59 million versus the first quarter. The negative business mix impact on freight revenue in the second quarter was almost a full point.","Growth in sand volumes was offset by an increase in lower average revenue per car intermodal shipments. Core price was 2% in the second quarter. Coal and international intermodal continue to be a challenge from a pricing perspective.","However if we set coal and international intermodal aside, our core price increased to 3% in the quarter. For the full year, we still expect the total dollars that we generate from our pricing actions will well exceed our rail inflation costs.","Turning now to operating expense, slide 19 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense increased 3% to $1.2 billion versus 2017.","The increase was driven primarily by volume related costs, network inefficiencies and increased TE&Y training expenses, partially offset by lower management costs as a result of our workforce reduction program that we initiated last year.","For the full year, we still expect labor and overall inflation to be under 2%. Total workforce levels were flat in the second quarter versus last year. This was driven primarily by a 10% decrease in employees associated with our capital projects.","Employees not associated with capital projects were up around 1%, driven primarily by an increase in the TE&Y training pipeline. Offsetting a portion of this increase was a decrease of more than 500 management employees.","Fuel expense totaled $643 million, up 48% when compared to last year. Higher diesel fuel prices and a 4% increase in gross ton miles were the primary drivers of the increase in fuel expense for the quarter, compared to the second quarter of last year, our average fuel price increased 36% to $2.30 per gallon.","Our fuel consumption rate also increased during the quarter by about 6%. While there were some adverse impact from mix the predominant driver of the increased C rate was the service related challenges that we experienced.","Purchased services and materials expense increased 6% to $630 million. The increase was primarily driven by volume related cost, higher freight car repair expense and increased locomotive repair costs associated with maintaining a larger active locomotive fleet.","Turning now to slide 20. Depreciation expense was $546 million up 4%, compared to 2017. The increase is primarily driven by a higher depreciable asset base. For the full year 2018, we estimate that depreciation expense will increase about 5%.","Moving to equipment and other rents. This expense totaled $265 million in the quarter, which is down 3% when compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by lower locomotive and freight car lease expenses and higher equity income mainly driven by the lower Federal Tax Rate implemented in 2018. These decreases were partially offset by higher car rent expense due to volume growth and slower network velocity.","Other expenses came in at $248 million up 13% versus last year. The primary driver was an increase in property taxes and other expenses partially offset by decrease in personal injury expense and reduced casualty cost. For the full year 2018, we expect other expense to be up about 10% compared to 2017 excluding any unusual items.","On the productivity side. Productivity savings yielded from our G55 + 0 initiatives were entirely offset by additional costs as a result of the continued operational challenges.","We estimate the impact of these operational challenges totaled about $65 million in the quarter. The $65 million of additional costs were spread somewhat evenly across cost categories of comps - comp and benefits, purchased services, fuel and to a lesser extent equipment rents.","Looking ahead as Cam just mentioned, we will be focused on eliminating network cost inefficiencies as quickly as possible so that we can once again begin generating your productivity savings we need to drive margin improvement.","Looking at our cash flow. Cash from operations to the first half totaled $4 billion, up about 17% when compared to last year. Higher net income and lower federal tax payments were partially offset by payments made to our agreement workforce in the first quarter.","Taking a look at adjusted debt levels. The all in adjusted debt balance totaled $25.4 billion at the end of the second quarter up about $5.9 billion since year end 2017. This includes the most recent $6 billion debt offering that we concluded in early June.","We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of about 2.4 times. As we mentioned in our Investor Day, our new target for a debt to EBITDA is up to 2.7, which we will achieve over time.","Dividend payments for the first half totaled $1.1 billion up from $980 million in 2017. This includes the effect of a 10% dividend increase in the fourth quarter of 2017 and an additional 10% increase which occurred in the first quarter of this year.","We repurchased a total of 42.5 million shares during the first half of 2018 including 33.2 million shares in the second quarter. This total includes the initial 19.9 million shares received as part of a $3.6 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we began in June.","We expect to receive additional shares under the terms of the ASR, as the program reaches completion later this year. Between dividend payments and share repurchases we returned $7.8 billion to our shareholders in the first half of this year.","Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we are raising our volume guidance and now expect full-year volumes to be up in the low to mid-single digit range. With positive full-year volume and positive core price, we should continue to see solid top line improvement for the remainder of the year.","On the expense side of the equation, we're working hard to improve our operations and eliminate inefficiency costs within the network. And we still expect to achieve an improved full-year operating ratio in 2018.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance.","Lance Fritz","Thank you, Rob. As we discussed today, we delivered record second quarter earnings per share driven by strong volumes and solid top line revenue growth. While I'm disappointed we did not drop more of that revenue growth to the bottom line, I am encouraged by the strength of the economy and the positive impact on the most of our business segments.","Looking to the remainder of the year, we expect the strong business environment to continue while we regain our productivity momentum and improve the value proposition for all of our stakeholders.","So with that, let's open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes. Good morning. I wanted to ask you about the - I guess, obviously, the tunnel impact and there was some constraints on crew. And you identified that $65 million, how would you think about that number in the second half. I mean it seems like the velocities improved in the last couple of weeks and you've got a better crew position. Does number come down a lot in third quarter or is that kind of a gradual thing where you still have meaningful, I guess, service costs in third quarter?","Lance Fritz","Tom, this is Lance. So I'll start and then let Rob kind of put details around it. So you got that exactly right. What we said was coming into the second quarter, we were making good progress on improving the service levels, decreasing congestion and starting to move some of those costs out.","We had that incident on the I-5 that was very impactful, particularly when it comes to a network that was already a little bit fragile. As are exiting the second quarter coming into the third, we're getting our feedback under us. We see improvement. I don't see any reason absent some other catastrophic event that we don't get right back on the path and start making those same kinds of improvements. Rob?","Robert Knight, Jr.","Yes, I would just add, Tom, it won't go away in the third quarter. There will be some lingering costs but yes, we are all about reducing those aggressively and dramatically, and if you just do the math for us to improve our operating ratio year-over-year, that implies that we will make good progress on the productivity front in both the third and fourth quarter.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate it. On the pricing topic, I mean I guess excluding, I think, international intermodal and coal. I think there was a little tick up to the 3% you identified, but when you look at the total core price at 2%, I think this is the fourth quarter in a row you've been at that level.","I would have expected more of a pick up in that. How do you think we ought to look at that going forward? Is that something that just kind of stay - stuck at 2% and that's just kind of the coal international intermodal headwind continue or do you think it's reasonable to expect that kind of a total coal price to pick up if we look at the next two quarters?","Elizabeth Whited","Well Tom, its Beth. The coal and international intermodal headwinds continue but we're really encouraged by what we see in the truck markets. ELD definitely had an impact. Capacity is kind of tight across all modes of transportation which is giving us good opportunity to price into that.","And just as a reminder we get to touch about a third of it every year and we're halfway through the year so -- and we are like I said encouraged, so.","Tom Wadewitz","So it sounds like realistic to - obviously you don't forecast the price it's going to do, but realistic to expect some improvement in kind of broader price momentum?","Elizabeth Whited","You are right. We really don't predict what pricing is going to do. Like I said we're encouraged by what we see out there, but we do still have some headwinds that we're still dealing with.","Tom Wadewitz","Right, okay. Thank you for the time.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hi. Thanks good morning. I appreciate you taking the question. I guess going back to the operating ratio. Can you quantify what the actual impact was in the quarter from the crews? I guess more specifically the tunnel collapse could have shown some improvement from that just having a hard time getting to run rate into second half that would give you full year improvements on 2018?","Robert Knight, Jr.","Yes. Let me take a shot at that Brian. The tunnel and direct cost was about $6 million to deal with that about half OE have capital. So just kind of size the tunnel itself. But it had clearly a residual impact on the efficiency of the network. And so breaking out exactly what impact the tunnel head beyond the direct cost is really kind of a difficult task. It definitely contributed to the inefficiencies much broader across our network that led to the $65 million of cost.","In terms of what we have to get them without giving a precise number we clearly have to get and can expect to get back on the drag. Again as I said earlier there'll be some lingering costs in the third quarter but we're aggressively going to reduce from the $65 million daily cost that we had in the second quarter and that's what is going to take to improve the operating ratio year-over-year.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. And just a follow-up, As Lance mentioned network is a little bit fragile. So I guess it's time for another PTC update. I'm just want to see how that was trending and on the labor side this is I guess second call we've heard call out on vacations potential headwind on the crew side. So - market's tight overall. I just wanted to get to your sense as to the pipeline being full enough to kind of finally get over the hump here when it comes to gaining crews need the most.","Lance Fritz","Cam do you want to handle the PTC and a little bit about crews?","Cameron Scott","On the crew pipeline as you say you will see the numbers on what the plan to enter into workforce for August and September. That pipeline looks very solid for the remainder of the year.","So as Lance mentioned we do not see a crew issue going forward. It will solidify. On the PTC front our unattended breaking ratio is dropping. That's very positive. And we have initiatives to continue dropping that ratio.","Total stops are about the same at this point as we bring more trains on board to that new technology. So net it's about the same. But the good news is we're making very positive progress on the stop ratio.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. Thanks for the details. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter","Hey, great. Good morning.","Lance Fritz","Good morning.","Ken Hoexter","So you mentioned the upside to your outlook on the revenue side, but Beth mentioned some tariffs impacts on the agriculture. Just wanted to see Beth are you starting to see that spread in any sort of way as they have expanded the tariffs.","And kind of maybe Lance your thoughts on impact on the trade. I know you made some comments on the conference recently. Maybe you can expand on that a little bit.","Lance Fritz","Sure. I'll start Ken and then let Beth talk specifically about our markets. So the concern is that tariffs are just basically going to be a tax, whether it's on U.S. consumption or US products going overseas. And generally, that's going to reduce the amount of demand.","We haven't necessarily seen that wholesale and I'll ask Beth to kind of fill in the blanks in detail. But it's pretty early. Those things just went into effect. We have seen some very specific impacts on us.","But they are pretty granular, right. Inbound on some rail that we buy from Japan. There was a substantial 25% tariff on the last boat that was received. And then we've seen some other discrete impacts on customers. But Beth do you want to fill in the blanks?","Elizabeth Whited","Yes. So when we talk about agriculture, we aren't really seeing the impacts yet, because of the crop uncertainty in South America that I referenced. So I think this year, the Ag business looks okay in the United States. But I think where we're more concerned is in the longer term, what the impacts will be.","And really the other impacts on steel, for example, have kind of a net neutral for us. But anyway to Lance's point, the longer term trade, free trade impacts are the thing we're really keeping an eye on.","Ken Hoexter","Great. And just a follow-up for Rob, if I can. Given the increased expenses, it sounds like with some Lance's comments about the tight network. Do you think the \u2013 are we still at a $3.3 billion CapEx or the increase that given the outages?","And then just a number question, I guess on your buyback yet, $5.5 billion in buyback 33.2 million shares that will be $166 a share. I presume that's not corrected up, because you still have shares coming from the accelerated buyback.","Robert Knight, Jr.","Yes, Ken. On the capital, we're not into planning on increasing to capital. We think the 3.3-ish has discovered for what we need to do to address the issues that we currently have upon us.","On the buyback, yes, that's exactly right. The math that you just did is missing the remaining call it 20% that will be delivered later this year of shares that are a part of that ASR.","Ken Hoexter","Thanks for the input. Appreciate it. Thanks for time.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So Beth, we've been talking about pricing pressure in international intermodal for quite some time. So I'm wondering if you could hash-out the new contract win that you called out there because you did see some volume acceleration finally. And how do you put that into context of this pricing pressure? I think we've been hearing about now for maybe two years.","Elizabeth Whited","So we were doing business with call it two-thirds of the alliance of ONE prior to them combining, and so when we won the rest of that business that's obviously given us that volume boost.","The market is still, I would call it in some - its not exactly in disarray, but there still remains a lot of pressure in that particular market, and we're subsequently seeing quite a bit of pricing pressure in that market.","Not only I guess there's different kinds of - there's different kinds of competition right. There's direct competition with other railroads. There's competition with trucks and then there's competition with other ports. And so all of those things bring different levels of competitive pricing pressure to the market, and that's really what we're dealing with.","Brandon Oglenski","Well, I guess, coming out of your Analyst Day a month or so ago we got the message from you guys that you don't want to just grow for growth sake and you want to make sure you're bringing on the right price.","So I guess that was I was giving out, are you happy with the price of the new contract that's coming on? And I think you also said you can only reprice maybe a one third of your intermodal business. So should we also believe that there's just not a lot of escalators on those contracts either that you can recoup inflation? ","Elizabeth Whited","Okay. So we -- I agree with you. We're interested in growing both price and volume. And we are intently focused on making sure that we receive the value that our capacity is worth when we do both of those things. So as we look forward what you see is we've kind of got two books of business if you will in intermodal right?","You've got the international intermodal business which is generally in more like the three to 5 year contracts that have some sort of an escalator in them that at the time we did the deal we're quite comfortable with.","And then you've got the domestic market that tends to reprice annually, and that domestic market tends to be very truck competitive and that's where we really feel pretty good about what we're seeing in terms of the tightening truck capacity and our ability to get pricing. ","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.","Amit Mehrotra","Thanks, operator. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Rob on the core pricing growth. That 3% ex coal international intermodal that you highlighted any help on where that was on an apples-to-apples basis maybe in early 2015, so we can just give a sense of where we are in the pricing cycle so to speak, X those kind of specific headwinds and how much room there is versus the prior peak? Thanks.","Robert Knight, Jr.","Yes. I don't have that number off hand. I will tell you that mix would come into play. But I would just tell you that three is up from roughly 2.75 earlier this year. So we're feeling good about that number. When you added all in I don't have a reference to 2015. ","Amit Mehrotra","I mean, okay. Just a quick follow-up to that. Do you think based on the pricing environment that you see today on the volume environment obviously getting a little better?","Do you think the trajectory of core pricing should be up or do you think kind of given the guys calculated kind of flat at these levels are better way to think about it?","Robert Knight, Jr.","Well, I would just reiterate what Beth said earlier. We're not going to give the precise answer that you're asking. But as Beth said earlier we\u2019re feeling pretty good about the environment and that if were able to achieve real pricing going forward that will show up in our yield calculation. ","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. I thought I tried anyways. I appreciate it.","Robert Knight, Jr.","I get it.","Amit Mehrotra","Let me ask one more. To be fair this might come across a little bit of a tough question and it's not some meant to be that way. It just comes across that way. But it's obviously on the OR.","If you add back the $65 million headwind in the quarter the profitability of the business is still several hundred basis points lower than what CSX reported in the second quarter when arguably I would say Union Pacific has some structural advantages with respect to returns just given the geographic difference.","So I understand obviously this is a tough question, but Lance, is there a sense of urgency that's been elevated. If you can just help us think about how your views may be evolving in light of what's happening in the east and how you're managing the railroad either from a customer negotiation standpoint or from a customer standpoint? I appreciate it. Thank you.","Lance Fritz","Sure. Notwithstanding what any other railroad is doing, you can see our elevated sense of urgency and focus and determination when, our headline quote for a quarter where we just generated our record earnings per share and record income is and it could have been better, because it could have been better.","To your point, we called out $65 million in costs in the network that really shielded us from generating much more attractive productivity. We demonstrated we know how to do that. We had underlying productivity that was being generated in the quarter, and it's frustrating that we weren't able to drop more of that top line to the bottom line.","So as we talked through and shared with you or the team at our Investor Day, we are laser-focused on getting the network right. We're learning from anyone that we can in terms of better ways to run the network, better ways to generate productivity and efficiency.","We've got all of those projects teed up, lined up. It's hard to make them pay off in an environment where you're basically over-resourced and trying to get the service product back up. We are doing that. That will happen and we will take those excess costs out, which is why we're so confident that we're able to hit that 60 operating ratio in 2020 because we see the underlying strength of the business, top lines growing. Price is attractive.","We've got plenty of productivity opportunity and we know how to get at it. We just got to get rid of these excess costs in the network as we bring our service product back up.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much for answering my questions. Have a good day.","Operator","Your next we comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Scott Group","Thanks. Good morning, guys. So first, can you just clarify what operating ratio you're using for the full-year 2017? And then, I just want to follow up on that last question sort of about CSX and comparison versus you.","We've heard the last few quarters, you talk about, well, we're watching and seeing what other rails are doing and other companies are doing, but it sounds like what we heard today is a part of the six year is adding more head count. CSX just took 11% head count out.","I mean, it's clearly working there. I guess, the question is, why aren't we talking about a real sort of change in strategy here to more sort of fully embrace sort of this precision railroading concept that seems to be working at? Maybe you said, again, we're earning from other things.","Is there anything that you see that you're actually implementing that can give us some sort of confidence in the trajectory of the productivity and margin improvement?","Lance Fritz","Yes. Sure Scott. I'll take that and then I'll let Bob talk about what 2017 full year operating ratio we're using as a comparator. So we discussed this last quarter and also at Investor Day. There are a number of things that we're already doing that we've learned from somebody else whether it's the CSX or the CP, CN.","One of them is we've reduced our low horsepower fleet by one-fourth over the course of the last three years. That has been a fundamental underlying productivity driver even as in 2015 and 2016 our volumes dropped at 12% 13%.","We maintained operating ratio. So that's an example. We talked about the blend and balance pilot that we ran up in the Pacific Northwest that a fair portion of is still in place.","We're right now in the process of continuing to blend and balance our network that is deconstruct specialized networks and reconstruct them as shared networks so that we can balance out our resource consumption whether it's crews and locomotives.","The thing that's frustrating Scott isn't that there's no activity on good ideas to generate more productivity is that we really value the service product to our customers. And first and foremost we're going to give them an excellent service product.","And we've got a very big broad franchise which is a strength of ours. We think in the end that's going to generate if you will winning in the marketplace to do that we've got to generate that excellent service product and experience.","And we're not telling you that we need to add more crews over and above volume that much different. We're saying we've got to get our crews right so that we can get that service product back. That is happening as we speak.","And even so in this quarter volume was up 4% and our crew bays was up mostly in the training pipeline and the active crew base that was basically flat. So we see productivity as being able to happen.","We think it is merely masked right now. And yes there are other initiatives that we've got teed up that we can do and will do.","Robert Knight, Jr.","And Scott the comparison on the OR that we're using for 2017 full year is 62.8. So to your point we reported 63 OR the pension impact in 2017 was about 0.2. So adjusted is 62.8 we're comparing ourselves to.","And by the way the pension impact for us this year would be negligible call it a 10th headwind for us. But again our commitment is to improve the OR year-over-year against the 62.8.","Scott Group","That's helpful. And can you just -- I just want to make sure I understand one point because you said you don't need to grow headcount as much as volume. I thought that any headcount was up 8% maybe you could just clarify what if that's a training thing or not.","Lance Fritz","Sure. It's all into training pipeline. I thank you understand that the training pipeline lasts about four or five months. And it's designed to basically backfill attrition and the TE&Y workforce. So we supercharged the training pipeline.","And then as they graduate they're basically backfilling active employees who are retiring or trading out of the workforce. So our active workforce is basically flat to marginally up and that's what we anticipate. We will not grow the active workforce faster than we're growing volume.","Scott Group","Okay. Make sense. And then just last question, just pricing. I know you're not to forecast pricing. One of the things that some of rails are starting to give and it's helpful they're talking about contract renewals. Can you may be share where contract renewals are tracking, is it above at this 2% range maybe that'll be helpful.","Elizabeth Whited","Yes. I don't think we're going to start using that as a metric that we measure ourselves. We're pretty happy with the way we do it in terms of being conservative and seeing actual results before we start forecasting.","Scott Group","Okay. Thank you.","Elizabeth Whited","Okay.","Operator","The next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.","David Vernon","Hey. Good morning, guys. Switching gears for a second, the domestic intermodal pick up. Beth, could you talk a little bit about what you guys are doing to actually sort of take a little bit more share in that marketplace?","And how we should expect those changes to kind of impact the longer term growth rate, like is this like a one-time contract win kind of thing, or is this actuals or a service design changes that you've been making?","Elizabeth Whited","In domestic intermodal?","David Vernon","Yes. You said \u2013 you guys said domestic was up in terms of volume, right?","Elizabeth Whited","Yes. Domestic is up in terms of volume. I would say, number one, we're doing a lot of things to go and build relationships directly with the BCOs to make sure that we're able to express the value that Union Pacific can provide. We have numerously more lanes of intermodal service than our competitor. And so we tried to raise the awareness of that with the BCO community.","And as the truck tightening has occurred, what we've seen is a pretty significant return from that investment that we're making and ensuring BCOs know that what we can provide. So we are seeing new customers as well as stronger volumes from existing customers.","David Vernon","And as you think about the go-to-market strategy on that stuff, the business that you're growing in there, how would that compare on a pricing standpoint relative to the existing base? Is it kind of an attractive set of rates? I'm just wondering like the simple...","Elizabeth Whited","The way that we think about our business is that we always are striving to ensure that we're generating value and good margin that ultimately drives stronger return for the corporation.","David Vernon","All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.","Allison Landry","Thanks. Good morning. So, of course, we know about intermodal with respect to the tight truck capacity and intermodal conversions. But curious to know, if you're either seeing or if you think this is an opportunity or if there's an opportunity to convert traffic from the highway in the merchandise segment?","Elizabeth Whited","Yes. I would say so. We're converting traffic from the highway into merchandise segment. One of the best examples I can give you is line pipe that's used for drilling that used to be a heavy truck market. Because it's relatively short-haul out of kind of the Houston Gulfport into the Permian and up into Oklahoma.","But we've pretty really targeted business development effort at that and we've been able to convert a significant portion to rails. So we're excited about that. And we have a number of other initiatives across market, but that's maybe one of the best examples I could give you.","Allison Landry","Okay. And do you think that given some of the dynamics that are happening right now with the driver shortage being worse than we've seen it historically. Does that create a bigger opportunity on the merchandise side?","Elizabeth Whited","I think it does. There's a few markets in particular where that's true. One of them is in the fresh and frozen space. The truck availability is really tightened there. There's a lot of demand for that in the east-west long-haul. And that's something that we're very focused on the. Lumber is another win where -- trucks had penetrated in some areas where we're now seeing people returning to rail and wanting more rail. ","Allison Landry","Okay. And I wanted to also ask about what you're seeing in terms of the network performance in the southern region specifically. I mean you've talked quite a bit about some of the pinch points down there. So just curious if you've seen any sequential improvement in the second quarter and the expectation for the second half. ","Elizabeth Whited","Cameron? ","Cameron Scott","The southern region, Allison has been performing very well in the second quarter. We do see volume coming online from some of the new plant expansions that Beth has mentioned in the past. And with some of our new inventory management tools, we've put in place we think the southern region will stay solid stepping into second half of the year.","Allison Landry","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Seidl","Thank you, operator. Good morning, team. Quick question. When I'm looking at your volume outlook in the second half and I'm comparing that to the first quarter numbers. It looks like automotive sales is the one that kind of flipped it went from a negative to a question mark. I was wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on that. ","Elizabeth Whited","So in the second quarter we did see a little bit of strengthening in auto sales. I think you got in June like a 17.5 SAR which was pretty high compared to what we've been seeing in the earlier part of the year. A forecast that we've seen from the OEMs as well as from some of our business development efforts appear to make that more of a neutral for us where we thought it was a bit of a negative question mark earlier. I don't think we're going to see massive growth they are or anything but it feels a little stronger than it felt earlier in the year. ","Jason Seidl","Okay. Fair enough. And Rob if I can go below the line as we look out for the other income line item, you sort of gave the guidance for other revenue. I don't know if I heard the other income because you have a pretty tough comp here coming up in 3Q for modeling purposes. ","Robert Knight, Jr.","Yes, you're right Jason. Because last year you're calling out a good point. Last year's comp is difficult. We had some unusual transactions that we called out. I would say generally it could be lumpy and it's hard to predict. But I would say somewhere in the $30 million to $40 million quarter range is a reasonable range expectation for other income. ","Jason Seidl","Okay. That\u2019s good. I appreciate it. Then thank you for the time as always everyone.","Robert Knight, Jr.","All right, Jason.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ravi Shanker","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. You had petroleum products as a positive and market for you. Can you just give us a little more detail on how you are looking at the Permian opportunity? How attractive that can potentially be and kind of what you will need to see some of the producers before you get more active there?","Elizabeth Whited","So the Permian is an interesting place right now. We are definitely starting to see some reduction even in crude output because of the lack of take away capacity. So that's maybe the first time we've seen that in 18 months or so.","And there is as you referenced an emergence opportunity to haul crude by rail out of there say over the next 18 months while the next pipelines get built.","Like I said we do think it's a short-term situation. So we will not invest to support that. But as we have capacity in our network we are working closely with the producers to see what we can bring to rail. And I do expect we'll we some results from that in the third and fourth quarter.","Ravi Shanker","Understood. And Lance, going back to the whole UNP versus CSX, if I may, I think there's tends to be a hyper focus on the OR as a stand-alone number without focusing on overall sustainable growth, and I think that you guys are growing volumes at a relatively decent pace compared to the whole railroad group.","So can you remind us on your philosophy on volume growth versus OR and kind of how you determine which one you go after at any point in time, particularly at this point in the cycle?","Lance Fritz","Sure, and you are exactly right, Ravi, we care about a number of measures to demonstrate whether or not we're running the business well over the long term. The highest order is generating growing operating income and growing cash from operations.","That's the source of being able to reward our shareholders, so that's what we focus on first and foremost and we actually had a pretty damn good first half in that context.","Now having said that, there's a couple of key measures that we care about. One is ROIC, and that is, are we efficiently using resources and being wise with investor capital? And the other is OR, and that is, are we efficiently dropping top line to the bottom line.","At this point, it's appropriate to focus on OR and say, we're disappointed with our ability to efficiently drop top line to the bottom line. That doesn't mean we can't do it. It means we didn't demonstrate doing that in the second quarter; we have all the confidence in the world that we're able to do that both over the long run and rectifying that here in the short term.","Then the last thing I would talk about, Ravi, is we run the business for all four stakeholders, right, in the very long run building long-term enterprise value, we have to generate returns for the shareholders, build their confidence. We have to generate excellent experience with our customers so that they want to keep doing business with us.","We have to help our employees feel fulfilled and connected to the work and our communities that we serve have to feel like we're a good partner, so that our social license to operate with them is healthy and strong. You hit it just right, Ravi. We think about all of that when we're running the business.","Ravi Shanker","Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions.","Justin Long","Thanks. And good morning. Just to start with a couple of modeling questions, I was wondering if you have a ballpark expectation on the level of share buybacks you're planning to complete in the second half of this year?","And then, on coal, I think I heard you mention a contract change. Any additional color you could provide on that and the impact?","Lance Fritz","Rob.","Robert Knight, Jr.","Justin, I would say that I don\u2019t any more to tell you on the share buyback. I mean at this point the ASR that we did. The rest of opportunities would be opportunistic in the marketplace.","And remember that we've set out a $20 billion buyback over the three year period or so but it's not going to be a straight line each quarter. So we'll be opportunistic.","Lance Fritz","And Beth?","Elizabeth Whited","So on the coal contract. We call that a couple of things. We have some retirements and we also have contract change. And those were about equivalent in size, in terms of millions of tons that we saw leaving us.","I don't think we're going to give you any specifics on that. But I guess that's all I've got to say about it.","Justin Long","Could you speak to what coal volumes would've looked like X both of those items that headwind from the retirement of the contract change?","Elizabeth Whited","I would call the combination of the two less than 10%.","Justin Long","Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, if you go back historically you've typically seen a sequential improvement in the OR during the third quarter. I think last year was on one of the rare exceptions.","I am not asking for specific guidance but just directionally is there anything that would prevent you from seeing normal seasonality and a sequential improvement in the OR in the third quarter?","Robert Knight, Jr.","Justin, I would say you're right. It's difficult to draw any conclusion from that. But having said that we are as we've talked this morning we are feeling good about the environment. We raised our volume guidance for the whole year.","You heard Beth talk about our confidence in terms of the market and what's happening in your pricing. And our focus on taking that inefficiency cost out aggressively. So without putting a guidance number for the third quarter OR we're going to aggressively do the best we can and we have to make progress immediately which we're focused on to improve the OR year-over-year.","Justin Long","Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate the time this morning.","Lance Fritz","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt Reustle with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.","Matt Reustle","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on higher fuel prices, I understand it's essentially EBIT neutral but it's been a pretty big drag on the OR year to date.","So is that something you could offset in the back half of the year and is there an inherent fuel price assumption in your forecast for the back half of the year?","Robert Knight, Jr.","Let me take that Matt. I think you probably know I mean we have some 60 different types of fuel recovery mechanisms surcharge mechanisms. So they're kind of all different.","But there's -- and there's generally speaking about a two month lag in terms of those catching up with the price of fuel. So in the long haul the fuel recovery mechanisms should neutralize over time.","Certainly in the second quarter from an EPS standpoint it was neutral. Rising fuel prices even if we're recovering 100% at a specific point in time can have an impact negatively on the OR just because of the math of it. So I mean that's how it works.","So we had to kind of leaves with that reality and our focus and we've done a good job over the years of minimizing the negative impact of rising fuel prices through these some 60 plus different fuel surcharge mechanisms.","Matt Reustle","Yes. I guess it has been a drag for the first half. I mean are you expecting that drag to continue into the second half? Because you mentioned it's just math but you're guiding to this improvement which seems like it's going to be fairly tough if you continue to see that weigh on margins on top of the ongoing network expenses that you have in the third quarter.","Robert Knight, Jr.","Well I would have to say I can't give you a number because it's contingent about what happens in the fuel prices.","Matt Reustle","Okay. Second question just on frac sand, you mentioned tougher comps coming into second half along with the impact of the local mines, in terms of those local mines have you seen any shifts in terms of the timing of those coming online and is a tight trucking market changing those dynamics at all?","Have you been having those conversations with customers where you expect to see a material impact in the back half of the year? Is that shifting out to 2019? Any color and that is helpful.","Elizabeth Whited","Yes. So we have -- they did come up more slowly than we expected and they were delayed. However they seem to be now kind of hitting their stride. And I think some of it is a combination of supply and some of it's the slow down in production that's happening because of the lack of take away capacity.","But June was the first month that we had this year where our frac sand into the Permian was lower than a year ago. And I would expect to see that continue as they gain more and more adoption, especially on the core smashes [ph], the local sand. So yes, it started to decline and it will continue.","On the positive side, we've been able to develop and have seen good growth in all of the other shale price. The Eagle Ford came on strong in the second quarter. We're seeing nice growth in the Oklahoma shale and then Colorado. So we will, of course, continue our business development efforts. But the Permian is in decline, I would say.","Matt Reustle","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee","Yes. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask Rob, just want the clarity first on the service related cost of $65 million. Is that cumulative or is that sort of second quarter it happens that really relative to the $40 million, you reported in the first quarter?","Robert Knight, Jr.","Yes, the $65 million of inefficiency cost in the second quarter was just the second quarter and that does compare to \u2013 I mean showed up differently. But it does compare to the $40 million inefficiency cost that we called out in the first quarter.","Lance Fritz","Yes, I think Chris when we talked about in the first quarter we said there was going to be a hangover effect even as we were anticipating improving service product in the network. And that's because we were putting those resources in through the first quarter. So there were more exiting the first quarter than entering the first quarter. So they just lingered longer than we anticipated.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. And when you think about -- in that context when you think about the tunnel, which I know Rob you said it was $6 million, but had a bigger halo effect than that. Does that sort of capture the entire increment if you think 1Q to 2Q or is it just sort of the timing of those assets?","Just wanted to get a sense we're actually seeing improvement there because it seems like maybe there's some incremental cost that weren\u2019t in the first quarter but...","Lance Fritz","Yes, Chris, the way to think about that is, so we were building in these incremental costs through bring the service product back up. We anticipated as a service product was coming back up, which it was in the first two months of the quarter that we would be actively then taking those incremental resources out.","The tunnel collapse forced us to keep them in. And basically keep them in longer in order to kind of maintain a service product because it was a pretty impactful location. Recall that in our network we've got big East West movements on the Sunset route in the Northern East West corridor. And then the other two big routes for us are Chicago down to Mexico in the I-5. And it's essentially shut down the I-5.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. That's helpful. And then just final a quick follow-up for Beth on the core price, not to belabor the point here but you had the ex coal in international and intermodal number accelerate from 1Q to 2Q. But coal stayed the same all in. When you think about coal and international intermodal is it getting more negative or is it getting worse I should say from 1Q to 2Q or is there some other dynamic that impact that number?","Elizabeth Whited","I think you're making a safe assumption.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes on line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your questions.","Walter Spracklin","Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. I do want to come back to the pricing, but I don't want to exclude coal and international intermodal instead ask a more general question based on investor feedback I'm getting and that is rather than you give us guidance on price make the comment that I'm hearing that your ability to drive price because of the inclusion of international intermodal and coal combined with the competitive environment with BN might suggest that you can never achieve core pricing above and beyond or even half of what other railroads can achieve.","If that's a statement correct me -- can you indicate where it might be wrong in terms of that emerging view in your pricing?","Lance Fritz","Yes. We need to correct that assumption or statement which is we can never achieve pricing the same as any other competitive railroad. Our dynamic and pricing is just that it's dynamic right? So the competitive forces change. They change over time. Sometimes they change quickly.","Right now we love the environment that we're pricing into when it comes to truck competitive product. And there are some other markets that we're pricing into that are facing different pricing competitive dynamics.","Those aren't set in stone. It's not like that's a law of nature. Those will and do shift. And I anticipate we're going to continue to price appropriately for the value that we represent and generating a really attractive return. ","Walter Spracklin","So is it just the basics of a cycle we're in where mix is not going your way but it is going the way of the others that are getting the 4% to 5% pricing? It's just a bad timing. Is that what you're saying? ","Lance Fritz","What I'm saying is exactly what I just said which is we price for the value. We're pricing for an attractive return. We're pricing in a competitive dynamic. And those move a lot and it's generally a good market to be pricing in right now.","The other thing I would say is -- remember exactly how we talked about price. We talked about yield and absolute yield dollars over total book of business. It's a nice conservative consistent way for us to measure ourselves in terms of yield that we're achieving and we're pretty optimistic as we look into the second quarter. ","Walter Spracklin","Okay. And then moving again back to the question on operating ratio. If I could reframe the question and simply ask, if you could maybe in broad categories why are you not at a better operating ratio today?","If you were to look at the others and say why is Union Pacific not with the others in terms of operating ratio today? What would you point to as the main reasons? ","Lance Fritz","So I'll start by saying we are actually better than the others although the CSX just produced a very good second quarter. So I'm not sure I want to go backwards to join the rest of the pack.","But having said that, there are some very specific cost elements that are in the way right now that we are actively getting out of the way. And I'll let Cameron speak to those and what we're doing about it. ","Cameron Scott","As velocity comes back to our network one particular area is the size of our locomotive fleet. And that has a positive impact in three different areas. Material to keep that fleet up and running, employee cost involved in working on those locomotives and then fuel usage as well to move the tonnage that we have on our network. So velocity returns would be very aggressive in rightsizing that fleet. ","Walter Spracklin","And correcting for those will give you a better generation toward a sub 60 and I know you saw the 55 OR target there. What gives us comfort that the 55 is achievable within a reasonable investment horizon?","Cameron Scott","Yes. So the $65 million that we called out is kind of excess recovery cost in the network this quarter. That's entirely over time and kind of inefficient use of crews, incremental cost of maintaining locomotives as Cameron just outlined, a sea rate that's both impacted by all the locomotive fleet as well as inefficient use for those locomotives.","And then a handful of other Nits N Nats and which is mostly kind of like car hire for excess inventory. All of that is addressable. And when we remove that we have a much more attractive second quarter and not only that but that doesn't count the productivity initiatives that that's retarding from accelerating even further. So we're very confident in the 60 by 2020.","Walter Spracklin","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ben Hartford","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Rob, could you clarify what you expect the tax rate to be in the back half of the year?","Robert Knight, Jr.","Yes. For the full year, we're projecting its going to end up being around somewhere 24-ish. So I think it's reasonable to assume it's going to be around that 24 in the back half.","Ben Hartford","Okay. And in terms of just staying on the point about intermodal, what are -- could you size up UMAX and the MP fleet as it stands today? What are the expectations for that finishing this year and perhaps 2019? If we can have any sort of direction on that front.","Elizabeth Whited","Are you asking about the number of containers that we have?","Ben Hartford","Yes.","Elizabeth Whited","Boy, that's a stumper. I think it's around 40000 each, but I will confirm that back from Mike and make sure that we give the exact number. But it's something like that.","Ben Hartford","That's a present number?","Elizabeth Whited","That's a present number. We have some small additions we're making this year. But nothing that really moved the needle.","Ben Hartford","Okay. And that would be for both of those fleets?","Elizabeth Whited","They are roughly to same size.","Ben Hartford","Right. And then in terms of just small additions in both fleets in the back half of the year?","Elizabeth Whited","Small additions only in the EMP fleet.","Ben Hartford","The EMP. And any thoughts about '19 as we look and obviously rising truck load rates generally presume service improvements and an eye toward domestic intermodal being used in 2019? Any thought as it relates to capacity needs in '19 and potential additions to either those fleets?","Elizabeth Whited","We are currently looking at what we think we might need in 2019. We have some attractive business development opportunities as you suggest. But we haven't quite zeroed in on a number yet. And we do have some fallout as well. So we'll be looking to acquire containers. I don't think we know how many yet.","Ben Hartford","Okay. Is it possible that if you had positive let's say mid single digit type growth in domestic intermodal in 2019, are there enough opportunities to improve service and velocity such that net adds could possibly be flat in 2019 to both of those fleets?","Elizabeth Whited","We\u2019re just really still in that evaluation process. I'm not sure what to tell you about that at this point. I think we'll get clearer as we get towards the end of the year.","Ben Hartford","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thanks very much and good morning. I wanted to get you to comment on this year's peak season in a couple of respects. Firstly, one of the things that we're hearing anecdotally is that the peak season may have arrived early and potentially as early as June as BCO is try to get ahead of tariff. So just wondering if that's a dynamic you've been observing in your business.","Elizabeth Whited","I would not say that we think the peak is arriving early so much as I would say there's a strong demand because of tighter truck capacity. It still feels like there will be a peak that's kind of normal time period.","Lance Fritz","That's really encouraging Cherilyn right? From the standpoint of -- it's not like peak is happening now and then it's going to die off during normal peak. It feels like we've got strong volume entering what feels like it's going to be a normal peak which is really attractive.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Okay. And in terms of just your readiness operationally it sounds like you're feeling good. The only thing I wanted to ask about was it does sound like it could be a robust peak. Is there any reason to be concerned about the readiness of the Chicago Gateway in that context?","Lance Fritz","I don\u2019t think so absent let's say product design changes that potentially goofed up the network. So if the network stays as designed right now amongst all the participants that interchange in Chicago Chicago's operating pretty well.","Absent every once in a while there's a hiccup here or there. But I think in its current format with the benefits of the 12 years of create that have been invested Chicago should be okay. The one thing that keep your eye on is if anybody starts altering their plans around interchange for intermodal that could have an impact.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Great. That\u2019s all from me. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions.","Bascome Majors","Yes. Thanks for taking my question here. In response to Allison\u2019s question earlier you gave some anecdotal examples about share gain from truck into the merchandise business at kind of a micro level.","I'm just curious do you guys track the opportunity and conversion impact at a macro level? Is this something that you think over the next year to really kind of adds points to either overall growth and merchandise growth in aggregate?","Lance Fritz","Beth?","Elizabeth Whited","We're certainly always watching what is moving out there in the transportation world and what we think is convertible to rail either from truck or barge or some other mode of transportation.","So clearly we're using that as a business development tool all the time. What I would say is I think that those tend to be basis of some sort. They don't tend to be home runs those conversions. So we have to pile up a bunch of them to move the needle. But that's what we're here to do and the team's actively looking on that over time.","Bascome Majors","Okay. Well I appreciate that. And you also made some comments about feeling pretty good about the supply, demand balance and your pricing power in the domestic intermodal market looking out beyond this year.","Do you think your pricing in the domestic business can be better this year than this year at this point just given how the market's progressing and we were able to price this year's numbers?","Elizabeth Whited","Well, I'm not sure how to answer that. I think if you keep having tight supply obviously that's going to allow everybody to be in an environment where you can achieve hopefully two things: volume growth and pricing growth.","The way we calculate our numbers as people have told you is somewhat backward looking. So some of the impacts from the ability to get pricing that we're doing right now you're going to continue to see as you go out over the next several quarters.","Bascome Majors","Thank you for the time.","Lance Fritz","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question and answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments.","Lance Fritz","Thank you, Rob. And thank you all for joining us this morning and for your questions. We look forward to talking with you again after the end of the third quarter in October.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."],"21284":["Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) Q4 2011 Earnings Call January 19, 2012  8:45 AM ET","Executives","Robert M.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jim Young, Chairman and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Young, you may begin.","James R. Young","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Union Pacific's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me in Omaha today are Rob Knight, our CFO; Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales; and Lance Fritz, our Executive Vice President of Operations.","As you can see, we finished 2011 with an all-time record quarter, achieving a quarterly earnings milestone of $1.99 per share, that's a 28% increase compared to 2010. Our outstanding fourth quarter results demonstrate the capabilities of this diverse franchise and contributed to the most profitable year in Union Pacific's 150-year history. ","Record top and bottom line results achieved historic marks and generated record financial returns and investments. Rob will provide the details here in the financials in a minute. We remain focused on delivering safe, efficient, high-quality service that generates value for our customers and translates into record financial returns for our shareholders. These efforts were recognized with best ever 2011 marks in customer satisfaction and employee safety. ","So with that, we'll turn it over to Jack to cover the marketing details.","John J. Koraleski","Thanks, Jim, and good morning. We will start this morning with a recap of our record-setting customer satisfaction scores. ","For the quarter, customer satisfaction came in at 92. That equals our best ever mark set in the second quarter. And along the way, October tied our best month at 93. So in terms of how our customers view the value proposition that Union Pacific brought to them in 2011, we closed the year with a record-setting score of 92, 3 full points better than the previous record set last year at 89. ","And while we still have plenty of room for improvement, faced with growing volumes, the Union Pacific team delivered even while our operating team was out there battling blizzards, flooding and droughts. ","The advantage of a diverse franchise was again, evident in the fourth quarter as volumes grew 3% despite our declines in Ag products and Intermodal. Core pricing improved 5% with gains in all 6 of our businesses. Those price gains, higher fuel surcharge revenue, and some positive mix as our carload business grew while Intermodal is a little soft, drove average revenue per car up 13%. The growth in volume and improved revenue per car produced a 16% increase in freight revenue to $4.8 billion.","So let me take you through each of our 6 groups in a little more detail. On Slide 4, you can see -- well, Slide 6. Slide 6, you can see Ag products revenue grew 2% as a 7% improvement in average revenue per car more than offset a 5% decline in carloadings. Softer volume wasn't unexpected as increased world crop production, high U.S. corn prices and plentiful crop storage reduced U.S. grain exports. ","Against 2010's record levels, our export grain shipments actually declined 43%. That decline was partially offset by a 22% growth in domestic grain, boosted by drought damage to crops in West Texas and forward ethanol plants that reopened earlier in the year. ","Our biofuels volume grew 18% in the fourth quarter. We saw a record number of ethanol unit train shipped in December, and biodiesel shipments surged as customers ramped up production to take advantage of the tax credits that expired at the end of the year.","With pent-up demand, improving inventory levels, aging vehicles across the country and improving credit terms, the automotive industry continued to gain momentum, pushing U.S. vehicle sales to their highest level since the second quarter of 2008. That strengthening was reflected in a 10% increase in our automotive volume, which combined with a 13% improvement in average revenue per car, to produce a 26% increase in revenue. Our finished vehicle carloadings grew 14%, and our part shipments were up about 7%.","Our Chemical business continued the strength we saw throughout the year with volume up 10%, which along with a 7% improvement in average revenue per car, produced an 18% increase in revenue. Petroleum volume increased 46%, driven primarily by increased crude oil shipments from the Bakken and Eagle Ford Shale regions. Supporting that growth was our strong delivery network that combines geographic reach with flexible service options. ","Increased shipments of polypropylene and polyethylene produced a 7% growth in plastics, and all other segments of our Chemical business also saw volume increases, including a near doubling of phos rock shipments as favorable weather and strong demand extended the shipping season.","Energy volume was up 8%, which combined with a 12% improvement in average revenue per car to drive revenue up 21%. The volume gains included some small makeup of missed loads from the second quarter of flooding, and that pretty much completes the recovery of that business.","Tonnage from the Southern Powder River Basin increased 7% with the new business to the Wisconsin utilities, again being the primary driver. With few production issues and strong growth in international shipments, Colorado, Utah tonnage posted its second consecutive growth quarter, up 10%. That capped solid improvement in the export coal market in 2011. Our export tons totaled 5.2 million for the year, which was up from 1.4 million tons in 2010. ","Industrial Products volume was up 7%, combined with a 16% improvement in average revenue per car and drove a 24% revenue increase. Just as our Chemicals business benefits from growth in the shale plays by offering outbound transportation solutions for crude oil, our Industrial Products group is well positioned to provide reliable transportation for inbound materials used in drilling like frac sand and steel pipe. ","In the fourth quarter, that was reflected in 40% growth in nonmetallic mineral shipments, which is primarily frac sand and a 9% increase in our steel volume with growth in pipe and steel coils. Steel also got a boost from continued strengthening of the auto industry.","Metallic mineral shipments increased 73%, driven by growth in our iron ore unit train business from Utah to California forts for export to China. Offsetting some of the strength was a 36 -- 38% decline in hazardous waste volume, driven by a reduction in our short haul uranium tailings move for the Department of Energy as government funding was reduced after the stimulus money ran out.","On Slide 11, our Intermodal volume grew 13%, as the 16% improvement in average revenue per unit more than offset a 3% decline in volume. The lower volume was driven by the international segment, where soft import levels produced a 7% decline. Also contributing was the continued impact of the contract loss that we won't wrap until May 1. While the weak international peak season was disappointing, the news was better in the domestic segment where highway conversions drove 3% growth. That topped the previous quarterly volume record that we set at the end of last year. ","Last, but not least, we closed the year with strong performance in our Mutual Commitment Program. As we discussed last quarter, we were able to provide customers participating in the program with all their needed box capacity throughout the domestic peak.","So that pretty much wraps up 2011. I'm going to turn focus here now to 2012 starting with Global Insight's most recent economic projections, which reflect the continuation of a relatively slow growing economy. GDP is expected to be a little stronger in 2011, but industrial production growth will be a little slower. Vehicle sales are pegged at $13.5 million, which is about where they came in, in the fourth quarter, so that seems pretty reasonable to us. We entered 2012, once again, looking for some signs of recovery in the housing industry. And time will tell whether this is the year where we finally start to see some signs of life there. ","Imports and exports are expected to grow more slowly this year. And even with some projected improvement, continued high unemployment adds uncertainty to the economic outlook.","So with that as a starting point, here's how we see 2012 volume growth shaping up in our major markets on Slide 13. Our diverse franchise gives us a number of markets where we're expecting solid growth. The top of the list are minerals and petroleum, which should continue to outpace the economy, driven by the opportunity in shale energy to move both inbound materials and outbound products. ","We continue to see Intermodal as a long-term growth driver, and in 2012, great service should bring new highway conversions in the domestic segment. Automotive volume should continue to grow as the industry's recovery continues. Prospects for growth in non-Powder River Basin coal look good, with improved production in international demand boosting the Colorado, Utah segment. ","Metals opportunities also look good in 2012. While the expected increase in housing starts, small though it is, should also give a boost to our lumber business. We also think that fertilizer and LPG should see solid growth. You can also see the markets where we expect more moderate growth, and those where we actually expect slow growth at best, with the latter top by the Southern Powder River Basin coal and International Intermodal. ","The SPRB outlook is dampened by a couple of contract losses in 2011, including one small legacy deal that went to the competition. We'll lap the startup of the Wisconsin utility that fueled this year's growth, and we have a few utilities that are telling us they're going to have somewhat softer demand this year. ","Of course, with our Energy business, a lot really depends on the summer burn. So we could have some upside if the summer really heats up. For International Intermodal, with an uncertain economy, we're actually taken pretty conservative approach to the volume prospects in 2012. ","So as we look out over the coming year, our strong value proposition's going to, again, support our business development and underpin our growth. I mentioned the one legacy energy contract loss in 2011, but we successfully repriced over 90% of the $1 billion of legacy business we competed for. So that provides a solid foundation for our 2012 pricing plan. As a result, we expect increases in volume will combine with pricing gains to drive profitable revenue growth. ","So with that, I'll turn it over to Lance.","Lance M. Fritz","Thank you, Jack. I'll start with safety. Our reportable personal injury rate was a record low in 2011. Training, process improvements and capital investments combined to reduce our environmental and behavioral risks. I'm particularly encouraged by a steep reduction in severe injuries that have the greatest human and financial impact. ","Regarding rail equipment incidents or derailments, our full year reportable rate increased 10%. Increases in mainline track incidents, which were driven by weather and human factor derailments, were partly offset by a decrease in yard and industry-lead derailments. ","In public safety, the grade crossing accident rate improved 9% versus 2010, and tied 2009's best ever performance. We closed 269 at-grade crossings on the UP system during the year, and our community and driver-focused approach to grade crossing safety continued to generate long-term improvement.","While I am very pleased to report 2 of 3 safety measures at all-time record lows, our ultimate goal is to eliminate all safety incidents. ","Moving onto UP's network performance. Last quarter, I noted the negative impact that Midwest flooding and the Texas drought had on our operation. We forecasted a return to normal by the end of the year, which is exactly what happened. We fully recovered our service capability by using a mix of surge resources, alternative routes and aggressive maintenance work. As a result, velocity climbed to average 25.6 miles per hour in the fourth quarter, 25.9 miles per hour in December, and is well over 26.5 miles an hour so far in January. ","We're well positioned for growth with about 1,000 employees furloughed and around 600 locomotives in long-term storage, which includes about 250 units ready for surge utilization. The value of surge resources was demonstrated yet again in 2011, helping us maintain fluidity and service in the face of major network disruptions.","Slide 17 illustrates our fourth quarter service and efficiency performance. Starting at the upper left. The condition of our network has literally never been better. In 3 years, we've reduced slow order miles by over 60%, enhancing customer service and generating capacity to support volume growth. Gross ton-miles per employee accelerated from the first 3 quarters to finish 2% better than 2010, despite the impact of more than 700 additional employees working on capital projects or positive train control. ","Moving to the lower left, train size improved in the fourth quarter with record fourth quarter manifest and Intermodal train lengths. Intermodal train size grew despite a decrease in the fourth quarter intermodal volumes compared to 2010. ","In the lower right, our service scorecard illustrates UP's customer value proposition. We absorbed the 3% carload increase, and weather disruptions, while maintaining a solid Service Delivery Index. The local operating teams continue to build the fundamental elements of great service, as reflected by industry spot and pull, which tied for an all-time best fourth quarter at 94%.","As Jack discussed, manifest traffic grew dramatically in 2011, driven by increased industrial products and chemical shipments. While all regions experienced an increase in manifest volume, the southern region absorbed about half the growth. The Union Pacific franchise is well suited for this business with excellent route density and terminal infrastructure. We've leveraged our terminal assets while absorbing the new volume, which is reflected here as an increase in the number of cars switched per man day. The ability to handle the current shift in traffic emphasizes our network strength. It's a shared resource, it's well positioned to support each of the 6 business groups. Capital investment keeps the network strong and adds new capacity where we can generate attractive returns on the new volume.","For 2012, our capital plan totals around $3.6 billion. More than half of that is replacement spending to harden the infrastructure, making the network safe and resilient. Spending for service, growth and productivity will total over $1.3 billion. Capacity, commercial facilities and equipment are the primary drivers. Major projects include additional double track on the Sunset Corridor as well as the Blair project, work on the Santa Teresa, New Mexico facility and various projects in the south to support our diverse book of business, including the growth in energy exploration and production that Jack mentioned. ","We're acquiring 200 new road locomotives and close to 1,800 freight cars, which includes covered hoppers, gondolas and new AutoFlex auto racks, which were designed and are being built by a UP car shop. These equipment acquisitions not only serve as replacements for older assets, but also to meet expected business growth. ","In addition to our investments for growth and efficiency, we plan to spend about $335 million on positive train control this year. We originally estimated a capital spend of $1.4 billion through 2015 when PTC was first mandated. After 3 years into the project and with significant software, hardware and systems development remaining, we now think the price tag for Union Pacific could be in the $2 billion range. Through 2011, we've invested nearly $400 million of the $2 billion projected spend. The 2015 implementation date poses some pretty big challenges for us and the industry. That being said, we are making a good faith effort to meet the 2015 deadline, while pacing capital based on proven technology.","In summary, I feel very good about the outlook for 2012. We are well positioned for another record safety year as we continue to mature our total safety culture, strengthen our relationships with local communities and harden the infrastructure. The network is ready to provide excellent service as volumes grow, and we should leverage that growth to the bottom line through increased utilization of existing assets. And we are going to invest a record amount of capital to support the new volume and to alleviate network constraints across the system. ","In summary, we'll use the 6 critical operating initiatives, including the UP way, to drive our business up into the right, growth with service excellence. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert M. Knight","Thanks, Lance, and good morning. We'll start by summarizing our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue grew 16% to an all-time quarterly record of $5.1 billion, driven by fuel surcharge recoveries, core pricing gains and volume growth. ","Operating expense totaled $3.5 billion, increasing 13% compared to 2010. Higher fuel prices drove over half of the expense increase. Operating income totaled $1.6 billion, a 23% increase and a best-ever quarterly record. Other income totaled $54 million in the quarter, up $45 million compared to 2010. Higher income from real estate sales and increased cost in 2010 due to a settlement on an environmental site, drove the year-over-year increase. ","Interest expense of $141 million was essentially flat versus the previous year. Income tax expense increased $566 million. Higher pretax earnings, and an unusually low income tax rate in 2010, drove the increase.","Net income totaled $964 million, a quarterly best, up 24% versus 2010. Earnings per share grew 28% to an all-time record of $1.99 per share. The outstanding share balance declined 2%, reflecting our share repurchase activity.","Turning to our top line. Freight revenue grew 16% to a fourth quarter record of $4.8 billion. Carloadings were up 3%. We also saw a positive mix impact driven by strong growth in higher average revenue per car moves. We achieved core pricing gains of 5%, which includes RCAF fuel escalators. ","And as Jack just mentioned, we've been successful with the legacy renewals, which drove a small uptick in our pricing numbers in the fourth quarter. Fuel surcharge revenue added 6% to the top line, driven by higher fuel prices in the quarter versus 2010. ","Slide 24 illustrates our solid pricing and productivity gains in 2011. We closed out the year on a high note, with an incremental margin of 59%, after adjusting for higher fuel prices. Our reported number of 44% also topped previous quarters in 2011, generated by strong core business operation. ","As Slide 25 shows, our compensation and benefits expense was up 4% compared to 2010, another good news story for us. Inflationary pressures, that we previously discussed, drove a 4.5% increase in cost. Volume-related expenses were offset with solid productivity gains. And as Lance mentioned, we leveraged the volume growth very efficiently in the quarter. Other factors also worked in our favor, including a very mild weather condition. And as expected, the number of new hires in the training pipeline was flat compared to 2010, thus not a driver of our year-over-year expense increase in the quarter.","Consistent with our previous guidance, workforce levels increased 3% in the quarter compared to 2010. Base business activity contributed to about half of the growth, while increased capital work, including positive train control, drove the remaining increase.","In 2012, we expect another year of attrition in the 8% to 10% range. We'll continue to hire new employees to backfill for attrition and to support volume growth. And as volumes grow, we expect our overall workforce levels to increase, but not at a one-for-one rate. Compensation and benefits expense will also increase in 2012, but will depend upon volume growth. ","On the positive side, labor inflation should moderate from the 4% to 5% range that we saw last year, and training costs should not be a year-over-year driver as it was in 2011.","Slide 26 shows fuel expense, which totaled $935 million, increasing $248 million versus 2010. The average diesel fuel price was $3.16 per gallon, which increased 28% year-over-year. Drivers included an average barrel price of $94, which increased 10%, and a $17 per barrel increase in the conversion spread. A 5% increase in gross ton-miles and a 1% increase in our fuel consumption rate also drove higher fuel expense.","Purchased Services & Materials expense increased 9% or $41 million to $508 million. Higher cost for contract services and equipment maintenance were the primary drivers. Also, crew lodging and transportation costs increased with the growth in volume. Other expense came in at $191 million, which was better than our previous guidance. We, again, saw lower-than-expected personal injury expense, reflecting positive experience from our continued safety gain. Versus 2010, other expenses were up $18 million, resulting from higher property taxes and lease buyout expenses.","In 2012, the other expense line will continue to be challenged with higher property taxes and volume-related expenses. We're also facing tough year-over-year comps in our personal injury expense.","Slide 28 summarizes fourth quarter expenses for the remaining 2 categories. Depreciation expense increased 9% to $413 million, in line with our guidance. Increased capital spending and volume growth drove the increase. ","Looking at 2012, we expect depreciation expense to grow at a rate similar to the 2011 levels. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $289 million, up from 2010 due to increased short-term freight car rental expense and higher contract lease costs. Lower locomotive lease expense partially offset this increase. ","Union Pacific's operating ratio on Slide 29 reflects the substantial improvements in profitability that we've achieved over the last several years. On a reported basis, our operating ratio was a fourth quarter record of 68.3%. Ongoing productivity efforts, core pricing gains and volume growth all contributed to this mark, more than offsetting the negative fuel price impact of nearly 1 point versus 2010. ","On a full year basis, our operating ratio was 70.7%, only slightly behind our all-time 2010 record of 70.6%. We achieved real improvement this year, nearly offsetting the negative year-over-year fuel price impact of about 1.7 point.","Looking forward, we remain committed to achieving our operating ratio target of 65% to 67% by 2015. Slide 30 provides a summary of our 2011 earnings and a full year income statement. I'll walk through a few of the highlights from our record setting year. ","Operating revenue achieved an all-time record of $19.6 billion. Operating income also set a new best-ever mark of over $5.7 billion, topping 2010's record by 15%. And net income of $3.3 billion and earnings of $6.72 per share also set new historic annual record. Union Pacific's profitability in 2011 also drove record free cash flow after dividends. Increased cash from operations more than offset the higher capital spending of nearly $700 million, and increased cash dividends of $235 million. ","We continue to see the benefits of bonus depreciation, which created a $450 million tailwind in 2011 versus 2010. This year, that benefit will be significantly lower due to the catch-up of prior year's program and a reduced rate of 50% bonus depreciation in 2012 from the 100% mark in 2011.","Our balance sheet remains strong supporting our investment grade credit rating. At year end 2011, the adjusted debt-to-cap ratio was 40.7%. There's some timing in this number since we accelerated around $475 million of debt maturities from the first part of 2012 into 2011, which we will likely refinance sometime this year.","Slide 32 shows our full year 2011 capital investment of $3.2 billion, slightly below our targeted investment of $3.3 billion. And as Lance discussed, our preliminary capital plan for 2012 is around $3.6 billion, up from 2011, but consistent with our guidance of 17% to 18% of revenue over the next several years. Increased spending on locomotives and positive train control are the major drivers. We'll also be spending more on capacity projects, but less on equipment purchases, given that we're not planning on buying any containers this year.","Slide 32 also reflects our achievements in generating returns on these investments. Return on invested capital was a record 12.4% in 2011, up 1.6 points versus 2010. Returns must continue to improve to support the significantly higher asset replacement costs and investments required to achieve our safety, service and growth initiatives. ","Our performance in 2011 generated record cash, and we're returning that to our shareholders. For 2011, dividends per share increased a total of 58%, a significant step toward achieving our target declared payout ratio of 30%.","In the fourth quarter, we bought back close to 3.9 million shares, totaling $381 million. For 2011, our share repurchases totaled $1.4 billion. Looking forward, we have nearly 28 million shares remaining under our current authorization. ","So with that, we've wrapped up a record-breaking year in 2011. But now, we're focused on 2012 and the tremendous opportunities that we see before us. For 2012, we're targeting record full year operating ratio performance. We believe there are continued opportunities for volume growth and pricing gains, as Jack highlighted earlier. Of course, the economy will play a determining role. And we remain focused on continued productivity gains, which will provide additional leverage capabilities and further drive operating efficiencies. Our prospects for 2012, supported by Union Pacific's strong value proposition, position us to take advantage of the unique opportunities offered by our diverse franchise. 2012 should also be another record year for earnings, allowing us to reward our shareholders with even greater returns. ","With that, I'll turn it back to Jim.","James R. Young","Thanks, Rob. And before I wrap up, I want to provide a quick update on National Labor negotiations. As many of you know, 10 of the 13 unions have ratified agreements, and 2 of the 3 remaining unions have tentative agreements out to their members for vote. The Brotherhood of Maintenance Way Employees is the only union without an agreement. The industry is making every effort to reach an agreement before the cooling-off period ends in February 8. We're making progress and are committed to getting a deal done. ","Now, when you think about our financial outlook for this year, our outstanding 2011 performance clearly sets the stage. The bar has been raised in terms of future expectations, and I believe our prospects have never looked better. Economic indicators generally point to slow continued growth in 2012. ","Excellent service though is the key to our future success, supporting our customer value proposition and helping us drive increased productivity. Our capital investment strategy will be another key part of UP's success, making investments today, building capacity for tomorrow. We believe very strongly in the opportunities to grow our financial returns in the future. ","So with that, let's open it up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jason Seidl, Dahlman Rose.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of quick questions. When you break down your volume growth potential, you have solid, moderate and slow to negative, can you give us sort of a range, what you consider a moderate growth is at sort of the 2% to 3%, and solids, 3% or above?","James R. Young","Yes, Jason. We've -- we're obviously not giving specific numbers on those. And -- I mean if you look back in time, you can kind of get some feel for the way some of these commodities grow. And we'll -- I think you're going to continue to see in growth, kind of what we've seen this year, good, consistent growth, but on a slow basis.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And when I look at your 5% growth on the core pricing, obviously. There is some of that RCAF in there. Could you talk what it would look like x RCAF, and what was the timing like in terms of the renewals on your legacy business? Did they happen earlier in the quarter or later in the quarter or they're evenly spread out?","James R. Young","Jack, do you want to take that or Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Let me start with the, maybe the first part of that question, Jason, in terms of the RCAF impact. It's about 0.5 point on our pricing, and that's been fairly consistent throughout 2011.","John J. Koraleski","I would also say, Jason, as we go through the process of continuing to renegotiate and renew and compete for these legacy deals, that RCAF component becomes a lesser piece of the pie for us in terms of how it influences our escalations.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And the timing of the legacy?","John J. Koraleski","Go ahead again, Jason. What was your question?","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","No, I'm saying that the timing of the legacy for the quarter, was it evenly spread out as you renegotiate the legacy deals in 4Q? Or was it sort of more in the beginning of the quarter?","John J. Koraleski","We have some of the $1 billion from last year, included some for this year. So we've got that completed, and it's behind us. The remainder of our legacy deals for 2013 are going to be at the end of this year.","Robert M. Knight","Jason, this is Rob, again. In the fourth quarter, most of what you saw on the renewals were back-end loaded in the quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan Chase.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On the pricing, as a point of a lot of interest in 2012. I guess I look at -- and I think simple logic could be core price that you had in first 3 quarters of this year without much legacy with 4.5%. I think that you've commented in the past that kind of strong legacy pricing, maybe you can get 2 points a year in a relatively good year. So if I look at 2012, I think you fairly easily get to 6.5 as kind of a low end. And maybe above that in terms of the core price, I'm sure you don't want to be specific, but is that appropriate logic or am I missing something in terms of thinking about core price in 2012?","James R. Young","Well, Tom, we're not going to confirm your numbers. I would be a little bit careful on how high you move it up here. Remember, some of these agreements have pricing phased in over time. You get some mix effect in here, but it will be a good year for us. I mean we said we were legacy light in 2011. We have been successful, as Jack said, renegotiating about 90% of the legacy deals. So it should be a pretty good year for us this year.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the follow-up. Rob, if I recall, on your fourth quarter 2010 conference call, you had -- I think it was probably 5 or 6 discrete items, training costs, state taxes, depreciation, accrue -- casualty accrual, a bunch of different things that were cost headwinds in 2011. It sounds like maybe depreciation's still at a -- growing at a fairly strong rate. But is it fair to think that your inflation is at a pretty -- a lot lower rate in your cost side in 2012? And I guess other than depreciation, are there other things to be aware of?","Robert M. Knight","Yes, a couple of points I would make, Tom. Recall that labor inflation coming into the year, we said for 2011 would be -- and it was in that 4% to 5% range. We think the labor inflation will moderate below that, as I said earlier. You're right, depreciation is a bit of a headwind, as you point out. The other item I would call to your attention is other expense. And as you know, there's a lot of items in there. But one cost pressure we know we're going to face in 2012 in the other line is going to be our property taxes, which again are driven by higher earnings and volume-related costs, or some volume-related cost are in that category as well. Plus, we do face some fairly challenging comps year-over-year in our personal injury expense line. So those will be the challenges that I would point out at this point.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But it -- but you think it's fair to say cost inflation overall is less of an issue than 2011?","Robert M. Knight","Yes, that's a fair statement.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just curious on the legacy repricing in terms of retention. Obviously, some of this was as competitive business. Can you give us a sense of how much of that legacy that you did in November, December was successfully retained by you guys?","James R. Young","Jack?","John J. Koraleski","Well, what we said was over 90% has been repriced, and I don't think we're going to get into very specific deals, but I think that's a fairly good number for you.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, now that's great. Just looking at your capital structure. I think you've been trending down to about a 40% adjusted debt-to-total cap. And just curious, I know you're going to refi a little bit this year. How are you looking at that? I mean, can give us a sense of what your target level is? And presumably, you'll use your share buyback for any excess cash that you're generating now. You're getting really north of 12% on your ROIC? Any extra cash that you're generating, assuming outside of the dividends, would be going into that share buyback. Is that a fair statement?","James R. Young","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Yes, Walter, a couple of things. One, as we've said before and as you point out, there was some timing in our -- because we're full ahead on the financing item. But we are comfortable being in that low 40s debt-to-cap ratio. So we don't have a specific set number target that I would share with you other than to say we are comfortable in that range. In terms of what we're going to do with cash, I think it's similar to what you saw us do this year. As you heard Lance talk, number one, we're increasing our capital spend, and we've increased our dividend. We want to continue to stay in that 30% payout ratio, and continue to be opportunistic with share repurchases going forward. And that's how we're approaching it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to dig in a little bit. I know that petroleum was one of the high-growth areas. Could you talk a little bit about the experiences that you're seeing in these shale projects right now? How much of it is being served by unit trains? And besides Eagle Ford and Bakken, are there others behind that, that are starting to be developed, that we should be aware of?","James R. Young","Jack?","John J. Koraleski","Yes, Justin, when you look at it, only about, I would say 25% to 30% of our business is moving in unit trains today, but we're still actually in that start-up mode. So moving a lot in manifest, and we're shifting more towards unit trains, and you'll see that trend continue as we work our way here through 2012. Clearly, the Bakken was the largest proportion of our business this year in terms of the crude oil. Eagle Ford started up, which was nice for us. We'll also, this year, be moving Permian Basin, and hopefully, out of the Niobrara as kind of the big ones.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. It seems like it's a nice piece of growth business for you guys. I wanted to dig in a little bit on the Powder River Basin and International Intermodal. Calling those out as areas of softness, is it just the legacy contract in Southern Powder River Basin that gives you any kind of concern in terms of your growth rates this year, or are there other environmental issues that you're worried about? We had a stay with Casper, but we'll find out more, I guess, later this year. And then, on the international side, you called out being a little cautious on the weak or the uncertain economy. As we look out at that, you lapped the customer loss, as you said in May, is there a reason to believe that the back half could be better there than the first half?","James R. Young","Yes. In terms of coal, Powder River Basin, in particular, kind of the way I think about it that might be helpful for you, Justin, is I take what I -- with the contracts that I lost, and I lay that against the contracts that I've gained, the new business and also some incremental international business, that's about a wash. That's about a breakeven for me. So when I look at coal business going forward, I'm looking right now at a very, very mild winter. I'm looking at stockpiles that are growing in November. The Powder River Basin stockpiles matched where they should be for normal. And since then, the winter weather has been relatively mild. So there's not much burn going on. So I see a stockpile issue burning or building for us that we need to work our way through. And then, we have a couple of customers that have told us to expect somewhat lower demand, and that was tied to some of the environmental regulations. Although now with staying of Casper, I think the jury is out as to just how much that will play. I think the bigger factor for us, hands down, is how hot is it going be this summer. So if the mild winter translates into a very, very hot summer, we should be okay. The other one is the low natural gas prices that are out there. That's not a real big impact for us right at the moment. But of course, you could always watch that and just see -- I mean if you saw -- I suppose if you saw natural gas prices go down to $2 and actually stay there, we could see some of the merchant plants lose some business to the grid. But typically, gas is not a big negative factor for us in our served territory.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And on the International Intermodal?","James R. Young","On the International Intermodal, we had no peak season to speak of this year. And we've watched inventory ratios, the inventory-to-sales ratios, we kept expecting them to see some build, it never happened. There's the potential there, but there's also some questions as to just how aggressive will the retail sales be and how does that all play itself out. So we're just looking at it and saying, we're going to plan for something that's kind of a repeat of what we saw last year. Yes, it could be a little stronger for us in the second half. We will wrap that contract loss on May 1. So we'll see kind of a stronger second half, but we're not just seeing a lot of enthusiasm for a real, real strong international peak season again next year. So that's kind of how we forecasted it.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And there's nothing related to the APL contract, or is there?","James R. Young","Not that I can say.","John J. Koraleski","Justin, the real wildcard here is where do you think the consumer will come play out next year? Housing actually has, can have a pretty big impact on International Intermodal. There's some positive signs there. So we're -- it's really bet on how you think the economy consumer will play during the year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just following up on the coal for a minute. You mentioned on the domestic, the softness on -- you're seeing on the PRB. You also threw in there on the export side, you went from 1 million to 5 million tons. Can you talk about your expectations for coal demand on a global basis and where are you moving that and your growth plans for that?","John J. Koraleski","I think overall, Ken, we're looking at the world demand and saying, \"It's going to continue.\" It could be choppy. You see prices ebb and flow from time to time that might cause some. But overall, we still see world demand growing and creating a great export opportunity for us. We had 5.2 million tons, up from, I think, what did I say, 1.4 million last year. We'll do better than that, again, this year. We'll continue to see growth in that marketplace for us, and it will -- our primary focus right out of the box is for the bituminous coal out in Colorado and Utah, because that's where the world demand seems -- the higher energy coal is more in demand than the SPRB. But we're all over SPRB opportunities as well. We're scouring every port potential, every opportunity that we get, we're working with the mines. And we see that as a continuing to develop as a good opportunity for us.","James R. Young","And Ken, keep in mind though, UP shipped total tonnage last year was about 250 million tons. So we're talking about an export market of 5 million. It's again, it's not a huge base for us. It will again as we think to the future, will also offer some consistent growth. But it is not the main driver of our coal business.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","No, I recognize that, but it's just, we've been seeing obviously some metcoal cutback announcements lately. And it's a positive sign that you're expecting that to grow into 2012.","James R. Young","Well, we're in different markets.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Meaning who you're serving?","James R. Young","Well, the metcoal, that's not a big player for us.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then can you provide any thoughts on the magnitude? You noted you kept 90% on the repricing. Can you provide any thoughts on the magnitude? Somebody threw out before -- you've noted in the past, it could add about 2% to pricing. Is that -- can you comment on the magnitude of what we would expect? Or at this point, just based on what you've already renewed?","James R. Young","Ken, we're not going to get into specifics. We feel good about what we're able to accomplish. We lost some business. I said we're out of the box if we couldn't get the kind of returns we're looking for. We wouldn't handle it. And what really helped reinforce it for us is the great service and value we're providing to customers. There's no surprise that there are substantial price increases in many of those, but we also heard very clearly about the value proposition coming through. So again, we don't get individual discussions on them. It was -- feel pretty darn good about what we accomplished this year.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","One last one. Just Rob, threw out that he expected the injury expenses to climb. Is there some driver of that because Lance started off talking about how safety had improved so much, just wondering why the conflicting statements?","Robert M. Knight","Yes, this is Rob. We don't expect the injury expenses to climb. What I was pointing out is that year-over-year, because of the sizable reductions in expenses in 2011, that just creates a difficult comp for us. We have every expectation that we'll continue to improve our safety performance and continue to improve the expense, perhaps just not at the same rate.","Lance M. Fritz","It won't be a negative.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe if I could start just on a question on PTC. What's the key driver primarily of the increase that you're seeing over your last projection? And kind of how should we think about layering that in from a timing perspective? You've given us the run rate through 2012, but how do we think about beyond that through 2015?","James R. Young","Lance?","Lance M. Fritz","Sure. Let's start with the drivers. So recall that PTC, when it was mandated, was not an off-the-shelf technology. So what you're seeing reflected is exactly what I mentioned in my comments. And that is, as we develop both the hardware, the software and the overall systems technology, we're discovering more complexity, more interactions, and it's more costly. So the reflection of going from $1.4 billion to $2 billion is mostly about technology development and getting a more finite cost on that. So then looking forward, by the mandate, we've accelerated spending in 2012 to this anticipated $335 million. I anticipate there could be modest acceleration from that point in future years. But it'll be predicated on having developed technology to implement. So spending is going to be paced somewhat by making sure the technology's developed.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Sure. And I guess that kind of goes into the idea of ultimate timing for 2015 implementation, I mean any sense of leeway around the timing? I mean, there has to be some discussions? I'm guessing you guys are working towards the '15 goal, but how do you think about that from a realistic perspective?","Lance M. Fritz","Well, Chris, the industry, you have a key report due to Congress on March 1. That -- obviously, the FRA will be required to report on the status. I'll be very honest with you, I just -- I don't see it happening in 2015, the complexity that we're faced with here, the requirements. I mean, keep in mind, if the system doesn't work, you don't move product. And that's why when we look at implementing this thing, it's got to have a very, very high degree of reliability. And you have no room to get it wrong. So keep your eye out on the report that goes to Congress here on March 1.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great, that's very, very helpful. And then, just one final follow-up. Just on the headcount side when you think about kind of the inflationary rate. I know you said it was going to step down, Rob, when you think about it for 2012? And what's the order of magnitude we should expect? Is it somewhere in the neighborhood of kind of 3-ish percent or is it a little harder to tell?","Robert M. Knight","At this point in time, it's harder to tell, just less than that 4% that I indicated. Yes, and that's -- if I can, just, Chris, on that, that's on inflation. The inflation rate in our labor line, I'm saying, is going to less than 4%. The headcount net-net, that will depend upon where volumes end up. And as I said, we expect volumes to be a steady slow growth. So we'd expect headcount to increase, but at a less than one-for-one rate.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Susquehanna International Group.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I just wanted to follow-up on the Casper issue. Obviously, it was stayed, but it's something that's not going away. We can all track the weather, I guess, for the next coming months and keep our fingers crossed. But I was wondering the longer-term implications of this environmental regulation, you kind of see the chessboard shaping up. Is it a net positive for UNP, or let's call it, an immediate term in the PRB coal can bridge some of the less viable Central App coal? Are you getting inquiries to that effect? Or just help me think about the impact to your franchise specifically as you sketch out the roadmap over the next 3 to 5 years of the Casper rig?","John J. Koraleski","Matt, when you look at it, I do actually look at it as a potential opportunity for UP and Southern Powder River Basin coal because the coal will be more amenable to meeting those standards. I think we probably were getting some inquiries about moving coal, particularly to the east with the stay. It's probably dead right at the moment. And I think the other question in a lot of our customers' minds is just the emission credits and what value will be assessed to them by the market, and how does that play itself out. So a lot of questions that are out there, but it does present an opportunity, I think, for UP. And the other side of it is, both in terms of moving limestone and also trona, as a couple of different approaches towards reaching those requirement levels would also be a good business opportunity for us.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","All right, thanks. And my second question or follow-up would be just the earlier timing of the Chinese New Year, kind of in a rough patch here, we've been destocking for several months. And now, everything shuts down for 2 weeks. You get about a 3-week lag before things can get here from Asia. So you were talking about the end of March before you could see a noticeable pick-up just from an economic perspective. Always interested in your guys' economic read. You cited some numbers, but everyone seems to be basing a lot of their hopes on just, I guess, just that hope. But are you actually hearing from customers and any pocket of the business you serve and intentions to restock? Or is it just more hope that we've bottomed and hope that things get better? Or is the rubber actually hitting the proverbial road?","James R. Young","Yes Matt, this is Jim. Maybe it's the new year, you always have more hope coming into it. But I'd say our perspective in meeting with customers, we're just with one of our very large customers here a couple days ago. They're a little more bullish. Now it varies by industry. The auto industry today, they're feeling much better than they were. There's still long ways from where they were in the peak, but that could be a pretty good year. You look at some of the areas where you're still significantly off from recession. Take the -- anything related to construction. In fact, I don't -- I can't remember if we said it or not. Well we had a little bit of an increase in our lumber shipments this year. Or in 2011, we're still 60% below where we were in the peak. So when you think about housing, some of the construction, it's a little more positive this year. So again though, I think it still all fits into the perspective of we will see positive growth, it will be something kind of the slow side.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Rob, I just want clarification on -- you reiterated your long-term margin guidance, the OR targets. Just to clarify, those are not the adjusted numbers that you're referring to, right? These include fuel and everything, not sort of the adjusted for fuel numbers?","Robert M. Knight","That's right. The 65% to 67% operating ratio full year all in by 2015.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, the fourth quarter obviously seasonally weak, but a really good OR nonetheless. Can we -- is there a way we should think about -- while the weather maybe was a little bit easier this quarter or was a little bit harder last quarter or last year, is there anything to keep that in mind that sort of -- not really onetime, but sort of unusual?","Robert M. Knight","I don't think -- we were still dealing with issues down south at the beginning of the quarter. You bet it was a little bit better weather wise for us, but that wasn't the difference maker. And at the end of day here, we really -- a couple of things to keep in mind. We cycled some of the cost. Remember, Rob, we're talking about training -- we got to employ  productivity. We've been telling you all year that we had really kind of a one-off deal where we're building our training forces. That leveled out fourth quarter, and you had decent volume that came through. We managed our costs very well. Our pricing came in strong. You put those all those together, and boy, it can really lever that operating ratio.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, absolutely. Jim or Jack, just I'm curious your perspective on what's going on when we see contracts go back and forth between the competition. It sort of suggests there's more horsetrading that goes on in the west than perhaps other regions? And I'm not quite sure why. If you guys are willing to walk, but the competition isn't, does that suggest a more aggressive pricing dynamic from them? How do we think about this?","James R. Young","Bill, we compete, we compete hard. And a lot of factors come into play when you look at your decision points. It can be the routes, the capability you have, the efficiency by corridor or long-term relationships you have. I don't like that word horsetrading, because it really is one we compete hard. And I'm sure the other guys would tell you the same thing that they have some internal dynamics. They look at where's the point to walk from. So again, we've had some very tough discussions with our customers in some cases. But the key for us, Jack just said, we renegotiated successfully 90% this year of those legacy deals. An absolute key is how the customer views value from its provider. And I will tell you, I've felt very good that we're in the legacy discussions -- negotiations when you also look at we have the best customer service in the history of our company.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Larkin of Stifel, Nicolaus.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Rob talked about the incremental margins looking very, very good in the quarter. And that sort of raised the question in my mind of how sustainable that is in terms of how much capacity you think you have on your existing manifest trains and the Intermodal trains where you can fill those trains out and really drive that strong incremental margin going forward.","James R. Young","Well, at the end of the day, for us to continue to improve the operating ratio, we've got to improve our margins, right, on the incremental side. I would be careful on a quarterly number. I mean I kind of go round and round with my CFO on this in terms of -- I know you guys like to look at the quarterly numbers. But there are a lot of factors that come into play. But the bottom line, if we are going to get to the operating ratio targets that we've provided, those margins have to improve. Rob, go ahead?","Robert M. Knight","Yes, just a comment I would make on that, John. What we've said, if that 65% to 67% target implies we've got to do about a 50% incremental margin improvement, and it will be lumpy, as Jim says. I think one point I would make is remember, our first quarter generally is our toughest, most challenged from an operating ratio standpoint. And second and third tend to be our best. So you get lumpiness within the quarter, but on an annualized basis, it's at 50% is our expectation. And that's what we have to do to hit that target.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then as a follow-on, we talked about earlier the notion of labor inflation may be coming in a little bit below 4. I'm guessing the overall cost inflation isn't going be too much different than that x fuel. I've heard Jim before talk about how much he challenges the managers at UP to sort of offset that inflation with productivity. Is there any kind of guidance you can give us in terms of what the objective is there? How much of that 4% plus or minus can be offset with additional productivity in technology applications?","James R. Young","Well, John, I believe -- we talked before. I mean, we set a goal offsetting all of inflation. Now realistically, about half of it, I think, you can sustain over time. And it's going be a function of  technology, it's going to be a function of process improvement. It's going be a function of leveraging volume and operations. So I don't think that's unrealistic, at a minimum offset half of your inflation number.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research","A lot of questions have already been asked, so I'm just going to ask one. Your Mutual Commitment Program was a pretty big change in terms of your go-to-market approach. And you commented that your own performance has been very good. Could you just comment on customer receptivity, and how that's evolved through the year?","James R. Young","Jack?","John J. Koraleski","Sure. We started off the year, customers kind of were -- kind of looking at it and looking at the change and trying to determine whether or not they should or shouldn't participate. So we kind of got off to a slow start. As we got into peak season though, we were right on with every commitment that we made during peak. We offered customers 110% of their committed volumes, and we were able to meet every commitment. So we came out of the peak season with some very favorable comments from customers and a lot more receptivity to the program. So we're anxious. We will definitely stay the course here and continue to work the program for 2012 and beyond.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Gary Chase of Barclays Capital.","Garrett L. Chase - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to see if I could get Lance or Rob or both to just help us think a little bit about the leverage you obviously saw in the comp and ben line for 4Q. It's pretty unusual for that to be down sequentially in dollars and also on a per head basis, and both of those things happened this time. Just wondering if you could help us think through what some of the key drivers? And I know you mentioned a few possibilities, things like the training cost falling out. I was wondering if that had already started? Also, Lance, the growth you pointed to in the manifest network, perhaps, that's where you're really getting the leverage and that was an enabler. And I guess, of course, most important is about the sustainability of those trends. Should we expect to see favorable comparisons on that cost per head basis as we look forward?","James R. Young","Rob, why don't you start and Lance, you can...","Robert M. Knight","Let me just give you -- kind of size the numbers, and then maybe Lance can give some technicolor on some of the initiatives. Remember, coming into 2011, particularly in the back half, we said that, that was going to be unusually high. And it was unusually high as we had more people in the pipeline, if you will, in terms of training. So we had that comp. And as we came in to 2000 -- back half of 2011, we said that we thought the fourth quarter would be a catch-up, if you will. So we experienced that. So we had fewer people in the hiring and training pipeline in the fourth quarter, particularly when you look at it year-over-year. And I'd say that was really what drove the financial variance that you're pointing out. In terms of some of the great initiatives that we were doing on the ground or in operation productivity, Jack should talk about that.","John J. Koraleski","Yes, let's talk about it. And it kind of gets to the earlier question about train size and other -- what we can think about going forward in terms of incremental productivity. So we did have a good quarter on train size growth. We also had a good quarter in terms of improvement in the fluidity of the network. You saw in one of my charts, I showed you improvement in cars switched per man day. That's pure productivity through our terminals. And we've got, what we call, the UP way and downtime initiatives that are using process improvement and direct involvement by the people doing the work to design the work, standardize it, take out risk and take out waste. And all of that is helping us drive, not only productivity, but safety and service at the same time. And there is plenty more of that left in the network.","Garrett L. Chase - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Is there anyway to sort of parse out the magnitude of contribution maybe for both of those with the training the more significant of the 2. It sounds like that would carry all the way through at least to the comps where you hit 4Q next year.","John J. Koraleski","I think when you look at the employee count spreads, the training piece was a pretty big number year-over-year, but they all interplay. I mean, I think one of the keys, Lance mentioned, we start to see our velocity pick up, the fluidity of the network. I think it just shows you how sensitive these networks are, the challenges you have. So you had a little bit less issues with weather. You had some of the routes, the mix comes into play. They all really contribute. And what I think you need to understand, we were saying that for 3 quarters. What you were seeing in the prior quarters was more unusual. That wasn't the norm. And when you're looking at a 9% and 10% increase in labor cost year-over-year, that isn't sustainable in a business. And this is an area where I think it's more of a sustainable level that they're seeing in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So it seems like mix was a nice positive in 2011, and when we think about the initial volume outlook for this year, losing some of the legacy business, I guess muted expectations for International Intermodal and what seems like stronger carload expectations, is it fair to think about mix as being a similar positive in 2012 like it was last year?","James R. Young","Jack?","John J. Koraleski","I think that overall, that's what I would expect. I think mix should favor us this year.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of the domestic intermodal outlook and no plans to add containers this year, how much volume growth do you think you can get without adding containers? And then I guess it sounds like the plan is to keep capacity tighter, it sounds good for pricing. How do you think about pricing in 2012 on the domestic intermodal side relative to what seemed like pretty healthy increases in 2011?","James R. Young","Jack?","John J. Koraleski","I think we're continuing our focus on increasing our pricing. I don't think that's going to change in 2012. And I think that with great service, we have added capacity or available capacity in our box fleet that gets us through the year just fine.","James R. Young","But Scott, I think there are other factors, external factors. What do you think is going to happen with capacity in the truckload sector? What's our perspective here in terms of the economy? All those come into play. We've achieved pretty darn good pricing with really a relatively weak economy. All those can come into play. So I would -- when I look at 2000 -- this year, if anything, there could be potential upside if the economy comes a little bit stronger going forward.","John J. Koraleski","And we're also sometimes -- Scott, it wasn't a prolonged period of time, but we were sold out on our containers even this year with a relatively weak peak. So we'll see that happen again next year, but we think that the throughput and the better service -- you're not dealing with floods and things like that hopefully. We'll get a greater turn on that equipment, and so we can handle more freight.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","That's helpful. And just last thing real quick, what's the latest thoughts on timing to finish Sunset?","James R. Young","Well, we've got 2\/3 finished right now. We'll do another, what do you think, Lance?","Lance M. Fritz","5%.","James R. Young","About 5% this year. We're going -- it's really a function of how we're looking at volume and the economy in the next 4 or 5 years. So again, it's still years out. I'd like to accelerate it. If I accelerates, that says the economy is much stronger, and we're much more bullish on the outlook. But right now, when you look at kind of the slow growth economy, we're in pretty good shape down there and  want to keep ahead of the curve.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Are you seeing incremental benefits along the way, or is it more of a once it's done 4 years from now, it's kind of a step-function improvement in productivity?","James R. Young","Lance?","Lance M. Fritz","Yes, we do see incremental benefits along the way. One of them that we don't talk about too much is we're cutting over double-track segments in areas where we have to perform maintenance on the existing single track. So we've talked historically about this investing for maintainability, and that's paying off in spades on the Sunset route.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird.","Benjamin Hartford","Real quick, Rob, as we think about pension expense in 2012, where did the expense fall out in 2011? I think the expectation was close to $80 million, $79 million versus $51 million in '10. What was the final number for '11? And what should we be thinking about for '12 preliminarily?","Robert M. Knight","We would think that the pension expense will be up slightly from 2011's levels.","Benjamin Hartford","That $79 million, $80 million was in the ballpark?","Robert M. Knight","I think that's in the ballpark of what it was. I don't have the exact number, but I think that's in the ballpark.","Benjamin Hartford","Good. And then, I guess, Jack, just thinking about coal volumes. I know that in 2010, about 18% of your volumes were destined for Eastern U.S. customers in some form. How did that trend in 2011? And is that expected to change meaningfully in 2012?","John J. Koraleski","Ben, I don't think it changed meaningfully in 2011. And staying the Casper rules and things like that, I don't think we'll see a significant change in 2012 either.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Ceraso of Credit Suisse Group.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of items, it may be for Jim. Is there any concern, Jim, that as your returns improve and you posted a record here in the quarter that, that starts to impede or weigh on your ability to raise price with customers? Or is there a level at which your returns get so high that you have to start thinking about that?","James R. Young","Well, I think we're a long ways from that. Here's my point, and you know we spent a lot of time up in Washington talking to members of Congress. I spent time in front of my customers. Here's the key, we just reported the greatest financial in the history of UP in 2011. And we just came out and said, we announced the single largest capital spend in the history of our company. They are connected. And when you think about the replacement cost of assets in the railroad industry, the returns have to grow. And I will tell you if we get into a situation where somebody wants to cap us at the level we're at right now, return of capital, you will see capital shrink. The math is pretty simple. So we're making bets on capital investment today under the assumption that I can continue to grow the return on invested capital. The other thing is provide great service and value to the customer. All those things are important. And I mean I'm not going to kid you, we obviously think about it. But my board has supported me in terms of the capital we're putting in, and I think we have a good story to talk with our customers.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then to follow-up on headcount, you mentioned the high attrition rate still, but hiring to backfill that, and then keep up with growth, although not on a one-for-one. Can you give us any numbers on what the net increase in heads you expect for 2012? Is it 1%, 2%, 3%? What's the net headcount?","James R. Young","We came up this year up about 3%, 1,500. We finished about 45,000. Keep in mind though, you got a split -- that 1,500 increase was split about 50\/50 between capital, which includes positive train control and OE. So as our cap, you got 2 things that will drive it. Volume will drive the OE number next year, offset by some productivity. It won't be 100% offset, but the capital spend including PTC should grow that. So I would tell you at the end of the year, assuming our economic outlook plays out, you're going to see more people working at railroad this time next year than we did the year earlier.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we're nearing the end of our allotted time for question and answers. And we have time for one final question. That question will be coming from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein Research.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Maybe a question for Jack. On the Intermodal side, are you getting a little bit of a positive benefit from the faster growth in domestic relative to international? I guess I'm thinking that empty repositioning is a little bit less than the domestic business. And I just wanted to check and see if that was consistent with your kind of view of the business?","John J. Koraleski","Yes, the domestic side, we had a great fourth quarter on the domestic business, record setting, so that was good. It reduces the repositioning. It would be nice to have the stronger international side as well, because there's some nice dovetailing that takes place, particularly, when they stuff the domestic containers on the West Coast. But overall, yes, your assumption is correct.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on weather. I think Jim, you mentioned that the weather wasn't a great impact on the record fourth quarter OR. And I guess I just wanted to kind of make sure I had heard that correctly, because I would've thought that the positive impacts on network fluidity, slow orders, all that kind of fun stuff would have actually kind of, been a benefit in the quarter.","James R. Young","Well, I didn't say it was a major driver. Although remember, we were still battling issues in Texas starting in the beginning of the first -- of the fourth quarter when you look at...","Lance M. Fritz","The Texas drought didn't really go away until October.","James R. Young","Well, my only point is there are a lot of factors that drove the operating ratio in the fourth quarter. The fundamental ones toward -- to me are business, our volume, our pricing and our productivity.","Operator","I will now turn the floor back to Mr. Jim Young for closing comments.","James R. Young","Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We're looking forward to talking to you again in April. I hope what you see today with our results is the real capability and potential for the UP network. So thanks again for joining us.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operation Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available in the Union Pacific's website.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President, and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may now begin.","Lance Fritz","Good morning, everybody. And welcome to the Union Pacific's fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha, are Beth Whited, our Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, our Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of $7.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017 or $9.25 per share. These reported numbers include the previously disclosed adjustments reflecting the impact of corporate tax reform which Rob will discuss in more detail in a few minutes. Excluding these adjustments 2017 fourth quarter net income was $1.2 billion or $1.53 per share. This represents an increase of 5% and 10% respectively when compared to 2016. Total volume increased 1% in the quarter compared to 2016 driven primarily by 17% increase in industrial products and a 5% increase in chemicals. Partially offsetting these volume increases were declines in agricultural products, automotive and coal. Intermodal carloads were flat for the quarter.","Overall force levels decreased in the fourth quarter both sequentially and year-over-year as we continue to make meaningful progress on our productivity initiatives. The quarterly adjusted operating ratio came in at 62.6% which was up 0.6 points from the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was driven by an increase in fuel price. I'm pleased with the results the men and women of Union Pacific achieved by focusing on our six-track value strategy. While we have room for improvement in many areas that does not include the dedication and hard work of our employees as they build America.","Our team will give you more of the details on the fourth quarter, starting with Beth.","Beth Whited","Thank you Lance and good morning. This will be our final reporting on six business groups as we announce during the third quarter. Effective January 1 we will transition reporting to our newly established four business groups agricultural products, energy, industrial and premium. For the fourth quarter our volume was up 1% driven primarily by industrial products and chemicals, we generated positive net core pricing of about one and three quarters percent in the quarter with continued energy in intermodal pricing pressure. Despite these challenges our focus continues to be on achieving core pricing gains that counterbalance inflation and coincide with our value proposition. The increase in volume and 4% improvement and average revenue per car drove a 5% increase in freight revenue.","Let's take a closer look at the performance of each business group. Ag products revenue was down 4% on a 7% volume decrease partially offset by 3% increase in average revenue per car. Grain carloads were down 19% driven by high global supplies and reduced US competitiveness in the world export market. Grain products carloads were down 2% as growth in ethanol exports were offset by reduced mill [ph] shipments to the east. The delayed implementation of the biodiesel tax credit also negatively impacted our oils business. Food and refrigerator volumes were up 2% driven by continued strength in import beer. Growth in refrigerated shipments for frozen fries in Cold Connect.","Automotive revenue was down 1% in the quarter on a 4% decrease in volume and a 3% increase in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 5% as a result of lower production levels in response to softer vehicle sales high inventories as well as planned outages for model changeovers. These reductions were partially offset by new West Coast import traffic and strong shipments into the Texas market for hurricane replacement.","The seasonally adjusted average rate of sales was 17.1 million vehicles in the fourth quarter, down only slightly from fourth quarter 2016. On the parts side, over-the-road conversions and growth in light truck demand minimized the impact of lower overall production levels resulting in a 1% reduction.","Chemicals revenue was up 7% for the quarter, on a 5% increase in volume, and 2% increase in average revenue per car. Petroleum and LPG shipments increased 15% driven by stronger diesel and crude oil shipments coupled with strengthen in propane due to Mexico demand, hurricane recovery and inventory build for seasonal winter demand. Plastics carloads were down 4% due to resin tightness and increased commodity prices as a result of residual impact from Hurricane Harvey. Fertilizer was up 11%, driven by continued strength in potash exports.","Coal revenue decreased 5% for the quarter, on a 3% decrease in volume, and 2% decrease in average revenue per car. On a tonnage basis, Powder River Basin was down 2%, while other regions were down 1%. Natural gas prices were down 8% from a year ago driving the decrease in domestic demand. Colorado Utah Loadings benefited from strong export shipments to the West Coast and to the Gulf Coast. Coal stockpiles have been below the five-year average for the majority of the year.","Industrial products revenue was up 28%, on a 17% increase in volume, and a 10% increase in average revenue per car during the quarter. Minerals volume increased 71% in the quarter, driven by a 100% increase in sand shipments, due to improving well completions and increased proppant intensity per well. Specialized markets volume increased 20% in the quarter, driven by a 15% increase in waste, as a result of West Coast remediation projects and a 60% increase in military shipments, due to increased deployments and rotations.","Intermodal revenue was up 4% on a flat volume and a 4% increase in average revenue per quarter. The domestic market increased 1% driven by strong parcel shipment. International volume was down 2% driven by continued headwinds from industry challenges due to overcapacity and consolidations which resulted in increased transloading and changing vessel ports of call.","Going forward we'll be begin to report on our four business groups agricultural products, energy, industrial and premium. For agricultural products we anticipate continued strength in ethanol exports driven by demand from China, Brazil and India. Continued growth in food and refrigerated shipments due to Cold Connect penetration tightening to our capacity, frozen fries expansions and continued strength and import beer. We anticipate continued uncertainty in the grain market as high global supply and unknown weak crop quality potentially affect our ability to participate in the export market.","For energy we anticipate continued strength in frac sand with more uncertainty in the second half due to the viability of local sand. As always for coal, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand. Industrial is expected to remain stable. We anticipate an increase in plastics as new facilities and expansions come online and resin supply increases. In addition we expect to see strength in both rock [ph] and cement markets. For premium, we truck capacity to continue to tighten providing an opportunity to drive higher levels of over the road conversions. Despite challenges within the international intermodal market, we anticipate new products benefiting the supply chain will drive growth. As for automotive the US light vehicle sales forecast for 2018 is 16.9 million units down 2% from 2017. Production shifts will create some opportunity to offset the weaker market demand and over the road conversions will present new opportunities for additional parts growth.","With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance.","Cameron Scott","Thanks, Beth and good morning. Starting with safety performance, our reportable injury rate was 0.79 slightly higher than the full year record of 0.75 achieved in 2016. Although we continue generating near record safety results, we won't be satisfied until we reach our goal of zero incidents, getting every one of our employees home safely at the end of each day. With regards to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate improved 3% to 2.94.","In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased 5% versus the 2016 to 2.55, as we continue to reinforce public awareness to community partnerships and public safety campaigns.","Moving on to network performance, as reported to the AAR, velocity declined 5% and terminal dwell increased 12% compared to the third quarter of 2016. We're not satisfied with this operating performance. Multiple factors play in the network fluidity and we intently focus every day on improving service from these levels. We also have the resources and capacity needed to make this happen.","In addition as I mentioned on our last earnings call implementation and testing a positive trend control across a growing number of routes in our network continues to drive part of the negative impact on velocity. For a quick update on PTC, by year end about 60% of the total wrap miles requiring PTC were fully implemented and operational. The western region has been completed. The northern region is near completion and we're well underway on the southern region. With these new regions come a new set of challenges both from a technological and training perspective.","The team is doing an excellent job troubleshooting and building upon the lessons learned from those locations where PTC has been implemented. We will continue working through these challenges as we progress towards the 2018 PTC deadline. Taking a look at our resources, all in our total operating workforce was down more than 200 employees in the quarter when compared to last year. Our TE&Y workforce was up 6% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily driven by an increase of approximately 600 employees currently in TE&Y training. This is predominantly a timing issue with the six and nine-month lead time required for new hires who becomes service eligible. We've begun refilling the training pipeline to accommodate our resource needs for the coming year.","Our engineering and mechanical workforce was down more than 800 employees driven by a smaller capital program in 2017 and because our G55 and zero initiatives have resulted in greater labor productivity. As always we will continue to adjust our resources as volume and network performance dictate. Moving onto productivity, although a decline in our velocity in terminal dwell metric did negatively impact productivity in certain areas. I'm pleased with the progress we experienced driving productivity elsewhere. We achieved best ever train size performance in our grain and manifest train categories during the fourth quarter. Marking the tenth consecutive quarter of best ever performance in our manifest network.","The team also achieved fourth quarter records in our automotive and intermodal train categories and with 2017 complete I'm proud to announce that the team achieved four year records in every single train category. We were also able to generate productivity gains within our terminals as car switched for employee day increased 1% during the fourth quarter.","Turning to our capital investments, in total we invested about $3.1 billion in our 2017 capital program. For 2018, we're targeting around $3.3 billion pending final approval by our Board of Directors. About 70% of our plan 2018 capital investment is replacement spending to harden our infrastructure, replace all their assets and improve the safety and resiliency of the network. Our 2018 capital program also includes about 60 new locomotives which will complete our multi-year purchase commitment.","We also plan to invest some additional $160 million in Positive Train Control. On accumulative basis we still expect to spend approximately $2.9 billion on PTC. Additionally we plan to begin construction of new classification yard in Hearne, Texas. This facility will be named Brazos yard and will help support expected volume growth from our customers in the southern region. We will improve service by decreasing car handlings and car cycle times. It will also be the most efficient hump yard in our rail network with the lowest operating cost. Construction is expected to cost approximately $550 million with operations schedule to begin in 2020.","To wrap up, looking into 2018 we expect network fluidity to return to normalized levels as we work through PTC implementation and shifting volume growth. We will continue to create productivity opportunities through initiatives, design to increase train length, balance resources and improve assets utilization. With the ultimate goal of enhancing the customer experience and creating value for our shareholders. And we'll continuous driving for positive safety results on a way to an incident-free environment.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Rob Knight","Thanks and good morning. Let's start with the recap of our fourth quarter results. I want to first remind everyone of a couple of non-cash items impacting the fourth quarter and it's full year 2017 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation passed prior to yearend. As we initially disclosed back on January 9, the fourth quarter includes a non-cash reduction in income tax expense resulting primarily from the revaluation of the company's deferred tax liabilities to reflect the recently enacted 21% federal corporate tax rate. After further analysis of the effects of the tax reform, we have revised this estimate upwards to just over $5.9 billion compared to $5.8 billion that we disclosed in our 8-K filing.","In addition, we also recognize a non-cash reduction to operating expense of just over $200 million related to income tax adjustments at equity method affiliates. This adjustment is primarily driven by our equity ownership in TTX and is reported in the equipment and other rents line of our income statement. Slide 20 shows our adjusted results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 reflecting the impact of these items.","With that in mind, let's take a look at our core performance in the fourth quarter excluding the impact of the corporate tax reform. Operating revenue was $5.5 billion in the quarter up 5% versus last year. Positive core price, increased fuel surcharge revenue and a 1% increase in volume with the primary drivers of the increase in revenue for the quarter. Operating expense totaled $3.4 billion up 6% from 2016. Operating income totaled $2 billion a 4% increase from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $29 million down $11 million from 2016. Interest expense of $188 million was up 8% compared to the previous year and this reflects the impact of higher total debt balance partially offset by a lower effective interest rate.","Income tax expense decreased 2% to $676 million. Net income totaled $1.2 billion up 5% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activities. These results combined to produce adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.53. The adjusted operating ratio was 62.6% up 0.6% points from the fourth quarter of last year. The combined impact of fuel price and our fuel surcharge lag had a 0.6 point negative impact on the operating ratio in the quarter compared to 2016. Fuel had a neutral impact on our earnings per share year-over-year.","Freight revenue of just under $5.1 billion was up 5% versus last year. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $293 million up $106 million when compared to 2016 and up $66 million versus the third quarter of this year. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the fourth quarter was a positive 0.5%. The primary drivers of this positive mix were year-over-year growth in frac sand and base chemical shipments partially offset by a decrease in grain carloadings. Core price was about 1.75% in the fourth quarter slightly down from the third quarter. However, if we set coal intermodal aside, our core price was around 2.75% in the quarter. And for the full year as we expected the total dollars that we generated from our pricing actions exceeded our rail inflation cost.","Turning now to operating expense, Slide 23 provides a summary of our operating expense for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense increased 4% to $1.2 billion versus 2016. The increase was driven primarily by a combination of higher wage and benefit inflation along with higher volume and partially offset by productivity achieved in the quarter. Full year labor inflation came in at about 4%, while overall inflation was approximately 2.5%. Productivity gains and a smaller capital workforce resulted in total workforce levels declining 1.5% in the fourth quarter versus last year or about 625 employees.","For 2018, we expect force levels to adjust with volume especially with respect to TE&Y workforce that Cam just mentioned. But our overall workforce levels will also reflect ongoing productivity initiatives as well. Fuel expense totaled $547 million up 27% when compared to last year. Higher diesel fuel prices and 3% increase in gross ton miles drove the increase in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate was flat while our average fuel price increased 23% to $2.03 per gallon.","Purchase services material expense increased 6% to $585 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher cost associated with subsidiary contract services. Turning to Slide 24, depreciation expense was $532 million up 2% compared to 2016. The increase is primarily driven by a higher depreciable asset base including our positive train control assets. For the full year 2018, we estimate that depreciation expense will increase about 5%. Moving to equipment and other rents, this expense totaled $276 million in the quarter which is down 1% when compared to 2016. This excludes the equity income tax adjustment of $212 million that I mentioned earlier.","Other expenses came in at $239 million up 3% versus last year. The primary driver was an increase in state and local taxes and other expenses partially offset by a decrease in personal injury expense. For the full year 2018, we expect other expense to increase around 10% versus 2017 driven in part by the anticipation of higher state property tax expense resulting from the corporate tax reform changes.","On the productivity side, our G55 and zero initiatives yielded about $75 million of productivity in the fourth quarter. This brings our full year total to just under $350 million. Slide 26 provides the summary of our 2017 earnings with a full year income statement again excluding the impact of our corporate tax reform. Operating revenue increased about $1.3 billion to $21.2 billion adjusted operating income totaled $7.8 billion, an increase of 8% compared to 2016. And adjusted net income was just over $4.6 billion while adjusted earnings per share were up 14% to a record $5.79 per share.","Looking at our cash flow, cash from operations for the full year totaled about $7.2 billion down 4% when compared to last year. The decrease in cash was primarily related to a lower bonus depreciation benefit in 2017 compared to 2016 which was mostly offset by the increase in net income. Our capital spending program in 2017 totaled around $3.1 billion. Adjusted return on investment capital was 13.7% in 2017 up a full point from 2016 driven primarily by higher earnings. Taking a look at adjusted debt levels, the all in adjusted debt balance totaled about $19.5 billion at year end 2017 up $1.6 billion since the end of 2016. We finished the fourth quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of around 19 times. Dividend payments for the full year totaled nearly $2 billion up from just under $1.9 billion in 2016. This includes a 10% increase in our declared dividend per share which occurred in the fourth quarter.","In addition to dividends, we also bought back 36.4 million totaling $4 billion during the full year 2017. This represents 29% increase over 2016 in terms of dollar spent. In the fourth quarter we bought back 9.2 million shares at a cost of about $1.1 billion. And since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased over 32% of our outstanding shares. And between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned $6 billion to our shareholders in 2017, which represented 129% of adjusted net income over the same period.","I want to provide you some commentary on how we believe the new tax law changes will impact Union Pacific in 2018 and beyond. Our federal statutory income tax rate will decline from 35% to 21% all in when you include state taxes, our effective income tax rate will be about 25% and from a cash perspective we expect our 2018 cash tax rate to be between 17% and 18%. This cash tax rate reflects the benefits from the lower federal tax rate and immediate expensing of eligible capital expenditures partially offset by the negative impact of prior year bonus depreciation programs.","In later years, our cash tax rate will likely trend in the direction of the statutory rate. We expect these changes will result in free cash flow by approximately $1 billion in 2018 and we're still in the process of developing specific plans for the uses of cash in 2018 and as you know these plans including our capital budget must be reviewed and approved by our board. But for now, I can assure you that our basic philosophies and priorities regarding cash allocation and distribution have not fundamentally changed. We will continue to employee a balanced approach to capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases.","First and foremost, we will approximately invest in the business with an eye on earning adequate returns on capital employed. And as Cam mentioned earlier, we plan to spend around $3.3 billion in capital in 2018 and our guidance of reinvesting around 15% of revenue remains unchanged. At this time, after capital expenditures we will continue returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Looking ahead to 2018 from a fundamentals perspective. We expect volumes in the first quarter and the full year to be up in the low single-digit range. And as Beth commented on earlier, we should see strength in several business categories along with uncertainty in other areas.","We will price our service product to the value that it represents in the market place from an all in pricing perspective we're confident the dollars we generate from our pricing initiatives should well exceed our rail inflation cost in 2018. As for inflation this year, we expect both labor inflation and overall inflation will be under 2% driven primarily by lower expected health and welfare costs. On the productivity side, we plan to achieve approximately $300 million to $350 million of savings this year as we continue to focus on G55 and zero initiatives.","To wrap it all up, in addition to the significant incremental cash benefit that we expect as a result of the corporate tax reform. Positive full year volume, positive core price and a significant productivity benefits will all contribute to another year of strong cash generation in an improved full year operating ratio in 2018. We're still focused on our targeted 60% operating ratio plus or minus on a full year basis by 2019 and we're confident in our plans to get there.","In longer term, we're firmly committed to reaching our goal over 55% operating ratio beyond 2019 as we continue to momentum of our volume pricing and productivity initiatives. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.","Lance Fritz","Thank you Rob. As we discussed today we delivered solid fourth quarter and full year results setting the table for 2018. We're optimistic the economy will favor a number of our market segments leading to another year of positive volume growth. Increased unit volume combined with inflation plus core pricing and G55 and zero productivity initiatives should result in another year of revenue growth and improved margins. We'll continue to execute our value track strategy to benefit our employees, partner with the communities we serve, provide our customers with an excellent experience and generate strong returns for our shareholders. With that, let's open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Van Kegel","This is actually Van Kegel on for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question. Lance, Beth could you just kind of give us post mortem on 2017. Your volume was up around 2% versus the industry up about 4% and your competitor being up 5% and historically UNP haven't seen a lot of growth. Could you just talk through some of the headwinds that maybe we don't appreciate from this year and some of the most compelling market opportunities going forward?","Lance Fritz","Sure, Van this is Lance. I'll start with just a very broad overview of 2017 and then turn it over to Beth for more specific market discussion. So you're right, we had about 2% volume growth. You combine that with core pricing growth and are about $350 million in productivity and it generates a record EPS of $5.79 now within that. there are some things that we're particularly proud of that is continued productivity improvement, the ability to get price in some of our markets that are relatively difficult having a franchise that makes us open and accessing to number of markets that are looking pretty sharp and good. And then there are some things that I would say I'm either not happy with or disappointed in and that is, in the second half of the year. We saw our operating kind of service product and overall operating performance slip a bit and that's a place that we're not comfortable in and we're working very hard to remedy as we speak. Beth?","Beth Whited","Lance mentioned we're very focused on ensuring that we're generating great value and margins for the company and we're maybe less focused on volume as we end and all be all, so we had great growth, wonderful business that we enjoy in frac sand. We saw coal return in the year overall to levels that are probably a little bit more normalized. We had really strong Ag in the first half not so much in the second half compared to the year before and that's really just a global markets perspective and then on the intermodal side, while our domestic parcel business went gangbusters, we continue to see competitive pricing scenarios in both international and domestic intermodal for most of the year that really dampened our growth potential compared to others. We remained really focused on improving margins in intermodal and so we didn't see maybe the same kind of growth that you saw from others.","Van Kegel","Great. And then on just quick follow-up on intermodal. I mean domestic up on and international on two and kind of wanted to strongest global trade environment we're seeing. Could you just give some more context around the drivers behind that and maybe either contract loses or some of the shifts that happen with the streamliners and then what you're doing on the sales and marketing side to maybe improve those outcomes. Thank you.","Beth Whited","So as I mentioned we were - we had really strong parcel growth in the last quarter, a lot of that ecommerce driven as you would expect. The domestic market seems to be significantly improving with the tightening of truck availability so I would - we're certainly very hopeful that ends up being a good market for us in 2018, on the international side. We did see some decline in the fourth quarter and I think that is largely due to some shifting from the Pacific Northwest US ports into some of the Canadian ports where you've seen some pretty significant capacity expansion.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group","So wanted to ask you Rob about just the pricing metric. I think people surprised that it decelerated this quarter even if you exclude coal intermodal decelerated a little bit. So maybe if you can give us some thoughts on why it decelerated. Beth, I think last quarter you said that the coal intermodal competitive pressure maybe starting to ease a little bit and maybe if you can give us an update there. And then Rob, you talked about inflation - pricing dollars well exceeding in inflation so I think that sounds a little bit better than what you've been saying in the past. Maybe do you have, is that just the inflation dollar amount slowing a lot or do you have confidence that the pricing dollars accelerates this year.","Rob Knight","Yes, Scott let me take all that in. first of all you noticed that we changed the refind [ph] if you will and I would say being crystal clear and trying to be as transparent as we possibly can the rounding convention to quarter points here. I would say that if you look at the difference between the just under two, that we reported in our pricing in the third quarter to the 1.75 that we're calling out here in the fourth quarter the difference between the third and fourth quarter is really quite small. So I wouldn't read that there is any pricing actions story to be told between the third and fourth quarter there.","Stepping back though, just to remind you and I know you, you know this but to remind everybody listening. How we calculate price? And we've been doing this for the 15 years that I've been the CFO and I'm very proud of this. It's a very detailed, analytical approach to what did we actually yield from our pricing action. So it's not representative of same store sales that took place this quarter versus last quarter or last year. it really is how many dollars did we yield from the pricing actions that we took since the last 12 months and how many dollars did we yield this quarter that actually went to the bottom line, so it's not again it's not a same store sales type, remember what we did really take to the bottom line and in the fourth quarter that was 1.75 pricing.","To your point, if you exclude as we called out in both the third quarter and now in the fourth quarter. If you exclude the coal intermodal where we continue to face some challenges I would say and Beth can perhaps elaborate on the intermodal piece of this. I would say that in the fourth quarter we still face those same challenges. Now as you look forward and Beth can comment on this, as you look forward particularly in the intermodal we're feeling better about that obviously but we're still in the competitive challenges I would say in the coal space and then there is one final comment before I let Beth comment on the intermodal on your question about the well exceeding comment that I made as we look to 2018 and what I'm saying there, is our expectation again remember how we calculate price, it's dollars yielded from the pricing actions that we took and comparing that to the dollars we anticipate expending on inflation, both pieces we think are moving favorably, yes we think inflation overall for 2018 will be lower than 2017, we think it's going overall be under 2% and yes, we do have some optimism as we look forward to 2018 in some of our pricing opportunity. So we believe that gap if you will of the pricing actions and yields from our pricing actions in 2018 versus the inflation dollars will be better in 2018, than it was in 2017.","Beth Whited","Yes, just building on what Rob said. My perspective is that, our pricing in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter was not different. We were still seeing opportunities to price and I would say growing opportunities to price on the domestic intermodal side, international intermodal and coal continue to be challenges for us competitively, but we definitely do see that truck availability is tightening in the spot market, how that converts into long-term contracts we'll get more and more opportunity to see as we have bid season coming up in domestic intermodal, but it does feel like the pricing opportunities are flowing.","Scott Group","Okay, that's helpful and then Rob, I wanted to just ask you what about just the balance sheet and maybe the rationale for being a single A credit. It doesn't seem like there is any sort of meaningful reduction you're seeing in borrowing cost relative to maybe some of the other rail so, so it doesn't just feel like we're optimizing that the cap structure here and now with all the extra cash flow from tax reform. It would seem to be like there is a pretty dramatic opportunity here to ramp up leverage and then obviously would that really ramp up the buybacks for your shareholders. I know you can't give us like the specific numbers today and maybe that will come in May, but maybe can you just because what I'm saying makes sense to you or is there a reason why you feel like you need to be a single A credit relative to what you used to be.","Rob Knight","Scott, duly noted. We totally understand your point and others point on this very issue. I would say that, with the new $1 billion of cash flow opportunity we have, it's frankly high class problem for us to evaluate how this is all going to play out. I know we and everyone including rating agencies are going to be digesting what does all this mean. We're comfortable being we drive towards cash flow measures and we've been comfortable with A rating, but even within that Scott to your point, we think there is a growing opportunity for us to both grow our cash flow from the fundamentals and the benefits of the tax reform act give us additional opportunities and as I stated. I'll reiterate it. We're not changing our philosophy we're going to contuse to be very focused on rewarding our shareholders in addition to spending capital, where the returns are there but we do believe this gives us a high class problem as we look at dividend and share repurchases going forward.","Scott Group","Okay, all right. Thank you guys.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter","Rob, you've been at between 63%, 64% OR for four years now and you noted the workforce that was in your commentary will increase with volumes. Is that a change from growing the workforce but not at a pace with volumes and I guess just thinking about 60% OR does that include the shift in pension income and with the rise in the fuel prices impacting the operating ratio.","Rob Knight","Yes Ken I mean your point is duly noted in terms of where we are and we're proud that we've, as you know over the years going from high 80s to the low 60s and we're very focused on getting that 60 and ultimately 55. The math behind why it may have kind of slowed the momentum here in the last couple of years is a lot of moving parts in there. But rest assured, we're very focused on continuing to improve year-over-year and we have to drive incremental margins to get to that 60 plus or minus by 2019. And what it's going to take continue focus on our G55 and zero initiatives which still is turning out stellar productivity numbers. High quality service product enables us to continue to get price in the marketplace. Specifically to your point on headcount that's not really a change. What I said here today on headcount and that is that, it will move with volume but not one for one that is not a change we've kind of had that philosophy now for several years and what I'm saying there, is if volume is up x% I would expect that will require us because we think we're right-sized right now that will require us to bring in additional employees depending on what business it is, what makes it etc., but it's not going to one-to-one because the G55 and zero focus on productivity, we're very confident that headcount will not grow at the same pace that hopefully volume does.","So it's really a combination of factors, but I take comfort that we're very focused and committed to continue to drive to that 60 plus or minus by 2019.","Lance Fritz","Ken, this is Lance just two other observations. One is that training pipeline is going to have to be filled just for attrition purposes. We have what mid to high single-digit percent attrition out of TE&Y workforce every year, so that's going to have to be filled for that purpose. As we look forward into next year in growth. The second thing is, growth is another levers that we focus on in making sure that we're able to drive long-term margin improvement and we're very pleased that we got margin improvement this year.","Ken Hoexter","Okay, great thanks. Rob I think I was little confused I thought you were shifting and saying that you're going to one-for-one in the original computation. Thanks for that clarification.","Rob Knight","Thank you for the clarification, no I'm not saying that.","Ken Hoexter","And then my second one, I guess Lance maybe for you the - we've heard now three other rails move to kind of eliminate it seems like almost all of their hump yards and improved operating performance. Now you're looking to spend maybe $500 million on adding another one. Maybe can you just walk through the cost benefit analysis so we can understand the difference of why you looked to add, when other seem to cutting them.","Lance Fritz","Yes, absolutely so let's start from the top. Ken, right we use yards whether it's flat switching yards or hump yards to categorize cars in our manifest network and you know we have a very robust large manifest network. When we determined how we want to get that switching done it's all about how many cars can we aggregate and how deep into the network or somebody else's network we can send them that informs for us. The number of large network yards which are hump yards for us that's all driven by car count versus smaller, regional or local yards which are flat switching yards. The reason why we're building a new hump yard in the middle of Texas is that as we look forward both from the volume that's coming out of the petrochemical complexes along the Gulf Coast. Texas itself and overall manifest growth down in that part of our network. We see that our existing infrastructure is going to be overwhelmed at some point in the future. We're doing everything we can to incrementally improve productivity in those areas. You saw Cameron this morning talk about incremental productivity and car switch for employee. We also look for incremental capital that can be spent in existing network yards, but once that string runs out, we have built new capacity.","When you think about this specific yard, Brazos. It will be the most productive yard on our network. It will be the lowest cost per car switched and the most efficient. And what we will do is, we'll utilize it again for a lot of that two and from business that's down in the Southeast part of our network and we're pretty confident I would scratch that, very confident that now is the right time to build it and it's the right asset to build.","Ken Hoexter","Thanks for the thoughts. Appreciate the time.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.","David Vernon","Rob, just real quickly in terms of that 10% growth in the other expense guidance. Could you clarify that a little bit more? It sounds like you guys are doing a lot of work on taking cost to out and yet this other line continues to kind of pop up a little bit. So I'm just wondering kind of what's behind that cost increase there.","Rob Knight","Yes, David I mean there's a lot goes into the line item as you know and it includes state and local taxes. The equipment property damage, utilities, insurance I mean environmental. A lot of things going into that so it's one of the hardest if you will to try to nail to the wall is to exactly what that's going to be. Your point is duly noted. On every cost bucket rest assured as part of our G55 and zero initiative though we've got an eye on being as efficient and productive as we can and we got to include the other expense, but our best linking at this point in time largely driven by some of the unknowns around the state and local tax is in that 10% category.","David Vernon","Okay and then maybe just you guys have done a phenomenal job in terms of managing upper turns and evaluating new business opportunities based on their reinvestability [ph]. As you think about the lower tax rate sort of maybe changing the math on what is investible, what is not investible. Are there any opportunities where you see you might be able to get a little bit more aggressive in terms of driving some volume growth because of a lower tax rate?","Lance Fritz","David this is Lance. The lower tax rate and increased cash flow resulting from it does not change the calculus that we used for the returns that are attractive to our shareholders and for reinvesting in the railroad. So I think the short answer is, just because we have increased cash, it doesn't increase the pool of either projects or markets that are effective to us.","David Vernon","I mean I guess the one area that's come up in a couple of conversations with some industry folks is the West Coast intermodal freight where obviously the US rail industry is going to be getting a little bit of tax reform benefit that maybe the Canadian rails aren't and you've seen a bunch of freight diversion of north. Would that maybe impact some of the routing decision in some of those moves or is that just something you guys wouldn't even consider.","Lance Fritz","Well so those routing decisions right now as we compete for that business right now is all about the service product, the ultimate cost to the end user and which way they want to go, what's most attractive to them. So we compete aggressively for that today. We'll compete aggressively for it tomorrow. In the context of making sure we generate an attractive return outlook.","David Vernon","All right. Thanks for your time.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO. Please proceed with your questions.","Fadi Chamoun","On the drill back into the productivity little bit. I mean looking back on 2017, we had a pretty good kind of revenue environment you achieved $345 million of productivity savings, the OR moved 50 basis points. So we're starting 2018 with 300 basis point to improve into your target. So 2019, if you can just kind of walk us through what is going to get better in 2018 and 2019 in order to kind of move the productivity momentum stronger and to get you to your target of 60.","Lance Fritz","Let me start with that and then I'll let both Rob and maybe Cam add technicolors [ph] appropriate. So Fadi, the game plan really doesn't change as we look forward. The levers continue to be productivity and we've talked about the amount of productivity we think we can get in 2018 and we're just laser focused on delivering that and then moving into 2019 for the same. We see market opportunity for growth and growth is always our friend in terms of leverage and dropping it to the bottom line and then price of course. The thing that gotten away a little bit for even better results from 2017 is that in the second half of the year, the fluidity of the network eroded to a certain degree in some part that's Positive Train Control and the impact of implementing it aggressively across the network you heard those stats. Part of it candidly was just execution in a certain spots around the network that we have all hands on and attention and I'm confident given that we've got the resources and the capacity that will remedy that. So my expectation is 2019, 60 plus or minus operating ratio is still eminently achievable and we have enough in front of us in activity and projects to make it happen.","Rob Knight","Fadi I would just add, don't take anything I'm about to say here as excuses, but just recall notably in the third quarter we did have the hurricane impact, we had the force reduction impact, fuel for the full year was a little bit of headwind, so no excuses but some of those things notably the workforce reduction sizable we'll get the benefits of that more in 2018 where we incurred the cost in 2017 and of course things like the hurricane, which frankly we whether extremely well, those are things that we don't anticipate repeating, other than that it really is just a volume productivity and pricing levers that we're going to continue to pull.","Fadi Chamoun","Okay, thanks that's helpful and just one follow-up on the pricing side. International intermodal you said that market can remain very competitive, would attribute that competitiveness to the Canadian ports and the Canadian kind of railroads being more aggressive on the market. Was it US competition like?","Beth Whited","Fadi, I would say that we see both things being pretty aggressive. It's pretty aggressive coming out as Pacific Southwest in terms of the pricing challenges and it's pretty aggressive coming on Pacific Northwest which is US railroads and Canadian railroads.","Fadi Chamoun","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee","I wanted to come back to the OR for a second just thinking about the fourth quarter and them maybe looking out to 2018. But within the fourth quarter, we know fuel was a headwind but it sounds like ex-fuel kind of OR was flattish. We had positive volume, positive price. Just want to get a sense from a 4Q perspective. If there is anything specific in the quarter going on from a cost standpoint. That you felt like maybe it was maybe a little bit one-time and make sure maybe that's recurring and then as you move into 2018 particularly the first half. I mean did those things kind of, are there other cost item that sort of drop away. Do you think you can get OR improvement in the first half of 2018? Just trying to get a sense of sort of how things are trending today.","Lance Fritz","Hi, Chris I'll let Rob speak to the details of the fourth quarter financials. But just at a high level. I think we would have been generating a better operating ratio and overall results with a more fluid network. Again there is a number of reasons for that, that Rob outlined that we've talked about this morning and there is no reason to think that that is systemic is anyway. That's a completely resolvable issue.","Rob Knight","Lance the only thing I would add and Chris as you know, we are focused on improving our operating gross here in 2018, we're going to stay away from breaking out by quarter or first half versus second half. But [indiscernible] Lance from my perspective there is nothing really unusual, you called out fuel that occurred in the fourth quarter other than our disappointment on the cost side. I mean we frankly admit that there is opportunities and we are very focused on doing better on that and that's the big delta in my mind.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay, all right. And that's helpful. I appreciate it. And then just in the context of sort of pricing and it seems like the industry is getting better pricing gradually in 4Q and then moving forward into 2018 with the potential of the much tighter truck market, how much of your business is sort of available and open for repricing. So how much in other words do you think you can kind of capture what's going on in some of those markets, with contracts that are available to be repriced.","Beth Whited","I think we've given guidance previously that roughly two-thirds of our business is under some sort of one year or longer term at any given point in time and then you have things that are under, everything else will be kind of under tariff and available for pricing and then you know of course you get roll off the one year deal, so.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay, so somewhere in the sort of the third range is kind of what the shot on goal is for 2018, maybe a little bit more than that.","Lance Fritz","No, so listen to what Beth was just saying, at a moment in time a third is available through tariffs overtime the other two-thirds a portion of that, maybe a fair portion of that is in short-term contract. So as they expire they become available for pricing.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison Landry","I guess just following up on the previous question. If we think about the bid season for trucking and assume that TL contract rates are up in the mid-single digits or high single digits during the bid season. Is it fair to assume that UNP would see a step function increase in price in the second half?","Beth Whited","Well as you know, there definitely is a timing of the bid season on the intermodal side in particular and then of course we have other business that's truck competitive as well. so as we go into the bid season in the second quarter, we certainly hope that spot high rates that are happening right now and trucks convert to longer term contract capability, but you're right it won't show up until later in the year.","Allison Landry","Okay, all right. And then I know that pricing is been - dead horse during the call, but I wanted to ask about the coal pressure. I know that you mentioned that the pressure was similar in Q4 to what it was in Q3. But if we think about new contracts signed in the second half of the year, was the pressure the same as it was for contracts signed in the first half of the year or was there some sequential easing that happened.","Beth Whited","I would say that, we're the pressure in the coal markets remains pretty much the same.","Allison Landry","Okay, so from the first half to the second half, it was the same.","Beth Whited","Yes.","Allison Landry","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors from Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions.","Bascome Majors","I wanted to focus on few of the CapEx budget items and how they might trend beyond 2018. Specifically the $460 million or so for locomotive equipment that you said this was the last year of your purchase commitment on locomotives. The 160 for PTC since we're at the tail end of that and the 445 that you allotted the capacity investment which seems to be up almost $200 million year-over-year and I'm assuming that's related to the Brazos project that you talked about earlier, but can you just give us sense for how some of those moving parts might move into 2019 and beyond, it would be helpful. Thanks.","Rob Knight","I'll probably disappoint you, not getting into quite the level of detail that you're asking and let me just start out by reiterating that our guidance for the long-term is 15% of revenue and as I think you and everyone knows, that's not how we build our capital plan, but that still is a good way of thinking about what we're thinking here as to what the overall expenditures will be when you add it all up. Some of the moving parts so that I will call out. Yes, this is the last year's as Cam pointed out, this is last of our long-term commitment on buying locomotives, so we'll take 60 locomotives this year and we don't have plans at this point in time to take any more locomotives beyond that. We will still have some capital expenditures that go into locomotive programs etc. in there. So the number will come down, but it won't go to zero in our locomotive line PTC.","Clearly once that's up and running and behind us that number will change. It will go down to probably not zero in the near term, but it will go down as it has dramatically from where it started and beyond that again, so we just talk about Brazos being an opportunity where we're making an investment because we're confident the returns are there. And that's how we look at all investments, so you're right there is some pieces coming down and other than Brazos we're not saying it's necessarily going to be backfilled dollar for dollar, but our guidance at this point in time to kind of answer your question is still at 15% of revenue look.","Bascome Majors","I appreciate that color there. Just one more question someone earlier mentioned that the training pipeline will have to be filled to start to backfill some attrition based on the growth you expect over the next few years. Where is the TE&Y pipeline today and can you help size us how many hirers you might need to get that pick where you like it to be?","Lance Fritz","Bascome, I don't know we'll give you exact numbers, but I think Cameron can give you a sense for how we're thinking about it.","Cameron Scott","For the attrition that Lance mentioned earlier in the meeting, we have filled the pipeline appropriately to meet that attrition and some of the growth that has been highlighted for the southern region and we feel like that's time to pretty accurately. There will be a few additional hirers filtration in the locomotive and engineering side, but we think we've got that pipeline filled appropriately.","Lance Fritz","The operating team and we haven't received any questions about this morning, but it was a pretty start [ph] number. They've done a tremendous job on the engineering and mechanical side of achieving productivity both in central operations and in our distributed operations that are throughout the network and I anticipate there is even more opportunity there as we look into 2018 and beyond.","Bascome Majors","Great. Thank you for the time this morning.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","Tom Wadewitz","I'll start with one on the cost side. I guess when you talk about inflation I know that probably doesn't map precisely to total operating expense growth, but obviously some broad relationship in the way we model that. you're talking about 2% or less in inflation and on the high side you get the 5% rise depreciation 10% and other expense so, what would be the categories of operating expenses that would be less than 2% and we ought to model at kind of pulling that overall number down to 2% and if I'm thinking about it wrong tell me that, but just want to know where we should model, maybe favorable OpEx items on the P&L. thanks.","Rob Knight","Tom, again I'll probably disappoint in terms of giving you the precise line items that you're asking, but I would just start out by saying, every cost bucket we're looking at opportunities to squeeze out efficiency and manage the cost. You've got your comp line, which again I called out that line overall should be less than 2% on the inflation side of the house. You look at rents I mean that's another category where we're hopeful of continuing to manage that effectively, but just and I know you know this. But just to kind of reiterate, when we less than 2% of course we're talking about inflation, the actual cost that flow through the income statement will largely be driven by what volume we actually enjoy and so volume costs albeit not one for one and all the efficiencies that we expect to squeeze out of that will clearly fill up on the line items as well, but as it relates to inflation. I call out I guess comp and rents of two lines that might be lower than overall average.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay and then, I know this has been a big topic on the call, but just headroom in pricing as well. how do you think about, like I think about the eastern rails is having more sensitivity to truck market so their pricing is kind probably going to move a little bit more close to the related to the rise in truck. How much of your book do you think is pretty sensitive to truck market, how much do you think that can flow through to help pricing. It seems like the truck markets are super, super tight and that it's kind of hard to resolve your cautious comments on price with that really tight truck market. How do we think about how much sensitivity you have to truck, what parts of the book or how much is the book overall?","Beth Whited","We do have several markets that are very truck competitive, intermodal being one of them. Lumber, I think you probably saw the article in the Wall Street Journal yesterday that called out Reefer capability as being very tight right now and we participate in that to obviously lower volume for us, but we do have exposure to that and then of course we serve a lot of bulk markets that aren't as likely to be truck competitive. So when we put all that kind of together in the mixer and we think about what's happening there, we do see that there is a potential for us to have the opportunity to participate with some higher pricing in these markets that are truck competitive. The caution I give you is that, we are continuing to see quite a bit of competitive pressure in big books of business like international intermodal and coal.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay, so you want to put a number around it, like 20%, 30%, 40%.","Beth Whited","Rob will not let me tell you a number.","Rob Knight","Various categories, but we're going to stay clear of giving up precise point on that.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, okay. Thanks for the comments.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Co. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Seidl","Well let me drag the horse out again, guys. Let me look at it at a different way, so obviously you're saying modest sequential decline and what you report as core price or essentially the same as the previous quarter. When you look at the contracts that you've signed this year or maybe late last year would those be above that core rate that you posted in the fourth quarter. so something similar to one of your competitors reported north of the border [ph].","Beth Whited","We really don't talk about individual deals when we do this, we have a very purist mentality about how we calculate price. We are looking at the yields and so one thing you might want to think about is, it really kind of depends on what's going on in your book of business, right. So mix can be very important and the fourth quarter we had the virtually the same price as what we got in the third quarter and we had a lot of changes in that mix of business. So it matters in the way that we calculate price. We still feel good about the pricing that we're getting we're going to take advantage of the opportunities we have as these spot truck rates firm we hope into longer term capability to price there. And as I've mentioned like a few times it feels like a bunch, we still see headwinds in some of our big books international, intermodal and coal being two, I would call out for you.","Jason Seidl","Your description of firming at least intrigues me to some extent because what we're seeing in the marketplace on the spot side is really strong price increases and a lot of people talking about potential contractual increases, somewhere between 6% and 10% on the truckload side. Are you guys seeing something different because I would categorize at a strong rate increases is not firming, if you will.","Lance Fritz","Jason, this is Lance. We would love for the current truck pricing environment to continue all the way through bid season next year as a potential that it does and it's a great environment for us to be out in the market place pursuing business and repricing business. So I think that's probably the sum total of what we want to say about truck pricing.","Jason Seidl","My follow-up is on Mexico, could you talk a little bit about the total exposure in terms of traffic direct from you guys and then maybe any interchange as well as, do you feel that there's been any increase in shipping to and from Mexico ahead of any potential issues with NAFTA.","Lance Fritz","I'll take that Jason. So our Mexico business is about 11%, maybe a little bit more of our overall book. We enjoy about 70% of that business to and from Mexico that's shipped by rail and we've not seen anybody's behaviour in our served markets changing pending NAFTA. Having brought up NAFTA of course we're keeping a very close eye on current negotiations, you know we're in the penultimate negotiation up in Montreal. So they're down to the really difficult parts of the deal that need to be negotiated and while I still believe there is a good opportunity for the NAFTA agreement to be solidified, all three parties continue in it going forward. We've got a strong eye on all the what if's and contingency plans and agility to react to whatever would happen.","Jason Seidl","Okay, that's good color. Listen, everyone I appreciate the time as always.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt Russell with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.","Matt Russell","Just going back to the productivity program and particularly in the context of the current cycle. Is there any trade off here where you think you'll capture less of the volume or the pricing upside and the cycle, just given you have this longer term focus on productivity.","Lance Fritz","I'll take a stab at that. so when we think about productivity we don't view that as a trade-off for price and volume productivity to a fair degree is in our control and things that we are consuming, paying for, organized for, in order to provide an excellent customer service which allows us to price in the market place. So I don't think we see it as a trade-off like that.","Matt Russell","Okay and just to go back to one of your follow-ups to David's question on capital investment. I would think that the return on any project that you were considering on a previous tax reform would previously tax [indiscernible] would improve here tax and cash flow that are low rate, the immediate depreciation. I guess why wouldn't that increase the pool of investments that will be attractive to you and is it just a factor of even after you adjust for those returns, [indiscernible] hurdle rate.","Rob Knight","Matt this is Rob. I would say clearly yes, that's a positive tax reform is a positive in that calculus. What we were saying and Lance addressed earlier is that alone is not going to cause us to, it's not like we have a bunch of pent up capital projects that were sitting on the sidelines just waiting for that extra couple of points have been improving on the ROI and by the way I would remind that we're improving or increasing our capital spend in 2018 versus s2017, so it's all in the mix of things but it's not like to ask opening a floodgate of additional investment that was pent up sitting on the sideline.","Lance Fritz","Matt, but so let's take a step back and take a little broader perspective of this tax reform. We do believe and we hear from our customers and our markets that tax reform fundamentally makes the United States more competitive both for direct investment whether it's foreign direct investment or domestic investment and for competing it with either import goods or for export goods. So from our perspective we believe the tax reform will result in more opportunity for us over the longer term which should result in more opportunity for us to invest and to grow and to hire. But that's the string that we see happening basically it will affect the competitiveness of the markets that we serve and then that will drive incremental investment opportunity and incremental hiring opportunity.","Matt Russell","Makes a lot of sense, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ravi Shanker","Just one straggler here. There's been a change in Canadian grain regulation that potentially allows US rail to maybe access some of that market. Do you see that as an opportunity for you guys?","Beth Whited","The change doesn't impact Union Pacific in particular, we do participate in some of the Canadian grain market that would come across desk from one of the Canadian railroads and go to export, but we don't see that - this change in the regulation materially changing anything for us.","Ravi Shanker","Got it and just a follow-up on the frac sand market. You said the second half of the year is likely to be challenging given the emergence of some local alternatives. What's your game plan there? I think you guys can [indiscernible] to kind of make your business more competitive or help make white sand more competitive versus brown sand to kind of help defer that impact.","Beth Whited","The reason that the brown sand is really emerging is because the logistics cost are so substantial coming from with constant in Minnesota and while there could be fringe markets that you can help make that worse, it doesn't seem like that's solvable by us. However I do think that there are other markets, other shale plays where white sand is desirable that will continue to emerge, so it's not just the Permian there's Eagle Ford, there's the Oklahoma markets are pretty hot you're seeing investment happening in the DJ Basin and Colorado as well.","Lance Fritz","And we're pursuing participation in the local markets to the extent that makes sense as well.","Ravi Shanker","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long","I wanted to ask about incremental margins as the fourth quarter was lighter than what we've typically seen in this type of environment, was there anything outside of the fluidity issues you've mentioned that drove this and as we look into 2018, what's your confidence incremental margins can return to levels that are 50% plus?","Rob Knight","Justin, you're right on I mean as I pointed out earlier. We were not happy with our performance in the fourth quarter on couple of measures and that showed up in the incremental margins, but it was fully explained by some of the fluidity challenges that Lance and Cam addressed earlier. So there is nothing other behind the scenes on that. and as we look to get to our 60 plus or minus by 2019 we've got annually run in 50% to 60% incremental margin range and that's our focus and we understand that and we're confident in our ability to get there.","Justin Long","That's helpful and Lance, you mentioned a couple of times earlier that operating performance did flip in the second half and I wanted to ask if you could address when you think the network can get back to normal fluidity this year and what are the specific action items that are necessary to see this recovery.","Lance Fritz","Yes, I'll just briefly take a stab at that question and ask Cameron to provide more. We won't put date certain on when we think the network is \u201cback to normal\u201d. My expectation is, it happened sooner as opposed to later. This isn't something that I think we wait around and see what happens in the first and second quarter. I mean we're actively working on the handful of issues that we need to address and Cameron maybe you want to talk about those specifics.","Cameron Scott","Velocity at this particular time is so being impacted as we implement PTC in Chicago, in Kansas city and Houston that's really the last series of implementation that we've ahead of us. There are always challenges when we implement and those big network industrialized heavy areas and we'll work out way through this. We're shipping quickly from implementing PTC to problem solving PTC which requires a technical team to continue to problem solve and that really a human design team to help people become more familiar and try to adapt to the technology that we've asked them to use as they're running trains. So we'll continue to work that throughout 2018 and there are really no other critical issues that's impeding velocity other than that.","Lance Fritz","So we've got couple of discrete kind of execution areas that we've got to pick up on but the good news from my perspective is, we got all the resources we need, we got the right team and they're focused on the right stuff. So we - so I expect this to happen sooner not later.","Justin Long","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","First following up on the PTC comments. You said you're going to the big metropolitan areas. Cam, if you can give us a guesstimate last quarter on how much PTC implementation shaved off velocity for the network so that would be helpful. And as you look ahead to beyond 2018 in the next couple of years, what's your early sense of the other rails, interoperability and is that going to be another potential challenge for rolling out this system after the first couple legs going through here now.","Cameron Scott","During the previous earnings call we estimated half of mile an hour to a mile an hour and that still looks like to be a very solid estimate, somewhere in that range. And as we mentioned some of that, as we troubleshoot, problem solve and train our employees will be recovered. You do highlight the challenge for the entire industry which is ahead of us, which is the interoperability, which we've all been working very closely with each other all along. I don't believe there will be any issues with executing that. it is little bit of unknown. We have yet to marry up with BNSF or Norfolk Southern or CN or CP and really run each other's products on each other's railroads that's ahead of us here this year.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay and their specific time on when you start to cross tracks or link up the systems as you mentioned.","Cameron Scott","I'll give you one example that is time certain if you think about Metra. Being a specific Metro in Chicago that cut over with each other is going to be this July.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay, thank you. And Lance just one quick one for you if I could. On just trade flows globally we've seen some news on tariffs being increased but on the flipside we've got a weaker dollar just been down I think 4%, 5% since you last reported earnings. So just what are you hearing from some of the bigger customers, bigger accounts and what's your view on kind of the upside and downside with potentially more tariffs but offset by what could be a continual weaker dollar which will be a pretty nice tailwind for you and for the industry in general.","Lance Fritz","Brian, thanks for that question. There's a lot of moving parts as regards to trade and trade is pretty important to us of course. First we need consumer in the United States to feel optimistic and feel wealthy so that they consume stuff, build homes etc. and that looks like it's set up pretty well as long as the risk and global environment don't kind of overwhelm that optimism. Right now consumers are saying they're pretty optimistic and we see wages starting to increase and they feel pretty wealthy. The second thing that needs to happen is we've got to have open markets and free and fair trade and more open markets is better.","While there is some rhetoric that isn't helpful to that, as we're negotiating NAFTA and as the administration observes other trade relationships as of yet. I've not seen it significantly negatively impact markets that we serve nor in conversations with my counterparts in those markets. Are they saying it's fundamentally changing their behaviour at this point? So there is a lot to pay attention to, now that it's, I think the power of tax reform is it almost can't be overstated to some degree. You think about this, every product produced in the United States that has any kind of supply chain to it, all along the way suppliers build in a 35% tax rate historically that drop in 21% fundamentally alters the landscape for cost of goods sold coming out of the United States and at the same time it makes us very attractive, more attractive for capital investment. All of that is positive for railroads.","And so I think in the net we're cautious and we're deliberate and diligent on all the moving parts, but I think there is a pretty fair chance that it turns out positive as oppose to negative.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay, thanks Lance. Cameron appreciated.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Mehrotra","First one is on the share repurchase, the company committed to 30 million I guess share buyback clip through 2020 back in 2016, you ran a little bit above 20% that rate last year by repurchasing a little more than 36 million shares. Now we have tax reform the share price is up more than 50%, since that target was announced. So just given all those factors moving parts can we assume maybe a bit of a cooling off on the pace of buybacks given those factors and also are you still committed to repurchase your 120 million shares by 2020 from the 2017 date. Thank you.","Rob Knight","Amit this is Rob. We don't straight line our repurchases. It's - we're opportunistic in terms of the pricing and the opportunity and we will continue to operate that way. But I wouldn't take, I wouldn't interrupt anything that we've said or what the benefits of the $1 billion of additional cash flow from the tax to imply that we will slow down the pace of share repurchases I wouldn't look at it that way and we were still working through all the details of that, but we think it gives us a greater opportunity on dividends and share repurchases frankly.","Amit Mehrotra","So the 120 million targets in terms of share, if it's still very much intact maybe even, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but maybe even some upward bias to that, given the inflows and the tax reform.","Rob Knight","I think we're still on track, we're still on track for that.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay, one other quick one for me and I don't mean to nit-pick on the core pricing, but I just wanted to be crystal clear on the movement as you move from 3Q to 4Q. you did talk about rounding and offering kind of that 1.75% number in the fourth quarter down from 2%. I just wanted to see was that 2% rounded. Again I'm not trying to nit-pick here but I just want to be clear, was it 2.00% or 1.8% or 2.05% any color there so we're just - we're on the same page in terms of that.","Rob Knight","Yes fair point, Amit. And as I said earlier, if you recall in the third quarter I said our pricing when you look at what we yield in the third quarter with just under two, then we refined our convention in terms of the routings. So I would say again the story is not the big change from the third to the fourth quarter and it's probably in the 10 or two tenths kind of range in terms of the way the math flew, so it's not a full quarter of point different.","Amit Mehrotra","But the and the mix shifts that impacted, the headline number, I would just imagine would probably accelerate over the next 12 months in terms of the coal intermodal volume. So I know you talked about I guess in response to one of the previous questions that 50% to 60% is obviously the walk to get to your long-term target, but how do incremental margins get to accelerate from kind of back half of the year, when some of the mixed challenges accelerate in 2018.","Cameron Scott","Amit, I don't think we really talked in detail about mixed challenges. What we were referring or trying to refer to is that mix is a significant contributor to what happens sequentially quarter-to-quarter to pricing. And if you look at incremental margin which we only really talk to for purposes of kind of illustrating full year, last year was something like mid-60s. the fourth quarter was something like high 30s, right. So the fourth quarter from our perspective was all about fluidity and some incremental cost like little elevated recruise, some little elevated overtime, little elevated [indiscernible] more equipment than we would need normally all adding up expense that need to be there.","Amit Mehrotra","Got it. Okay. All right that makes sense. Thank you for taking my questions. Have a good day.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your questions.","Ben Hartford","I just to come back to service real quickly Lance and Cameron. When you with clears the economic outlook has improved the truck market is tighter. There were some headwinds across the rail space noted in the back half of the year that presented challenges to service you talked about the PTC. And I think Lance you said you expect improvement for the year sooner rather than later, but what in your mind is the biggest risk to service improvement historically would suggest that it's accelerating volume growth across the rail network and I think that's clearly a bias here as we started the year, but it's also well telegraphed. So is it the macro and if not then what is in your mind the biggest risk to incremental service improvement during the course of 2018.","Lance Fritz","Sure. I'll start and then turn it over to Cameron. I'll call it a service blip that was reflected in our fourth quarter again is not systemic. Historically when we would get into really difficult times, we get behind the resource curve for locomotives TE&Y other labor and it's really hard to catch up in those environments, it takes quite some time given the lead time, the kind of amount of time it takes to get incremental resources back into the network. We're not anywhere near place like that. we've got 800 or 1,000 locomotive stored. We've got a pipeline full of TE&Y that makes sense to us. So it's not that stuffed.","From this point going forward service will be about maybe some weather shocks that's always a possibility and making sure we navigate through Positive Train Control effectively that we're problem solving, things that are getting in the way of us being fluid and doing that rapidly. Cam?","Cameron Scott","To answer your volume question, which is a good one. Northern region looks sound, western region looks very sound. This really about the State of Texas and very positive growth not only this year but the next several years and that is what is Brazos is meant to address. Plus if you looked under the hood of where we're spending our capacity dollars, it is all pointed at Texas. So we have the right capacity projects pointed at growth to take care of the southern region.","Ben Hartford","Okay, that's great. Thank you. And the rather quick follow-up on the other income line item as you looked to 2018, in any direction relative to 2017 on an absolute basis.","Rob Knight","Good question, Ben. Because 2017 was an unusually higher year if you remember the third quarter we had couple of larger transactions Kinder Morgan, Seabrook which we called out. So as we looked to 2018 a normal year is closer to call it $150 million range plus or minus rather than you know call it $300 million that we had this year.","Ben Hartford","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question is from the line of [indiscernible] with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","I just wanted to ask a quick one on network performance. Despite mentioning the transportation plan adjustments and I was just wondering if you could clarify whether that was intended to indicate that adjustments to plan impacted network velocity in Q4 or that you intend to make changes to the plan to improve network velocity.","Lance Fritz","We always take Beth's forecast and drop it into a model and take a look at a couple basic questions surrounding T plan, whether or not we have enough T plan to offload our terminals and we make adjustments as necessary. So we'll be watching that particularly down on the southern region. Again it's not really a western region or northern region exercise it is focused on the southern region.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. That's all from me. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I'll now turn the floor back to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments.","Lance Fritz","Great. Thank you. And thank you all for your questions and interest in Union Pacific.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may begin.","Lance Fritz","Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Jim Vena, our Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning Union Pacific is reporting record 2019 second quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.22 a share. This represents an increase of 4% in net income and 12% in earnings per share compared to 2018.","Our quarterly operating ratio came in at an all-time best mark of 59.6%, a 3.4 percentage point improvement compared to the second quarter of 2018. This is the first time Union Pacific has ever recorded a sub-60% operating ratio for a full quarter. And while that's a remarkable achievement, it's magnified when you consider the challenges we faced from significant flooding that adversely impacted volumes and added incremental operating costs during the quarter. That's a testament to the tireless dedication of the men and women of Union Pacific.","Working with our customers and the communities that we serve, the team safely restored our rail operations while continuing to drive productivity through our G55 + 0 and Unified Plan 2020 efforts. As a result, our operations have returned to normal, enabling us to focus on providing a safe, reliable, and efficient service product for our customers. The Unified Plan 2020 transformation at Union Pacific is full steam ahead, and I continue to be encouraged by the great opportunities we see for our customers and for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it over to Kenny to provide some details on our results.","Kenny Rocker","Thank you, Lance, and good morning. For the second quarter, our volume was down 4% as gains in our Industrial business group were more than offset by declines in Premium and Energy. However, we generate a positive net core pricing of 2.75% in the quarter, as we continue to price our service product to the value it represents in the marketplace while ensuring it generates an appropriate return.","Freight revenue was down 2%, driven by the decrease in volume, partially offset by a 3% improvement in average revenue per car. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each business group. Starting off with ag products: Revenue for the quarter was up 4% on flat volume and a 4% improvement in average revenue per car. Grain carloads were down 7% driven by continued reduction in export grain shipments. This was partially offset by strength in export wheat and domestic corn. Volume for grain products was down 1% as sustained demand for biofuels and related products was more than offset by challenging environment for exports. Fertilizer and sulfur carloads were up 12% due to strength in export potash, diesel exhaust fluid and sulfur.","Moving on to Energy: Revenue was down 13% as volume declined 9%, coupled with a 4% decrease in average revenue per car. Sand carloads were down 50% largely due to the impact of local sand within the Permian Basin. Coal and coke volume was down 7% driven by ongoing headwinds of contract changes and retirement. Flooding in May and June also negatively impacted shipment. In addition, coal exports were lower due to softer market conditions. However, on a positive note, favorable crude oil price spreads drove an increase in crude oil shipment, which was a primary driver for the 30% increase in petroleum, LPG and renewable carloads for the quarter.","Industrial revenue was up 4% on a 2% increase in volume and a 2% improvement in average revenue per car during the quarter. Construction carloads increased 4% primarily driven by strong market demand in the south for rock shipment. Plastics volumes increased 6% due to higher production. Forest products volume decreased 10% driven by reduced paper shipment as a result of high containerboard inventory and decreased lumber shipment associated with lower housing starts.","Turning to Premium: Revenue for the quarter was down 2% with a 5% decrease in volume, while average revenue per car improved by 4%. Domestic intermodal volume declined 11% during the quarter as a softer market coupled with weather-related service issue led to lower volume. Industrial intermodal volume was up 1% in the quarter as volume returned back to seasonal levels following a tariff pull ahead in the previous two quarters. And finally, finished vehicle shipments were up 1% as second quarter U.S. auto sales were down approximately 1% from 2018.","Light truck and SUV sales were stronger and able to offset declining car demand. Looking ahead for the remainder of 2019, for ag products, we anticipate continued strength in biofuel shipment due to the increased market demand for renewable fuels to help offset the headwinds in the ethanol marketplace associated with exports. We also expect stronger beer shipments, along with long-term penetration growth across multiple segments of our food and refrigerated business.","Furthermore, we expect uncertainty to persist in the grain market due to reduced U.S. crop production and foreign tariffs. For Energy, we expect favorable crude oil price spreads to drive positive results for petroleum products. While year-over-year comps for sand ease in the second half of the year, local sand supply will continue to impact volume. We also expect coal to experience continued headwinds throughout 2019, and weather condition will always be a key factor for coal demand.","For Industrial, we anticipate an increase in plastic shipments driven largely by plant expansions coming online later this year, coupled with continued strength in the construction market in Texas. However, we are watching the forest products market as housing starts are forecasted to be down year-over-year in the second half. And lastly, for Premium, the U.S. light vehicle sales forecast for 2019 is 16.8 million units, down about 2% from 2018. However, consumer preference for SUVs over sedans will continue to help offset the declining car demand.","Domestic intermodal volume is expected to be impacted by truck competition in the second half of 2019, which may limit opportunities for over-the-road truck conversions, but longer term fundamentals still provide a bullish outlook for over-the-road conversions. In addition, uncertainty in trade and the economy could create a tough fourth quarter comp due to the pull ahead we saw in late 2018 for international intermodal shipment.","And so before I turn it over to Jim for his operational update, I want to share that I continue to be encouraged how we work collaboratively with the operating team. Jim and I have been making difficult decisions to improve the overall supply chain and aligning our sales with our customers to find the best way to serve and grow with them. In the end, this builds us a solid platform for more reliable service product for our customers.","And now I'll turn it over to Jim.","Jim Vena","Okay. Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Kenny. As you've already heard this morning, our network was once again challenged by significant prolonged flooding in our Mid-America Corridor. We responded by rerouting traffic and deploying additional people and equipment to quickly restore operations. And I am pleased to report that with the weather behind us, including Hurricane Barry, our network has returned to normal operations. I would be remiss not to say how proud I am of our employees who responded to the challenge, working efficiently and without injury to restore operations in the face of some pretty adverse conditions, while delivering an all-time best quarterly operating ratio of 59.6%.","This truly was a remarkable achievement. It all starts for us with safety. As safety remains job one at Union Pacific and our commitment is relentless. We have opportunities to improve our rail equipment incidents, and we're working as a team to learn and improve each and every day. Turning to slide 11. I'd now like to update you on our six key performance indicators. Despite the weather, most of our metrics improved year-over-year. This is a direct result of our relentless focus on improving network efficiency and service reliability as part of Unified Plan 2020.","Continued improvement in asset utilization and fewer car classifications led to a 14% improvement in freight car terminal dwell and a 4% improvement in freight car velocity compared to the second quarter of 2018. Train speed for the second quarter decreased 6% to 23.1 miles per hour as flooding impacted fluidity. Train speeds also were affected by the 30-plus percent increase in daily work events being performed as the part of Unified Plan 2020. While these work events are helping us increase train size and drive asset utilization, the team is still working to execute these work events even more efficiently and drive faster train speeds.","Turning to slide 12: Continuing our trend from the first quarter, locomotive productivity improved 19% versus last year as efforts to use the fleet more efficiently enabled us to park units. As of June 30, we had somewhere around 2,150 locomotives stored. Driven by an 8% decrease in our workforce levels, productivity increased 4% year-over-year. In addition to improving productivity, delivering a great service product is of equal importance to the team. Car trip plan compliance was basically flat year-over-year as the benefit from an increased freight car velocity and lower dwell were offset by the impact of weather on our network. We expect our service product to improve going forward. In fact, we're already seeing improvements in July.","Slide 13: We continue to push forward with Unified Plan 2020, and the slide highlights some of the recent network changes. From a terminal rationalization standpoint, we stopped humping cars at our Proviso yard in Chicago and curtailed yard operations in Salem, Illinois, at our 36th St. Yard in Denver, East Yard in San Antonio. Proviso, in particular, was a very old and inefficient hump yard, still using retarder operators to manually flow cars into the ball tracks.","By moving this work to outlying yards, including one of our most efficient in North Platte, we are not only saving labor dollars but avoiding capital as well. In addition, we have made a number of changes in the Kansas City complex to improve service and increase efficiency. We've largely consolidated traffic out of Armourdale facility while cars previously handled in Des Moines, Iowa are now switched in Kansas City. And our plan to simplify intermodal operations in Chicago is well underway. We idled our Global three facility, and the Canal Street Container Depot will follow shortly.","Going forward, we will continue to look for ways to reduce car touches on our network, which will undoubtedly lead to additional terminal rationalization opportunities. And we are making excellent progress with our train length initiatives as illustrated by the graph on the right. By putting more products on fewer trains, we increased train length 10% since January of this year, and I expect to see continued improvement as the year progresses.","To wrap up, while a number of bold steps have been taken and the results are evident, there are a lot of opportunities ahead of us to further improve safety, asset utilization and network efficiency. Once again, our network showed tremendous resiliency in the face of significant weather during the quarter as we have returned to normal operations. As we move forward, running a safe, reliable and efficient railroad for both our customers and our shareholders is our number one priority.","And with that, Rob, over to you.","Rob Knight","Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Today, we're reporting second quarter earnings per share of $2.22 and 3.4 points of year-over-year improvement in our operating ratio to 59.6%. This represents an all-time best quarterly operating ratio for Union Pacific and is a testament to the great work we are doing with G55 + 0 and Unified Plan 2020. Our quarterly results were, however, affected by some one timers so before I jump into the details, let me give you some technicolor.","Like the first quarter, significant weather events impacted volumes and added operating expenses. These weather challenges resulted in a 0.6 point negative impact to our operating ratio and $0.07 earnings per share compared to the second quarter of 2018. And I'll detail that more in a minute. We also recognized a $32 million payroll tax refund, along with $3 million of associated interest income. This was part of the $78 million refund that we outlined in the 8-K that we filed in March.","The refund had a 0.6 point favorable impact on the operating ratio and $0.04 EPS tailwind in the quarter compared to last year. The combined impact of lower fuel price and our fuel surcharge lag had a favorable impact for the quarter of 0.6 points on the operating ratio and $0.04 of EPS compared to 2018. The good news is that despite the weather challenges and lower volumes, we drove core operating margin improvement of almost 3 points or $0.23 of EPS compared to the second quarter last year.","To give you a little more detail on the weather impact, we attribute about 2 points of the 4 points second quarter volume decline to flooding or roughly $75 million. We also incurred around $19 million of weather-related costs in the quarter, primarily in the compensation and benefits and purchased services and materials cost categories. With all of our routes returned to service, we do not expect any weather-related cost to carry over into the third quarter. And now let's recap our second quarter results.","Operating revenue was $5.6 billion in the quarter, down 1% versus last year. The primary driver was the 4% decrease in volume. Operating expense totaled $3.3 billion, down 7% from 2018. Operating income totaled $2.3 billion, an 8% increase from last year. Below the line, other income was $57 million, an increase of $15 million compared to last year.","Interest expense of $259 million was up 28% compared to the previous year and this reflects the impact of higher total debt balance, partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. Income tax expense increased 14% to $488 million. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 23.7%. For the full-year, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the mid-23% range.","Net income totaled $1.6 billion, up 4% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance decreased 7%, as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. As we noted earlier, these results combined to produce second quarter earnings per share of $2.22 and an all-time best quarterly operating ratio of 59.6%. Freight revenue of $5.2 billion was down 2% versus last year.","Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $399 million, down $13 million, when compared to 2018. Business mix was essentially flat for the second quarter driven by decreased sand volumes and significantly less intermodal shipments. Core price was 2.75% in the second quarter.","Slide 19 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense decreased 8% to $1.1 billion versus 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in total force levels, which were down 8% or about 3,500 FTEs in the second quarter versus last year. Productivity initiatives along with lower volumes resulted in a 5% decrease in our TE&Y workforce, while our management engineering and mechanical workforces together declined 11%.","Fuel expense totaled $560 million, down 13% compared to 2018, due to lower diesel fuel prices and fewer gallons consumed. Average diesel fuel prices decreased 4% versus last year to $2.21 per gallon and our consumption rate improved 5% through the combination of lower volumes and more efficient operations.","Purchased services and material expense was down 9% compared to the second quarter of 2018 at $573 million. The primary drivers of the decrease in the quarter were reduced mechanical repair costs and less contract services and materials, partially offset by weather and derailment-related expenses.","Turning to slide 20. Depreciation expense was $551 million, up 1% compared to 2018. For the full year 2019, we estimate that depreciation expense will be up 1% to 2%. Moving to equipment and other rents. This expense totaled $260 million in the quarter, which is down 2% when compared to 2018. Other expense came in flat versus last year at $247 million. For the full year 2019, we expect other expense to be up around 5% compared to 2018.","Productivity savings yielded from our G55 and Zero initiatives and Unified Plan 2020 totaled approximately $195 million in the quarter, which was partially offset by additional costs associated with weather and derailments. As a result, net productivity for the second quarter was $170 million. It has been a tough first half of the year, but as we exit the quarter, the positive momentum from our productivity initiatives gives us confidence that we will still deliver at least $500 million of net productivity in 2019.","Looking at our cash flow. Cash from operations through the first half totaled $3.9 billion, down slightly compared to last year. Free cash flow before dividends, totaled $2.3 billion, resulting in a free cash flow conversion rate equal to 77% of net income for the first half of 2019.","Taking a look at adjusted debt levels. The all-in adjusted debt balance totaled $27.7 billion at the end of the second quarter, up $2.5 billion since year-end 2018. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times. As we have previously mentioned, our target for debt-to-EBITDA is up to 2.7 times.","Dividend payments for the first half totaled more than $1.2 billion, up $123 million from 2018. This includes the effect of 10% dividend increases in both the third quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of this year. We repurchased a total of 21.9 million shares during the first half of 2019 including 3.7 million shares in the second quarter at a cost of $639 million. Between dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned $5.4 billion to our shareholders in the first half of this year.","Looking out to the remainder of 2019. Although we expect second half volumes to improve sequentially from the first half that improvement will not be enough to produce year-over-year volume growth. In fact, our best thinking at this point is that volume for the second half will be down around 2% or so versus 2018. And as Kenny mentioned earlier, our pricing strategy is unchanged as we continue to price our service product to the value that it represents in the marketplace, while ensuring that it generates an appropriate return.","We remain confident that the dollars we yield from our pricing initiatives will again well exceed our rail inflation cost in 2019. As it relates to our workforce, strong productivity initiatives and to a lesser degree lower volumes have resulted in a 6% year-to-date reduction. Looking out to the balance of 2019, we expect the combination of operating efficiency and lower business levels should result in full year force levels to be down around 10% versus 2018.","Importantly, we are still confident in our ability to achieve a sub-61% operating ratio in 2019 on a full year basis, which implies that our second half operating ratio will be better than the first half. Furthermore, we still expect to be below 60% by 2020. We have to play the hand that we are dealt when it comes to volumes, but rest assured our commitment to achieving our financial targets is unwavering and has never been stronger.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.","Lance Fritz","Thank you, Rob. As discussed today, we delivered record second quarter financial results driven by exceptional operating performance. For the remainder of 2019, we look forward to building on the momentum from Unified Plan 2020 and providing a consistent reliable service product for our customers. As always, we're committed to operating a safe railroad for both our employees and the communities we serve and we remain focused on driving increased shareholder returns by appropriately investing capital on the railroad and returning excess cash to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.","With that, let's open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your questions.","Ken Hoexter","Hey, good morning, and great job on the execution on your UP 2020. Just maybe Jim or Kenny, your thoughts on the lane closures as you shift yards and the impact on volumes as you move into the second half. Is this more an economic call Rob on the volumes? Or is this more lane closures and shifting target on volumes?","Kenny Rocker","Hey, good morning Ken, this is Kenny. First of all it's a very minimal impact and a lot of those volumes that were impacted again were the lower profitable business. The commercial team did a really good job of being proactive in working with customers to make sure that we have solutions in place. So, we feel -- again, it's very minimal and we feel good about the decision to make those calls.","Jim Vena","One thing I would add Kenny is -- what we're trying to do Ken is -- we're not trying to do it we're doing it. We think we build a better product for our customers. We build a better service in Chicago and other places where we're looking at the flow of traffic and it doesn't make sense for us to have six locations that we touch railcars and try to move them around. We consolidated into the minimal spots. We put them in the best place to win and we grow with the customers that are with us to be able to go from L.A. We want to build the best service going across our network. We're close. When we fix these touch points that we have, we end up with the best service that we can provide and we grow with our customers.","Ken Hoexter","And Rob just as a follow-up given your move to keep the sub-61% OR and a better OR in the second half which seems reasonable just given the pace you're at just want to understand the kind of cadence of your employee cuts. Is this something you see accelerating just given the steps Jim is taking on reducing locomotives? Is it spread out on different parts? I guess is it T&E focused or is it kind of more widespread?","Rob Knight","I would say its widespread Ken. And yes, year-to-date as I called out in my remarks, we're down about 6% and we expect the year average to end up around 10%. So, that does imply improvement. And it is widespread and it's really driven largely by the success of the Unified Plan 2020. And we hope at least that we'll have a free -- flood-free zone to be operating in starting today.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Appreciate the time guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long","Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the quarter. So, maybe to focus on productivity, you reiterated the guidance for over $500 million in productivity for this year, but given you're maintaining the OR outlook despite the weakness in volumes and weather it seems like the expected productivity in 2019 is moving higher. Can you just give us a sense for the incremental productivity gains you expect to achieve this year versus your original expectation?","And maybe give us some sense for how you're thinking about the second half relative to the $170 million of net productivity in the second quarter. Just curious do you expect that number to continue trending higher sequentially?","Lance Fritz","Rob, do you want to take that?","Rob Knight","Yes. Justin I would just say that really what it proves out in my mind and you've heard me say this many, many times is that we're not going to use the lack of volume as an excuse not to make aggressive achievements on our productivity. And I think with Jim and his team and the implementation of Unified Plan 2020, I feel stronger about that than I ever have frankly.","And so yes, we are still -- we're sticking with our $500 million at least productivity net number. And that does imply that the second half is stronger than the first half because the first half was burdened with the inefficiency cost related to the flooding and other weather events.","So, the net pace will pick up in the back half and that is our expectation. And it's across the board, but it really is largely driven by the success of the Unified Plan 2020.","Justin Long","And just thinking about that sequential change, do you think third and fourth quarter can look better than what you posted in the second quarter from a net productivity perspective?","Rob Knight","I mean in total yes -- we're going to stay away from giving quarterly guidance on that. But I would say in total if you look at second half versus first half, again, largely because of the overhang of the flood impact cost in the first half, yes, we expect the net number to be stronger in the second half.","Justin Long","Okay. And then I guess finally thinking about productivity into 2020 you maintained the guidance for a sub-60% OR next year. Can you talk about what that assumes for productivity even if it's just from a high level? Does that assume that the productivity dollars next year are higher than what we're going to see in 2019?","Lance Fritz","Hey Justin we haven't yet put together a game plan for 2020, but you're right, we're holding firm on our guidance for overall OR. And I'll let Rob speak to the details of that.","Rob Knight","Yes. Justin I would say Lance is right. We don't have the final numbers on that. But I would tell you that the levers that we pull will be the same levers they always are and that is volume which we haven't finalized our outlook in terms of volume; quality reliable service that we're confident we are improving that product which enables us to continue to get appropriate price in the marketplace.","And we're in the sort of still early innings by my definition of the Unified Plan 2020. So, clearly there is more productivity dollars that we will be going after to achieve that sub-60% next year.","Justin Long","Okay, great. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the time.","Lance Fritz","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks. So, Rob, I just want to just quickly clarify. The 10% head count that's an average or year-end? I'm not sure.","Rob Knight","That's an average of 10% reduction year-over-year.","Scott Group","Okay. Kenny, on the pricing side so with the moving pieces here the volume environment maybe, I don't know if anything's changed with BNSF just directionally is the pricing environment getting any tougher as you see it? And then I know mix is sort of an impossible one to forecast but such a dramatic change from minus 4% in the first to flat in the second. Any directional at all sort of color or idea on how we should think about second half?","Kenny Rocker","Yes. You asked a number of questions there. I'll take a few here. First of all, we're focused on our pricing strategy. We've got a number of competitive forces out there beyond just the competitor in the West. There's barge and there's trucks. I'm really proud of our commercial team and their ability to just stay very focused on pricing to the service product that we have and the value we present.","I'll tell you that I'm also looking forward to getting this weather behind us because I expect that our service product as it improves is going to give us an ability to compete in the marketplace. So, I like our chances as our service product improves to stick with our pricing strategy and price to the market.","Lance Fritz","Scott I'll address your mix question. You know we don't guide the mix because it's very hard to figure out as we just demonstrated Q1 to Q2 and there's mix within mix as Rob says all the time.","So, bottom-line is when you look backwards what happened between Q1 and Q2 was about a large drop in intermodal that aided mix. And as you look forward, we'll just have to see what the markets present to us.","Scott Group","Okay. Thanks. And Rob if I can just ask you one more quick one. So, the other railway revenue was sort of flattish year-over-year down a little sequentially, any thoughts on how to think about that in the back half?","Rob Knight","Yes. Nothing I would call out that's going to change the pace of that at this point.","Scott Group","Thank you guys. Appreciate the time.","Lance Fritz","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee","Hey thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask you about the head count. And so some significant improvement on head count and certainly for productivity. I was wondering if maybe you could help us sort of understand if there's a piece of that that's sort of reaction to weaker-than-expected volume and sort of what piece of it that's sort of more of a sustainable run rate. And presumably at some point as we move into 2020, I'm guessing you guys are assuming sort of a better more stable potentially growth volume environment.","So, I would imagine you wouldn't cut heads beyond what you think you can kind of manage that, but if you could give us some sense of what you're doing that's going to catch up because the volume environment's been soft. And really what's kind of core to the bigger-picture plan?","Lance Fritz","Yeah. Chris, you've got it just right. When volumes get softer, we know how to adjust our resources to match what volume represents. But I would have to say, the lion's share of what you saw was about Unified Plan 2020 and productivity. And you can see that kind of across the board. We had to adjust the amount of resources we put at locomotives as we parked about a quarter of the locomotive fleet if not more. And you can see that directly related to the headcount, to the manpower that we have attached to maintaining locomotives. The same is true on maintaining cars. The same is true on the TE&Y workforce. We've taken a lot of work out of the network and it's being reflected now on our manpower. And we've got \u2013 there are more of those adjustments to be made as the network continues to stabilize and as we continue to find opportunity.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate that. And maybe just a broad question, Kenny about sort of the demand environment. So, clearly softness in volume \u2013 some of it might be some lean dynamics where it sounds like it's relatively minimal on your network. When you think about sort of what you're hearing from the customer environments why has it been so sluggish over the course of maybe the last four, five, six weeks?","Kenny Rocker","Yeah. So I'd tell you, we are seeing some softness in the truck environment. Clearly, trade is impacting some of our ag business and we'll continue to look at other pieces of the business in the second half. I'd tell you at the same time, I am feeling bullish about our franchise. We've got a lot of upside with our petrochem business, our industrial chem and plastics, our construction product. And I'm feeling really good about our crude oil business. So we'll see what happens in the second half. And like I said as our service improves, I like our chances to compete in the marketplace.","Chris Wetherbee","Got it. That's helpful. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to go back to price for a second. I don't think you really showed too much leverage to the tighter truck market in 2018, when you calculate, it differently. So there's a 2.75% price still on the core side. Is that really sort of a lag basis from what we saw in the truck market and things are getting re-priced and showing up now? Hence I guess, the formulary would be, if you think the truck market is going to soften a little bit more can you maintain that level of coal price or something pretty close to it through the rest of this year and into 2020?","Lance Fritz","Hey, Brian, this is Lance. I'll let Kenny or Rob speak to more of the detail. But when you mentioned, we calculate our price on a holistic basis that is the absolute dollars yielded during the period divided by all revenue. So in the second quarter 2.75% that's pretty solid performance in a relatively soft truck market and there is an impact in terms of what moves as to what gets counted as yield, right? I mean, you can take a price action last year on a book of business and if it doesn't move this year you get no credit for it. That's how we calculate our price. So there's a price\/volume impact in there that is very hard to tease out.","Kenny Rocker","The only thing I'll add is that, we'll see what happens in the second half. It doesn't change our pricing philosophy or our approach to be disciplined here. Maybe it means a couple few more opportunities. But regardless the opportunities that we're presented, we're going to be very disciplined about what business we accept and compete for.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. Thank you for that. And then Kenny one more for you to follow-up on coal. We've seen a lot of headlines there recently a couple of bankruptcies a big push for large-scale consolidations. So I just wanted to get your thoughts. It's been challenging for a while, but this seems like it's another step change. Just want to get your thoughts on how you adjust for that for the commercial side both in the short-term and long-term. Do you need to change how you price maybe more to natural gas try to push more exports? And then Jim, if I could get you to comment on the operating side, I think the network did a really good job of adjusting for the fallout in frac sand but this is clearly a bigger chunk of the business. It's probably got a longer and potential tail downward than some of the secular challenges.","Kenny Rocker","Yeah. So we've been living in a coal environment for some time, so this is not a surprise or anything new to us. It doesn't change our approach to ensuring that we compete and win the business at the appropriate return for us. We're going to stay committed to that. I will say that as you hear about some of these bankruptcies or closures it doesn't take away from the fact that another producer or shipper up in that area might be able to move that volume. So you got to keep that in mind as you're thinking about that.","Jim Vena","So, Brian the only thing I'd add is this is a railroad and as long as I have and the gray hair I have markets go up markets go down pieces of the business go up and down. If you're a good operator, good company you know how to react to it. We've reacted by making sure that we don't get ahead. We plan properly with our assets. We make them as efficiently as possible. We're making the coal train, specifically more efficient so that we can have a better return on the product that we're moving, and that's what's it's all about. We have to react fast. And in other places where we see increasing business, we have to put assets in there to do that in a smart way. So it's as simple as that, Brian.","Lance Fritz","Hey, Brian, one last \u2013 this is Lance. One last thing to note and that is thinking about this market holistically long-term, we've talked about this that coal has been challenged in kind of a secular decline. You see that in cold unit closures. You see it in investment in alternative sources of energy. And we'll \u2013 we've got a game plan for that in the long term at \u2013 and over time, we also care deeply about making sure that there are good healthy capitalized coal producers to serve the market. They exist today, and I know they're working hard to make sure that their future is solid and we just support them as they do that.","Brian Ossenbeck","All right. Thanks for the thoughts.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Mehrotra","Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. Jim, I was just hoping you could talk about the additional and maybe structural cost opportunity. For example, where is the active locomotive fleet today? Where do you think you could go? What's the target for car velocity against the 200 miles per day you're doing \u2013 you're achieving today, opportunity for system-wide train length? Anything else that just gives us a sense of where you think the further opportunity is on the structural cost side relative to the improvements \u2013 the significant improvements you guys have made to-date? Thanks.","Jim Vena","Appreciate it. Listen, you just don't list it. And I think there's opportunity in car velocity, there's opportunity in the locomotives, there are opportunity on terminals, there are opportunities on how we handle our trains, how we \u2013 how many touch points we have on cars. So I think like Rob said in the prepared notes, we're early in this. We've got lots of long runway to go, and many innings left to be able to deliver Amit.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. I wasn't going to ask you what inning you're in but thanks for adding that anyways.","Jim Vena","I do as soon as I've said that. Somebody was going to ask me what is. Appreciate it. Thanks.","Amit Mehrotra","But you kind of teed up my follow-up question with respect to how all that translates to the OR. And given your early innings into all this, I would just expect your OR targets at this point when you've got six months of very strong operating performance in a tough environment to be frankly more ambitious, because there's another rail out there that has much lower revenue per carload but significantly better OR. It, obviously, takes time. So this is not a critique by any ways but I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on what the structural profitability potential is for the business based on both your longer tenure at the company and then also what other industry peers are being able to achieve? Thanks.","Lance Fritz","Rob, would you take that for us?","Rob Knight","Yeah. I'll make -- I'll comment on that. And Jim if you wish to contribute, obviously, you can. I mean, I would say you've heard me say this, I have never felt better about our ability to achieve the targets we've set because of what you're outlining and because of what Jim and the team were doing with Unified Plan 2020 and that is we're going to get through as sub as we can, 61% this year and then as sub as we can next year of 60% and ultimately to that 55%. So everything you're asking about we agree that there are opportunities in there.","And that's -- when you add it all up that's what's going to drive us to that 55%. And I get the criticism I'll wear it that we haven't put a date out there yet on 55%. But our philosophy and our goal and our drive here at Union Pacific is to get to that sub as we can 60% first and then not stop there by any means but continue to drive towards that 55%.","Jim Vena","The only thing I'll add is I like to just deliver the number and then we'll talk about it like we delivered a 59.6%. I like that number and there's opportunity there. And we'll continue to deliver. I'll let Rob worry about how we appraise the number, okay?","Amit Mehrotra","And just to be clear it wasn't a criticism. I think we all respect and appreciate how hard it is to deliver the results you achieved. But I just wanted to I guess ask the question because I had to but I appreciate it. Thank you.","Rob Knight","I got the whole question. I understood a bit.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison Landry","Thanks. Good morning. Maybe if I could ask that OR question in a slightly different way. Jim, as you just said you're at a sub-60% already. I realize that's just a one quarter number but it was a difficult quarter. You have a lot of momentum going forward. So I wanted to get your thoughts on the feasibility of getting to that sub-60% by 2019. And specifically what would need to go right for that to happen? Would volumes have to come in better than the down 2%? Any help framing that scenario would be great.","Jim Vena","I think the best way to frame the operating ratio number is it's a result of a lot of hard work, okay? So I'm very comfortable with what we've been able to do. I've been here six months and four days. And the whole team we've worked hard at train length, car productivity, freight, how fast we move the cars, the locomotive engineers, how well they're handling for fuel conservation. We're making sure that the mechanical people, how many people we need, how well they're inspecting the cars. It's a full story.","And it's -- this whole company is engaged in making it the best most efficient railroad in North America. That's what we want. I'm not sure the time line exactly, because I'm not sure what's going to happen. We had a hurricane last week yet a small one not a category three or four or five, but we had a hurricane effect us. So I can't tell you Allison. I wish I could.","But what I'm comfortable with is we have the right team. People are out there from the -- everybody in the company knows what we're trying to do, give a better product to our customers, grow our business and have the most efficient railroad in North America. That's what's it's all about, simple as that.","Allison Landry","Okay. I appreciate that. Lance I think maybe a month ago or so in the media you had said that you guys were taking share from BN as a result of the success of our -- the United -- the Unified Plan. Could you put some maybe numbers around that in terms of volumes or share gain? And maybe give us a sense, of which end markets that you're seeing these share gains? Thank you.","Lance Fritz","Allison thanks for the question. Yeah, if you look at the first half, I would say our growth is moderately better than our primary competitors. That can come from a lot of different angles. It could have to do with how their network is operating versus ours. I would say one such point for sure is our franchise is different. And we think better, we think it's the best franchise in the industry.","What we would anticipate and expect as we look forward is Unified Plan 2020 creates a more consistent, reliable service product for our customers. We're a more efficient service provider. That should set us up to win in the marketplace and to have our customers win in their marketplace. And I anticipate regardless of the economy that we face that gives us the best opportunity in that economy to win and grow. I don't -- I'm not sure exactly what that looks like. I'm not sure what that looks like in comparison to BN or anyone else but that's what we're trying to achieve.","Allison Landry","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz","Yeah, good morning. Jim, I've got a couple for you. I wanted to see -- I appreciate the detail and the framework on what you're doing with yards and terminals. I wanted to see if you could take a step back and just give us a sense of what you started with and where you're at today, and then maybe give us a comment on broad-brush what you might get to. So just hump yards in January and maybe what you're at today. And then rail terminal, how many you had, how many you're at today, just to kind of frame it.","And then I guess just a sense of how far do you have to go. Can you go from your 12 went to 10? Can you go to five or six? Or how we might think -- how you might frame that and how we might think about it on yard rationalization?","Jim Vena","Okay. So when I look at the hump yards, I don't look at them because they're -- I've mentioned this before and people have heard me say this countless times they're very efficient when they handle a lot of cars and we need to have them there. You could figure out a way and then not put a car through a hump yard and save 24 hours on the car that's what it's all about any yard. So that's what -- that's the way we're looking at it.","Right now we have one hump yard complex left in our Northern region. Our Northern region is a pretty big piece of railroad and it's at North Platte. That's it. And we have a non-mechanized switching yard that we classify it as a major yard but it doesn't have all the mechanization in California -- Northern California in Rolesville.","But that's it that's what we have. So it's pretty hard to cut. I think North Platte is going to be there for a long time. We're asking it to work harder though. We're putting more railcars in there. And the cars they have they have to do them efficiently and we move them out. They are setting records today on how fast they're able to switch cars and get them through that complex. And I expect that to improve substantially. We've got some smart people out that are able to do that.","So that's the way I look at it. I'm not sure what the heck we had. I'd be guessing on the number. I don't keep it that way. We have complexes that we need. Houston is a growth area. We expect that hump to be efficient and stay there. So it's all about being able to move the cars quicker.","On the intermodal if I could be real quick, Kenny and I are aligned. In fact, we have a plan of where we're moving and we'll do that. We'll announce it as we come ahead when we need to. It's all about again giving a better product to the customer, able to handle their containers in and out in trailers faster, so that they have a better market, and we can grow. And we can compete against trucks take some of that traffic off of the highway and compete against the other railroad that we compete against head-to-head and see if we can win. And I think we will. So that's where we are. That's the best I can describe now.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay. So it sounds like you've done a lot already with hump rationalization or at least in the North, so we shouldn't necessarily expect a lot more of that going forward. But the intermodal terminals you still have room to go. Maybe on a different element of the operation the train length expansion of -- I think you show about 10% June versus January. It's a pretty impressive number 7,700 feet on average. How much runway is there on that? Are you constrained at this point from a sighting perspective? Or could that number continue to rise a bit further?","Jim Vena","Look, all I can tell you is we're not constrained. We'll invest in places where we're constrained. We did that on the route coming out of L.A. going towards El Paso closing some gap. So we announced that three months ago. We're just about completed with that. It will help us. There's a little bit of investment, I guess, little against the $3.2 billion that we have, but we'll continue to invest to do that. Yes, train size will grow, no if ands or buts. It will grow across the whole network.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay. Great. Thanks for the time.","Jim Vena","Yeah.","Lance Fritz ","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Walter Spracklin","Yeah, thanks very much. I guess the first one here is for Rob. I mean, I know you mentioned this coming back to the OR here, I know you mentioned that you haven't put in your plans for 2020, but you effectively got a guidance for 100 basis point improvement given the guidance you have for 2019 and 2020. I guess we're all looking at you possibly getting to your 2020 target by 2019. And obviously, keeping 60% in place for 2020 because that's your guidance, wouldn't be the right thing. So, I guess, what I'm asking is if we're starting with the 100 basis point improvement as our base assumption in 2020 versus 2019 as you get your numbers together, what factors will you be using to determine whether that's to -- is that too low or too high? And perhaps I know Jim try to chime in, but the track -- the success you've been having so far today, correct me if I'm wrong, but it could amplify that 100 basis point improvement in 2020?","Rob Knight","Yeah, Walter. First of all, I would say, we are not guiding to just one point of improvement. Again, kind of back to my commentary of we're going to get a sub-61% this year as we can and then as sub as we can on the 60%. So, yes, I get that the 61% to 60% is one point, but we're going to try and do as best we can to achieve as much success beyond that one point as we can. That's the sub comment.","But the factors, it all kind of starts with our read of -- as we look to 2020 when we get to that point our read of what the economy is, and what do we think volume is going to be. And as we continue to drive it, as you've heard me say, many times as we continue to drive and improve our service reliability that gives us confidence to continue to be aggressive and achieve core pricing gains, which is going to be a lever.","And then the balance of the ability to squeeze out and make margin improvement is going to be wrapped up in our Unified Plan 2020 of which, I mean, I don't think you can hear more confidence from the team here in terms of our ability to continue to drive efficient operations and drive productivity dollars, which will fall to the margin.","Walter Spracklin","Okay. That makes sense. My second question is more kind of high level Jim. You've seen precision schedule railroading implemented a couple of times either directly or from a distance. And each time it's led to a fairly significant service disruption, which once gotten through, it becomes a weapon and a tool to improve service, but there's always that initial phase of service disruption. I'm hearing from Lance and perhaps I'll let you chime in, you're looking to do it this time without having that service disruption. What is going to happen? I mean, 10% workforce reduction, these kind of things lead me to believe that the customer is going to be affected. Can you help me get comfort that the comfort -- that the customer is not going to be affected with this time in terms of this movement to PSR?","Jim Vena","So it's a \u2013 Walter, the history, you're correct. So let's not rewrite history. It's -- that's the way -- there was a lot of noise. I was involved with some of it and there was some noise. What we're doing here is we're trying to keep the noise down as much as possible being real smart about how we do it.","Listen, I had a plan the first day I showed up. We wanted to park 500 locomotives. I didn't park 500 locomotives per state. I said let's work through this in a systematic way. We make it more efficient. We look at the touch points. We see where we are.","I had a plan with Proviso from when I used to work at another company CN, okay? In Chicago, I went to visit Proviso. I didn't like that yard when I was on the other side. So it was going to happen, but we did it at the right time, right place and that's what it's all about, Walter. We're trying to do this in a systematic manner instead of holding it up and seeing what you can put together after all the pieces.","So, hopefully we keep the noise as much. But Kenny knows, there's going to be some noise, and we talked about it. But I'll tell you what I give Kenny and the whole team a lot of credit. We're being proactive. We're getting out in front of it. We tell the customer what we're doing. We tell them what -- when we made the changes in accessorials, we told them. We gave them a chance to change their processes instead of just putting them in place. We're doing that specifically to try to keep them in. We understand how important the customer is to us. That's what drives our whole business model. So that's the way we're doing it, Walter.","Walter Spracklin","Awesome. Makes a lot of sense. Thanks very much guys.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.","Jordan Alliger","Yeah. Hi, morning. Yeah, I just had a quick follow-up to the extent you can answer on the -- what you're doing in the intermodal complex in Chicago to improve the throughput and speed. Any sense that you could put on the timing of it, a little more specifically? Just curious because obviously the intermodal volumes of likely domestically have been on the softer side. I'm just wondering once that gets into place this is the second part of the question, is that when you could really start to more aggressively market the product? Would that be the plan? So that's why I'm curious about the timing of the whole complex improvement.","Lance Fritz ","Yeah. So Jordan I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Kenny and Jim to fill in more detail. So I think what you're referring to is really two different things that are occurring in Chicago: one, Jim mentioned earlier and that is consolidating and specializing our intermodal ramps. So, G3 focused on international intermodal, G2 focused on domestic intermodal and Yard Center focused on some specialty niches.","That work is under way. G4 is -- or excuse me, I'm sorry, G4 focused on international. G3 has already been consolidated or is in the process into G4. G2 is in the process of being invested and also growing. So that's kind of an operational focus and that's a clear benefit to our customers. It simplifies the drayage equation and it provides a more consistent reliable service product.","Second thing that's happened in Chicago is, we've rationalized service lanes in interchange with our interchange partners, both CSX and the NS at a high level and that's providing a more effective service product that's an interline service product. So the interchange happens more reliably, quicker. And you don't dwell boxes around ramps as long as you used to. So I'll let Kenny and Jim talk to how that impacts our customer base; what it looks like going forward.","Kenny Rocker","Yes. And the only other thing I'll add is that, we have proactively worked with our customers to get the dwell down on our intermodal ramps at the destination. I mentioned this earlier, about 15 hours. So all of those three things of reduced complexity, the interline changes and the dwell has improved.","But I'll tell you, we have worked with our customers. They are starting to see the benefit. We're looking at the service metrics and they are turning around. We have one of our -- group of our larger customers in and we've been talking to them. And they've expressed a very positive tone with this. So we feel very encouraged moving forward.","Jim Vena","Last thing I would add is this. We want to look at our product, especially intermodal. We're talking intermodal end to end. So it's all about when the ship arrives at the port, how well we're able to move the containers out of the port, terminal that's international and how fast we can get it consistently to the customer so that they can use it.","I think we build that model end to end. We're able to compete against everybody on the West Coast and on the South Coast to see what we can do to increase the business, because of the model we have, the facilities we have, we turn them quick. So I'm really excited. I think we're going to build a model that is as good or better than anybody out there in the marketplace.","Jordan Alliger","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Vernon with AllianceBernstein. Please proceed with your question.","David Vernon","Hey, good morning, guys. Kenny, could you give us a little bit more color on the down 2% volume? Should we sort of expecting the same variation across the product groups? Or is there any sort of additional insight you can give us into which traffic categories are going to -- what the trends by traffic category?","Kenny Rocker","Yes. I mentioned the things earlier. We're going to just look at the trucking market here and see what happens. There still seems to be a lot of capacity out there. We can't control the foreign trade policy and we'll look at that. We talked about the comp getting better in our sand network, but we expect that to deteriorate a little bit more.","But, again, having said all of that, the fact that our service will be improving, I like our chances to compete with truck more. The fact that we've reduced a lot of complexity out of our supply chain, gives us an opportunity to compete more. And we'll see what happens, but I like our chances.","David Vernon","Okay. So, it's a little bit weaker in Premium and Energy, continuing to kind of be the weakest segment.","Kenny Rocker","That's correct. Yes, that's right.","David Vernon","Hey, Rob, just as a follow-up. I know you guys -- we talked a lot about margins and stuff like that, but if we look at the -- sort of the back half of the year, I think, consensus is expecting 11% EBIT growth. Given the 2% down volume, obviously, productivity is a little bit better in the back half of the year. Yes.","Are you comfortable with an expectation of sort of like a 10% growth in EBIT line, just based on what you know right now with the down volume? It's really tough from the outside in to get the incremental and decremental, right? And, obviously, with the PSR thing happening at the same time, it's really confusing. I'm just trying to help our clients understand, kind of, what that trajectory and earnings growth should be, as opposed to just looking at the OR.","Rob Knight","No, I get it, David, and I'll disappoint you in that we aren't going to give earnings guidance, as we don't. So, I mean, we're going to do as good as we can. And I think that you've heard us talk about the confidence that we have in driving margin improvement and how that turns out in terms of the earnings. We'll be as aggressive and hopefully as successful as we can. But I'm going to stay away from giving any earnings guidance.","David Vernon","All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ravi Shanker","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just looking at the kind of head count cuts in the back half of the year, can you just help us understand, if this was kind of always part of the PSR plan? Or are you being more opportunistic given a softer volume environment to kind of make more cuts here while you can?","Lance Fritz","Yes. I'll start with that. The short answer, Ravi, is we've always anticipated that labor would be a fairly large portion of our productivity savings for the year, which we've highlighted as plus $500 million net. So that's always been part of the expectation. If we do less work, we size the workforce for that less work.","Rob Knight","But, yes, Ravi, I would add to that, that's the driver, that's the key drivers, is our confidence of the Unified Plan 2020. But given the fact that we have eyes on as best as we can at this point of the volume numbers that we gave for the back half, that we take that into consideration as well.","Ravi Shanker","Understood. And just a follow-up. The Canadian rails have been really bullish on the international intermodal opportunity for the last couple of years and then going forward. Some of that kind of insinuates kind of some share shift from the U.S. ports, the Canadian ports. Can you just talk about what you guys are seeing on the international intermodal side? And kind of do you see that as a secular shift in the industry?","Lance Fritz","Kenny, can you take that?","Kenny Rocker","Yes. We have seen over the last few years a little bit of share shift versus the West Coast. I'll tell you that, if you look at the weather issues that we faced, coming out of the couple of quarters of pent-up demand, we still feel pretty good about the fact that our international intermodal volume was up 1%. As we get back to a more stable economy, again, we still feel good about our opportunity to compete and grow that international intermodal business.","Ravi Shanker","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ben Hartford","Hi. Thanks for the time here. Kenny, just wanted to follow up on the back half volume outlook. Just to clarify, in terms of how you guys are thinking about the cadence through the back half of the year. Do you expect it to return to a more normal seasonal volume cadence through year-end?","And maybe in that same vein, what are you hearing as it relates to IMO 2020 plans from shippers, particularly in the international intermodal side? Any plans to pull forward ahead of that? And how do you think about the impacts there for a petro-chem product perspective? Thanks.","Kenny Rocker","Yes. So a couple of questions there. First I'll just say that, the things and some of the challenges will be what they are. We'll see what happens with the domestic trucking market. We'll see what happens with trade. We still feel very good, again, about the construction business that we have, the crude oil that we have. And the plastics business, we expect that to continue to grow.","Everything that Jim is doing on the operating side, again allows us to compete. It allows us to get after rail-centric business that we lost during the floods, which allows us to increase a lot of the truck-centric business moving forward. So we feel positive about that.","In terms of IMO 2020, we spent a lot of time with our international intermodal customers and we don't see anything significantly changing. We don't see anything from a pull ahead perspective changes. We don't see anything changing from a supply chain perspective, meaning that they might preference the Western port over an Eastern port. So, we haven't seen that. We've been talking to our customers all along the whole time. And right now, you shouldn't expect anything structural from what we're hearing.","Ben Hartford","Okay. Thanks. And a quick follow-up. Jim, could you just provide a little bit of perspective on the changes in Chicago the reduction in ramps? It sounds like there's more to come as it relates to intermodal from a service standpoint. But when you think about that change, how pleased have you been? Do you expect any further changes around the Chicago area to be able to accomplish what you're alluding to on the intermodal side?","Jim Vena","Listen, pretty straightforward. We've announced the changes that we're going to make there. I think that changes sets us up to have a great product within Chicago service that whole area and be able to stretch ourselves from Chicago to other markets. So, we're not changing anything. The time line is good. People are on board. Kenny has done a good job of explaining it to the customers. So, you'll see us make the change as we move forward. Some of the changes will take us a little bit longer five, six months to get them in place to be able to do that or up to a year, but we've got the plan there as we do in other places.","Ben Hartford","Thank you.","Jim Vena","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Bascome Majors","Hey Jim, we're seeing a lot of your efficiency metrics really start to move higher, particularly on the locomotive productivity in train linked departments. But the customer-facing metric your long-time performance versus your trip plan actually failed year-over-year, remains in the low 60% range. And what's probably pretty cost critical in workforce productivity feels like it's lagging a bit as well. In your prepared remarks, you said, car trip compliance had improved in July. Could you expand on that and speak to a sequential place of progress here with the weather behind you? And on both customer facing and the workforce productivity front, when might we start to see more stair step-like improvement? And what's going to drive that? Thank you.","Jim Vena","Son of a gun. You're tough Bascome, okay? You hold me that, but I love the question. I appreciate it. So, if we take a look at workforce, it's -- we adjust for the work that we have to do and we've made some quick adjustments. And I think, we've done a good job of being smart about how we do it and you'll continue to see that. Rob has given the numbers of where we expect to be. I'm not going to add anything there. I don't need to add anything there.","And as far as the productivity metrics in general, all of them, we think there's opportunity on them and we will continue to be productive in every one. We are touching. So, if you start with a car, how fast it moves for the customer and the weather had a big impact on us. So, what we did was, we didn't adjust the number. The number came in the way the number came in. We've got hit for the weather and we parked cars. We didn't make it to the customer. But, now that we're out of that, we've seen it's substantial. It's at least 10% higher our improvement and we'll continue to do that. We know we have to deliver a great product for our customers to be able to grow this and have been in the long term an efficient railroad and a great product for our customers. That's what it's all about Bascome. That's what we're trying to do.","Lance Fritz","Bascome, so the moving parts on that service product, it's a mixed bag in the second quarter. Freight car velocity is a direct impact on customer experience, right? They're getting their cars more frequently from origin. Embedded in that, is terminal dwell. That's a direct impact. First OS launching on time has a direct impact. That car trip plan compliance that's a very specific holistic number that says from the time, the car was tendered to us that we do exactly that plan that day.","And things like flooding made us use alternative routes and switch in different places. So, once we get a network that's smooth and steady and normal, we see the kind of thing that Jim is talking about which is a pretty quick snap back. It's a lagging indicator, but it is an indicator. And we expect that to go like the other service indicators are going. It just might take a little longer.","Kenny Rocker","I can tell you just real quickly. We're sitting out with customers each week. And we're seeing an improvement. So, I want to give Jim and Lance and the team a pat on the back. We didn't talk about first mile, last mile, which we're also seeing a pretty significant jump in also and as a very tangible metric to customers. So, I -- we're expecting that to get better as we move along.","Bascome Majors","It's great to hear about the substantial progress with the flooding behind you here. Rob any -- are we going to get an update from you guys on the long-term outlook next spring or summer like you normally do in the last year of a long-term plan? Any guidance on when that might happen? Thanks.","Rob Knight","No. Stay tuned. We'll always update. As we said earlier on the call here, we'll be putting together our 2020 plans more firmly as -- between now and then and stay tuned.","Bascome Majors","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thanks very much and good morning. It's been a long call, so I'll just stick to one question and that is, you sound fairly confident that we're starting to move through the overhang associated with inventory pull forward in advance of tariff. So, I just wonder if you could elaborate on what you're hearing from customers or seeing in your carloads that influence that confidence.","Kenny Rocker","Yes, I'll take that. First of all, what we're hearing one thing that's good is that, we are hearing that we're going to get a normal peak season volume here. So that lets us know that, a lot of the noise that we saw with the pull ahead is over. Again, we know what the domestic market is like. The only outlier that's out there from a trade perspective that probably impacts us is really just on the ag side and we talked about the soybean market. So, it really becomes a timing issue and we'll see what happens.","Cherilyn Radbourne","That's helpful. Thank you.","Kenny Rocker","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments.","Lance Fritz","All right. Thanks Rob, and thank you all for your questions. To wrap it up, I want to again acknowledge the tenacity and the determination of Union Pacific's workforce. Hats off to them for producing great financial results in a pretty challenging quarter. And with that, we look forward to talking to you again in October.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may now begin.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thank you and good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me here today in Omaha are Beth Whited, our Chief Operating Officer (sic) [Chief Marketing Officer] (00:40); Cameron Scott, the Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, Chief Financial Officer.","This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.3 billion for the first quarter of 2018, for a first quarter record $1. 68 per share. This represents an increase of 22% and 27%, respectively, when compared to 2017.","Total volume increased 2% in the quarter compared to 2017. Energy carloads increased 6%, primarily driven by frac sand shipments, while Industrial and premium volume both increased 2%. Partially offsetting the volume increase was a decline in Agricultural Products, driven primarily by lower grain carloadings. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 64. 6%, which improved a little over 0.5 point from the first quarter of 2017.","Our solid first quarter results were a direct reflection of the tremendous effort put forth by our entire workforce, and had not been for some network congestion it would have even been better. I'm encouraged by the work we're doing to quickly regain superior levels of service and efficiency. Our team will give you some more of the details on the first quarter starting with Beth.","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Thank you, Lance, and good morning. For the first quarter, our volume was up 2% driven by Energy, Premium and Industrial offset by Agricultural Products, we generated positive net core pricing of 2% in the quarter with continued pricing pressure in our coal markets. The increase in volume and a 5% improvement in average revenue per car drove a 7% increase in freight revenue.","Let's take a closer look at the performance of each business group. Ag Products revenue was flat on a 4% volume decrease with an offsetting 5% average revenue per car increase. Grain carloads were down 16% with continued weakness in grain exports due to high global supplies, partially offset by strength in long-haul domestic grain business. Grain products carloads were up 1% as growth in ethanol exports and other biofuels were partially offset by reduced meal shipments to the east due to a strong eastern crush. Fertilizer experienced a 10% increase due to robust export potash demand coupled with increased demand for sulfur from both the mining and fertilizer markets.","Energy revenue increased 15% for the quarter on a 6% increase in volume and a 8% increase in average revenue per car. Coal and coke were down 3% driven primarily by a contract change, coupled with lower natural gas prices. Natural gas prices fell 7% versus first quarter 2017 and PRB coal inventories continue to be below the five-year average. Sand carloads were up 52% due to increased crude production from major shale formations and favorable crude oil prices. Petroleum, LPG and renewables carloads increased 22% for the quarter, driven primarily by crude oil shipments.","Industrial revenue was up 6% on a 2% increase in volume and a 4% increase in average revenue per car during the quarter. Construction carloads decreased 6%, primarily driven by rock, due to weather and service impacts in Texas. Metals volume increased 11% for the quarter, driven by strong OCTG pipe and line pipe shipments into West Texas and Oklahoma. Our specialized markets volume increased 10% overall, driven by military shipments due to continued strength in training rotations and deployments as well as waste shipments due to remediation project growth.","Premium revenue was up 7% with a 2% increase in volume and a 5% increase in average revenue per car. Domestic intermodal volume increased 5%, driven by continued strength in parcel and stronger demand from tight truck capacity. Auto parts volume growth was driven by over-the-road conversions and growth in light truck demand which minimized the impact of lower overall production levels. International intermodal volume was down 2%, driven by increased transloading and changing vessel ports of call. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 2% as a result of lower production levels and high inventories. These reductions were partially offset by new West Coast import traffic and strong truck and SUV shipments out of Mexico.","Looking ahead, for Agricultural Products, while we continue to face challenges in the export grain market from high global supplies, potential tariffs and a low-protein wheat crop, we are starting to see some positive indicators resulting from crop uncertainty in South America. We anticipate continued strength in ethanol exports. We also expect growth in food and beverage shipments due to Cold Connect penetration, tightened truck capacity and continued strength in import beer.","For Energy, we expect favorable crude oil spreads to drive positive results for petroleum products in 2018. We anticipate uncertainty in frac sand due to tougher year-over-year comps in addition to continued concerns around the viability of local sand. We expect coal to continue to experience headwinds in the second quarter with natural gas prices. And as always for coal, weather conditions will be a key factor for demand.","For Industrial looking forward we anticipate strength in plastics as new facilities and expansions come online, as well as continued strength in Industrial production. For Premium, over the road conversions from continued tightening in truck capacity will present new opportunities for domestic and auto parts growth. Despite challenges within the international intermodal market, we anticipate year-over-year growth for the remainder of the year resulting from new business opportunities. The U.S. light vehicle sales forecast for 2018 is 16.9 million units, down about 2% from 2017. Production shifts and new import business will create some opportunity to offset the weaker market demand.","With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance.","Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.","Thanks, Beth, and good morning. Starting with safety performance, our reportable personal injury rate was 0.74, a 17% improvement compared to last year and a first quarter record. With regards to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate improved 13% to 2.76. In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased 38% versus 2017 to 3.05. This result is disappointing given all the initiatives we have been progressing on. But we'll continue our efforts to partner with communities using safety campaigns to reinforce public awareness and safe driver behavior.","Moving on to network performance. As reported to the AAR, velocity declined 4% and terminal dwell increased 8% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Multiple factors are affecting our network fluidity. We are experiencing record manifest volumes in our Southern region. Also transportation plan execution at some of our key terminals has contributed to the degradation of our operating metrics. Sequentially, however, we are making improvement.","Over the past several weeks, our velocity has consistently increased with all three regions showing meaningful improvement. Systemwide, terminal dwell has decreased by 5%. Our total freight car inventory as reported to the STB is down 3%. More importantly, our operating inventory, which excludes cars that are stored or placed at customer facilities is down over 25,000 cars or 11% since its high in the first quarter.","We're intently focused on continuing to improve service levels, and we're confident that we have solid plans in place to achieve better results. Let me provide you with a high-level look at our service recovery initiatives. We are aggressively managing inventory to reduce terminal congestion. This is primarily targeted at the southern end of our railroad.","We're closely monitoring car inventory levels at key terminals. Railcars with excessive dwell are being identified and prioritized for prompt handling. We also continue to adjust our transportation plan or T-Plan to route cars around congested areas to the extent possible. We're being more disciplined in running the T-Plan as scheduled, which help locomotives and crews remain balanced. We're shifting volume between some of our Southern region terminals to more effectively balance car flows within network.","And we're now complete with the T-Plan adjustments we piloted in the Pacific Northwest and Northern California. This resulted in the discontinuation of some aspects of that pilot, while maintaining the positive adjustments that we implemented, including more seven-day per week manifest through trains running on the network.","We are improving efficiency at our key terminals. This is the basic blocking and tackling of getting cars in and out of yards effectively. We have increased local train frequency to facilitate spotting cars at our customer facilities in a timely manner after they reach the local serving yard. This also enables us to quickly pull cars from customers once they are released.","We have also added more yard jobs, as port yard and terminal fluidity. These changes have enabled us to make significant progress in reducing freight car inventory over the past month.","I am confident that going forward, we will continue to see steady improvements to our service and operating efficiency. When you add all this up, the decline in our operating metrics, coupled with service recovery plan we have put in place, has put some pressure on our resources.","On the locomotive front, we have reactivated approximately 650 high-horsepower locomotives since mid-2017, including more than 250 high-horsepower locomotives since early February. Currently, we have about 225 high-horsepower road units remaining in storage, and we will continue to bring stored locomotives into the active fleet as needed to support our service improvement efforts.","Additionally, we have entered into a short-term lease agreement for approximately 100 locomotives. These units will provide additional surge capacity in case of an unexpected event like a hurricane.","On the TE&Y front, we have recalled all furloughed employees back to service and continue to hire new employees to handle expected attrition.","Our TE&Y workforce was up 8% when compared to the first quarter of 2017, primarily driven by an increase of approximately 800 employees in the training pipeline. We plan to graduate approximately 200 trainees per month between now and July.","In some of the more challenging labor markets, we are currently offering signing bonuses to make these jobs more attractive, which is a tool we have used successfully in the past. This does not mean, however, that we have given up on our productivity initiatives. Although the decline in our velocity and terminal dwell metrics are negatively impacting productivity in certain areas, we are still driving productivity elsewhere.","G55+0 continues to be an integral part of our daily fabric with respect to how we approach our work. For example, while we are recovering our system fluidity, we were able to continue generating solid productivity in both our engineering and mechanical functions. We also achieved best-ever train size performance in our grain train category during the first quarter. The team also achieved first quarter train length records in our manifest, automotive and intermodal businesses.","Looking ahead, we expect network fluidity to return to more normalized levels, as we continue our service recovery efforts. While there isn't a specific date that I can provide you before we reach normalized operations, please be assured that the entire company is working with a sense of urgency and teamwork as we continue making improvement.","Next, I would like to provide you an update on our progress with Positive Train Control. PTC is already implemented on nearly two-thirds of Union Pacific's network, and we have a comprehensive plan for installation and implementation to complete PTC.","As part of this plan, the Union Pacific intends to file an alternative schedule with the Federal Railroad Administration in order to maintain the health of the railroad network.","The remaining implementation schedule will be phased in over the next couple years, so that additional problem solving and system testing can occur, while minimizing operational issues. We do not anticipate the revised schedule will materially change the $2.9 billion estimate of investment required to install and implement PTC.","But of course, as Rob has discussed on previous occasions, there will be ongoing capital and operating expense required to maintain and enhance the system going forward.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","Thanks and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our first quarter results. Operating revenue was $5.5 billion in the quarter, up 7% versus last year. Positive core price, increased fuel surcharge revenue and a 2% increase in volume were the primary drivers of the increase in revenue for the quarter.","Operating expense totaled $3.5 billion, up 6% from 2017. Operating income totaled $1.9 billion, an 8% increase from last year.","Below the line, other income was a negative $42 million compared to a positive $72 million in 2017. And as we previously disclosed in an 8-K filing on April 6, other income was negatively impacted by a non-cash, pre-tax charge of $85 million associated with an early bond redemption. Excluding the impact of the early bond redemption, other income would have totaled $43 million or about $29 million less than last year.","But also keep in mind, we had a favorable pre-tax real estate gain totaling $26 million, which we recorded in last year's first quarter. So if you net out the large one-time items from both this year and last year, other income was essentially flat at $45 million.","Interest expense of $186 million was up 8% compared to the previous year. This reflects the impact of higher total debt balance, partially offset by lower effective interest rate.","Income tax expense decreased 35% to $401 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower tax rate as a result of corporate tax reform and was partially offset by higher pre-tax earnings. Our effective tax rate of 23.4% came in a little lower than the 25% rate that we were anticipating. In future periods, we would expect our effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range.","Net income totaled $1.3 billion, up 22% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity.","These results combine to produce record first quarter earnings per share of $1.68.","The operating ratio was 64.6%, an improvement of 0.6 percentage points from the first quarter last year. As we have footnoted in the financial handouts accompanying this earnings release, the first quarter 2017 operating ratio was adjusted upward 0.1 points to 65.2% for the retrospective adoption of the new pension accounting standard. Please reference the Investor section of the UP website for the 2017 full year restatement by quarter.","The combined impact of fuel price and our fuel surcharge lag had a 0.2 point negative impact on the operating ratio in the quarter compared to 2017. And fuel had a $0.03 positive impact on earnings per share year-over-year.","Freight revenue of $5.1 billion was up 7% versus last year. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $353 million, up $141 million when compared to 2017, and up $60 million versus the fourth quarter of last year. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the first quarter was slightly positive. Year-over-year growth in sand, petroleum products, metals and lumber shipments offset a decrease in grain carloadings, and an increase in lower ARC intermodal and auto parts shipments.","Core price was about 2% in the first quarter, up from the 1.75% we reported in the fourth quarter of last year. Coal and international intermodal continue to be a challenge from a pricing perspective. However, if we set coal and international intermodal aside, our core was about 2.75% in the first quarter. For the full year, we still expect the total dollars that we generate from our pricing actions to well exceed our rail inflation costs.","Turning now to operating expenses, slide 20 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense increased 1% to $1.3 billion versus 2017. The increase was driven primarily by volume-related costs, networking efficiencies and increased TE&Y training expenses incurred during the quarter, and partially offset by our G55 workforce productivity initiatives. For the full year, we still expect labor inflation and overall inflation to be under 2%.","Total workforce levels decreased about 1% in the first quarter versus last year. This was driven primarily by a 10% decrease of employees associated with capital projects. Employees not associated with capital projects were up about 1%. Our management employee count was down 600 employees, primarily driven by the workforce reduction program that we initiated last year.","Fuel expense totaled $589 million, up 28% when compared to last year. Higher diesel fuel prices and a 4% increase in gross ton miles were the primary drivers of the increase in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate increased about 2%, while our average fuel price increased 22% to $2.13 per gallon.","Purchased services and materials expense increased 6% to $599 million. This increase was primarily driven by volume-related costs, higher freight car repair expense related to the return of leased cars, and increased locomotive repair costs associated with a larger active locomotive fleet.","Turning to slide 21, depreciation expense was $543 million, up 4% compared to 2017. The increase is primarily driven by a higher depreciable asset base. For the full year 2018, we estimate that depreciation expense will increase about 5%.","Moving to equipment and other rents, this expense totaled $266 million in the quarter, which was down 4% compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by lower locomotive and freight car lease expenses. Other expenses came in at $266 million, up 2% versus last year. The primary driver was an increase in state and local taxes and other expenses, partially offset by a decrease in personal injury expense and reduced casualty costs. For the full year 2018, we continue to expect other expense to increase around 10% versus 2017.","On the productivity side, our G55+0 initiatives yielded approximately $35 million of productivity in the first quarter, net of the operational headwinds that we experienced during the year. This is well below what we anticipated coming into the year.","We estimate that the impact of these operational challenges totaled about $40 million in the first quarter. The $40 million was spread evenly across the cash cost categories of comp and benefits, purchased services, equipment rents and to a lesser extent fuel. While we are seeing some improvement in our operating metrics, as Cam discussed a minute ago, our full year productivity will be less than our original goal of $300 million to $350 million given the current challenges.","Looking at our cash flow. Cash from operations for the first quarter totaled $1.9 billion, up slightly when compared to last year. Higher net income was mostly offset by payments made to our agreement workforce in accordance with the terms of the recently ratified labor contracts and the timing of tax payments.","Taking a look at adjusted debt levels. The all-in adjusted debt balance totaled about $20.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $570 million since year-end 2017. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of around 1.9 times.","In light of the higher earnings and cash flow that we expect to generate from tax reform, we are in the process of reevaluating our target leverage ratio and optimal capital structure. As we have stated before, we believe tax reform enables greater debt capacity for Union Pacific while still retaining a strong investment-grade credit rating. From a timing perspective, we will have an update for you at our Investor Day scheduled for May 31 in Omaha.","Dividend payments for the first quarter totaled $568 million, up from $492 million in 2017. This includes two recent 10% increases in our declared dividend per share. The first increase occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the second increase was effective in the first quarter of this year.","In addition to dividends, we bought back 9.3 million shares totaling $1.2 billion during the first quarter of 2018. This represents a 53% increase over 2017 in terms of dollars spent for share repurchases. Between our dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned about $1.7 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter, which represents 132% of net income over the same period.","This also represents a 39% increase in cash returned to shareholders compared to the first quarter of 2017. Looking ahead to 2018, we still expect full year volumes to be up in the low single-digit range. As Beth just commented, we're optimistic with several of our business categories but have some uncertainty in other areas. Positive full year volume and positive core price should lead to solid improvements in the top line for 2018. On the expense side of the equation, our current operational challenges will be a headwind to operating expenses in the near term.","Our goal is to still achieve an improved full year operating ratio in 2018. And with respect to our targeted 60% operating ratio, plus or minus, on a full year basis by 2019, we have clearly lost some time given the service challenges that we are experiencing and it is now unlikely that we will achieve that target next year. We're still committed to achieving a 60% operating ratio, just not likely next year, and ultimately a 55% operating ratio. We will provide you with more details on our outlook at our upcoming Investor Day at the end of May.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thank you, Rob. As we discussed today, we delivered solid first quarter results despite experiencing operational difficulties. We're pleased with the improvement we've seen in recent weeks, and we are confident in the plan we have in place to continue building on the progress that we've already made. With the economy favoring a number of our market segments, we're well positioned to benefit from another year of positive volume growth and solid core pricing gains.","With that, let's open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you and our first question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to start with price and I know you don't give guidance, but hoping that you could help to frame for us directionally if we should be thinking about another step up in that core pricing number in Q2 or the second half? And then some of the drivers behind that? And then, if you think about what's happening with truck pricing, do you think ultimately that could translate into pricing gains that are above what you've seen in prior cycles, of course adjusted for legacy?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Beth, do you want to handle that?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Sure. Allison, we continue to be very encouraged by what we're seeing in the truck market and the opportunities that that gives us both for, as you indicate, pricing gains but also volume gains, bringing more volume onto the railroad. We will continue to feel like we have opportunities in all of our truck competitive markets. Where we're really seeing pressure continues to be in places like international intermodal and in the coal markets","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And maybe just switching to the plastics opportunity that you highlighted. Do you think there's more opportunity to capture export traffic than perhaps you initially thought? Again, given the tight trucking market and equipment constraints, and even thinking about the rebuild activity in Texas and the competition for labor. How do you see that playing out versus your expectations maybe three or six months ago?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","I think that we've always been pretty optimistic that we're going to handle the plastics business to a significant degree. Some of it will be packaged onsite at the original producer, in which case Union Pacific won't have an opportunity to participate.","But for those producers that are intentionally using hopper cars as their first means of warehousing, if you will, and then going to a plastics packager for their export shipments, we hope we'll certainly participate at least on that first move. But we do believe that there will be a substantial percentage of this plastics that's produced in the Gulf that will end up West Coast exit from the United States. And we think that packaging facilities like the one we're developing in Dallas right adjacent to our intermodal facility will give us a great opportunity to participate in that. And we are still on track to open that facility with our partner KTN in the late third quarter of this year.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Excellent. Thank you.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Wanted to come back on some of the network challenges and your thoughts around productivity, I guess, for the year. When you think about the $40 million from the first quarter, can you give us some rough estimates of what the net number might look like as the year progresses? I think you said that it's going to be diminish but it's probably going to be there to a degree?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Let me start and then I'm going to turn it over to Rob to fill in some detail. So from the standpoint of the network challenges, we mentioned that those had really started in the second half of last year and there are a myriad of reasons. Ultimately, that culminated in us having too many operating cars \u2013 operating car inventory on us for the amount of carloads that we were generating, which exacerbated the problem, made it worse. We've spent a good part of the first quarter and coming now into the second quarter in getting that right, there's still more work to be done there. And Rob mentioned that in terms of we're still going to face a headwind as we move into the year with excess resources deployed, so that we can get our service product right.","But, Rob, do you want to...","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, Chris, I would just add \u2013 we're not going to fine point number on what we think that congestion cost is going to be in the second quarter. I will just tell you recall Cam's slides where we are making improvements. We've seen sequential improvement on the one hand and that's all good. But we are bringing on those additional locomotives that we highlighted there. So when you add it all up, we're focused as all can be on getting back, if you will. But in terms of exactly what that dollar amount might turn out in the second quarter, we'll just have to stay tuned. We're aggressively looking to reduce that.","And I would also add that even with that $40 million of challenges that we faced in the first quarter, our total productivity was still a positive at that $35 million that I reported.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. So the net benefit was still there, that's helpful.","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","That's right.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And when you think about the full year OR, I think the goal now is to improve, which maybe is a little less assertive of a statement, I guess, than previously. How do you think about some of the puts and takes there? Seems like pricing's maybe gotten a bit better, at least from a core perspective, and volume has been okay. So what are the dynamics there that might move the needle one way or another that maybe are different now than they were previously? Just trying to get a sense of maybe if there's a different feeling around the OR improvement potential this year?","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, Chris, I would say it's the same levers that were there before. And that is positive volume, which we feel pretty good about; positive price, which, as Beth talked about, we still feel pretty good about; and then productivity.","So yeah, the margin, if you will, of improvement might have gotten a little bit more challenged with what we were facing on the congestion cost. But the levers are frankly the same. And we are fixated and convicted around improving that operating ratio this year.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","And, Rob, I think it's important to note that the fact that we're masking some of the productivity improvements that we have the ability to make through these excess resources to get the network right. That has not in any way diminished both the game plan and the confidence around the game plan of what productivity opportunity we have.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks and good morning. I appreciate the way you report core pricing is different than others, so I wanted to ask about renewals. Would you be willing to share the average renewal rate this quarter and how that compares to what you saw in the prior quarter?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","We don't really comment on that, Justin. What I would just tell you is we are encouraged again by the tightening truck capacity. And we feel good about our opportunity to get pricing in those truck competitive markets.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then maybe following up on some of the OR commentary. There was the change in language. And I just want to clarify that we're not reading too much into this.","Is it fair to say that improving the OR this year could be a little bit more challenging relative to what you thought back in January? And I guess, to follow-up on that, what's your confidence that the OR can improve in the back half? Has that changed at all?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","So let me take the front half of that question, then I'll give Rob the opportunity to deal with the back half. In terms of confidence in improving OR, we are confident in improving our OR this year. Clearly, we would have liked to have made more progress in the first quarter. And we mentioned that in our comments, that we had a solid quarter, I'm proud of the financials, and they could have been better.","And when we see that, it's a little bit of a disappointment on our side. But it's also a confidence boost, knowing what we're capable of achieving. Rob?","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, Justin, as you know, we don't give quarterly guidance on the OR. But remember last year the reported OR was 63%. Of course you've got the pension adjustment that affects that. So that's the marker. And, yes, I think it's fair to say that the room for air, if you will, to make improvement is a little bit more challenging this year, given the costs that we just talked about, than it might have been had we not incurred those costs. But we're still focused on making that improvement year-over-year.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Great, that's helpful.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, operator. Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I'm a bit surprised by the OR commentary relative to the targets that you guys laid out, given the backdrop at least prospectively probably couldn't be better.","So I guess the real question is really around incremental margins, which obviously have been lowered in the mid to near term. And I just want to understand that a little bit better. It's really a piggyback to Chris's question.","But certainly service levels are getting better prospectively, volumes and pricing are good, pricing's actually accelerating in the quarter. You're also adding costs, so I understand there's some puts and takes there.","But relative to that 50% to 60% incremental margin target that you guys have targeted at least over the next several quarters or 1.5 years, what's the right incremental margin expectation now, given those puts and takes?","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, Amit. I would say that the incremental margin is still a fair way of looking at it. And we still need to average, call it, in the 50% to 60% range. I mean, on a fuel adjusted basis I think in the first quarter it was like in the mid-50s. Absolute, all reported was closer to 40-ish.","But we have to get back to that 50% to 60%, and over the long-term we're focused on doing that. And I guess, I would just say that if you're calling out surprise around the OR commentary, you might \u2013 I assume you're referring to the 60%, plus or minus, by next year.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah. What we're basically saying there is, that in our mind is a 60%. I mean, that was the guidance that we are taking down and we're going to revisit that when we meet at the end of May. But that \u2013 to achieve a 60% OR from where we are today by next year, we're just saying that's unlikely at this time. We're not giving up on our focus, but that's just unlikely to hit a 60% between now and next year.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just one follow-up question, if I could, on the reevaluating of the optimal capital structure. I know I don't want to \u2013 and I'm sure you're going to discuss this in length at the May end Analyst Day. But can you just help us now, give us a little bit of preview in terms of how you're thinking about it? Because you are retiring \u2013 you've got some high cost debt out there that's trading at a big premium to par. So probably doesn't make sense to buy that back.","So when I think about optimizing your capital structure, what I'm really thinking about, correct me if I'm wrong, is leveraging up the balance sheet in a very prudent way to buy back a disproportionate amount of stock, just like Norfork announced that they're going to start doing in terms of accelerating their share repurchases. CSX is certainly doing it.","So is that the right playbook in terms of how to think about how you're approaching this analysis from a balance sheet capacity perspective?","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah. I mean, and I've said this publicly previous, and you're right, we are going to get into this in more detail at the May Investor Conference. But the way we're thinking about it, I mean, we think we have additional capacity both as a result of our ongoing strong cash from operations and then turbo charged, if you will, by the tax reform.","And our guiding light is a solid investment grade rating, and we are working with the rating agencies around that. But more to come on that, but we think that gives us additional capacity.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","But you're four and five notches above investment grade \u2013 well, investment grade territory. Is it safe to say that you maybe even want to go one or two notches below but still stay well into investment grade territory? How do we think about that?","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","More to come on that. I mean, again, I'm not going to get into details here, but again, a solid investment grade rating is sort of that guiding light. And you're right, we're well above that today.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thanks. Morning, guys.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Morning.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","So I want to try and take a step back, big picture, how did we get to this place? Volumes are only up 2%, they were up 2% last year, you've got TE head count up 8%. Why are we having these service issues? It doesn't feel like there's that much volume growth that should be pressuring the network?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, Scott. So it's not an aggregate issue. It's kind of a more targeted issue. So for us, if you go back to the second half of last year, there were a number of things that we've highlighted that started us down the road of a congested network, specifically ion the Southern region.","Part of that congestion was visited in other parts of the network in part with our implementation of Positive Train Control and unintended stops. We've done some tremendous work on reducing that occurrence, and we feel very good and confident about squeezing that out.","We did a couple of other things in terms of experimenting with our T-Plan, specifically up in the Pacific Northwest. And that created a little bit of congestion in dwell. We've deconstructed that. We're keeping the piece that we thought was most productive. And then you get down south, basically in our most constrained part of our network, we've seen significant manifest carload growth, which is the type of product that consumes our terminal and yard capacity. So when you put that all together, the way to get out of that as operating car inventory increased because of that congestion is to over-resource the network so you can run on demand.","That you don't wait for crews and you don't wait for locomotives. And as Cameron pointed out, we changed our transportation plan so that we actually added starts in order to move cars out of our terminals and in toward customers and in toward interchange. All of that is paying dividends. We see that, as we mentioned, with a $25,000 or 11% reduction in our operating car inventory, and an improvement in dwell and an improvement in velocity.","There's more work to be done there, but that's why you get more locomotives than you would need steady-state, more crews than you would need steady state. And once we achieved steady state or as we approach it, you should start seeing us put locomotives back into storage and our appetite for TE&Y is also going to reduce.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. I guess that makes sense. And then wanted to ask you one other just, again, on the operating ratio side, I guess. So if we go back a year ago, when we first had the management changes at CSX and we asked all the rails about it, I think what you said is, hey, we'll watch and maybe we'll replicate some things that they're doing and I'm sure they're going to want to replicate some things that we're doing well.","I guess, a year later and it's just a quarter, but they now have the best operating ratio for a quarter of any rail, so it seems to be working there. I guess I'm asking, are there things that they're doing that you see that, hey, that works and that applies to us as well like demurrage or hump yards or what, that you think about wanting to replicate so you can get back to having best OR of any U.S. rail?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yes. So unpacking that, the short answer is yes. We do see both the CSX and the other railroads and other businesses, candidly, other industrial businesses doing things that we can learn from. We experiment with that learning like we did in the Pacific Northwest. Some elements that worked, some elements didn't, and we'll continue to innovate and experiment so that we continue to drive operating ratio.","We're very proud of and I think stand on our record of improving operating ratio over the long term while providing a sound and excellent service product and being able to find areas of the market that we can grow into and generate attractive profit and return and we're going to keep that up. So nothing has really fundamentally changed for us in terms of how we're looking at the business and running the business. And what we're holding ourselves accountable for and what our shareholders and communities and customers and employees are holding us accountable for.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, thank you for the time, guys.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your questions.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Good morning. Lance, if could just maybe follow up on that a bit, if I look at some of the yard services issues, Cam talked about adding new locomotives and crews that you just highlighted. In I guess was it 2004 or 2005 when you launched the Unified Plan, it took that network overhaul. Does this require a network overhaul, so you don't just push problems from one yard to another as you did back in the early days of the 2000s, so you can get the fluidity running on the network? Or is this really just that Southwest and if we can fix that area with the oversupply that you talked about, then it neutralizes itself?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, Ken. I think it really is about getting the mix right of the right transportation plan, getting the inventory right and making sure that we have the right amount of fixed capacity available to handle it. You saw us announce earlier that we were firing up Brazos which is a large, modern network terminal in the middle of Texas, that's a key component of making sure that we have the right capacity to handle our business in Texas.","We have other capital investments that we're making down in that area that will increase the fluidity and the ability to handle carloads in that area of our network. I don't think we have to deconstruct entirely and reconstruct entirely the game plan. We don't see that. But clearly, we see opportunity to continue to find productivity, both in how we manage over the road and how we manage in our terminals, and Cameron and team are all over that.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So if I can just get my follow-up then on the \u2013 would you then view this low 60% range? You've gone from the 90s to the 80s now to getting to the low 60s. Is this the peak? I mean, is this maybe where the rail network needs to run and operate, so you don't have to keep over-hiring and bring on resources? Or is this just, kind of a slow bleed, whether it's pricing or technology that gets rolled out that can continue to improve those operations, just in order to handle the rebounding growth as it comes?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah. We do not believe that there's a choice that you have to make to identify a low-water mark that you stand on in terms of operating ratio. We think that we can run this business in a way that will continually look for opportunities to reduce our operating ratio, and we think there's still opportunity for that.","The other thing to note is we don't manage the business solely with a focus on one metric, right. I mean, operating ratio is a very important metric for how efficiently we're running the network. Return on invested capital is a very important measure that we use to make sure that we're making prudent investment decisions. We look at our service KPIs and our quality KPIs and, of course, our safety KPIs.","So we believe we can accomplish all of that at the same time. We did a fair job of that in the first quarter this year. I mean, we've shown operating ratio improvement, record EPS, solid increase in operating income, and we think there's more of that to be had. And some of that was masked in the first quarter, because we had excess resources in the network to get back to a great service product.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Appreciate the time and insight.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah, good morning. We spent a lot of time on the OR. I was curious, I mean, officially your volume guidance is unchanged from what you put out in January at low single digits. I'm just \u2013 do you feel better, worse about kind of how volumes are going to shape out this year with one quarter under your belt? And can you maybe point to any upside or downside risk outside of frac sand which you already highlight that we should think about there?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Bascome, I would say that the economy feels pretty good to us. Industrial production was very strong in the first quarter. It looks to stay strong as we progress throughout the year. We've had some wins that are public on the international intermodal side that makes us feel good. We do have some uncertainty I'd say with what happens with coal, the Ag markets globally are always a little bit of a question mark for us.","And there was something else I was going to say which slipped my mind, oh, frac sand is still, like you indicated, uncertain just because of all the capacity that's coming on locally. So our guidance has been kind of low-single-digit. We're not changing that at this point. But certainly, we're optimistic about having a nice volume year.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you for that. And Lance, maybe one for you. At a high level, I mean, you and Rob have talked about being able to sustain more leverage on the balance sheet. It certainly makes sense from return on equity standpoint, but it also probably reduces your balance sheet optionality if we do get into another round of rail consolidation down the road. I was just thinking about at a board level, is that a conversation UP is having? How do you think about the tradeoffs from that?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah. Bascome, so we constantly discuss our capital structure. You know, looking at us now and historically, we're pretty conservative in our capital structure. We make sure that we have our powder dry for the what-ifs as we look into the future. So not disclosing anything we discuss at board level, I would tell you that's a constant discussion. Right now, we think both our ability to generate incremental operating income and cash and tax reform gives us the opportunity to in aggregate increase leverage and also to reevaluate the amount of leverage we have.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you. Appreciate the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Rob, I just wanted to talk a little bit, again, about the same issue, right. If we're sort of walking back off of the 2019 target, how do you get confidence that there's enough operating leverage in the business to get you to that 55% number?","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, I mean, as you know and others know, we haven't put a finite date on that 55%. But as Lance and Cam have commented throughout this morning, we continue to believe, while we've hit this little speedbump, if you will, that doesn't change our conviction and our belief that there's a lot more to be gained here. And we don't just don't pull numbers out of the thin air, we've got real action plans behind, as you've heard me speak to you many times, real action plans behind getting to that 55%. And yeah, we need economy to cooperate. We need to be performing at a high level, we need to continue to get price above inflation to get there, but we're confident in our ability to ultimately drive to a 55%.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","But I mean, I guess the primary controversy here or the primary issue here is when the market hears a 55%, is connecting those dots. Like how do you \u2013 is this going to be part of the Investor Day agenda in May? Like how do you help give confidence around that margin potential inside of the business?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, fair point, David, and I would envision that we will be talking to this at our investor conference. And I get the pushback. I mean I understand. We've hit a little speedbump here in the road, and we're going to clear that as soon as we possibly can and get back on the track. But I hear the message that we need to rebuild that confidence in the investor base.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Matt Reustle with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.","Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks for taking my question. Just one quick one again on leverage capacity. I just want to make sure, it sounds like you're referencing specifically that you see more debt capacity from tax reform. I mean, it also seems like you would have some additional capacity to match where your peer group is? Are you considering both of those opportunities, are you specifically looking at where you are and the opportunity from tax reform and still wanting to keep a better balance sheet than a lot of your peers?","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah. Matt, again, this is Rob. We'll talk more detail at the Investor conference. But I would say directionally it's both. I mean, you're right. We think we have debt capacity and that is turbocharged by the benefits from the tax package. So we're looking at it as a combination of those things and that's what we're working through with the rating agencies.","Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Rob. That's all for me.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Apologize if you've covered this already, just overlapping conference call with UPS. But I guess, pricing topic is pretty fertile ground so there's room to talk about it. How do you think about kind of stability you've seen in core price and any potential changes in that? I think from other railroads we have seen pretty good evidence of acceleration in price. So how do you think about that in terms of dynamics in your business and whether that's changing and how big the effect is from coal and international intermodal where you have for a while identified a little more market pressure, market challenges?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah. You're right, Tom. We've had a couple price questions already, and they are somewhat similar. But, yes, we continue to see pressure in coal and international intermodal. We are very optimistic and encouraged by the truck tightening. And certainly in our truck competitive markets we're seeing strong pricing. Rob talked about that earlier. If you took coal and international intermodal out, we are at about 2.75% pricing. So there is opportunity out there in the truck competitive markets and we'll be going after it strong.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","So is it reasonable to think that there's room for acceleration in what you're seeing? Or do you think what you're seeing in the first quarter results is kind of representative of what might be the case looking forward?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Well, we don't like to try to predict what's going to happen in the future. All I can really tell you is that we will take advantage of every opportunity to not only go after pricing, but to try to convert that highway business to rail while we see the truck tightening and the opportunity for us to provide value.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So do you still have a fair bit of the book left to reprice this year? Is there still opportunity to get rates up on business this year?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Yes. We are partway through bid season on the intermodal side, and we always are converting over about a third of our business every year and we'll have pricing opportunities as the year progresses.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Right. Okay. Thank you for the time.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Sure thing, Tom.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks very much. I'm going to limit to just one question, I guess, maybe directed mostly at Lance or Cameron. And really looking at your capacity. And we've seen other railroads see some capacity issues. I saw you pulled back all your furloughed workers. You've brought in 650 locomotives or reactivated them.","Can you touch on is that all of the locomotives that you have in storage now? Or do you still have some remaining? Can you touch a little bit on network capacity in addition to your capacity on the employment side and on the locomotive side?","And where any surge capacity \u2013 as I know you touched on that in your prepared remarks. But given some of the issues some of the other rails have had, what confidence can you give that you're prepared for any surges if we should see them? Thanks very much.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Okay. Cam, you want to start?","Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.","Sure. Our Western region and Northern regions are in excellent shape when you look at rail network capacity. It truly is, as Lance mentioned, a Southern region story from a network capacity perspective. And it's a good one, that we're experiencing growth and we're responding appropriately with capacity investment to tackle that growth.","From a locomotive standpoint, we still have 225 locomotives in storage. And we will evaluate bringing those back in as our network picks up steam.","On the employee side, we don't have anybody furloughed anymore, and we are hiring. And the pipeline is full. It's about 200 employees a month through July that will be landing in full-service. And we'll be evaluating hiring going forward, preparing for the fall.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah. Walter, part of that answer is, again, when a network business like a railroad gets congested, you can either gut it out, and that takes a long, long time. And usually it means volume goes away. And then, finally, you get enough spare capacity to be able to make the improvements you need to get back to where your plan was. Or you can overload the network so that you can run volume whenever you want.","We have a physical capacity that is a rail capacity issue just in a few spots in the South in some terminals and some parts of the line of road. But what we don't want to do is also have that plus a locomotive capacity issue plus a crew capacity issue. So we've over-resourced those areas in the first quarter, clearly.","We do have some more powder that's dry in locomotives. And as Cameron says, our hiring pipeline is full. I fully expect, as Cameron and team continue to improve our service product in the South, that we're going to be in a place where we start storing locomotives again and slowing down that hiring pipeline.","Where that happens exactly, when it happens exactly, we can't tell. But what we can tell is, as we make improvement, we've got an eye towards being able to do that because those are the costs that are getting in the way of us demonstrating the $300 million to $350 million of productivity that we know we can get this year.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","And did you touch on your workforce that you expect to end the year at? The workforce level?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","No, we did not.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","Do you have an estimate around there?","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","So, Walter, our view, as you've heard us say many times on that, has not changed. And that is it will move up and down with whatever volume ends up being. We are projecting that volume is going to be on the positive side of the ledger. But it will be one for one. We still expect to achieve productivity as we look at the head count.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","So the 200 per month is a gross number, I guess. You'll be attriting there, so it won't be to that extent, obviously.","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","That's right. That's right.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then just one final question, more of a housekeeping. I don't know if you mentioned it. The other expense move around by shifting it from labor into that below the line item. Did you give guidance on that with regards to what we can expect on a quarterly cadence going forward?","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","You're talking about on the pension?","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","Yes.","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","Like 0.1 of a percent impact on the OR.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets","Right. Okay. That's all my questions. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Thanks, everyone, for taking my question. So I'll just leave it at one, but Lance or Rob or Beth, you guys \u2013 I think if we look back a few years \u2013 have underperformed the industry in terms of volume growth. And your top line really maxed out maybe looking back at like 2014.","And I don't want to steal any thunder from the analyst meeting but what can you talk about from a growth perspective maybe at a very high level where maybe the last decade you weren't able to expand with the market, but looking forward you really want to leverage this unique network that you have and really take advantage of that economics versus the highway. Because we've been hearing about that a long time but the growth just hasn't really materialized specifically for your company?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yes. Brandon, I'll start by saying what we really focus on is generating industry-best operating income and cash, which we do. And some part of whether or not we can get that from the top line volume is predicated on what's happening in the market and what's available to us at what we would consider appropriate and attractive return. But with that, I'll turn it over to Beth and Rob.","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Yes. I wholeheartedly agree with Lance's comments. But what you are seeing I think from us this year in particular, is pretty \u2013 we had some questions earlier about growth, but I think it's going to be a solid year for us. We are having some wins in international intermodal that are, like I said, public. The markets feel good to us. We have great exposure to the growth that's happening in the Gulf Coast in industrial, chemicals and plastics. So just echoing Lance's comments, our focus is very much on getting value for the service that we provide so that we do provide industry-leading margins and returns, and my team is really focused on doing that. We have a great business development pipeline. And we're going to continue to ensure that we put up good numbers in that regard.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So Beth, you mentioned earlier in the call about petroleum LPG were pretty strong because of crude oil, but wanted to see if you could comment further on the opportunity to export refined products into Mexico, given all the changes with energy reform and the gateways that you serve into the country?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Yes. We have been participating in that Mexico energy reform market. It started first for us with pretty significant LPG volumes. And then last year and into the first quarter, we did see solid finished fuels, gasoline and diesel shipments. It's a nice growth opportunity. I wouldn't call it a substantial carload potential over the long-term. But we're participating in that market and will continue to pursue opportunities from the refinery complex that we serve in the Gulf Coast down into the key consuming markets in Mexico in partnership with both KCSM and FXE.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for the details on that. The follow-up was, you talked a lot about the operations already, but maybe a little more specifically on the freight car inventory for Cam. Is there anything to read into the mix of private cars on the system? It's been pretty high across most of North American network. I understand a lot of that relates to the type of volume and freight that you're moving. But did that add to any of the complications when you're trying to get through some of these pinch points? And do you think it'll have any effect after you reset the network if that does continue from here on out?","Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.","I think both Beth and the operating team and the customers are working together very well to try and rationalize that very topic of private freight car inventory. We're making good progress and we expect to continue that progress throughout the remainder of the year.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Just a quick follow-up on that, are you able to incentivize with lower rates or potentially even demurrage or is it just in everybody's best interest to get the fluidity up and to keep it that way?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","You know customers are really motivated to do the same thing that we are, which is make money and move their product, right. So we see very rational behavior from customers in terms of adding freight cars to the network based on the cycle times that they see. So as we slow down, we did have some customers that added additional freight cars. I feel like our conversations with those customers about the improvements that were making and the increased cycle time and then causing them to make rational decisions which is pull freight cars back off the network. So I don't see that being any sort of a long-term systemic issue for us.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Beth, Cam, thanks for your time. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yes, thank you all for your questions. And we look forward to talking with you at our Investor Day in Omaha on May 31. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may now begin.","Lance Fritz","Thank you and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific's third quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Cameron Scott, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.3 billion for the third quarter of 2015. This equates to $1.50 per share, which is down 2% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Total volumes decreased about 6% in the quarter, more than offsetting another quarter of solid core pricing gains. Carload volume declined in five of our six commodity groups with coal down the most at 15%. Automotive was the one commodity group with a year-over-year increase in the quarter with carloads up 5% versus 2014.","On the cost side, we made significant progress aligning our resources to current demand.","And I am pleased to report a quarterly record operating ratio of 60.3%. Going forward we will be intently focused on generating further productivity improvements. In addition, developing new business remains an important part of our strategy, whether we grow existing markets, develop new business with existing customers or find new market opportunities our commercial team is constantly filling the business development pipeline.","I'm encouraged with the progress we have made as the men and women of Union Pacific worked tirelessly and safely to serve our customers and deliver value to our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it over to Eric.","Eric Butler","Thanks, Lance, and good morning. In the third quarter, our volume was down 6.5%, with gains in automotive more than offset by declines in the other business groups. We generated core pricing gains of 3.5%, but it was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharge and mix headwinds, as average revenue per car declined 4% in the quarter. Overall, the declines in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 10% reduction in freight revenue.","Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups. Ag products revenue was down 4% on a 3% volume reduction and a 1% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain volume was down 11% in the third quarter. The strong US dollar and high worldwide inventories reduced grain exports by 32%. Slightly stronger domestic grain shipments partially offset the export decline. Grain products volume increased 1% for the quarter. July and August saw the largest domestic soybean meal crush on record, resulting in a 17% increase in soybean meal shipments. Partially offsetting this was a 4% decline in ethanol shipments driven by strong 2014 comps of higher production and shipments.","Food and refrigerator product volumes were flat for the quarter as strength in import sugar and barley were offset by declines in frozen meat and potato shipments.","Automotive revenue was flat in the third quarter as a 5% increase in volume was offset by a 5% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments were up 5% this quarter, driven by continued strength in consumer demand. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for North American automotive sales was 17.8 million vehicles in the third quarter, up 6% from last year. In auto parts, volume grew 5% driven primarily by increased vehicle production.","Chemicals revenue was down 6% for the quarter on a 3% reduction in both volume and average revenue per car. We continue to see strength in plastics shipments, which were up 7% in the third quarter due to stable resin pricing and strong export volume. However, our volume gains were more than offset by declines in shipments of both fertilizer and crude oil. Lower grain commodity prices and market uncertainty resulted in farmers delaying fertilizer purchases. This resulted in a 10% decline in our fertilizer volume. Crude oil volume, which was down 40% in the quarter continues to be impacted by lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads.","Coal revenue declined 18% in the third quarter on a 15% volume decline and 4% decrease in average revenue per car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 12% in the quarter. Low natural gas prices continue to put downward pressure on coal demand as coal share of electricity generation declined from 38% in the third quarter of last year to 35% this year. Coal inventories, which are currently 20 days above the five-year average contributed to the sluggish demand. Colorado Utah tonnage was down 32%, driven again by soft domestic demand and reduced export shipments. ","Industrial products revenue was down 16% on a 12% decline in volume and 4% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Our reduction in shale drilling resulted in a 31% decline in minerals volume, primarily driven by a 36% decrease in frac sand car loadings. ","Metals volume was down 26% as lower crude oil prices suppressed drilling related shipments and the strong US dollar drove increased imports. Demand for construction products resulted in a 1% volume increase in the third quarter, driven by continued demand in road and construction projects in our Texas [Rock] region.","Intermodal revenue was down 11% in the third quarter on a 4% lower volume and a 7% decrease in average revenue per unit. Domestic intermodal volume was up 1% in the third quarter. Even though retail sales were down slightly year-over-year, we still achieved a best ever third quarter of domestic intermodal volume. International intermodal volume was down 9% in the quarter as compared to a strong third quarter of 2014, when cargo owners advanced peak season shipments in anticipation of port labor strikes. With relatively high inventories some international intermodal customers have reduced orders and not all east coast diversions have migrated back to the West Coast. I will update you on peak season in just a minute.","To wrap up, let's take a look at our outlook for the rest of the year. In Ag products, although we have had another strong crop year, low commodity prices and abundant global supply created uncertainty in our volume outlook for grain. In food and refrigerator, we expect continued strength in beer, but we are facing headwinds in other markets from increased truck availability year-over-year.","We expect automotive sales to remain strong for the rest of the year, driving growth in finished vehicles and part shipments. We continue to expect coal demand to remain below year ago levels due to low natural gas prices, higher than average coal inventories and headwinds in the export coal market. As always, a key factor in demand will be weather conditions.","Most chemical markets should remain steady for the remainder of the year, with strength expected in LPG. We continue to expect that weak oil prices, reduced production, and unfavorable spreads will remain a significant headwind for crude-by-rail shipments. In industrial products, lower crude oil prices will also continue to challenge our minerals and metals volume through the rest of 2015. While the housing market is slowly strengthening, the strong dollar and relatively weak China lumber import market are driving more imports of Canadian lumber to the US. We continue to expect demand for construction products to remain strong particularly in the southern part of our franchise.","Finally in intermodal, we continue to see highway conversions and we expect this to be the seventh consecutive year of record domestic intermodal volumes. We expect that relatively soft retail sales will cause headwinds in our international intermodal volumes. ","Overall, we will continue to focus on solid core pricing gains, strengthening our customer value proposition and developing new business across our diverse franchise.","With that I'll turn it over to Cameron.","Cameron Scott","Thank you Eric, and good morning. Starting with our safety performance, our year-to-date reportable personal injury rates improved 12% versus 2014 to a record low of 0.92. ","While we continue to make significant improvements, we won\u2019t be satisfied until we reach our goal of 0% incidents, getting everyone of our employees home safely at the end of each day.","With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate increased 17% to 3.56, driven by an increase in yard and industry reportables. While our reportable rate has taken a step back this year, we are confident that our strategy aimed at eliminating human factor incidents and hardening our infrastructure will put us back on a path of long-term improvement.","In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased slightly versus 2014 to 2.25. We continue to focus on driving improvement by reinforcing public awareness through channels including public safety campaigns and community partnerships. Moving onto network performance, our operating metrics showed a step function improvement in the third quarter with net work velocity reaching levels not achieved since 2013. While weather conditions in the quarter were more favorable from an operating standpoint, year-over-year volume swings and business mix shifts continue to create a dynamic operating environment. However, the men and women at Union Pacific proved up to the challenge, diligently leveraging the strength of our franchise that serve our customers proudly. ","In regards to service, one of the key metrics we use to track our performance is our service delivery index. The measure, which gauges how well we are meeting overall customer commitments improved 8% versus the third quarter of last year. We also generated improvement in our local service product to customers with a 95.3% industry [Indiscernible], which measures the delivery or [polling] of a car to or from a customer. Though we know there is still more work to do and we are working hard everyday to further improve service and reduce cost. ","Adjusting resources to current demand continued to be a key focus area for us in the third quarter. While we noted back in July that we had our locomotive fleet close to being right sized, we have made meaningful progress adjusting our TE&Y workforce over the past couple of months. By the end of September we had around 2700 TE&Y employees either furloughed or in alternative work status, compared with 1200 at the end of the second quarter.","In addition to adjusting the lower volumes, our improvement in network performance has translated into fewer [Indiscernible] resource demands of our network. Overall, our total ","TE&Y workforce was down 10% in September versus June. Around half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline.","Our active locomotive fleet is down 140 units from the end of the second quarter. As we currently sit, we still have some work left to do when our resources at the end of the third quarter were more closely aligned with current demand.","While resource alignment has been a key focus throughout the year, we have not lost sight of other initiatives, which also drive productivity. We ran record train lengths in nearly all major categories, remaining agile and adapting our transportation plan to current demand. We were also able to generate efficiency gains within terminals, as productivity initiatives led to record terminal productivity even with 4% decline in the number of cars switched.","Growth capacity investments, alongside process improvements, have enhanced our ability to generate productivity and have increased the fluid capabilities of our networks. In addition, our progress in adjusting resources to demand has helped enable gains in asset utilization, including locomotive productivity. While the mix headwind from running lower coal volumes largely drove the 1% decline versus the third quarter of 2014, this fleet productivity metric has improved 6% sequentially from the second quarter levels.","To wrap up, as we move forward, we expect our safety strategy will yield record results on our way to an incident-free environment. And while we gained significant traction throughout the quarter, we continue making operational improvements by leveraging the strengths of our diverse franchise to deliver service products our customers have come to expect. With our resources now closely in line with demand, we will continue our focus on other productivity initiatives to further reduce costs. Ultimately running a safe, reliable and efficient railroad creates value for our customers and increases returns for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Rob Knight","Thanks and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue was just under $5.6 billion in the quarter, down 10% versus last year. A decline in volume and lower fuel surcharge revenue, along with negative business mix more than offset another quarter of solid core pricing.","Operating expenses totaled just under $3.4 billion, decreasing 13% when compared to last year. Drivers of this expense decline were significantly lower fuel expense, along with volume-related reductions and productivity improvements. The net result was a 5% decrease in operating income to $2.2 billion. Below the line, other income totaled $30 million, up from $20 million in 2014. ","Interest expense of $157 million was up 9% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during the last 12 months. Income tax expense decreased about 7% to $781 million, driven primarily by reduced pretax earnings. Net income decreased 5% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce quarterly earnings of $1.50 per share, down 2% versus last year.","Now, turning to our top line, freight revenue of $5.2 billion was down 10% versus last year. Volume declined about 6%, and fuel surcharge revenue was down $407 million when compared to 2014. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel price was a $0.05 headwind to earnings in the third quarter versus last year, and this includes the net impact from both the fuel surcharges and lower diesel fuel costs. And as we expected on our last earnings call, business mix was a negative contributor to freight revenue for the third quarter. The primary drivers of this mix shift were significant declines in Frac sand, steel shipments, and bulk grains, partially offset by a decline in international intermodal volumes.","Looking ahead, business mix will continue to be a headwind to freight revenue for the remainder of the year. A 3.5% core price increase was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter. Slide 21 provides more detail on our core pricing trends. While down slightly from first half levels, core pricing continued at levels that are above inflation and reflects the value proposition that we offer in the marketplace. Of the 3.5% this quarter, about 0.5% can be attributed to the benefit of the legacy business that we renewed earlier this year, and this includes both the 2015 and 2016 legacy contract renewals.","Moving onto the expense side, Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 2% versus 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes and improved labor efficiency, as we continued to realign our workforce. Labor inflation was about 4% for the third quarter, driven by agreement wage inflation as well as high pension and other benefit expense. For the fourth quarter, we expect labor inflation to also be about 4%. Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count was flat when compared to 2014.","And excluding our capital related employees, however, our workforce level declined about 3%, and as Cam just mentioned, we made significant TE&Y reductions in the third quarter, and we are more closely in line with current demand. For the fourth quarter, we now expect our total force levels to be down 1% or so when compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. ","Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $484 million, down 45% when compared to 2014. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with an 8% decline in gross ton miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate increased 1%, driven by negative mix, while our average fuel price declined 40% to $1.81 per gallon.","Moving on to the other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense decreased 9% to $589 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume related expense and reduced repair cost associated with our locomotive and car fleet. Depreciation expense was $507 million, up 5% compared to 2014. We still expect depreciation to increase about 6% for the full year.","Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $302 million, which is down 3% when compared to 2014. Lower locomotive lease and volume related expenses were the primary drivers. Other expenses came in at $205 million, down 15% versus last year. Decreased freight, equipment and property damage costs along with a reduction in general expenses were the primary drivers. We now expect other expense to be close to flat on a full year basis, excluding any large unusual items.","Turning now to our operating ratio performance, the third quarter operating ratio came in at a record 60.3%, an improvement of 2 points when compared to the third quarter of 2014. The operating ratio did benefit about 1.5 points from the net impact of lower fuel prices in the quarter. Earlier in the year, we challenged the organization to safely and efficiently right size our resources and reduce cost, and I am pleased with the results that we have been able to achieve. Ongoing productivity initiatives, along with pricing above inflation, have been key drivers to improving our overall margins.","Turning now to our cash flow, year-to-date cash from operations increased to just over $5.6 billion, and we invested around $3.3 billion in cash capital investments through the first three quarters. ","Taking a look at the balance sheet, we continue our efforts to rebalance our capital structure, while maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating. Our adjusted debt balance grew about $1.6 billion through the first three quarters of this year, taking our adjusted debt to cap ratio to 44.5%, up from 41.3% at year-end 2014. Our adjusted debt to EBITDA has increased from 1.4 times at year-end to 1.6 times at September 30 on a trailing twelve-month basis. This is consistent with our target ratio of 1.5 plus. Longer term we define that to mean less than two times. ","Our profitability and cash generation enable us to continue to fund both our capital program and cash returns to shareholders. Year-to-date we have repurchased more than 28 million shares. Almost half of these shares were repurchased in the third quarter. Year-to-date spending totaled $2.9 billion. The third quarter alone was up 45% versus last year to over $1.2 billion. This demonstrates our opportunistic approach in the marketplace, and should not be considered a new quarterly run rate.","Adding our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned $4.3 billion to our shareholders through the first three quarters of 2015. This represents roughly a 22% increase over 2014. Why we have made good progress in the third quarter we do expect to see some difficult year-over-year comparisons as we close out 2015.","In the current demand environment, continued lower volumes versus last year and an even more challenging business mix will bothnegatively impact fourth quarter results. And when we compare it to last year, fuel prices will also continue to have a negative impact on earnings for the fourth quarter. Keep in mind we did report a $0.05 positive fuel benefit in the fourth quarter of last year, making the fuel comparison more challenging year-over-year.","On the plus side, we will continue to focus on achieving solid core pricing gains and building on the progress that we have made with our cost reduction and productivity initiatives. And when you add it all up, we will fall short of last year\u2019s fourth quarter and full year earnings per share records. As for next year, we are still early in the planning process. It looks like we may have opportunities in many of our business segments, but it also appears that our energy related volumes will continue to be challenged.","Given the uncertain environment, we are taking a hard look at our capital spending for next year. We haven't finalized our plans, so it too early to tell how it will relate to our long-term guidance of 16% to 17% of revenue. But from an absolute dollar perspective we do currently expect that it will be somewhat less than this year\u2019s $4.2 billion, and the plan does include the acquisition of around 200 locomotives as part of a long-term purchase commitment.","Overall, we will remain intently focused on running a safe, cost efficient and productive operation, and we remain committed to providing our customers with excellent service and our shareholders with strong financial returns. ","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.","Lance Fritz","Thanks, Rob. As you have heard from the team, we have made great progress in meeting this year's challenges. Our operating metrics have improved to more efficient levels, and our resources are now more closely in line with demand. We will continue our unrelenting focus on operating safely and providing a quality service product for our customers. We will also continue to grow existing business and to establish new markets.","Even so, as Rob said, there are some question marks as we finish 2015 and head towards next year. One uncertainty, of course, is the extension of the positive train control deadline. We continue to believe that Congress will do the right thing for our country and our customers and will vote to extend the deadline. Beyond that, energy prices, the consumer economy, grain markets, the strength of the US dollar, all will be key to future demand. Over the long term, we are well positioned to safely provide our customers with excellent service, while delivering strong value to our shareholders.","So with that, let's open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead with your question.","David Vernon","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Rob or Eric could you help us frame the \u2013 how challenging coal could be next year from a volume outlook if we were to assume kind of normal demand patterns, gas prices kind of staying where they are, are we looking at similar declines as we saw this year or something smaller than that?","Rob Knight","As we said David, coal demand really depends on a couple of major factors. One the competitiveness against natural gas, and so what the outlook for natural gas pricing is, and certainly the weather and certainly export markets will have an impact on the coal market. Now at this point if you look at natural gas futures, there is no discernible improvement in that natural gas pricing. So you would assume natural gas will remain very competitive versus coal. I don't think you would project any improvement of coal market share against natural gas pricing and the weather is always an open factor.","David Vernon","But deterioration, would you expect \u2013 are there things that about your retirements on your fleet or new builds anywhere in the network that will give you some cause for saying that there is going to be material deterioration assuming the competitiveness remains unchanged?","Rob Knight","So, again the main driver is kind of the competitiveness of coal. I think you should also look at the current inventories. The inventories as we mentioned are about 20 days above historical five-year average levels. They are actually about 30 days above last year third quarter levels. So you can assume that there would be some desire of utilities to manage those inventories down to a more normal level.","David Vernon","Okay, great. And then maybe just one quick follow-up on the pricing, obviously we heard a little bit from one of your interchange partners down in the Central South making some discussions on rates to maybe incentivize some coal burn. How do you guys think about that, are you guys changing your thinking about that given the change in competitiveness right now of coal and natural gas?","Lance Fritz","We don't about specific customer issues or specific commercial issues with customers. Our strategy has not changed. We think we have a strong value proposition. We are going to price to the value proposition to generate a return for our company. Our strategy has not changed.","David Vernon","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Good morning. Lance and team, great job on the operating ratio, but now that you are kind of at this 60 level, you maybe talk a little bit about what projects you still have that can improve, obviously we saw tremendous improvement in the velocity during the quarter, is that something that you still see can return to even a couple of year ago levels and there is more room to get that into the 50s, and maybe just talk about what projects you have underway that can keep improving that into the next few years?","Lance Fritz","Sure Ken. Before I turn it over to Cameron for a little more technicolor, like we have answered historically, there are just almost limitless opportunities for us to continue to improve the business. What you saw in the quarter and what we have reported for an average quarterly fluidity reflected in velocity has been accelerating through the quarter. So as we are stepping into the fourth quarter we feel pretty bullish about the ability to continue to make gain.","And the other thing to think aboutfrom a service perspective is while the fluidity of the network at this moment in time looks like it has that any previous period from the standpoint of very good. There are still opportunities in specific service products that we can continue to make strides on. So Cameron, I will give it to you to talk a little bit more specifically about projects for productivity.","Cameron Scott","We continue to see opportunities in a number of different areas, including variable cost control, train length growth, terminal productivity, see greater fuel efficiency, and engineering and mechanically \u2013 efficiency initiative to help squeeze out as much productivity as possible. And we are gaining traction in all of these areas as Rob mentioned.","Ken Hoexter","Great. I appreciate the insight. If I could just have a quick follow-up on the [fuel] pricing, you mentioned that it decelerated to 3.5% from 4%, is that due to more truck competition, I don\u2019t know, Eric, if you mentioned it, I don\u2019t know if their pricing contract's down or what's driving that, but maybe you can dwell into that a little bit.","Rob Knight","Ken, this is Rob. Let me jump on that. A couple of points. One, how we calculate price, very proud of it. That is, we only count what actually moves. So, we calculate the yield, the price. So, the point being, volume has an impact clearly on our reported price. Anything I would say is our attitude. Our focus has not changed at all in terms of our commitment and understanding to drive price as a key contributor to what we've been able to achieve up to this point and it will be a key contributor as we move forward, continuing to get that solid core pricing.","And I wouldn\u2019t read too much, frankly, into the change from the second quarter to third quarter, because there is volume issues, there is the legacy that we called out. And there is some round, we always round the numbers in terms of what we report here. So, there's not as big of a gap if you will from the second to third as you might otherwise think. Again, our commitment and our focus on pricing is unchanged.","Ken Hoexter","I appreciate the comment and insight. Thanks, guys.","Rob Knight","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Jason Seidl","Now, thank you, and good morning everyone. You guys talked a little bit about some of the east coast business not falling back to not all there at least flowing back to the west coast ports. Do you think it's now permanently based on the east now, do you think peoples change their supply their supply chains?","Eric Butler","This is Eric, Jason. Now, we do not. Frankly, as we said last quarter and I think the previous quarter, we do think that ultimately the cheapest best fastest supply chain will win and that still is west coast ports. There are still probably a couple 3% points of share that migrated over to the east coast ports during the port strike that has not migrated back. We think some of that is just some short term risk management, some hedging for the market and retail inventories. But we fully expect that the shortest quickest, most economic supply chain wins in the end and that's the west coast.","Jason Seidl","Okay. Now, that's great color. And Rob, just a quick question on pricing. I think you mentioned that about half a point was due to the legacy mix brought forward, just had. So, as we certain looking out to 16, should start just basing our assumptions on about 3% core pricing?","Rob Knight","Nice try.","Jason Seidl","You can't [blame the guy]?","Rob Knight","No, I get it. I mean, clearly we are saying that you can assume that the legacy is not going to continue, but in terms of what happens underneath or beyond legacy, we haven\u2019t given a precise number of guidance, other than our commitment to core real core pricing gains above inflation. And we're not changing our attitude or focus there. What the number actually ends up being, stay tuned.","Jason Seidl","Sounds good. Guys, I appreciate the time as always.","Rob Knight","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, good morning. You been, I was going to ask a couple of questions on price and I guess is understanding, you are saying you're not changing your approach, but the market can change. And so, I'm wondering whether you perceive that what we heard about from just you and presumably another competitor taking a rate down on call. Do you think that the market is changing in terms of more broadly than that or would you say look there are targeted action that you really shouldn\u2019t read into broadly.","Because I think you're clear on what you're doing, but the market matters as well. I just want to -- what do we think on whether the market is really going to change or not?","Lance Fritz","Tom, this is Lance. Historically, we've always focused on providing an excellent product and then charging for the value that that product represents to our customer base. We faced markets that are very difficult, different headwinds and we faced very robust markets and that philosophy doesn't change. So, we are in a very competitive business. We compete aggressively for the business that we enjoy. And at the same time we expect to receive a price that represents the value that we provide and it has to be reinvestable. All that's real, and all that continues to be real as we look into the future.","Tom Wadewitz","Is it fair, I guess, if we look at you versus the market or competitor how you want to characterize that? Over the last several years, it's probably you've been a little bit willing to give up some volume, I think there were some contract moved away from you in coal in 20 -- I think 2013 and 2014. And so, you say well that's an example of being formant pricing being willing to give up a little volume. Is it fair to say that then your behavior and that willingness to give up a little volume to keep prices, is that way we should view you saying we're continuing with the same thing?","Lance Fritz","Tom, I wouldn\u2019t change my answer to you at all. We expect to be paid for the value that we represent and we expect to be able to reinvest in our business.","Tom Wadewitz","Right, okay. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Rob Salmon","Thanks. To get back off of Kens' earlier question on the productivity front. It was very impressive that you guys were able to pretty much extent train length across the network and environment where volumes were down about 6%. Can you give us a sense of what sort of siding constraints you guys are have across the network and the opportunity to expand that further?","Eric Butler","Both of the train side as you saw there, equates at about 6000 feet and almost 90% of our network is 7200 feet capable. So, we really don\u2019t have any siding constraints and it is up to us to maximize train length and meet customer commitments. So, well, we have a lot of opportunity in that category going forward.","Lance Fritz","Yes. I would add, it's very dependent on the lanes around the network. We still do have targeted capital investment that's oriented towards siding length extensions and being able to increase maximum train length on a particular route over and above what you see as average train length here. So, there are always or right now there are opportunities for us to continue to invest targeted capital to make that happen but we're a far way away from being at our average train length threatening our current siding length.","Rob Salmon","Thanks, really. I appreciate that color. With regard to PTC, Lance, you had briefly alluded to it in the prepared comments. Can you give us a sense of what the impact across the network would be if Congress doesn't extend it, and any lessons that you learned from the massive uptick in volume we saw on 2014 that you could deploy. Because to me, reading the announcement, the press release you guys had put out on the topic, it would impact a substantial amount of the network.","Lance Fritz","Yes. So, Rob, what we've announced, well we said that we would do is there is not an extension. And again, I'm very optimistic that Congress will be prudent and well, has an extension before we have to take any action. But what we've said is around Thanksgiving, in order to remove TIH from our railroad, we would have to start imposing an embargo. And that would be impactful. That means we'd have to stop allowing interchange product onto us of those commodities as well as start working with customers, try to figure out a way for them to ship it an alternative lines.","Also we said as we approached the end of the year, we would start working with our Amtrak as well as the commuter agencies that we host to stop passenger traffic. Both of them would be very bad for the U.S. economy and for commuters. The TIH includes commodities like chlorine, that's used to clean drinking water. It includes products that go into fertilizer and other manufacturing processes. So, that would all have an impact on the U.S. economy. And then you can imagine in a place like Chicago, if the commuter lines were to stop running January 1, what commutes would be like for the 300,000 people a day that rely on those commuter lines.","Rob Salmon","Thanks so much for the time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Tom Kim","Hi, good morning guys. Nice quarter. With regard to the cost side, obviously we're seeing them come down year-and-year but also importantly sequentially. I'm trying to get a sense of like the pace of declines we should be anticipating for the -- the fourth quarter? Do you think the run rate we've seen in Q3, is it a reasonable Q-on-Q?","Lance Fritz","Rob.","Rob Knight","Yes. Tom. I wouldn't take the run rate because we're satisfied that we make great progress, but that was a pretty steep successful decline from the second quarter which we're very proud of. And all I would say to you is we are going to control the things that we can control and as Cam has mentioned we got continuing opportunities while we make great progress, right sizing and realigning the organization; we are not done yet.","We're going to continue to take initiatives to squeeze that out and be as effective as we possibly can. So, the run rate probably will be different but the success of our -- continue to be realigned and look for every opportunities we can to further that productivity initiative will continue.","Tom Kim","Okay that's helpful, thank you. And then -- hearing. And that chuck is our increasingly competitive with the rails. And there is the common suggesting with pricing down for the TL that are potentially conceiving less share. Obviously, that's more of a certainly a remote open. But I'm just wondering with regard to the rest of your book of business, how much could you sort of size up would be potentially at risk of diversion to trucking. I mean, my sense to that be relatively limited but I just would love to hear your thoughts on that.","Rob Knight","Yes. I think if you look at what's going on currently in the trucking environment, the lower fuel cost is allowing trucks to be more competitive vis-a-vis rail just by virtue of that fact. Long term trucks still have the same systemic long term issue that they've always had in terms of driver shortages, some of the productivity headwinds that they have with some of the CSA regulations, the road congestion, etcetera.","So, we are still very confident of our ability to drive truck conversions which we demonstrated even in the third quarter in earning a model business. Certainly trucks are great competitor and there is some competitive impact that we always, [indiscernible] and effort. We are still positive about the position that we are in as a rail and driving conversions from truck to rail.","Lance Fritz","And case and point, you grew domestic intermodal in the third quarter by 1%.","Rob Knight","Right.","Tom Kim","Outside of intermodal, is it much of a threat or something we should be thinking about?","Rob Knight","Trucks are always a competitor. We feel very good about our value proposition and our ability to compete.","Tom Kim","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question. ","Scott Group","Hey, thanks. Good morning guys.","Rob Knight","Good morning.","Scott Group","So, Rob, why don\u2019t you just follow-up your comment about head count in the fourth quarter being down about 1%. Could that imply a slight sequential increase from the third quarter average, even though ended the third quarter a lot lower than the average. I guess I'm just not throughout follow the down 1%. Are you adding head count back in the fourth quarter?","Rob Knight","No. Scott, I just got to take you back. Remember, we had previously guided that we thought we would finish the year flattish with 2014, I think was roughly 48,000 number. What we're saying now given the confidence we have in the progress we've made today is we expect to end the year with the number being down a percent or so. So, I think compared to where we are now, it's flattish but a good volume and other initiatives will dictate exactly where that number lands but okay that's the map.","Cameron Scott","Yes. Our job going forward, Scott, is -- Cameron, continued stay focused on getting the housing order from an operating craft head count. We are also in the process of getting our housing order on a non-agreement perspective. Right, we talked about that in an announcement late in the third quarter. And we've got an opportunity in capital head count particularly in light of Rob's discussion that capital is likely to be down next year. As we exit this year, we got an opportunity to make adjustments there.","Scott Group","Okay. And then, Rob, you said a couple of times I think 4% labor inflation. What does next year look like?","Rob Knight","We haven't finished our planning first next year, Scott, on a number of initiatives. But I think it's safe to say that the labor inflation will be lower than it was this year. Remember, this year we had the double wage, we had other issues that push the labor inflation full year up closer to that we had 5% to 6% in the first half of the year. So, I think it's competent, we're competent, says it's going to be lower than that. Exactly where that number lands at this point in time, again stay tuned.","Scott Group","Okay, great. And just, last just a quick thing on the CapEx. Is your comment that it's going to come down but we may not be able to get it down all the way to 16% of revenue or a lots on table, we could get it even lower than 16%, we just don't know.","Rob Knight","Yes. What I'm saying there is the absolute number we would expect to come down, but it may not be in that 16 to 17 guidance range, yet, because remember this year because of the fall-off in the revenue, driven largely by the fall-off in the fuel surcharge revenue.","And as you know and others know, we don't set our capital plan based on revenue. It's just the kind of guiding marker that we provide to you. So, it's possible that we'll quite make it all the way down to that 16 to 17 depending on how the revenue number looks as we work through our planning process and that's what I am suggesting.","Scott Group","Okay, great. Thank you guys.","Rob Knight","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse group. Please go ahead with your question.","Allison Landry","Good morning. So, I know there has been a lot of questions on price, but thinking about core prices of inflation, I was wondering if you could give us the sense of what overall rail inflation is currently running at?","Rob Knight","Yes. Allison, this Rob. I mean, this year overall inflation again largely driven by that discussion I just had with the labor line is probably in the above three'ish, so maybe slightly higher than three, full year this year. Again, Allison, as you know, we don't set, again that's another marker similar to my discussion on capital. We don't set our pricing based on any one particular period inflation expectation. That's just a marker that we expect to continue to achieve above, that can be lumpy from one quarter to the next or one period to the next. But to answer your question, inflation overall was three-plus'ish this year.","Allison Landry","Okay, that's helpful. And then thinking about intermodal, how much of the decline in the segment stems from your main competitor taking some share back as its network recovers and do you expect a further bleed in the fourth quarter given that the end has opened the northern region and added some new expedited intermodal service from Chicago to the PNW?","Rob Knight","Yes. So, Allison, as we mentioned, the decline in our intermodal space was really in the international and the mobile space. And there is really a number of different dynamics that are going on in that. One is not to complete remigration if you will from east coast to west coast so that that is progressing. One is as you know in the liner steam ship business there is a number of different dynamics going on there with the different alliances and different entities deciding what lanes they're going to put their ships in.","And certainly, kind of the suggested softness in China and other parts of the Asian and them all having the impact on that. So, those are really the drivers in terms of our domestic intermodal franchise. As we mentioned, we grew. This will be the seventh consecutive year of record of volumes. We feel great about our franchise, the position of our franchise and the strength of our franchise.","Allison Landry","Okay. So, just to be clear on your answer, BN has not taken any of the share back that you may have gained last year or that's just not a significant factor?","Cameron Scott","So, as we talked at earlier earnings releases, we did have, I think Rob said a percent to 2% share benefit last year from business with the difficulties at our competitors, we fully expected that to migrate back and elsewhere in a couple of areas, those were intermodal, those were in grain, those were in coal, and we have NRC and those migrate back and backwards aligned with our expectations.","Allison Landry","Okay, great. Thank you, very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please go proceed with your question.","Justin Long","Thanks, and good morning.","Rob Knight","Good morning.","Justin Long","Maybe just a follow up on intermodal again. I know right now you're facing headwind from tough international comps, there is uncertainty in the retail space. So, I was just wondering bigger picture, when do you feel this business can get back to more of a GDP or a GDP plus growth environment versus the declines we've seen year-to-date?","Eric Butler","Eric. Let me take a stab at that. The longer term, we feel very strong, very bullish on the intermodal product in general that in the long run is going to be driven in large part by U.S. consumers and consuming both international product as well as domestic product. It's also predicated on our ability to have a service product that can penetrate against a truck. And all of those secular dynamics are set up positively for the long run.","In terms of dislocations that are happening in the short term, it's hard to time things out. It is very dependent on what happens in the U.S. economy, what the jobs pictures look like what the earning picture for consumers look like, what the U.S. dollar is doing. Adds then to all that, we're focused on controlling what we can control which is an excellent service product. We got the best franchise from a domestic and international intermodal perspective in the U.S. and that will serve us well over the long run.","Justin Long","Okay, great. And maybe then just follow-up on that. Looking at your intermodal business today, I know it varies by lane but what's the average discount for intermodal versus truck in your network today. And longer term, where do you think that percentage could go without causing a significant slowdown in intermodal volume growth?","Eric Butler","Yes. We've said historically, a 15% to 20% as a rough we look on, would be part of our core strategy of course, to minimize that as we increase our value proposition.","Justin Long","Okay, great. I will leave it to that. Thanks for the time.","Eric Butler","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Alex Saraci with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.","Alex Saraci","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, you guys have obviously made a lot of progress on aligning the resources in light of the softer volumes. And I know the volume outlook is uncertain in a lot of areas right now and it's tough to actually point to where and what might drive an acceleration. But should volumes actually start beginning to surprise to the upside in 2016 for whatever reason?","How do we think about your ability to kind of leverage the resources you have right now and do you feel like there is a lot of operating leverage in the business in where your resources are currently or would you anticipate you have to kind of add back pretty aggressively. I know it's kind of depends on what the volumes actually translate but how do we just sort of think about the operating leverage intermodal if volumes actually do surprise the upside?","Lance Fritz","Alex, we would welcome nothing more than a surprise on the upside in terms of volume next year. And we are well positioned to be able to absorb that into the existing network. Cameron has got adequate locomotives and crews ready all around the network to be able to handle an uptick. The fluidity in the network would be able to absorb it rapidly.","He and the operating team have done a great job in terms of getting the terminal and yard productivity up, and we will be able to bring in cars readily into that environment and handle it fluidly. And between Eric and Cameron and the rest of the team, they've done a stupendous job on stabilizing our train plan and making sure that it's robust enough to be able to handle some incremental growth. So, that would have significant leverage for us and we'd welcome it.","Alex Saraci","Okay, that makes sense. And then just my second question here on, you suggested that there are some headwinds in the fourth quarter and that earnings per share would probably be down on a year-over-year basis. Can we kind of can you help us think directionally relative to the kind of 2% decline you saw in the third quarter? Can we expect another similar low single digit decline in the fourth quarter or probably a bit of a worse year-over-year move there, given some of the puts and takes?","Rob Knight","Alex, this is Rob. What I am calling out there, I mean, we'll see how the world actually plays out in terms of volume. But as we look at this point, we're not giving precise earnings guidance. It does look like we're going to have a bigger headwind in the fourth quarter on mix year-over-year and the reason for that is last year's mix actually was quite favorable. And if you look at the business, we were running sand fairly strong, coal was relatively strong, Ag was a pretty positive mix player. And those are things that we just don't see repeating in the fourth quarter.","In addition, as I called out, we see a headwind year-over-year in fuel because last year's fourth quarter we got the benefit of about a nickel of the timing of fuel the fourth quarter last year which we don't see that reporting repeating again this year. So, I am calling out that year-over-year, it does look to us like the fourth quarter does have some bigger challenges than frankly the third quarter did.","Alex Saraci","Okay, that makes sense. Thanks very much for the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee","Hey, thanks, good morning. I want to talk a little bit about the coal network and the outlook for next year. Obviously, still some challenges particularly market share relative to natural gas. When you think about the network, one of your eastern competitors has started to make some changes in terms of the network, that's a little bit more structural in nature. I guess I'm just curious from your perspective how you think about that as you look out to 2016 and maybe beyond, given the coal outlook. Are there things that need to be done there or things you could do to potentially improve that the value proposition there?","Lance Fritz","Chris, before I hand it over to Cameron for a little more technic color, the thing to note about our coal network is it's largely run on a shared network. So, we have made fundamental adjustments in resources that reflect coal being down. You see that in our adjustment to [T&Y] craft, the locomotives, it's also embedded in some of the cars that we've stored. And we're constantly looking at our assets as they are currently deployed to make sure they fit the demand profile for commodity like coal. Cameron?","Cameron Scott","You are exactly right, Lance. And our coal network is truly built out. So, for us it's really more of how we manage the tangible assets around locomotives and crews and we'll continue to do that. Having said that, we'll continue to study the assets around our coal network and react appropriately.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay, that's helpful color, I appreciate it. And then, Rob, just coming back to you on the buyback just for a second. Obviously, you talked about it not being a run rate in the third quarter and that makes complete sense to me, I guess. If you could help us maybe think about how you might be opportunistic going forward, I guess I just want to get maybe a rough sense of maybe how you view that proposition as you think about this quarter and next is in terms of the buyback and the run rate we should be expecting?","Rob Knight","Yes. I mean, Chris, I mean, you probably could. Right, my answer here and everyone would say, I mean, we're not giving precise guidance, because in terms of what we're in buyback. Because if we don't do that, I mean, we certainly value and understand the value of a continued buyback program.","And we kind of walked our talk there. And as we've always said, we will be opportunistic in the marketplace, based on factors like the price of the stock. So, all those are factors in terms of how it will look as we play out into the next several quarters. We will continue to take the same mindset if you will, in terms of how we approach the opportunity and approach how many shares we actually do buyback.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay, that makes sense. Thanks very much guys, I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Bascome Majors","Yes, good morning guys. I want to ask another one on the coal here. How much of the mid team's volume decline that you're tracking towards for this year? Would you attribute to the year-over-year decline in natural gas prices?","Eric Butler","Bascome, this is Eric. It varies. I would say the vast majority of the decline is in some way or the other attributable to natural gas prices. As you know, they are different high sell regions that we operate in and the impact of natural gas is different in those regions. But I would say vast majority is attributable at the end of the day to the competitiveness of coal with natural gas with one other factor and that's being our export coal market, just the worldwide export coal prices, that's also a factor.","Bascome Majors","Understood, I appreciate that. And just to follow-up, I know there is a lot of significant moving parts here, but say natural gas prices are flat next year, so you don't have that magnitude of a year-over-year headwind on that front and winter is normal. Just roughly speaking, what kind of 2016 coal volume outcome are you looking at here? I mean, is this the situation where you could be down double-digits again or is kind of mid-single digits more of what you guys are planning for?","Eric Butler","Hey, Bascome, as I mentioned earlier, one of the other factors that is a factor is the current level of coal inventories that now at the end of the third quarter there are 30 days higher than where they were last year and 20 days higher than the average five year average. So, I would say is their expectation to assume utilities would work those down, not only maybe even to the averages or below the averages, but they're trying to be in inventory management mode.","Bascome Majors","Understood. I appreciate the time this morning. Thank you.","Eric Butler","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Brandon Oglenski","Yes good morning everyone and congrats on the good quarter here. I know cutting budget can be pretty difficult. So, Lance, by my calculation has been about 12 minutes since you got a question on pricing. So, I'm going to come back to it because I honestly think that's probably the biggest concern for your shareholders right now. But I just want to ask a more general question about the industry right now because it's kind of two parts here.","If you look across the industrial landscape, we are definitely seeing deflationary pressure for a lot of your companies. Energy CapEx is likely to be down again next year and obviously commodity prices are a lot lower. So, it's just less value to extract from that supply chain when you think about it holistically. But then, secondly, I mean, the industry obviously has an issue here at PTC, we're late relative to while that was probably poorly written, but none the less in this environment where your customers are facing a lot challenges and we do have regulatory issues, how do we balance the reinvestment to service and the price equation such that we try to keep all the constituents happy?","Lance Fritz","That's an excellent question, Brandon; one that we are constantly working on. Our primary focus, first and foremost is a robust reliable excellent service product and in that context it's making that service product better than the alternatives. That puts us in a position to be able to secure a price premium. And that represents the value of that service product. So, long as we're in that position, then we can handle the rest of the pressure points appropriately.","And when it comes to a regulation, our best defense in a regulatory environment is happy customers and customers that are getting an excellent service product. That won't stop the conflict around the pricing discussions that we have, it won't stop regulators from wanting to find ways to regulate us. But it will stop some of the pressure and that's our biggest defense when we focus on those.","Brandon Oglenski","I appreciate that. And is there risk here though that if we face further declines, which it feels like we are in the fourth quarter, that this whole process just takes a little bit slower pace in terms of where our margin improvement return improvement, just understanding that we have a lot of other pressures across the industrial landscape?","Lance Fritz","We are keenly focused on making sure we generate a really attractive return on our investing capital. Embedded in that is trying to make sure we continue to improve our margins. I think we've outlined today that there are ample opportunities to continue to make that happen. One of them is price, but it's only one of the mechanisms and that's what we're focused on.","Brandon Oglenski","I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question's from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thanks, very much and good morning. So, you cited a high retail inventory levels, the volume impediment for the last couple of quarters and I'm just curious how far along you think we are in drawing down those inventories and putting the inventory correction behind us?","Lance Fritz","Yes. We've actually only mentioned it this quarter and little bit last quarter. So, it really depends on the consumer. Consumer confidence does appear to be strong, it does appear to be a trend where consumers are paying down debt and spending on non-product things like data, internet, healthcare services, etcetera. I do think if you talk to a lot of the BCO's and the retailers, they do have an expectation that with consumer confidence remaining strong, there should be a pickup during the holiday season of sales but time will determine whether or not that happens.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a very quick one on cost. You called out $50 million of inefficiencies last quarter which is down from a $100 million in the first quarter. And wondering what fell in the third quarter, if anything?","Rob Knight","Cherilyn, this is Rob. Yes, we made good progress on that. Remember that marker that I was sharing with you in the first and second quarter was against the previous year and we feel very good about as Cam walked through. We feel very good about the quarter progress we made in better aligning our resources. Having said that, we are not done. I mean, that's last year it wasn't the end of the game.","So, we still see opportunities for us to continue to squeeze out productivity initiatives on multiple fronts and we are going to continue to do that. But in answer to your direct question of compared to what I showed you last quarter on the year-over-year, we made very good progress in taking out those inefficiencies that we showed you in the second quarter.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Okay, thank you. That's my two.","Rob Knight","Thank you, Cherilyn.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of John Barnes, RBC Capital Markets. Please go with your question.","John Barnes","Hey, thank you. And looking at the couple of the kind of car load outlooks on the positive side that you provided, I need the one they are starting to get a little bit of attention is the auto side. I know right now autos' continues to be very strong but with a soar that is at the historical kind of upper end of the range, any concern there that if you see a bit of a correction maybe a normalize level of production.","And especially given the case you mentioned, we got retooling going on at a couple of Mexican facilities for GM and Chrysler. Is there any concern that you start to see maybe some of that growth in the auto sector slack off as we go into the new year?","Rob Knight","Yes, John. I think that's a great question. Certainly as you mentioned, the SAAR's rate is kind of at a barn burner rate. The amount of debt associated with auto loans is that. I think the auto manufacturers would still be pretty bullish because of the features that they think they're providing to the consumer, and the average age of automobiles out there. But the sales rate is at a high number and so that by definition would indicate a little caution and concern.","We don\u2019t have too much concern about model changeovers. There is always model changeovers. We see that year-in year-out. We have the benefit of a very broad diverse autos franchise and somewhere there\u2019s always that happening. So, we don\u2019t see that as too big an issue, but certainly the sales rate, the amount debt associated with sales, you could say something there to watch out for.","Lance Fritz","Hey, John. Regardless of what SAAR is. What we really are pleased with is the UP Automotive franchise. It\u2019s outstanding, it gives us great access to Mexico, products produced in Mexico, gives us great access to the ports of products produced over season imported. And we have an excellent distribution system for finished vehicles on in the Western United States. We're in a very good place when it comes to the automotive franchise.","John Barnes","Yes, no doubt. I\u2019m glad to see you taking advantage of that now. I just with a couple of the other pressure points out there and although having been kind of one of the bright spots I was getting a little nervous about. You need time to see a turnaround, maybe begin to return to normalization. That\u2019s just the reason for the question. One follow-up on the buyback, Rob, you talked about opportunistic in and I\u2019m just kind of curious, have you done buybacks overtime?","Have you ever gone back in and you done a look at the success of your buyback program as maybe a program done a little bit more ratable per quarter a little bit kind of more consistent in terms of the absolute dollar spend or the absolute shares bought back versus maybe timing it a little bit and being more opportunistic in and if you ever looked at that and doesn't that guide you at all in terms of how you approach your buyback effort?","Rob Knight","John, this probably will shock you, but we look at it every day and feel are very comfortable that what we have done to-date works for us. And we're not changing our approach or that how we look at it but I understand the point of your question, but rest assured, we look at what\u2019s the right way to deal with this and we\u2019re confident that we are doing the right thing.","John Barnes","Very good. All right, thanks for your time today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura. Please go ahead with your questions.","Matt Troy","Thank you. Just a housekeeping question. I noticed in your commentary about expenses specifically on comp and benefits. You did not reference and sent it comping crew. The other railroad, it\u2019s been about tailwind to a two and a $0.2 to $0.6 per quarter. I\u2019m just trying to think about forward modeling in fourth quarter, was there a positive impact that you just didn\u2019t call out or is there potentially a larger crew up that we\u2019d expect to see in the fourth quarter as we round the quarter in the yearend?","Rob Knight","Yes, Matt, this is Rob. Yes. I mean, I don\u2019t see any general -- not calling out that there would be any change in terms of the direction we've been and we haven\u2019t changed our approach. And so I don\u2019t anticipate of being any big swing in that.","Matt Troy","Okay, thank you for that. And then just the second question would be on coal longer term. Obviously, the eastern rails have had to or and will have to continue to live under the threat of environmental regulations, which basically coin the question of viability of some of their sourcing basins as well as their customers. Some of the pushback we get from investors and union specific is hey those guys are kind of have to live through it to the next five years.","It\u2019s a long time ahead of us but just wanted to get a sense, have you at very high level looked at whether it\u2019s plants being decommissioned, shutting down, or new gas-fired turbines coming online with your system. What potentially just could be vulnerable of your existing business as we look at over let's call it three to five years basis in terms of just sourcings which is just the viability of certain customers? Thanks.","Eric Butler","Hey Matt, this is Eric. We look at that in depth continuously as part of our strategic and tactical analysis of our market. I would say that at a high level, coal continues to represent ongoing forward probably and necessary minimum third of electrical generation in the U.S. short of some new technology, I'll call it Star Trek technology just for short hand purposes.","Coal, of necessity is going to be a part of the electrical generation of this country for the foreseeable future. And so I think you could perhaps the coal get to a minimum I'll call it a 30% market share but short of some really new generational technology and I think you'll right now for the foreseeable future that\u2019s probably the minimum that will be.","Lance Fritz","Matt, this is Lance. So, I want to provide a little editorial comment as well. I think United States is blessed with the coal reserves that we are and our ability to generate electricity with coal, relatively cleanly, and it\u2019s never been as clean as it is today. It would be a mistake from the U.S. economy perspective, our competitiveness globally to continue to regulate that out artificially. I think we have to work on continuous improvement with the emissions from coal fuel generation, but it would be a mistake to artificially retard that too much.","Matt Troy","Understood. Thanks for the detail everyone.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.","Cleo Zagrean","Good morning and thank you for your time. My first question also on price. Against very strong yield that fuelled this quarter, the relative weakness in automotive and intermodal; could you please comment on the driver there whether it is mainly mix or comparative dynamics and how you expect them to play out into next year? And specifically, do you expect domestic intermodal to grow more strongly than international, with potentially positive impact on price? Thank you.","Rob Knight","Hey, Cleo. The numbers that you see in autos and intermodal from kind of in our yield standpoint is really hindered by the fuel cost surcharge reduction. That's more than a 100% of that impact.","Lance Fritz","And then, your second question was Mexico versus international on intermodal?","Cleo Zagrean","No. Just [indiscernible]. I simply added back an estimated 4% to 5% fuel impact through each of the price boat of ton-mile numbers that we see there and I appreciate that fuel impact would be different across safe categories. But so maybe then you could comment, is that are we missing something by seeing auto and intermodal as weakest in terms of yield but for mile year-on-year? And then my second question was whether domestic should grow faster, domestic overall than international next year and that's get some help to pricing overall from mix perspective. Thank you.","Rob Knight","Quick -- Cleo, this is Rob. Let me take that first question. I would caution you not to just use straight line numbers on it because I think the piece to answer to your question what you're missing, I think what you're missing in that analysis is mix. Mix has an impact within each of the commodity groups in terms of what ends up being reported as average revenue per car on top of each of their individual impacts from the fuel surcharge.","So, I would just caution you that there are differences within each commodity group.","Lance Fritz","Yes. And as you know we are not going to give guidance in terms of pricing in the future. We do think that the domestic intermodal market should continue to have strong pricing opportunities in 2000 and as we go into the future.","Cleo Zagrean","Okay, but faster or slower than international with all the noise we had this year?","Rob Knight","There is a lot of input, a lot of ins and outs that happen. There are lots of dynamics as you know going on in the international intermodal market that are dynamics being driven by other countries and steam ship liner carriers. We feel good about our value proposition. We feel very good about our domestic intermodal franchise and our ability to get price on that.","Cleo Zagrean","Okay, I appreciate that. And the second question relates to CapEx. Can you please remind us of the share that you consider discretionary versus maintenance or require renditions given shifts in the geography of demand and highlight for us those discretionary areas in which it appears prudent with step back this time? Thank you very much.","Rob Knight","Cleo, we've historically said and I don't think it's changed much to kind of maintain what we've currently got is about $2 billion plus minus number and after that it's things like technology, PTC, capacity additions, commercial facilities, new equipment, etcetera.","Cleo Zagrean","Okay. And would you be willing to share any as if you're speaking to an engineer, what areas would you like to you think you see maybe prudent for as best candidate for retrenching next year?","Rob Knight","As we are making our capital plans next year, we're just constantly evaluating both capital productivity in terms of dollar per unit that we put in the ground or buy and where exactly we're putting it. So, I won't make any commentary on exactly what those plans look like.","Cleo Zagrean","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.","Ben Hartford","Thanks, good morning. Rob, a quick question. I just wanted to use your perspective on the risks to continue to return on asset improvement for the rail line. You've done a great job doubling it over the past seven years. We talked a lot about pricing on this call but if you think about just the three simple factors to drive that higher going forward pricing volume growth and service improvement. In your mind, what is the biggest risk or a point of concern from your perspective as it relates to inhibiting continued ROA improvement for the rail lines of those three kind of fundamental inputs?","Rob Knight","Yes. I mean you're exactly right, Ben. That the lever says you've heard us talking as you fully understand the levers that draw this from where we once where to where we are today are productivity which is driven by the service. That sort of has also enabled us to get the right place in the marketplace and volume is always our friend in that calculus.","We are going to control those that we can best control. So, I would say, frankly, the biggest risk I see at this point is that which we have less control on and that's the economy and what that then gives us in terms of volume to play with. But as I've said many times and you've heard us say, we're not going to use the lack there of volume to slow us down on our initiatives to continue to make progress on that which we can control, but that's what we are going to continue to do as we have over the last decade.","Ben Hartford","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Jeff Kauffman","Boy, you guys are popular. Congratulations. Question for Eric, kind of broader picture. As we look at the four areas that are kind of the biggest areas of the volume decline right now, so I will throw coal in there, metals, crude and frac, when are you hopeful that you will start to see positive year-to-year comparisons and then I have a follow-on related to that.","Eric Butler","I think as we've been saying throughout the call, there is uncertainty about the going forward outlook in all of those and I am not sure our prediction will predict us any better than anyone else. Certainly the strong dollar is impacting our metal steel business, our domestic metal steel business, oil prices will be a direct factor in terms of the amount of drilling the amount of crude by rail and then the natural gas will be a direct driver in terms of the amount of coal. So, at those points, an ability to predict those items and that\u2019s right, have any better ability than anybody else in the marketplace to do that.","Jeff Kauffman","Yes. I was just curious in your view, yes. All right. Let me just follow-up on that. The question was asked earlier, you're attacking the variable cost and you are getting a lot more momentum with that. And I think you mentioned we're not going to do much with the fixed cost in the coal network, but as you look at the railroad and how these business units have changed just over the last 12 months, where do you think there are opportunities to attack the fixed cost infrastructure beyond just taking down employees and taking down locomotives and assets dedicated to it?","Lance Fritz","Jeff, this is Lance.","Jeff Kauffman","Yes.","Lance Fritz","I don't think we said we're not going after fixed cost. We focused the commentary on some of the variable cost, but where we have opportunity to for instance reduce our CapEx or for instance reduce the physical footprint of shops that maintain locomotives or other areas like that. We're going to take advantage of those as well.","I think what we were trying to impart is that our coal network is not isolated and independent from our overall network. And so it would be very hard to tease out individual physical assets hard assets that are completely dedicated to coal and isolated on their own.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay. So, hence the shared network term. Lance, thank you.","Lance Fritz","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Don Brown with Avondale Partners. Please go ahead with your question.","Don Brown","Good morning, everyone. Real quick, and I kind of just trying to do some back of the envelope math here in -- look at what has been a 40% decline in fuel and as translated into essentially what is a 7.9% headwind in pricing, if I look at your reduction and yield realized and the core pricing of 3.5% that you stated.","Would that imply that you would even if you were to go flat from the current levels that at least in the early part of next year you would have to -- he was looking at a 16% decline. I feel you'd have to achieve it essentially at 3.2% or higher core pricing in order for pricing realized to be flat?","Lance Fritz","Rob?","Rob Knight","Don, you may have stumped me in terms of the actual numbers that you just worked through because I frankly wasn\u2019t probably --.","Don Brown","Relatively speaking.","Rob Knight","Yes. But I would just say that mix is clearly a factor in that, so just be careful in your analysis to factor that in.","Don Brown","Sure.","Rob Knight","And again, all I would say about the pricing, is, we are going to continue to focus on driving value to our customers, continue to drive productivity and continue to drive price where we can in the marketplace. And we know that the underlying value of our service product to customers is a key component to that and it all kind of hangs together there. So, we're going to continue to focus on driving as much as we can on it.","Don Brown","Well, so, even with the best service available are you going to be able to go to customers whose volumes are down in the high single digit low double-digit range and as far and receive better than 3% pricing?","Lance Fritz","Don, this is Lance. There is never a conversation at our commercial team enters into with the customer on price; that's easy. It doesn't matter if their volumes' up or the volumes' down. So, clearly Eric and his team into the environment that we are in right now have secured what in the third quarter 3.5% coal price and then in the previous quarters as much as 4% coal price. Though none of that came easy or was a layout and I expect them to continue that good hard work into next year's securing an appropriate price for the value that we represent to our customers.","Don Brown","Fair enough, good luck.","Lance Fritz","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments.","Lance Fritz","Thank you very much, Rob. And thank you all for your questions and interest in Union Pacific, this morning. We look forward to talking with you again in January.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you. Mr. Koraleski, you may begin.","John J. Koraleski","Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today in Omaha are Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer; Eric Butler, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Lance Fritz, our Executive Vice President of Operations.","This morning, we're pleased to announce that Union Pacific achieved an all-time record quarter, generating an earnings milestone of $2.37 per share, an increase of 13% compared to the second quarter of 2012.","We managed our network efficiently and continued to show the agility of our strong and diverse franchise. When combined with solid core pricing gains, we more than offset the slight shortfall in volumes, generating a new best-ever quarterly operating ratio of 65.7%, translates into value that we're creating for our customers and increased financial returns for our shareholders.","So with that, let's get started. I'll turn it over to Eric.","Eric L. Butler","Thanks, Jack, and good morning. Let's start with how we're creating value for our customers, the cornerstone of our strategy. It all starts with the industry's best franchise, which provides customers access to diverse and growing markets. Through targeted investments, we continue to enhance this franchise so that we can deliver the best service and support future growth. Our passion for providing excellent service has allowed us to introduce innovative products that not only win business but also secure re-investable returns. And the capstone of our value proposition is our relationship with our customers, a key component that we work hard to develop and maintain.","Today, our value proposition is stronger than ever, as reflected by our customer satisfaction scores, which came in at 93 for the second quarter. We appreciate this recognition from our customers and continue to focus on providing excellent service and strengthening our value offering.","In the second quarter, volume was down about 1% compared to last year as strong growth in Chemicals and solid gains in Automotive were offset by declines in Intermodal and Ag. The drought-related decline in Ag continues to have a significant impact on overall volume. Setting Ag aside, the other 5 groups were up about 1% in total.","Core price improved 4%, with all 6 businesses posting gains. Those pricing gains, along with some positive mix, were the main drivers in the 5% improvement in average revenue per car. With price-driven average revenue per car gains outpacing the volume decline, freight revenue grew 5% to more than $5.1 billion.","Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 groups, starting with the 2 that saw declines. Ag products revenue declined 8%, with second quarter volume down 10% and a 2% improvement in average revenue per car. Last summer's drought continued to impact grain carloadings, with second quarter volumes down 22% from last year. Domestic feed grain shipments declined as tight U.S. corn supply, especially in UP-served territories, led to reductions in livestock feeding and increased sourcing from local crops that are less likely to move by rail. Export feed grain shipments also declined with limited U.S. supply and improved world production. Grain product shipments were down 1% as more DDGs were fed locally, driving a 17% decline in DDG's volume. Ethanol shipments provided some good news, growing 3%, as production picked up to replenish low ethanol inventories.","Food and refrigerated shipments also declined 3% as lower U.S. sugar prices, driven by surplus conditions, reduced sugar imports from Mexico, and restrictions in Russia and China limited U.S. beef and pork exports.","Intermodal revenue was down 1% as a price-driven 2% improvement in average revenue per unit partially offset a 3% decline in volume. The lower volume was due to declines in International Intermodal, where soft West Coast imports reduced shipments by 8%, following strong first quarter gains. With modest retail sales growth, retail has remained cautious about overstocking inventory levels. Volume fared better for Domestic Intermodal, where continued success converting highway business to rail in both dry and refrigerated containers drove volume up 3%.","Automotive volume grew 4%, which combined with an 8% increase in average revenue per car to drive revenue up 12%. Driven by replacement demand, favorable financing and an improving overall economy, vehicle sales continued to gain momentum with the seasonably adjusted annual sales rate reaching $15.9 million in June, the highest level since late 2007. New models offering more features and improved fuel efficiency are compelling consumers to replace aging vehicles. In addition, upticks in housing and construction activity have increased demand for light trucks. While overall auto sales continue to reflect strong growth, our finished vehicle shipments saw a more modest increase, reflecting a 2% gain as select OEMs faced downtime to deal with model changes and new product launches. Parts volume increased 5%. Our pricing gains in the previously mentioned Pacer network logistics management arrangement increased average revenue per car.","Chemicals volume increased 10%, which combined with the 2% improvement in average revenue per car to produce a 12% increase in revenue. Crude oil volume was up 3% from the previous quarter and increased nearly 40% when compared to the second quarter of last year. Growth was driven primarily by increased shipments from Bakken, Western Oklahoma and West Texas shale plays in UP-served terminals in St. James, Louisiana and the Texas Gulf Coast and Arkansas. Our petroleum products and LPG gas business was up 10%, driven by growth in residual fuel oil and asphalt shipments. Strong international demand for potash led to a 7% increase in fertilizer shipments, while most other segments also posted gains, reflecting the continued strength of our Chemicals business.","Turning now to Coal, you can see from the chart of weekly carloadings that the second quarter volumes began to stabilize and finished the quarter a little bit better than flat compared to last year. Core pricing gains led to a 12% improvement in average revenue per car and produced a 12% increase in revenue.","Tonnage from the Southern Powder River Basin increased 1% as declining utility stockpiles and higher natural gas prices improved the demand for coal. Powder River Basin stockpiles are estimated to have declined 21% from their peak in April 2012, swinging from 24 days above normal at that time to about 1 day below normal this May. New business also provided a boost, but these gains were offset by utility outages and the previously mentioned loss of a legacy customer contract at the beginning of the year. Soft domestic demand, a weak international market for Western U.S. coal and mining production issues lifted limited shipments -- limited shipments of Colorado\/Utah coal, with tonnage down 11%.","Industrial Products revenue increased 7%, even as volume remained flat, driven by 6% improvement in average revenue per car. Nonmetallic minerals volume was up 18% as continued growth in shale-related drilling increased frac sand shipments by 24%. Growth in housing starts and residential improvements increased the demand for lumber, with shipments up 11%. Although the housing market continued to strengthen, lumber's pace of growth eased slightly in the second quarter as falling lumber prices, excess inventory and wet weather slowed lumber shipments. On the downside, lower steel production and soft global demand impacted scrap steel, with volume down 17%. Rock shipments declined 5% as local sourcing impacted some of our short-haul business into the Eagle Ford shale play. We also saw a steep decline in military shipments, with reduced deployments and training rotations to facilities on our network.","That wraps up the second quarter, so let's take a look ahead at what we see for the second half of 2013. Our current outlook is for the economy to show some improvement from the sluggishness we've seen in the second quarter. Although we'll continue to face challenges in some markets, our diverse franchise still provides opportunities to grow in others. The diminished 2012 corn crop will continue to impact Ag products in the third quarter, but an improving export wheat market should offer some relief. The pace of decline for Ag Products should ease, with third quarter volumes expected to be down in the lower-single-digit range. We hope to see a return to trend line yields when the new crop -- corn crop comes in later in the year, which should provide some opportunity.","Global Insight has raised their full year light vehicle sales estimate to 15.4 million vehicles from 15.0 million at the beginning of the year, which should be good news for our Automotive business. Crude oil should continue to drive Chemicals growth, but the growth rate will continue to ease against 2012's larger base. Most other chemical markets are expected to remain solid. Moving to coal, the loss of a customer contract at the beginning of the year will continue to impact volumes. While we expect coal lines to increase sequentially in the third quarter, year-over-year volume quote for the quarter will depend upon weather conditions. Industrial Products should also continue to benefit from shale-related growth, with increased drilling activity and a ramp-up in pipeline projects after a slow start to the year. The housing market continues to recover, which is expected to drive demand for lumber. We expect continued success in converting highway business for Domestic Intermodal, and International Intermodal should pick up as the slowly growing economy is expected to produce a positive but somewhat muted peak season.","For the remainder of the year, our strong value proposition and diverse franchise will continue to support business development opportunities across our broad portfolio of business. Assuming an improving economy and a normal summer weather pattern, we expect to finish the full year with a slight volume increase, which, combined with pricing gains, will generate profitable revenue growth.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Lance.","Lance M. Fritz","Thanks, Eric, and good morning. I'll start with our safety performance for the first half of the year. Our year-to-date reportable personal injury rate increased 5% from 2012. However, the number of severe injuries declined to a record low, which reflects our work to reduce risk and the team's deep personal commitment to safety, something we call the courage to care.","Rail equipment incidents or derailments improved 1% versus 2012. Our continued investments to harden our infrastructure, as well as leverage advanced defect detection technology, have driven a reduction in track and equipment-induced derailments.","Moving to public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 3% versus 2012, reflecting our focus on improving or closing high-risk crossings and reinforcing public awareness. Our second quarter rate of 1.85% was a second quarter best and represented a significant improvement over the first quarter performance. Incidence rate -- incident rates improved in each region of our network, including the South, where there is a higher grade crossing density than our overall network.","Moving on to network performance, in the second quarter, the network remained fluid, but it does have room for improvement. Overall, velocity was down 3%, and terminal dwell was up 4% in the quarter, both adversely impacted by weather interruptions and heat-induced slow orders in the southwestern portion of the network. Increased track renewal programs in high-volume quarters also played a role. Weather challenges included flooding that impacted major gateways in Chicago, St. Louis and Eagle Pass, Texas. As a result, we saw a 25% increase in the number of days with major service interruptions versus the second quarter of last year. Infrastructure investments that enhanced our agility and resiliency enabled us to rapidly recover after each incident, reducing the impact from these events. Overall, our network remains solid and well positioned to handle volume growth. We continue to provide outstanding local service to our customers with a best-ever 96% Industry Spot & Pull, which measures the delivery or pulling of a car to or from a customer.","Our Service Delivery Index, the measure of how well we are meeting overall customer commitments, declined modestly compared to the second quarter of 2012. Half of the decline can be attributed to tighter service commitments to our customers and the effects of traffic mix changes. Despite these challenges, we achieved sequential improvement in both service delivery and terminal dwell compared to the first quarter. Solid network fundamentals position us to operate at improved service levels going forward. We are continuing to increase capacity across our network, most notably in the South, where volumes have rebounded to prerecession levels.","Moving on to network productivity, slow order miles declined almost 30% to a best-ever second quarter level. We've made substantial advancements in the South with process improvements that allow us to maintain the railroad while providing value-added service levels. As a result, our network is in excellent shape, reflecting the investment in replacement capital that has hardened our infrastructure and reduced service failures.","We continue to leverage existing resources in growth markets, as well as realize efficiencies in more challenging segments. During the second quarter, we turned the 4% growth in Automotive volumes into an average train size increase of 2%, running an all-time quarterly record of 65 cars per train during the quarter. And despite the 22% decline in grain volumes, we were able to run near-record second quarter grain train lengths, with manifest and coal train lengths falling just short of quarterly records. Intermodal train sizes reflect the challenge of an 8% dip in International volume.","We continue to find ways to utilize assets more effectively through process improvement and targeted capital investment. A good example of this is the Fort Worth terminal, which is a major network yard that supports Texas oil and gas fields, Mexico, the automotive network and construction markets. UP Way uses process improvement tools like value stream mapping and the A3 problem-solving process to find and apply countermeasures for process bottlenecks and service failures. More importantly, it engages those doing the work in generating these countermeasures, collecting and focusing the power of the team. Through our UP Way initiatives, we are handling substantially more cars through a key network yard in Fort Worth at better service levels.","Our capital investment strategy also plays a vital role. Our targeted 2013 capital spend is still around the $3.6 billion mark. About $2 billion of that is replacement capital, with most of that to renew our track infrastructure. We're on target for the year as more than half of that program work is now complete. Spending for service, growth and productivity will total around $1 billion. Capacity, commercial facilities and equipment are the primary drivers. Spending on positive train control will total $450 million for the year. Major projects include work on the Santa Teresa, New Mexico rail facility, which is slated to open in early 2014. This year's progress on the Sunset Corridor includes about 30 miles of double track. Additionally, our capacity expansion plans in the South are increasing more than threefold from spending levels in 2011, helping support the efficient movement of growing volumes in that region. We're adding sightings, expanding terminals, double-tracking some routes and upgrading signals. We're also purchasing 100 locomotives, 900 freight cars, as well as some domestic containers to replace units currently on lease or being retired.","It's important to note that all of these projects have a positive safety impact, whether it's replacement or service and growth capital. And the growth capital must meet aggressive return thresholds or we just will not pursue the project.","Let me wrap it up. We remain optimistic on our operating outlook for the second half of the year and our ability to realize network improvements on various fronts. We remain steadfast in our commitment to operate a safer and more efficient railroad for the benefit of our employees, customers, the public and shareholders. We remain agile, managing network resources in response to dynamic market shifts and unexpected events. The network is strong and fluid, capable of handling volume growth at safe, efficient and reliable service levels. Our continuous improvement efforts and particularly, the UP Way will continue to generate process improvements that add value for all of our stakeholders.","To support our growth initiatives, we will continue to make smart capital investments that generate attractive returns, all of which will continue to enhance our overall value proposition.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert M. Knight","Thanks, Lance, and good morning. Let's start with a quick recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue grew 5% to an all-time quarterly record of nearly $5.5 billion, driven mainly by solid core pricing gains.","Operating expense totaled $3.6 billion, increasing 3%. Operating income grew 9% to $1.9 billion, also getting a best-ever quarterly mark.","Below the line, other income totaled $23 million, up $2 million compared to 2012. For the full year, we're still projecting other income to be in the $100 million to $120 million range, barring any unusual adjustments.","Interest expense of $133 million was $2 million lower than last year, while income tax expense increased to $662 million, driven by higher pretax earnings.","Net income grew 10% versus 2012, while the outstanding share balance declined 2% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce a best-ever quarterly earnings record of $2.37 per share, up 13% versus 2012.","Turning to our top line, freight revenue grew 5% to more than $5.1 billion. Solid core pricing gains of 4% and positive mix of about 2 points, driven by a decline in lower average revenue per car Intermodal shipments, more than offset the slight decline in volume levels. In addition, fuel surcharge revenue was down from last year due to a lower average diesel fuel price and lower volumes.","Moving on to the expense side, Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which was up 3% compared to 2012. Inflationary pressures of about 2.5%, combined with shifts in traffic mix to more manifest business, which requires additional employees, drove the quarterly increase. Lower volume costs and productivity gains partially offset these increases.","Workforce levels increased 2% in the quarter. About half of the increase was driven by capital projects, including positive train control activity. The other half was driven by a shift in traffic mix that I just discussed.","Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $863 million, decreasing $19 million versus 2012. A 3% decline in the average diesel fuel price drove the reduction in the cost. Gross ton miles were essentially flat compared to last year. Conversely, our consumption rate increased 2% compared to 2012.","Moving on to other expense categories. Purchase, services and materials expense increased 8% to $585 million due to higher locomotive and freight car contract repair expenses and joint facility maintenance expenses. As we discussed in April, we continue to incur logistics management fees associated with the new Pacer agreement, which are recouped in our Automotive freight revenue line.","Depreciation expense increased 1% to $438 million. The impact of increased capital spending in recent years was partially offset by a new equipment rate study that we discussed with you earlier this year. Looking at the full year 2013, we now expect depreciation expense to be up in the 1% to 2% range versus 2012 due to the timing of asset purchases and project work completion.","Slide 25 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $302 million, up 1% compared to 2012. Increased container expenses associated with the new Pacer contract and growth in automotive shipments drove higher freight car rental expense. Lower freight car and locomotive lease expense partially offset these increases.","Other expenses came in at $219 million, up $29 million versus last year. Despite the long-term improvement trend in our safety performance, personal injury expense increased compared to a tough comp last year. Our recent actuarial study resulted in a smaller reduction to our estimate for prior year activity compared with the second quarter of last year. In addition, higher operating taxes and freight and property damage costs also drove expenses up compared to 2012. For the second half of this year, we still expect the other expense line to average around $225 million a quarter, barring any unusual items.","Turning to our operating ratio performance, we achieved an all-time best operating ratio of 65.7% this quarter, improving 1.3 points compared to last year. Our performance highlights the positive impact of solid core pricing gains and network efficiencies despite the slight shortfall in volumes. Looking ahead, we remain committed to achieving a full year sub-65 operating ratio by 2017.","Union Pacific's record first half earnings drove strong cash from operations of more than $3.2 billion, up 16% compared to 2012. Free cash flow of $833 million reflects the growing profitability of the franchise, more than offsetting the 12% increase in cash dividend payments versus 2012. Our balance sheet remains strong, supporting our investment-grade credit rating. At quarter end, our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio was roughly 40%.","Opportunistic share repurchases continue to play an important role in our balanced approach to cash allocation. In the second quarter, we bought back nearly 3.1 million shares, totaling $463 million. Since 2007, we've repurchased over 97 million shares at an average price of around $82 per share. Looking ahead, we have about 9 million shares remaining under our current authorization, which expires March 31, 2014.","So that's a recap of our second quarter results. Looking at the remainder of the year, the economy will be a key driving factor. Assuming an improving economy and summer weather conditions that will drive coal demand and fall crop harvest yields, we're projecting positive volume growth for the second half of the year, which should bring full year volumes to the positive side of the ledger.","In the third quarter, we'll continue to see a year-over-year decline in our Ag volumes, however, not at the magnitude that we saw in the second quarter. As for our coal shipments, summer weather will be the determining factor. In addition, we'll have to see how consumer sentiment and the economy impact the Intermodal peak season this year. However, we do think there are continued growth opportunities in other market sectors that have the potential to offset these uncertainties.","Combined with continued real core pricing gains and our ability to leverage our diverse franchise, we expect to achieve yet another record financial year with best-ever marks in earnings and operating ratio. We're well positioned through the first half of this year. Regardless of the hand that the economy deals us, we'll remain focused on our ability to generate improving returns required to strengthen and enhance our network, create value for our customers and drive increased returns for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Jack.","John J. Koraleski","Thanks, Rob. As we move into the second half of the year, the economic outlook remains uncertain. But from our perspective, the underlying economy in the second quarter seemed somewhat weaker than it did in the first quarter. We're hopeful that we'll see some economic improvement in the months ahead.","We are well positioned with our diverse franchise, our strong value proposition and our excellent service offerings while remaining agile in today's changing environment. We'll continue focusing on re-investable pricing, attracting new, profitable growth opportunities and running a safe, efficient and reliable network that generates greater value for both our customers and our shareholders going forward.","With that, we'll open up the phones for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe first, a question on the Coal business. You saw a nice sequential step-up in the coal yields there. I guess I'm just kind of trying to think about how we should be thinking about the mix of what was previously priced legacy business and maybe what is kind of a current run rate business as we think out into the back half of the year. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of maybe what the mix factors could be when we look at the Coal business in the second half of 2013.","John J. Koraleski","Chris, if you look at it, I think we have a $350 million in legacy up for renewal this year, and we retained about 80% of that. Majority of that was Coal business. There's really nothing significantly changing as we go forward for the balance of the year. And the mix impact that you're going to see is really going to be dependent on the coal burn in the various customer regions and zones. So there's really not much more clarification. Eric, do you have anything to add to that?","Eric L. Butler","No.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. I guess I'm just trying to maybe get a sense. You lost the contract earlier in the year, which, I think, that you had mentioned was about 5% of the business. So it would seem that the underlying business is obviously doing better than kind of the flattish volumes you're seeing there. But that's helpful. Maybe switching gears with a follow-up, just on the back of crude-by-rail, when you think about the tightening differentials on WTI versus Brent, have you seen a deceleration in the pace of activity at St. James, for instance? Just trying to get a sense of how we should be thinking about the sequential pace of crude-by-rail on the back half.","John J. Koraleski","We really haven't seen any impact at St. James. We have had seen some minor impact in our Texas business, where there's a lot of pipelines. Eric, do you want to...","Eric L. Butler","Yes. The intrastate Texas short-haul business, we always take opportunistic opportunities to move some of that, which is pretty directly competitive to pipeline given the fact that it's pretty short-haul stuff. And so we've seen some decline in that. But for -- that's really nominal. For our base book of long-haul, Bakken, the St. James business, we feel pretty good about the continued opportunities with that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","So I wanted to first just follow up on Coal. So if I remember earlier in the year, you guys were guiding to slight declines in Coal volumes for the full year, and I guess the implication was positive volumes in the back half of the year. It seems like you've got maybe less visibility to Coal now. I just want to understand that. Are you no longer confident that you're going to have positive Coal in the full second half of the year?","John J. Koraleski","Go ahead, Rob.","Robert M. Knight","Scott, we haven't changed our guidance, where we said that for the full year, that we still think Coal's going to be slightly down, given all the factors and given the fact that it was down 19% in the first quarter. So that does imply -- with the flat performance in the second quarter, that does imply strengthening in the back half. Where we're saying there's lack of clarity, if you will, is, as always, weather will be a huge factor in how the summer burn plays out in our Coal business. And as Eric pointed out, at this point in time, inventories are about 2 days lower than normal, so we're well positioned if the weather, in fact, cooperates.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","We're getting killed in New York with heat. How is the weather cooperating in your territories right now?","John J. Koraleski","Well, it's going to be 97 degrees in Omaha today, so we're doing high fives. But so far, at least, for the summer, it's been okay, was actually a cooler spring than what we had hoped for. But the summer has heated up nicely, and we're hoping that that's going to stay through the balance of the season.","Robert M. Knight","Yes, I want to add that the Energy Department has put out estimates that suggest that electrical generation demand will be down 4% in the second half of the year. They probably don't have any better crystal ball than we do in terms of weather impacts, but that is the data point that's out there.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And just second question, why is International Intermodal so weak? Is there share losses to BN? And do you think it's just the West Coast ports losing any share? They just seem surprisingly weak, and I wanted to get an explanation for it and how you think that plays out in terms of peak season.","John J. Koraleski","Part of it may be they were surprisingly strong in the first quarter. But, Eric, you can clarify that.","Eric L. Butler","Yes. So our first quarter was strong, if you recall. There's always significant competition between all of the ports up and down the West Coast and between ourselves and our competitors, but there's no significant share swings that have occurred. The real fundamental issue is retail indicators in this country, retail sales have really been mixed. And you could argue even in the second quarter, they looked like they have softened a bit. Supply chain manufacturers and retailers are continuing to thin out the supply chain and trying to squeeze out inventories. So you have actually seen lower volumes coming into all of the West Coast ports from Asia. Certainly, what's going on in China might also have an impact to that. Certainly, near-sourcing to Mexico might have an impact to that. But you have seen lower volumes into all of the West Coast ports in the second quarter.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","So why do you have improved international peak as a positive in the second half?","Eric L. Butler","Well, if you look at -- again, what we've said is the economy is what our outlook is dependent upon. If you look at inventory, if you look at some of the sentiment, it does suggest that later in the third quarter, the fourth quarter, there should be decent consumer sentiment for a strong retail season. If that happens, you will need to move the business because there are not a lot of inventories out there, so that would suggest a pickup from where we are today.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to ask you about the kind of look on coal beyond second half of this year and the weather comments. But if you look into 2014 and 2015, have you seen a kind of, I guess, new indication from utilities that there are more coal plants being scheduled for shutdown, or is that pretty much status quo? And when you look at that, would you say, hey, there might be some impact in 2014 to demand from coal plant shutdowns, or do you think that's not going to be much of an effect?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","So as we discussed previously, coal shutdown plants in any amount that you might see, really, is not a factor because there's more capacity than demand. And you might hear about shutdowns that just kind of match capacity and demand. The key issue is what market share coal has. Coal is hanging in there pretty solidly at the 38%, 39% market share of total electrical generation. We see nothing on the horizon that's going to substantially change it. Certainly, there could be some environmental regulatory thing that could change that. But right now, from a business economic standpoint, we see nothing on the horizon that's going to change that.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then one on crude-by-rail, you commented on, I guess, the near-term trend. It sounds like there's somewhat negative impact on the short-haul business but really not in St. James. What about customer investment activity and the discussions that you're having that would kind of indicate how new terminals will be opened up looking out the next year or 2? Is there a change in discussions? Are customers kind of slowing things down at all? Or is it pretty much the same as what you saw before, when crude spreads were wider?","Eric L. Butler","So actually, customer investment in destination terminals is expanding both -- in St. James, there's a project well underway to expand that capacity. But more importantly, we've talked about this in the past. If you look at what's going on in California, there's significant activity in terms of expansion of destination terminals in California. We've mentioned before, California is going to have a significant short-haul. Their local crude production is declining. Alaska's slope is declining. And so they're looking to source from Canada, from the Bakken and also from the Niobrara and also Permian, and so they need destination terminals in California. And there's a significant activity, significant investment going on. Some has been public, some is not.","John J. Koraleski","Yes, we have seen no diminishing in the enthusiasm for customer investment in the oil business.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","In spite of a relatively modest revenue growth rate, the OR this quarter was very impressive, I think, by any measure. And if we look at kind of how things change sequentially, typically, your third quarter is the best. And I know you don't give guidance, so we're not sort of looking for that. But if you think about kind of anything in the third quarter or on a sequential basis, that means that we need to keep in mind something that's going to cause you now to be off. Is there anything that you look at in this upcoming third quarter or even relative to last year that's important for us to bear in mind? Because this was pretty impressive and suggests that the long-term guidance will be achieved early.","John J. Koraleski","Bill, we don't see anything in the third quarter that would -- that we would consider to be unusual. There's always, in the rail business, unforeseens that could happen. But at this point in time, we really don't have anything substantive. Rob or Lance?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. Bill, I would just say that one thing to keep in mind is always a factor in our business is mix. Obviously, it can have a factor and so can fuel prices. I mean, if fuel price is up or down, that can obviously have an impact. But no, there's nothing directionally that's going to change our commitment to continue to make progress on our operating ratio commitments.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. Now if you think about these long-term OR goals that you have, the ROIC has gotten to pretty good levels, certainly relative to history. How do you think about the implications over time of being above the cost of capital? Is that -- do we have to start thinking about regulatory risks yet, or is this -- are we not really there?","Robert M. Knight","Well, Bill, as you've heard us say all along, I mean, we're proud of the fact that we've improved our returns. We're going to continue to reinvest in the business, which is how we are able to reinvest as much capital as we do. And as you've heard me say many times, if you look at our calculation of our returns on a replacement basis, our returns are around -- Coal at 7%-ish. So clearly, room for us to continue to improve that on a natural replacement cost calculation. So we're going to -- we're not going to change our behavior. We'll continue to run a safe, efficient network and price to value, where we add value to our customers, and continue to move forward in our returns so that we can continue to make these capital investments that we'd like to make.","John J. Koraleski","Yes, Bill, every chance I get in Washington, D.C., my message is very, very clear that while we earning good financial returns, we are investing record amounts of capital. We're providing great value and service for our customers. And on a replacement cost basis, we're still not in the ballpark of where we need to be. And I think that message has been well reserved -- has been well received, particularly given that customers are relatively satisfied with our service offerings.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I was curious on coal yields here when I look at things on an RPU basis. I mean, we saw volumes up nicely this quarter versus what we've seen at least for the past few quarters, and RPU declined sequentially. And I'm just trying to get an idea as we look out to the back half and expect improvement from a volume standpoint year-over-year. How much of the prior legacy flow-through should influence RPU? And would I be smart to expect stable, flat or down? And obviously, I'm assuming that we get a decent burn going on this summer and that volumes do increase on a year-over-year basis.","John J. Koraleski","Okay. Rob, do you want to take a shot at that?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. Justin, I mean, the simple answer to your question is it's difficult to give guidance on what you're asking in terms of the average revenue per car because mix plays as a key factor in that. But you're right. Sequentially, the average revenue per car did come down, and it's driven primarily by the mix effect that Eric talked about, where volumes, as an example, were off 11% in our Colorado\/Utah business, for example, while PRB was up in the quarter. So that's an example of the mix effect. In terms of the pricing underlying what's happening in the Coal business, there's no directional change. We renewed those legacy contracts that Jack talked about, and that should flow through to the balance of the year. So there's no change in that element of the average revenue per car, but the mix effect and the volume associated with those repriced contracts will clearly play a role as we move forward.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And maybe a little bit on the longer-term view as we look out to the petrochemical projects that are coming online in your Southern Corridor. Curious how we should be thinking about the timing. I know there's at least one cracker in 2014, and most of the rest of the stuff is beyond '14. But what's the timing of that project, and how meaningful would you expect loads to start coming on in 2014 from that?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","As you're talking about the expansion of the chemicals production capacity due to low natural gas prices, I think there are roughly 8 announced plant expansions. Most of those have turnover to operation dates, I think, in 2016 or beyond. And so we are working with them now in terms of developing transportation alternatives, working with many of those customers and try -- and helping them shift their inbound construction materials to build the facilities. But I think most of those will be late '15, early '16 or later.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I think there was one, the Gruppo Mossi project, that had an estimated completion in 2014. So I was curious as to what kind of production you would expect that to see. And I know that one that you guys have called out before in presentations.","Eric L. Butler","Yes, we don't -- as you know, we don't list production from individual plants and individual customers. We do have a very strong Chemicals franchise with a lot of great value, and we believe that there's upside. I think what we might have called out in the past about the Gruppo Mossi facility was a 2016 start. I think that's what we called out. But we don't list individual opportunities in individual plants, but we are excited about all of the upside.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You talked earlier about International Intermodal. If I can switch to Domestic Intermodal, you're looking at -- I guess volumes were up about 3%. Would you anticipate that to grow faster on that? I mean, you've talked about it. I think it was about 10 million addressable loads plus, I think, out of 2 or 3 from Mexico. Do you expect the conversion rate to pick up, or is the 3% kind of your targeted run rate?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","So as we look at Domestic Intermodal, it's a rich target area. I mean, we have said publicly that there's probably 9 million, 10 million loads that can be converted from truck to rail. We have, we believe, the strongest North-South Mexico franchise. We have 6 border points. Truck business to and from U.S. and Mexico is growing rapidly this year, so we think there's a rich target area. We have a number of strategies and initiatives that we're-- we have underway with our partners in the Intermodal industry to convert more truck to rail. And so we think there's lots of upside. Converting, there are a lot of issues and a lot of things that need to be done to do that effective conversion. So I'm not sure I will give a roadmap in terms of what the number will be at what period of time, but we continue to believe there's significant upside in the Domestic Intermodal market.","John J. Koraleski","I'm pretty excited, Ken, about the opportunity that we'll have in 2014 with the opening of our new facility in Santa Teresa to be able to take -- in addition to that 10 million truckloads, there's another 3 between the U.S. and Mexico. And that facility is going to really -- we're going to really focus on that and target that. So we're looking forward to having that facility up and running here in 2014.","Eric L. Butler","And I'd like to make one other data point. The new trucking CSA rule that went into effect July 1, we're not really seeing any impact from that right now, but we do expect over time that there will be an impact from that, which will make rail more competitive -- Intermodal more competitive.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You're talking about hours of service, right?","Eric L. Butler","Yes.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I guess my other question is -- I think Rob mentioned during his speech that more manifest will drive a need for more employees. Should we see that pace accelerate, given some of the comments on the areas you're targeting, whether it's crude-by-rail or some of the other areas that might be more manifest? Should we see that pace of employees pick up now?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Ken, it depends on the volumes, and the mix is a part of it, but I go back to our original guidance on headcount. We sort of put capital aside because, as I commented, some of our headcount was earmarked on the capital and specifically how the trains go. But if you look at our -- our net headcount should flow with volumes. So if volume is slightly up, I would expect headcount net to be slightly up. If volume is going to be slightly down, for example, which I don't hope -- I don't want that to happen, but if that were to happen, we expect headcount to be down, all of which not one for one because there is productivity in there. So I think while manifest itself carries with it a little bit more labor intensity, when you step back and look at it enterprise-wide, that doesn't change our view on our headcount guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse Group.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you could provide any detail on the volumes that were associated with the utility outages and the new business that you mentioned for the Coal business. And specifically, did the new business that you were talking about include any legacy Coal business that was repriced for 2012 but did not move?","John J. Koraleski","Eric? Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Allison, if I understand your question you're asking, in the second quarter, what was the impact of some of the legacy repricing -- business that did not move, let me attempt to answer, and if I don't answer it correctly what you're asking, come back. We have previously said that as we reprice contracts, if the volume doesn't move, and we called this out in the second -- excuse me, in the first quarter that we didn't get Coal at 0.5 point price because the repriced business, the volume was down. We're still experiencing that. Now while we had sequential improvement in our volumes in our Coal business, it's still not at the rate that -- the full load rate, if you will, back to historical levels. So I would summarize by saying that if Coal volumes were to tick back up to historical levels, there's still some upside opportunity there. And depending on when it actually happens, it may or may not show up in how we report our pricing, but rest assured it would show up in our margins.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And is there any volume number that you could give us for the utility outage that you mentioned?","Eric L. Butler","No. I mean, it's in our numbers. It's in the mix of our numbers. We don't call that out specifically.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then my follow-up question on crude-by-rail. You talked a lot about the destination side of the equation. But I was wondering if you could speak to production ramping up in the Niobrara and how many rail facilities that you might serve there on the origination side.","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. So as you know, production in Niobrara is ramping up, but it still is at much lower levels than what you see out of Bakken or out of some of the Canadian areas. There are -- in terms of new -- or our customers and destination origin terminal owners, there are a number of large projects underway. I'm not going to call out the specifics, but a number of large projects, both on ourselves and on our competitors, that are underway in terms of origin facilities out of the Niobrara. Those are really targeted to move Niobrara product into California.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to follow up from the question that Ken was asking on Intermodal. You guys mentioned your new Santa Teresa facility that you are ramping up. Does that mean that Ferromex is going to jump a little bit more aggressively into the cross-border Intermodal business with partnership with UP?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. So our Santa Teresa facility that Jack was talking about is targeted to open in the first quarter of next year. That facility is on UP, and that'll do a number of things for us. But one of the things that it'll do is it'll help us really penetrate the maquiladora market that is just south of the border and moving their products to destination in the U.S. by long-haul truck. We'll be able to convert that to Intermodal and move to Intermodal. And so that's not really an FXE play. It would not surprise me if the FXE is interested in growing the Intermodal business. They have a great franchise, as does the KCSM. And as I said before, there's a rich target opportunity there in terms of Intermodal, particularly to and from Mexico. So it would not surprise me if that were the case.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And maybe, Eric or Jack, if you guys want to respond to this one as well. But I think the risk that could develop here is if the slow economy continues, do you think that Union Pacific can continue driving core pricing growth in the 4% range? I know there was some legacy contracts last year you're giving a little bit more benefit this year. But it's our understanding that you don't have a significant book of business to reprice early in 2014. So do you envision that, if things kind of continue at the 2Q pace, you could maintain that level of pricing growth? Or is there a little bit of risk to the economy there as well?","John J. Koraleski","Okay. Rob, go ahead.","Robert M. Knight","Yes, Brandon, let me just remind everyone what we've said. Again, we haven't given guidance on specific pricing number other than to say that we're confident we can still get real pricing, which some and many have defined that as sort of inflation-plus kind of pricing. But as we talked before, we're focused on making sure that every piece of business is re-investable. But to your point of legacy, I have called out that 2014 is a \"legacy-light\" year. But that doesn't change our overall focus on pricing and our commitment to get that real core pricing gain.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Troy with Susquehanna.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Given the market's evident enthusiasm with the Mexican business, as evidenced by Kansas City Southern's multiple, it's always worth noting you guys have an absolute basis and equally sized -- somewhat equally sized Mexican business. Perhaps if you could just talk about, I know we've touched on Intermodal, but some of the growth that you saw in the second quarter, how that business is trending in terms of near-shoring and business development. What does the pipeline look like in terms of what might be coming online in Mexico to drive further and future growth?","John J. Koraleski","Sure. Eric?","Eric L. Butler","So we are very excited about the Mexico market. And as you may or may not know, we are still the Kansas City Southern de Mexico, KCSM, largest interline partner to and from Mexico. So we're excited about the franchise. We are excited about all of the opportunities. There's immense growth on the Auto side of the business. There are a number of different automotive facilities that are being built and expanded in Mexico. And between the KCSM and the FXE joining with the UP franchise, that's a sweet spot for us. The Mexican grain business is always very strong for us. With the drought last year, we have seen some weakness. But as you have normal crop yields, that is always a target area for us. And then Intermodal is really kind of the untapped area. There is a significant amount of Intermodal today in terms of -- for the auto manufacturers, but if you take the auto manufacturers out of the mix, there's Mexican North-South truck moves, and we believe that that's an untapped area for us to penetrate and grow our Mexico business. So we're very excited about Mexico.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Excellent. I guess my follow-up question will be longer term. We're starting to hear and see conceptual schematics and models of natural gas-powered locomotives. Certainly, the manufacturers are starting to talk about it more and potential for savings operationally of 20%, 30% in terms of running cost. Again, this is all kind of theoretical at this point. But to what extent are you examining natural gas locomotives, beta testing, where are you in that? And realistically, what might be a time frame to see something deployed on a commercial basis?","John J. Koraleski","Sure. Lance?","Lance M. Fritz","Sure, yes. So there is a lot of work both at Union Pacific and in the industry on natural gas-powered locomotives. We are positioning ourselves right now to start running some beta testing. We have been partnered up with CN. They used some of our equipment when they were beta testing and have seen their results. It is not a layup from the standpoint of earning a reasonable return out of the investment necessary to convert to natural gas. There's a significant capital footprint on the network, and there's also a significant capital put into the rolling stock so that you can have tenders behind locomotives. However, it looks promising, so we're investigating and pursuing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","My question is on the Agricultural business. 2Q '13 volumes, I think, were the second lowest going back to 2007. And so 2 questions, really. Has there any -- has there been any change other than, say, the droughts on your network with either customers coming on or off the network? And then secondly, what have been the implications for you from an expense standpoint, and how does that resolve itself as volumes eventually come back?","John J. Koraleski","Okay. Eric?","Eric L. Butler","So let me talk about kind of the network. We actually have been expanding our Ag network footprint as we've gone through the drought period. We have invested and have created with our customers more originations, and we have expanded our capability in terms of running larger, more efficient trains in our network. So while the drought has been underway, we have actually positioned ourselves for the future to grow the business. If you look at the Ag business, yes, it was near record lows, but there are a couple of factors. We had the drought. We also had, during this time, don't forget, we had the Russian and Chinese governments putting bans on some of our exports. We had our sugar exports being impacted also in terms of -- from Mexico. So all of those factors have impacted the volumes while we've had this drought. In terms of our corn crop, everyone is focused on, so it's almost like a perfect storm. But we feel pretty good about the future. Assuming normal trend line yields, our network is probably in better shape now than we were going into it in terms of being able to handle the upside.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A quick question on the core pricing gains of 4%. As we look into the back half of the year, sort of all things being equal, if you do get that lift from domestic coal, if weather does cooperate, will--could we see the core pricing numbers go up because of the previous legacy renewals?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Yes, Jason, you could. I mean, just the math of it is as those, some of those legacy contracts that we repriced, if the volume increases, that's a benefit for us this year. So we'll have to see how it plays out.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And sticking with the Coal theme for my follow-up, how is the PRB looking in terms of sort of going to get some Eastern burn going forward? I know we've seen a little bit of a switch out from some of the Eastern plants Illinois[ph] basin. Is there any room for PRB to pick up some steam?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","No. Eastern utilities, they have a choice between PRB. They have a choice between Illinois coal. They have a choice between Central Appalachian coal. And the decision is really different for different utilities based on where they are in terms of the scrubbers and other environmental investments that they've made, the materials that they would need to cleanse the coal, like lime. So I mean, it's a different equation for every utility, and I think every utility is looking at that equation and the mix of what they want to do. In that context, we are continuing to have discussions with Eastern utilities.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","But do you think there's a good chance that that could pick up in the future?","Eric L. Butler","Eastern utilities, they're making these decisions. They're investigating Southern Powder River Basin coal as one of numerous options. We are excited about that. We want to facilitate that, but there are a lot of factors that go into their decisions.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Rob, would you care to talk about the magnitude of the fuel surcharge lag impact in the quarter? Could you kindly hang a number on that for us?","Robert M. Knight","Yes, John, I'd say it was a tailwind that, when you consider the recovery of the lag, the price of fuel, et cetera, it was a tailwind of $0.01 or so.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And so not a major factor in the quarter?","Robert M. Knight","Right.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then also, on the expense side, in a world where volumes were down 0.5% to 1%, expenses were up 3%, which seems to run in the face a little bit of the company's long-running objective to try and offset cost inflation with productivity. Was the mix and traffic to more manifest the main driver of that, or was there something else going on?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Yes, John. As I commented earlier, manifest was a part of it. I talked about the personal injury item. While improved safety performance year-over-year, it wasn't as good as last year's prior-period adjustment. So that's a factor. Headcount, we are hiring, as we talked about. We're hiring partly manifest, partly just getting ahead of the curve on some other replacement activities was a part of the activity as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Mine are just 2 kind of follow-up questions. First, on Intermodal. Can you tell us on the domestic side whether all of your growth right now is coming from conversions? Or is there any -- in other words, is the economy playing at all a negative, flat or a positive factor on your domestic side, or is your entire growth coming from truck-to-rail conversion?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","I would use an estimate 2\/3-1\/3, 2\/3 conversion, 1\/3 economy. So the majority of our growth is coming from conversion.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of your employee count, just a follow-up on that. You had mentioned that you wanted to grow your employee count somewhere less than volume. It seems that it's growing at least more than volume in the first half, so is that to indicate that we should see a reduction in your employee count in the back half of the year? Am I reading that right?","John J. Koraleski","That will be pretty hard to say. So if you look at it, Walter, right now, about half of that employee count was driven by capital spending, PTC investment and those kinds of things. One of the phenomena that we're seeing right at the moment is hiring or the replacement of people who will be retiring and leaving the workforce. So we have probably a few extra people at this point in time because they're in training for the second half of the year and those kinds of things. But I don't think it's going to change. I don't know. Rob, do you see it differently?","Robert M. Knight","No. Mix will play a factor, but again, our overall guidance is a net effect of headcount. When we said capital side, we'll be up or down with volumes with the assumption that we're continuing to get productivity behind that.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So roughly, how much of your guys here are capital people that are compared to last year? How many have you added for capital purposes versus last year?","John J. Koraleski","Rob said it was about half of our growth in headcount was capital and about half was driven by other.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","A follow-up on PRB. I think at the investor meeting in October, you mentioned export coal might be 7 million or 8 million tons this year. Does that still seem reasonable, and could you add any color to that smaller part of the franchise?","John J. Koraleski","Sure. Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Last year, we had about 7.6 million tons of export, which, I think, was a record. We might have a couple of points higher than that. We might end up at 7.8 million this year. Frankly, the export market was somewhat disappointing this year, given some of the economic difficulties, particularly in Europe, less so in Asia. We do expect that as the world economy grows, that the export market should strengthen and there will be upside to that. But this year, it'll be a little higher, call it around 8 million tons averaging up.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Eric, is that exporting through Houston to Europe? Is that right?","Eric L. Butler","We have exports from our network going to the Gulf, and we also have exports going off the West Coast to Asia.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And then switching subjects to PTC, I guess as PTC spend is becoming more fully implemented and larger, do you, at this point, as you're getting close to this large spend this year, foresee any economic benefit from this?","John J. Koraleski","Lance?","Lance M. Fritz","Sure. The short answer is no. So just a level set for everybody, PTC is an overlay system that sits on top of what we already have. It only is designed to do 4 things, all of essentially stopping trains in the -- prior to an incident. There is no productivity benefit to that. As a matter of fact, we're managing the project very aggressively, so we don't get hit by productivity hit because the only thing that could happen is if the system isn't working well, it could reduce our effective capacity. So we're working very hard not to let that happen.","Operator","Our final question this morning is coming from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I think you mentioned that the third quarter guidance for Ag volume will be down slightly. And I guess what I was just trying to get some help figuring out how, if we get the crop that we planted for, that volume could recover kind of as we move into 2014.","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","The crops really impact the fourth quarter. The harvest really doesn't start until late in the third quarter, late September. So it's really crops coming in as a fourth quarter impact.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So the majority of the recovery there should start sort of end -- sort of mid-fourth quarter?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, that would be our expectation, David.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, great. And then one last quick one. With the mix of export moves that you have relative to utility, do you have a sense for the average length of haul between those 2 chunks? I know the total Coal business is in the 960, 970 range. I was just really trying to figure out if export is longer-haul or shorter-haul than your average utility move.","Eric L. Butler","[indiscernible] down to Houston will be about the same and then be a little longer than California, but I don't think it's going to be a big issue.","John J. Koraleski","Tonnage is so small. It's just...","Eric L. Butler","Yes.","John J. Koraleski","It's just a small tonnage. I don't think it's going to move any of our numbers.","Operator","Mr. Koraleski, I'll turn the floor back to you for closing comments.","John J. Koraleski","Great.

Welcome to the Union Pacific Third Quarter 2013 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Koraleski, you may now begin.","John J. Koraleski","Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today here in Omaha are Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer; Eric Butler, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Lance Fritz, our Executive Vice President of Operations.","This morning, we're pleased to announce that Union Pacific achieved an all-time record financial results this quarter. We generated best-ever quarterly earnings of $2.48 per share, an increase of 13% compared to the third quarter of 2012. The quarter was not without its challenges, including headwinds in coal and grain volumes and severe flooding in Colorado that caused network disruptions and shipment delays. But at the end of the day, that's all part of running a railroad.","We managed our network efficiently, overcoming these challenges and continued to benefit from the strength of our diverse franchise. When combined with real core pricing and productivity gains, we more than offset the flat volumes to generate a new, best-ever quarterly operating ratio of 64.8%.","We feel very good about our accomplishments this quarter. We're leveraging our capital investments to strengthen the UP franchise and further enhance our value proposition in the marketplace. We remain focused on delivering safe, efficient, high-quality service that generates value for our customers and increased financial returns for our shareholders.","So with that, let's get started this morning. I'll turn it over to Eric.","Eric L. Butler","Thanks, Jack, and good morning. In the third quarter, the value and diversity of our franchise allowed volume to finish flat compared to last year despite volume declines in 3 of the business groups. Industrial Products, Automotive and Chemicals led the way with growth. Offsetting that good news were declines in Intermodal, Ag and Coal. Core pricing gains of 3.5%, which, combined with a modest benefit from positive mix, produced a 5% improvement in average revenue per car. The combination of flat volume and improved average revenue per car pushed freight revenue to a record $5.2 billion.","Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. Ag Products revenue declined 2% with third quarter volume down 4% and a 2% improvement in average revenue per car. Grain carloadings continued to reflect the impact of last year's drought with third quarter volume down 9%. Domestic feed grain shipments declined as tight U.S. corn supply led to reductions in livestock feeding and increased reliance on local feed crops. Export feed grains also declined with improved world supply and the higher U.S. prices. Partially offsetting these declines was an increase in weak Gulf exports, primarily destined to Brazil. Grain products volume was up 3%, driven by an 11% increase in ethanol shipments as the discounts to gasoline led refineries to replenish low ethanol inventories. Declines in import beer and barley led to a 4% decrease in food and refrigerated volume.","Automotive volume grew 8%, which, combined with the 9% improvement in average revenue per car, produced a 17% increase in revenue. Growth rates in auto production and sales remained strong in the third quarter, driven by pent-up demand to replace aging vehicles. Even so, the average age of vehicles on the road continued to increase, reaching 11.4 years, with customers replacing them with new models offering improved technology and fuel efficiency. UP finished vehicles shipments grew 5%, and sales continued to grow with seasonally adjusted annual sales rate reaching $15.7 million in the third quarter, the highest quarterly level in 5 years. Parts volume increased 12% while pricing gains in the previously announced Pacer network logistics management arrangement increased average revenue per car.","Turning now to Coal. You can see from the chart of weekly carloadings that volumes picked up from the second quarter as expected but tracked 7% below last year. Core pricing gains and favorable mix led to a 10% improvement in average revenue per car and produced a 2% increase in revenue. Tonnage from the Southern Powder River Basin decreased 8% as mild summer weather led to a 3% reduction in year-over-year electricity generation in UP-served territories. Also contributing to the decline was the continued impact of a contract loss from the beginning of the year. Colorado\/Utah tonnage declined 17% as soft domestic demand and mine production issues offset growth in West Coast exports. Also hampering loadings in the third quarter was the September Colorado floods. Providing some good news, tonnage from other coal-producing regions increased 19% from a relatively small base, driven by gains from Southern Wyoming and Illinois loadings.","Before we move on, note this slide shows a steep decline early in the fourth quarter as volumes were impacted by nearly 3 feet of unseasonably early snow in the Powder River Basin during the first week in October. This has impacted volumes through the first half of the month, but we expect the majority of shipments be made up throughout the remainder of the fourth quarter.","In Industrial Products, a 9% increase in volume and 2% improvement in average revenue per car, despite unfavorable mix, produced revenue growth of 11%. Nonmetallic minerals volume was up 21% as continued growth in shale-related drilling increased frac sand shipments by 27%. Our construction-related volumes grew 11%, driven by an 11% improvement in rock shipments with increased construction activity, mostly in the Texas and California markets, which also contributed to 12% growth in cement volume. Metals volume was up 8% as pipeline projects picked up following a slow start to the year. We also saw an increase in export iron ore shipments with the resolution of mine production issues that limited shipments last year. Growth in housing and home improvements continued to increase the demand for lumber, with shipments up 6%. Although the housing market continue to strengthen, lumber's growth eased early in the third quarter as falling lumber prices and excess inventory slowed lumber shipments. Offsetting some of the strength in other Industrial Products market was a 4% decline in government and waste volume. As in previous quarters, reduced government funding, limited military shipments and delays to extending the federal production tax credit led to a decline in win moves.","Intermodal revenue was flat as a 2% increase in average revenue per unit offset a 1% decline in volume. With the economic recovery continuing its slow pace, retailers proceeded cautiously in the third quarter. Our international Intermodal volumes declined 5% due to market share shifts within the ocean carrier industry and increased port transloading activity. Continued success converting highway business to rail drove 4% growth in domestic Intermodal.","Chemicals revenue grew 5%, reflecting a 3% increase in volume and a 2% increase in average revenue per car. Industrial Chemicals volume was up 9%, driven by strength in end-user markets such as housing and automotive. Increased demand in new business led to a 10% increase in petroleum products volume. Dampening the good news was a 5% decline in crude oil volume compared to the third quarter of last year, although crude oil shipments to St. James, Louisiana, continued to grow compared to 2012.","Before we move on to our outlook for the fourth quarter, I'd like to give a brief update on our Crude-by-Rail business, which accounts for about 40% of our shale-related volume and about 2% of our overall volume. As we said, we've been expecting our 2013 crude oil volumes to increase at a moderate pace year-over-year, though not with the dramatic ramp-up seen in the year before, particularly given the lack of significant destination capacity expansion this year. As you can see in the blue portion of the bar chart, so far this year, we've seen the benefit of very steady demand into St. James, Louisiana, which continued to be a premier rail destination. Additional opportunities have come from other areas, such as West Texas and Oklahoma, and these volumes, in particular, has been somewhat more volatile as the domestic crude oil market continues to evolve and reflect the dynamics inherent in the commodity marketplace.","As you know, pricing spreads are one of the influences on traffic flows as producers look to maximize netbacks. With the narrowing of the WTI discount to Brent, we've seen a resulting volume decrease into areas with readily available pipeline access, primarily Texas and Oklahoma, which also have been impacted by increased pipeline capacity. We've also seen a small decline in shipments from the Bakken to Texas as tighter spreads have made it more attractive to ship Bakken crude oil to the East, where new facilities have increased crude-by-rail capacity.","Going forward, we expect the economics of crude oil spreads to continue to be a driver of traffic flows, particularly in areas such as Texas. Other markets, such as Canadian crude, should provide new opportunities as Crude-by-Rail continues to evolve. Meanwhile, our franchise strength in the South will continue to provide a solid foundation to our business, giving customers attractive access to important Gulf destinations.","While crude oil volumes will always be subject to the ups and downs of market spreads, we believe the long-term fundamentals of Crude-by-Rail remain attractive. Increasing crude production, limited pipeline infrastructure and the flexibility rail provides will enable us to leverage our value proposition and develop new unique opportunities ahead.","Let me close with what we see for the fourth quarter. Our current outlook is for the economy to continue its slow improvement, although there is uncertainty in the marketplace. No matter what the economy does, we'll continue to focus on strengthening our value proposition, attracting new customers and supporting our existing customers as they work to grow their business. Given that, here's what we see across our business for the next few months, both the challenges and the opportunities.","With the effects of last year's drought behind us, an improved fall harvest is expected to provide opportunity for Ag growth. Global, Insight raised their full year light vehicle sales estimate to 15.5 million vehicles, which is good news for our Automotive business. Crude oil spreads will continue to impact our Crude-by-Rail volumes but strength in other Chemicals markets is expected to drive the solid performance we've seen throughout the year. With the challenges previously mentioned in our Coal business, we now expect full year volumes to be down in the high single-digit range, which includes the lost contract of about 5% of our Coal volumes. Industrial Products should continue to benefit from shale-related growth with increased drilling activity that supports frac sand and pipeline projects. An improving housing market is expected to drive demand for lumber shipments, and growth in construction is expected to support increases in rock, metals and other related markets. International Intermodal volume is expected to be down slightly compared to last year, while highway conversions will continue to drive domestic Intermodal growth.","For the full year, our strong value proposition and diverse franchise will again support business development opportunities across our broad portfolio of business. Assuming the economy does not slow down, we're well on track to deliver profitable revenue growth again this year.","With that, I'll turn it over to Lance.","Lance M. Fritz","Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Starting with safety, year-to-date results nearly matched our 2012 record results on the strength of a record-low third quarter reportable personal injury rate. I expect our total safety culture, risk identification and mitigation process and robust training programs to drive continued improvement as we go forward. Our ultimate focus is making sure every one of our 50,000 employees returns home safely at the end of each day.","Rail equipment incidents or derailments improved 3% year-to-date versus 2012. This is a direct reflection of the investments we've made to harden our infrastructure and to leverage advanced defect detection technology, which, combined, have reduced track and equipment-induced derailments. We are also making progress on human factor incidents through enhanced skills training and root cause resolutions.","Moving to public safety, our year-to-date grade-crossing incident rate improved 7% versus 2012, reflecting our continued focus on improving or closing high-risk crossings and reinforcing public awareness. We achieved year-over-year improvement in 5 of the last 6 months, including a record third quarter rate. Our focus on grade-crossing risk in the South has generated an 18% year-to-date improvement in that region.","Our safety strategy helps keep our network strong and resilient. And as a result, our network remains fluid and is operating at very efficient levels. Velocity in the third quarter improved 1% compared to 2012 and improved 2% sequentially from the second quarter, despite flooding that severed numerous corridors in Colorado. We rerouted traffic and developed contingency plans during the event to support our affected customers and rapidly restored service on the lines that were washed out.","Our agility in the face of these outages prevented any year-over-year deterioration in our Service Delivery Index. The measure, which gauges how well we are meeting overall customer commitments, improved sequentially from the second quarter and would've improved year-over-year if not for tighter service commitments to our customers. We continued to provide outstanding local service to our customers with a best-ever 96% Industry Spot & Pull, which measures the delivery or pulling of a car to or from a customer.","Infrastructure investments and process efficiencies have improved our ability to recover after incidents, reducing their impact on the network. We continue to invest in capacity across our network, most notably in the South, where volumes are growing, across our diverse portfolio. Overall, our network remains well positioned to handle volume growth.","Moving on to network productivity. Slow order miles declined 38% to a best-ever third quarter level. As a result, our network is in excellent shape, reflecting the investment in replacement capital that has hardened our infrastructure and reduced service failures. We continue to identify and realize efficiencies that contributed to our record 64.8% operating ratio this quarter. Locomotive productivity, as defined by gross ton miles per horsepower day, improved 1%. Network planning and improved locomotive reliability drove this improvement in spite of a 2.5- to 3-percentage-point headwind associated with the mix shift from lower coal shipments and higher manifest shipments.","During the quarter, we continued to reposition resources to align with the traffic mix trend of growing southern region and manifest volumes, which require additional manpower versus the average of the network. The chart on the lower right demonstrates our ability to leverage growing manifest volumes through UP's extensive terminal infrastructure. We switched 1.5% more cars while keeping yard and local employee days flat. This resulted in an all-time quarterly record in terminal productivity. The improvement was particularly evident in our southern region where car switch per employee day was up 3%. These results reflect employee engagement, which is an important part of our operating strategy. Our employees are bringing their expertise to bear on improving safety, service and efficiency by standardizing work and reducing variability.","To recap, our operating performance in the third quarter was solid, improving nicely from second quarter levels. We remain vigilant in our commitment to operate a safer and more efficient railroad for the benefit of our employees, customers, the public and shareholders. We've demonstrated the ability to successfully flex network resources in response to dynamic market shifts and unexpected events, including weather.","As I touched on last quarter, we've successfully completed a number of significant capital track programs, both on the replacement and capacity side. Overall, these projects were completed with minimal network disruptions and resulted in measurable enhancements to our franchise. We will continue to make smart capital investments that generate attractive returns and that keep the network fluid and safe. With strong network fundamentals, we are well positioned for future growth while enhancing UP's value proposition.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert M. Knight","Thanks, Lance, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue grew 4% to an all-time quarterly record of nearly $5.6 billion, driven mainly by solid core pricing gains. Operating expense totaled $3.6 billion, increasing 1.5%. Operating income grew 10% to $1.96 billion, also hitting a best-ever quarterly mark.","Below the line, other income totaled $28 million, basically flat with 2012. For the full year, we would expect other income to be in the $110 million to $120 million range, barring any unusual adjustments. Interest expense of $138 million was up 1% from last year. However, it includes about $7 million of net onetime costs associated with our recent debt exchange. Income tax expense increased to $701 million, driven by higher pretax earnings. Net income grew 10% versus 2012, while the outstanding share balance declined 2% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce a best-ever quarterly earnings of $2.48 per share, up 13% versus 2012.","Turning to our top line. Freight revenue grew 4.6% to more than $5.2 billion, driven by solid core pricing gains of 3.5% and favorable mix of a little more than a point. A decline in lower average revenue per car Intermodal shipments, combined with freight revenue impact from the Pacer arrangement, drove the positive mix. But these items were partially offset by double-digit growth in rock shipments, which typically move less than 200 miles, and a decline in longer haul grain moves.","Moving on to the expense side. Slide 21 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which was up 1% compared to 2012. Inflationary pressures and higher training costs drove the increase, largely offset by productivity gains. Workforce levels increased 1% in the quarter. About half of the increase was driven by more individuals in the training pipeline and the other half was due to capital projects, including positive train control activity. When you think ahead to the fourth quarter, remember that we saw the benefit of a onetime $20 million payroll tax refund that is reflected in last year's fourth quarter comp and benefits expense.","Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $866 million, decreasing 2% versus 2012, primarily driven by lower average diesel fuel price. In addition, gross ton miles declined 2% due to lower coal and grain shipments. This mix impact also contributed to the 1% increase in our fuel consumption rate compared to 2012.","Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense increased 8% to $588 million due to higher locomotive and freight car contract repair expenses and joint facility maintenance expense. And we're incurring logistics management fees associated with the 2012 Pacer agreement, which are recouped in our Automotive freight revenue line. Depreciation expense was $447 million, basically flat compared to last year. The impact of increased capital spending in recent years was offset by a new equipment rate study that went into effect at the beginning of this year.","Looking at the full year, we expect depreciation to be up about 1% versus 2012, slightly lower than our previous projections. However, for 2014, full year depreciation expense should increase at a more normalized rate, more likely in the 5% to 7% range.","Slide 24 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $309 million, up 3% compared to 2012. Increased container expenses associated with the Pacer contract and growth in Automotive shipments drove higher freight car rental expense. Other expenses came in at $205 million, up $5 million versus last year. Higher property taxes and freight damage costs drove expenses up compared to 2012. A moderate reduction in personal injury expense and effective cost-control measures partially offset these increases. For the fourth quarter, we would expect that other expense line to be more in the neighborhood of $215 million, excluding any unusual items.","Turning to our operating ratio performance. We achieved an all-time best operating ratio of 64.8% this quarter, improving 1.8 points compared to last year. Our performance highlights the positive impact of solid core pricing gains and network efficiencies despite flat volumes. Through the first 9 months of this year, we generated an operating ratio of 66.5%, improving 1.5 points from 2012, clearly illustrating the strength and value proposition of the Union Pacific franchise.","Union Pacific's record year-to-date earnings drove strong cash from operations of nearly $4.9 billion, up 12% compared to 2012. Free cash flow of $1.3 billion reflects the growing profitability of the franchise and includes a 13% increase in cash dividend payments versus 2012. Our balance sheet remained strong, supporting our investment-grade credit rating. At quarter end, our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio was roughly 39%, which includes the impact of adding over $450 million to our balance sheet debt since year-end 2012.","Opportunistic share repurchases continue to play an important role in our balanced approach to cash allocation. In the third quarter, we bought back nearly 3.7 million shares, totaling $575 million. Year-to-date, we've purchased more than 9.6 million shares, totaling over $1.4 billion, already matching our full year spend from last year. Looking ahead, we have around 5.4 million shares remaining under our current authorization program, which expires March 31, 2014.","So that's a recap of our third quarter results. As we move through the rest of the year, we're mindful of the economic uncertainty in the marketplace. For the fourth quarter, we expect to see modest volume growth, mainly driven by improved grain shipments. Assuming the economy doesn't slow down for the rest of the year, we would also expect to see continued growth in other market sectors. Given the flat volumes in the third quarter, it's unlikely that our full year volumes will be positive even with our modest growth assumptions in the fourth quarter. However, we will have to see how the rest of the year plays out. In addition, we should see solid core pricing gains roughly similar to the third quarter results. All in, the fourth quarter should round out another record financial year for Union Pacific.","Now let's take a preliminary look at next year, realizing that it's still very early. From where we sit today, we're expecting modest volume growth if the economy continues along a slow growth trajectory. We think there will be some markets that will be stronger than others. We should see strength in grain shipments. And if the economy holds, there should be positive growth in other business sectors. Mexico-related traffic should also generate volume gains for us next year.","Our Coal business is a little more difficult to predict, but we can tell you that we retained and renewed roughly 50% of next year's $100 million legacy business. The lost legacy business, which is currently not moving at re-investable levels, will create about a 2% headwind on our Coal volumes in 2014. But as always, weather and the economy will be the driving factors for our Coal business next year. Although 2014 is a legacy-light year, we'll continue to generate real core pricing gains. However, we don't expect to match 2013's levels, which, as you know, include about 1.5 of legacy repricing that won't repeat next year. In addition, inflation-related escalators are expected to be lower next year, including those used to calculate the A-lift cost escalator.","At the end of the day, our fundamental strategy and focus on pricing for returns has not changed. While we won't see a legacy benefit next year and inflation escalators are expected to be modestly lower, pricing on the rest of our business in 2014 remains strong. When you add it all up, we expect to achieve core pricing above inflation next year. Overall, we're forecasting another record financial year in 2014, if the economy cooperates. In addition to our pricing initiatives, ongoing productivity gains and volume leverage opportunities should help drive continued margin improvement.","We feel very good about our outlook going forward. The fundamentals are strong, supported by a diverse franchise that allows us to pursue new, attractive market opportunities. We'll continue to move the ball forward, focusing on improved returns to support capital investments that will strengthen and enhance our network, create value for our customers and drive increased returns for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it back to Jack.","John J. Koraleski","Okay. Thanks, Rob. Well, as Eric mentioned, we've had a bit of a tough start here to the fourth quarter with the early blizzard slowing Coal volumes out of the Powder River Basin. But the good news is there's still a lot of quarter ahead of us. And as we did in the third quarter, we'll manage through the obstacles to ensure our customer commitments are met and our network is protected. More broadly, we continue to monitor the economic landscape and the ongoing saga in Washington.","But supported by our diverse franchise, we remain agile and well positioned for economic recovery. The 50,000 men and women of Union Pacific stand ready to leverage the opportunities while navigating through the challenges. We'll continue focusing on re-investable pricing, attracting new, profitable growth opportunities and running a safe, efficient and reliable network that generates greater value for both our customers and shareholders going forward.","So with that, let's open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I wanted to kind of -- I guess a broad framework that seems to be shaping up for 2014 is that there are pretty good reasons to think that your volume growth may be a bit stronger, obviously, grain, maybe coal is less of a headwind, hopefully, the economy, but you're going to get the slower pace of pricing gains, less legacy contract. So how would you frame the results of that in terms of margin improvement? Do you end up with a kind of a similar framework for margin expansion opportunity? Is it more challenging if it's kind of more volume and less price? How do you think about margin opportunity in 2014?","John J. Koraleski","Tom, I think overall, we're in a good position. We've not varied at all from our guidance that says we're going to get to an operating ratio of sub-65%. So it'll be a little more difficult. I'll let Rob give you some technicolor here.","Robert M. Knight","Yes. Tom, I would just add to Jack's point, I mean, it's moving the ball forward. As you know, volume is always our friend because we're able to leverage that from a productivity standpoint. But you're right, without the benefit of the legacy repricing, we expect to continue to move the ball forward. And that's going to be continued focus on providing good service, leveraging volume where we can to squeeze out additional productivity initiatives and continue to fairly price the business. You add all that up, we continue -- we expect to continue to make progress on our overall margins.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then a follow-up on Coal. I know it's probably really challenging to have much visibility in Coal. But are there any, I guess, parameters that we should consider that you would consider, stockpile levels? Any activity you're seeing in the East, plant shutdowns? How would you put things together in terms of is it more likely your coal tonnage is up in 2014, or is it more realistic to expect it down? Just a little more detail on framing Coal, if you can.","John J. Koraleski","Sure. I think overall, Tom, if you look at energy and the Coal business, the 2 biggest factors are always going to be energy consumption, how much electricity is generated and what the weather is going to be like. We've seen the stockpile levels on a national basis come down a bit. But you always have to be careful because even within that mix of business, you have some that are a little higher, some that are little lower. Eric, you want to put some technicolor around that?","Eric L. Butler","I think that's exactly right. Stockpiles have come down. They're about 20 days below where they were last year, and actually, a couple of days below what would be considered historical norms. So what Jack said is exactly correct. It -- factors are what's the electrical consumption, generation, what's weather. Those are always going to be the key factors.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on Tom's question a little bit, but more with regards to rail inflation in 2014. So if we're assuming, this year, inflation was around 2.5% to 3%, is it fair to think about next year being closer to 2% to 2.5%?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Yes, Allison. We would -- at this point in time, and of course, things can change, we would expect that inflation looks like it's going to be more around, all-in, 2%-ish.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","2%-ish? Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up question on the Crude-by-Rail and looking towards next year. Without getting too granular, I was wondering if you could maybe comment on some volume growth that you see that is less spread dependent and also, within the context of new origination terminals that you have coming online in the Niobrara and some new destination terminals in Louisiana and Texas that are UP-served.","John J. Koraleski","Sure. Eric, you want to do the rundown on what we're looking at for 2014?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. So we still believe we'll see moderate growth in 2014. As we indicated in our comments, it's dependent upon a lot of market dynamics, including the spreads, the timing of additional capacity, production levels, overall demand. We're still very optimistic as we look at destination opportunities in California. Those destinations are still coming online. Some of them had long lead times just getting through the normal construction process that you typically go through in that region of the country. But again, kind of the normal vagaries of market dynamics will drive kind of what happens next year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","I want to just follow up on, Rob, your comment around pricing for next year and understanding that it's legacy light. But when we think about 3.5% pricing that you got in third quarter, would -- how much legacy do you think in third quarter you actually got? Because I'm guessing with Coal, that was down. You didn't get a full 1.5 from that. I just want to get maybe kind of what the base is tracking right now, x legacy. And then maybe if you can give any color on how you think mix could help or hurt next year with grain coming back and maybe some of the other moving parts when we think about overall yields next year.","Robert M. Knight","Yes, Scott. In the third quarter, our reported 3.5% price included, call it, roughly 1.5 points of legacy. But to your point, the 3.5% did not include probably less than 0.5 point of coal repriced business because the coal didn't move. So kind of do the math on that. As you look forward in 2014, yes, it's a legacy-light year and, yes, mix will play a part. I mean, if the volume of business that we've repriced, whether it be in coal or grain, if it happens to move before we've lapped the renewal of a contract, then we should see the benefit of the price on our price calculation. But as I always point out, if the business moves after we've lapped the repricing, while it may not show up in our core pricing number that we report, it will show up in our margin. So it's a net benefit to us, clearly. So I guess I'll just summarize by saying that we head into 2014 as optimistic as ever on our ability to price, but we just won't have that benefit of that, call it, 1.5% legacy charge.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then this other question for you, Rob, on the balance sheet. So you mentioned that you were going to need to reauthorize share repurchase next year. If I look, you guys are at about a full turn less of leverage than the other -- most of the other rails, and your returns are better than average, for sure. Do you think that there's an opportunity, now that we're through legacy and we need some other parts to the story, that -- is there an opportunity to more aggressively take on some leverage and more aggressively buy back stock?","Robert M. Knight","Scott, as you know, we always take a balanced approach. And as I've said many times, we're comfortable in the range we are right now on our net debt-to-cap ratio. I mean, it's not how we manage the business, but that's kind of a guiding light. So we'd always take a look at it, but that has served us well to be in that range. And in terms of will we look at more or less, we're going to continue to be -- hope to be -- continue to be optimistic in terms of our share repurchase. We did this year, as you know, buy at a higher rate of share buyback this year than we did last year, so we have been ramping that up. And I think that speaks to sort of our thought process.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","If I can hit, Eric, up, I guess, a bit on Intermodal. Looking at domestic, is this the kind of run rate here, the low single digits on the domestic side on the highway adoptions? And then internationally, you noted some losses. When do your grandfather that? And should we see growth going forward in the fourth quarter into next year? When do you start looking at kind of the environment on the international side as well?","Eric L. Butler","Let me start with the international. The international, what I mentioned was some market share shifts amongst the steamship carriers. And so that -- as you know, there's excess steamship capacity, and there's natural shifts that are going on amongst them. And as the bid seasons happen every year, those shifts will happen in the steamship arena outside of the rail arena. In terms of the domestic Intermodal side, the 4% we're proud of, but we think there's upside. We think there's still a large, over-the-road truck market out there for us to convert. We think we have the right products. We have the right strategies. We're investing in our franchise. We've talked publicly about our new facility outside of El Paso, Texas, that will be coming online next year. We think that, that will help us penetrate significantly the maquiladora market there around El Paso and also allow us to put some new products and services in place. So we are excited about the upside for continued domestic over-the-road conversions.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And if I could just get a follow-up, I guess, with Rob on the productivity side. And as you look toward maybe a little bit less coming from yields and maybe more of that from -- coming from productivity, do you still seeing accelerating opportunities to continue to gain on the productivity side? How do you look at that opportunity?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. I mean, Ken, we never run out of opportunities to squeeze out productivity. And Lance and his team are continually looking at the mix shifts that take place in the business. And we challenge ourselves, and you've heard me say this many times, to offset 100% of inflation with productivity. If we get half, offset half of inflation with productivity, we're doing pretty well. And our track record has spoken very strongly, I think, in doing so, even without the benefit of volume. So if we get positive volumes, that certainly will help. So we'll continue to look for every opportunity we can.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Wanted to get a sense, I mean, as we enter into this kind of post-legacy year for you guys, how your average book is structured right now with your customers, and kind of what the pace of contract renewal is going to look like on a go-forward basis and how we should expect that, that gets attacked. So as I look out over the next 5 years, what piece of your overall book do you think comes up and, what's the average tenure of the contracts that you've been re-signing?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Justin, I'm not quite sure quite what you're asking. We've talked historically in the past that at any one given time, about 70% of our contracts or our prices are kind of locked in for the next year. As we go into the future, there's a natural evolution of pace, of things that come up as you go through different markets. And we're, as Rob said and I think as Jack said, we continue to be excited about the value of our franchise and the value proposition that we sell and the ability to get price as we go forward on...","John J. Koraleski","But as we -- as Eric -- I think what he's kind of talking about is and, Justin, chime in here, buddy, about 40%, typically 40% to 45% of our business is tied up in multiyear contracts. But in our current world, 3 to 5 years is probably the timeframe of those. About 1\/3 of the business or 30% is tied up in 1 year, like letter quotes and deals, and then the other 30% is roughly tariff that we have 20 days notice in terms of changing price. So at any one point in time, we have our business constantly being evaluated and looking for market opportunities where we can take advantage of price increases.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That was exactly what I was looking to get at, so thanks for the clarification, Jack. And as I think about the guidance here looking out to 2017, I was just, Rob, wanting to get an idea. Obviously, volume's been more challenged in the near term because of coal. But as I look out to 2015 and beyond, there's some expected positives on the Chem side of your business, specifically on petrochem, I would think. So I wanted to get a sense, as you guys think about mix within that long-term guidance, what type of volume CAGR you think you need to have, cognizant of what we just talked about in terms of the pace of pricing going forward and that being more of kind of an inflation plus as opposed to having that bump from the 1.5 points of legacy that we're seeing right now?","Robert M. Knight","Yes, Justin, this is Rob. The guidance, it's just a reset. The guidance on the operating ratio is to -- by full year 2017, to achieve a sub-full year 65% operating ratio. And volume is our friend. And when we give that sort of guidance, we're assuming that the economy will cooperate, that volumes will be on the positive side of the ledger, if you will. But we know that we can't predict precisely exactly what the mix is going to look like. So we're going to have to deal with the hand that the economy plays us between now and then. And we're confident that if the economy cooperates, that the mix will enable us to achieve that target. But as I've said all along, each measure, each metric we've given, as we've been working down from the mid-80s operating ratio years ago, we're going to get there as soon as we can, as efficiently as we can. We're not going to stop, so the sub-65% is not an end game. It's just the next rung on the ladder, if you will, and we'll get there as efficiently, leveraging volume, if we can, leveraging productivity and leveraging strong price.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But -- okay. So you're seeing volume growth that's sub-GDP right now across your franchise and still being able to leverage that into margin improvement, which is something you guys have been able to do, do you think you can do even as we start to see more legacy wear off?","Robert M. Knight","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just maybe following up on the longer-term OR guidance. As you think out -- I think you have a few years now left to hit a target, which is a few hundred or a couple hundred basis points away from sort of the run rate that you're at right now. So when you think about the setup, is there anything that we should be thinking about, absent mix, that would be preventing kind of the continued progress that you've been making steadily over the last couple of years? Obviously, legacy comes into all of that. But I just want to make sure, from an operational perspective, are there any other challenges we may need to think about? It strikes me as being a bit on the conservative side, which is good, but I just kind of want to get a sense if there's something I'm missing in there on that guidance.","John J. Koraleski","I think, overall, Chris, when you look at it, we look at it from the perspective that we're going to achieve those goals, we're going to achieve them despite whatever hand we're dealt in terms of the economic activity. That's the commitment we're making. But you can never say never in terms of what happens if you have another 2008, what happens if the Washington situation melts down and consumer confidence wanes and we kind of do a double-dip here. We're not looking forward to that. But I think the thing that you can feel good about is if you go back and you look at our results and you look at our track record, when those things happen, we marshal very effectively, we deal with it and we move on. So I don't know, Rob, do you have any other kind of like big onetime things or things -- I mean, we've got productivity gains that we are absolutely focused on, Lance and his team. Rob always uses the term squeeze. I actually think of it more positively than just a squeeze. We have a lot of people working hard to do things better to drive bottom line results, and you see that reflected in our 64.8% operating ratio. Eric and his team are very effectively deploying business development strategies and taking advantage of price opportunities in the markets where we have the opportunity to go above and beyond what would be considered inflationary, and that's good for us. So everybody's kind of focused on that. Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Yes -- no, you're exactly right. Now clearly, going from a mid-80s to a mid-60s rate of improvement is one slope. Going from where we are today to sub-65%, the slope of the line is different, but the tenets of how we get there are unchanged.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Sure, sure. That makes sense. That's helpful. And then when you think about the capital spending side of it, in context of that target and sort of the slope of the line, as you say, over the course of the next couple of years, I think you updated us with guidance last year around this time for how we should be thinking about CapEx. Anything you need to change as you think about that, as you're further into that? Obviously, PTC is still in the picture and probably will be for at least a few years to come. But just kind of curious, your thoughts around that for '14 and beyond.","John J. Koraleski","We're watching our capital spending very closely. Our -- we had reduced our 17% to 18% to 16% to 17%. Clearly, that implies we're going to see some volume growth. If we don't see the volume growth, we'll be paring back capital. We'll be making the right decisions from a return perspective as we see the needs across our network. PTC is still in there. At some point in time, we may or may not change those numbers. But at least right now, we're comfortable with the 16% to 17% kind of number we put out there last year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to come back to the pricing discussion. In the past, you guys have been pretty successful at getting rate up to re-investable levels. Is there any way to quantify for us today what percentage of the business, or in broad strokes, that remains at -- on investable rates that has a lot of pricing upside in the future?","John J. Koraleski","Rob, why don't you take a shot at that?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. Brandon, I know what you're asking and it's just not a number we provide, other than to say that we're confident across our entire book of business there are opportunities for us to price to market and make sure that we are at the re-investable level. So that's as detailed as we get on that.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And maybe a follow-up for Eric. When we look at grain dynamics heading into 2014, what's the mix looking like right now from a domestic grain perspective or an export perspective or even ethanol? And how's that going to impact mix and revenue and volume for you going forward?","Eric L. Butler","So as you know, with the drought and high U.S. corn prices, U.S. grain on the world markets really took a hit, just because we're a high price relative to what the other prices were in other growing markets around the world. It looks as if -- and as you know, the USDA website has been down for the last several weeks. But the last public report looks as if this will be a near record year for corn production. And so I think that will make U.S. exports, corn, on the bean side and even wheat exports more competitive on world markets. I think you should see some growth in export opportunities vis-\u00e0-vis this year as you go into next year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of William Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Rob and Jack, you've always sort of described your longer-term OR guidance as a -- as not really a target and an ending point but things can go beyond that. And I think something that we've all sort of struggled with over the years is thinking about kind of what structure of a network kind of limits how good margins can get. When you look at the Union Pacific network and you see what you've been able to achieve over the last 5 to 7 years, which, in margin terms, is kind of breathtaking, is there anything about the network that makes you say, yes, it's going to be hard for us to ever achieve sort of record profitability relative to our peers in the industry? Is there anything about your network, structurally, that limits how good you can be?","John J. Koraleski","Man, I can't think of anything. Rob, can you?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. No, Bill, I mean, there's no -- there's not like a mountain that's in our way that's not in other people's way. I mean, we all have the same challenges, and there's -- it's a great theoretical question in terms of how low can you get, and we get that question. I mean, a sub-65% is pretty good performance. We think we can go below that, while at the same time, of course, that's just a measure we use as shorthand, if you will. Because at the same time, what we are very focused on, of course, is improving returns, improving income, driving larger cash, et cetera. So at end of the day, that's what we're really focused on. How low can the margins go? We'll see.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, okay. Eric, a follow-up for you on Intermodal. Do you feel like the new hours of service rules so far have had any impact on your growth rate there, or is this kind of something that'll take longer to show up?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. Any impact right now has been negligible. Certainly, the truckers probably are seeing some impact on their expense lines. But in terms of conversion rates to intermodal, it's been negligible so far. We do expect, over the long term, that it will drive more business to intermodal, to the rails. And as I mentioned before, we still are pretty excited about the upside opportunity in terms of over-the-road conversions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","My question, I guess, focus in on the weather impact that you had in Colorado and Denver and more kind of a theoretical one here. When you see that kind of weather impact manifest itself, and it may be that we're going into a period where -- in the future where these happen more often, my question is do your clients -- do your customers say, \"Okay, this is weather, it's out of your control, we won't let it damage too much our relationship,\" or are we seeing more and more customers saying, \"And it looks like you've been able to reroute quite well.\" Do you see that as a competitive advantage versus other railroads that might or might not be able to reroute as well due to whatever network constraints they have? In other words, do you view that, your rerouting capacity, as a competitive advantage? And perhaps, Lance, you can answer that. Maybe, Eric, in your customer conversations, are they attaching more and more importance to that ability to reroute?","John J. Koraleski","Yes. Walter, I'll let Lance and Eric chime in here, but let me just kind of from an overview perspective. I think our team did a remarkable job of working with customers, rerouting trains and ensuring that their freight moved to their marketplace as quickly and as efficiently as possible, and doing it in a way that they knew we're working hard to keep them ahead of the trouble and out of harm's way. And then to get the whole process back up and running again, get the railroad back up and running in a record amount of time, I think customers appreciate that. We spend a lot of time talking to them about our strategy is basically to create value for them. And we consider that a strategic advantage of ours in terms of being able to demonstrate, what does value mean, and this was a great time to do that. And that's not to say we were perfect in all cases, but I think our customers have given us high marks for that. Lance or Eric, you want to chime in on that?","Lance M. Fritz","Yes, Jack. So we do talk about how our franchise is a wonderful thing, and it showed through in how we reacted to what happened in Denver. We had alternative routes that we could use and, to Jack's point, support our customers while they were going through some of the same issues. So I think that's a great manifestation of the franchise strength, basically.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Do you think it's better than your competitor?","Lance M. Fritz","I won't speak to whether it's better than our competitor. We focus on providing our customers outstanding service, so they fall in love with Union Pacific and think of us first.","John J. Koraleski","One of the things that Lance and Eric's team does that I love, and I think the customers do as well, is they do a postmortem on every one of these events and go back and say, \"What did we learn from this? What would we be prepared to do differently the next time the cards line up this way,\" so that we always learn, we always -- the next time Mother Nature takes a swipe at us, we're better prepared and more experienced in terms of how to deal with it and minimize any disruptive situations for our customers.\"","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That makes a lot of sense. My follow-up question, I guess, is on your Crude-by-Rail. You mentioned St. James seems to be showing a little bit more resiliency. Other areas seem to be more impacted by the differential. My question, I guess, is to what extent can your St. James destinations be insulated from that differential? And perhaps talk a little bit about the difference as to why that is and what level does it need your St. James and as they -- also be impacted by differentials.","Eric L. Butler","Yes. So we talked in the past about the reason for St. James being such a premier rail destination, and it's really the connectivity, the pipeline connectivity, the connectivity to multiple refiners, the ability to do blending there. And so it has become, really, a premier destination for crude, light sweet crude, going to the Gulf. And we think that, that resiliency will remain. As you know, the oil will move to where the market dictates, based on spreads. But we think that the factors we've historically talked about with St. James makes it a premier destination, and we will see that resiliency remain for the future.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein Research.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Eric, maybe you could -- if you could give us a little more color on the legacy retention issues. Are we done sort of settling up the legacy book for next year? Was the -- were the plants that did not get renewed, did they just shut down or was it a share loss? And whether this was PRB or Rocky Mountain coal?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. So as you know, we don't really get into customer-specific negotiations or discussions other than what we said before. We had about $100 million of legacy renewal. We retained about half of those and the half we didn't retain was not at re-investable levels, so.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. But was some of the losses perhaps due to the plant just being shut down, or was it -- or if you don't want to comment, that's fine. I'm just trying to understand the -- what was driving the loss.","Eric L. Butler","Yes. Our calculation of legacy does not include plants that are shut down. There are lots of shutdowns going on in the East in terms of mine shutdowns. But in terms of our serving territory, there's not any measurable mine shutdowns that are occurring in our service territories, at least not this year and not for the foreseeable future.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","All right, great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up, how do you feel about the viability of the Colorado and Rocky Mountain coals that were moving east relative to the Illinois Basin kind of going forward?","Eric L. Butler","That's a good question. First, utilities that are looking to convert, they can decide to convert to Illinois Basin or Colorado\/Utah coal. And there's a different sweet spot depending on the mechanical burn capability and the scrubber capability of the utilities and they have an economic profile that may drive them one place or the other. We intend to participate in both markets. We have service products in both markets. We still see Colorado\/Utah coal having a strong place in the marketplace, particularly the export market. And I think, going forward, the export market opportunities for Colorado\/Utah are probably larger than even the Illinois Basin export coal opportunities.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Anthony Gallo of Wells Fargo.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I thought I heard you mention that transloading was a bit of a headwind for Intermodal. I was hoping you could expand on why that is. And that doesn't look like a trend that's about to reverse, so some color there, please.","Eric L. Butler","Yes. As you know, some of the BCOs are looking at landing product on the West Coast and transloading it into a domestic intermodal container as opposed to using the steamship container to move the product all the way inland. That is a trend that appears to have ramped up in the last year or so. And there are some benefits for some customers to do that. There are some benefits for some customers to keep the steamship carrier, what we call the IPI option, to move all the way inland. Our view of the world is we're going to participate in both markets, and we're going to provide effective products and services no matter how the shipper decides to ship the product.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then I'm hoping you can either confirm or deny the chatter we've heard from some of the IMCs that part of the issue with intermodal growth on your network is lack of access to equipment. And I think they were talking specifically about chassis. Can you put any detail behind that?","John J. Koraleski","Wow. Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. I'm not -- I think it's just chatter. We do not have a lack of access issue on our network. I think it's just chatter.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Long of Stephens.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","You touched briefly on the Santa Teresa Intermodal facility earlier, and it sounds like that's still on track to open early next year. But could you provide any details on the capacity of that facility and how we should think about the potential ramp in volumes in 2014 and beyond that?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. So our investment in that facility is going to do a couple of things for us. One, as you know, the El Paso, Juarez area has huge maquiladora opportunities. I think there's something like 250 customers that have manufacturing facilities in that region. And today, a large portion of that is moving by truck over the road. We are capacity constrained in our current El Paso Intermodal facility to take advantage of that. And so with the opening of this new facility, we'll immediately be able to double our capacity, but we're not limited by that. We'll have the footprint to go beyond that as we have market opportunities.","John J. Koraleski","Yes, Justin. The initial buildout should handle 250,000 lifts a year. And we have plenty of space available to go way beyond that, in addition to it being our new fueling facility.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And second question, I was wondering how much visibility you have on the potential impact from the new automotive production that's coming online in Mexico the next couple of years. Is that something that should be a meaningful tailwind as we head into next year, or is it still too hard to tell how much that volume could move on your network at this time?","Eric L. Butler","So you're referring to kind of the large, announced facilities by Nissan and Volkswagen, those opening dates are beyond next year. We, along with the Mexican railroads, both the FXE and the KCS, we're working to develop service products and offerings so that we can get our fair share of participation in those. But those facility operation -- I mean, opening dates are beyond 2014.","Robert M. Knight","If I could just add on that, Justin, because you've heard me say this many times, no franchise matches the Union Pacific in and out of Mexico. We're the only railroad that has the 6 border-crossing points. And today, we enjoy in excess of, call it, around 80% market share of all autos business in and out of Mexico. While we haven't given a precise number of what the market share is going to look like after these plants go, we feel very good about the franchise. We have north of the border and the fact that we are the only rail the crosses those 6 border points, that we will get our fair share of business that wants to move north and south.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research","It's been a long call so I'll just ask one. I was just struck by the massive decrease you've had over the last couple of years in slow order miles. And just wondered if you could elaborate a little bit on what's driving that and where else that shows up in your operational metrics and in the cost structure.","John J. Koraleski","Did Lance pay you to ask that question?","Lance M. Fritz","I love that question.","John J. Koraleski","Yes. Go for it, buddy.","Lance M. Fritz","So, Cherilyn, it reflects our capital programs, which are pretty sophisticated in trying to figure out where to spend the money and what to spend it on. So you see us investing $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion directly into track infrastructure renewal for about the last, call it, 6 or 7 years, and that slow order mile decrease is a direct reflection of that appropriate investment. And when you think about the impact it has, it has an impact on every aspect of customer service. Because those slow order miles are throughout the network, and they basically have the network, when they're present, operating at a level that's below design. And any improvement we make in slow orders, generally speaking, has a direct and immediate impact on the reliability of our service and the absolute magnitude of the service we can provide.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Eric, a quick question on Intermodal. Could you give us a sense of what you believe the discount to the product vis-\u00e0-vis a like-for-like truckload move would be today?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. We've talked before that it's lane-dependent, lane-specific. But a 15% number is probably a reasonable number, 15% to 20% in terms of the all-in cost of intermodal versus an equivalent over-the-road long-haul truck. But again, that's lane-dependent, lane-specific.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Of course. And when you talk about some of the optimism that comes from that network being able to even reaccelerate the 4% volume growth, is it under the context of being able to continue to narrow that gap as well and accelerate volume growth? Or do you anticipate that differential to be constant and expect volume growth to potentially accelerate? How should we think about that?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. So a couple of factors. One, the question was asked before about the hours in service, so that is going to continue to have a cost impact on truckers. So their prices are going to increase. So we'll continue to grow our pricing even without narrowing the gap. I do think that there are places where we can narrow that gap and still convert. And fundamentally, we've done some work and analysis that basically says there's still a pretty large untapped market of people who just haven't tried intermodal and haven't used it, and so it's an ideal market sales opportunity for us to penetrate. So there's lots of upside opportunities, and we could get it. Even by narrowing the gap, we can still grow.","John J. Koraleski","And we also have new service products that your team has been working on with Lance and his team in terms of providing great service, some new market destinations and some originations. And as the network continues to evolve and develop, that's an opportunity for us as well.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Two quick ones here. When I look at Coal out into 2014 and look at the arc or the yields, given that you've retained sort of 50% of that legacy business, how should we look at how that arc's going to move? I mean, were the 50% return retained, longer length of haul, about average?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just trying to get a sense of the number that we're going to see all else being equal.","Robert M. Knight","For planning purposes, I'd look at it as an average, but we're not going to give detailed arc projections for Coal. And by the way, it will be dependent upon mix. I mean, in terms what -- we're confident in our ability to continue to price our overall book of business. We won't obviously have the legacy tailwind that we called out. But the arc will move based on the mix of the coal traffic that actually moves, so I can't give you a projection on that.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Right. But all I'm saying is that the mix that you retained, that 50%, that wasn't, overall, vastly different from your normalized mix?","Robert M. Knight","I'd call it in the normal range.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","In the normal range. Okay, great. And just a quick follow-up question on Intermodal. I hear you guys on -- in terms of the hours of service and truckload rates eventually have to go up. But we've been waiting for that for a while and we haven't really seen much progress on that. Sort of how do you look at sort of gaining market share off the highway if we're still stuck in this sort of very muted truckload pricing environment?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. So again, hours of service just went into effect on July 1. So that's why when I answered earlier about negligible impacts, it really is just recent. If you look at what we've said before, we are putting in place lots of products, new offerings. There's an opportunity to sell what -- what we've seen is large shippers really have a great understanding of the intermodal value proposition, and they're heavy users of the intermodal value proposition. There's some market segmentation opportunities for the other guys other than the Walmarts or Targets of the world. And that's why I think we continue to be very optimistic about the ability to penetrate intermodal, get growth and get price.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I think a couple of us have hinted at the -- how conservative it seems, the sub-65% goal by 2017. And I mean no insult because you guys have identified conservative goals in the past and hit them again and again. But are there are couple of threats? What would be the top couple of threats that could disrupt this progress?","John J. Koraleski","I think when you just step back and look at it, certainly, what we just went through in Washington, D.C., and the fact that it wasn't really a resolve, it was just moved ahead, is still out there and it's very concerning for us, given that 70% of the economy is driven by consumer spending. And so anything that would cause the housing market to go back down, for people to stop buying cars, those have all been big benefits to us in the recovery piece of that. And that's a concern for us. I don't know of any other, quite honestly. Rob?","Robert M. Knight","I would just add to that. I mean, you're right. And you're also right that we're not going to stop at that and get there as efficiently as we can. But the things that can impact you, clearly, in addition to the economy that Jack points out, would be the fuel price. Just the math of the operating ratio performance is heavily -- can be heavily impacted by fuel. But beyond that, it's sort of business as usual, if you will, in terms of the tenets of what are going to get us from here to there.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So it sounds like you identify fuel price and consumer spending are a couple of principal ones and maybe legislation. But I noticed that you didn't mention sort of regulatory environment, is that less of a threat than might previously have been discussed?","John J. Koraleski","Well, you never say never because there are a number of pieces of legislation that we're watching, either legislation or from the Surface Transportation Board. But we work very hard to make sure that we're telling our story clearly, that we're creating value for customers, that we're investing heavily in our network and infrastructure. And anything that gets done on the regulatory front, we've been very clear that if it caps our ability to generate a return for our shareholders, it's going to curtail capital spending and investment. Nobody really wants to see that happening. And most people in Washington want to see more jobs and growth. So I never want to say we're not concerned about it, but we're working it as hard as we can to ensure that that's not a major issue for us.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I know it's been a long call, so I'll be brief. What should we be thinking about in terms of -- I'm looking at cash flows here, tax rate and with the reversal of some of the bonus depreciation items over the last year, what should we be thinking about in terms of deferred taxes and depreciation on the cash flow side?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Yes, Jeff. I mean, you're right. Bonus depreciation, we've had that benefit for several years now, and we don't anticipate that we'll see that benefit continuing to 2014. And as I've said, it's -- that impact in '14 is going to be in the several hundred million dollar range, but we don't think -- it's not going to impact our capital structure or our plans that we've outlined. But it's going to be kind of in that neighborhood.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. So in terms of modeling free cash flow, how should I think about the difference between the income statement depreciation, cash flow depreciation? And what tax rate should I be thinking about?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. From a tax rate standpoint, I'd use around a 38%. On a book basis, yes.","Operator","Our final question this morning is from the line of Don Broughton of Avondale Partners.","Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Question, in your assumptions in longer term, and it's still a ways away, what kind of assumptions have you made on international Intermodal, post the opening of the wider Panama Canal? So in the latter half of 2015 and 2016 and then 2017, are you looking for international Intermodal volumes to be flattish, just diminished rates of growth, or actually go negative for you?","Eric L. Butler","So we have talked publicly before, and we still think it holds that, today, about 1\/3 of the business or about 30% of the business goes all water to the East Coast versus West Coast destinations. We think that, that might grow by 1% or 2% to 31%, 32%, but it won't be beyond that.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jack Koraleski for closing comments.","John J. Koraleski","Well, great. Thanks for joining us on the call this morning.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Koraleski. You may begin.","John J. Koraleski","Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. With me here in Omaha today are Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer; Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Lance Fritz, Executive Vice President of Operations.","Union Pacific achieved an all-time record quarter, generating an earnings milestone of $2.10 per share, an increase of 32% compared to the second quarter of 2011. Best-ever quarterly operating revenue and operating income drove our record operating ratio performance and bottom line results. We're clearly delivering on the strength of our diverse franchise. Volume growth across many of our market sectors allowed us to offset the 17% decline in coal volumes.","When combined with solid pricing, efficient network operations and continued productivity gains, the net result was our best-ever quarter by nearly every financial measure. We're continuing to focus on providing safe, efficient, high-quality service that creates value for our customers and increased financial returns for our shareholders.","So with that, we'll get started this morning. I'll turn it over to Eric.","Eric L. Butler","Thanks, Jack, and good morning. Let's start with a look at customer satisfaction, which came in at 93 for the quarter. That's 1 point better than a year ago, and it matches the record we set in the first quarter this year. We appreciate this recognition from our customers and we're committed to continuing to provide them a strong value proposition.","Second quarter volume was a little better than flat against last year, as strong growth in Automotive and Chemicals and solid gains in Industrial Products and Intermodal were offset by continued weakness in coal. Excluding the impact of coal, combined volume in the other 5 groups grew 5%, despite a softer ag export market.","Core pricing improved 4.5%. All 6 groups posted gains, but the overall improvement was impacted again this quarter by the fall-off in coal volume, where much of our legacy repricing has occurred. The improved pricing, along with about 2% from increased fuel surcharge revenue, resulted in a 6% improvement in average revenue per car. Together, the slight increase in volume and improved average revenue per car resulted in the 7% increase in freight revenue to a record $4.9 billion.","Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. Let's start with Coal, which we used to report as Energy. To avoid confusion with the fast-growing shale energy markets that are driving growth in Chemicals and Industrial Products, and other energy markets from wind to ethanol, going forward we're going to call this group Coal. This is just a renaming of the old Energy line of business. There is no change in what's included in the results.","In the second quarter, Coal revenue declined 9%, as the 10% improvement in average revenue per car wasn't enough to overcome the 17% drop in volume. Coal demand remained weak, as historically low natural gas prices reduced coal's share of electricity generation and mild winter weather sent coal stockpiles soaring. Powder River Basin stockpiles are estimated to have grown 70% from their low point last August, swinging from 7 days below normal at that time to nearly 20 days above -- 24 days above normal this April, before dropping back some in the past 2 months.","The tough market conditions and the ongoing impact of a couple of contract losses last year led to an 18% decline in Southern Powder River Basin tonnage. Colorado\/Utah tonnage grew 4%, overcoming the weak domestic demand with a 135% increase in export tons. Seasonal strengthening boosted overall coal volumes toward the end of the quarter and the recent upward movement in natural gas prices has been an encouraging trend, but the chart in the upper left shows we're still tracking well below last year and the comps get tougher in the second half.","Ag Products revenue was up 1%, as volume declined 2%, but average revenue per car improved 2% despite the negative mix impact. With improved world supply, grain exports have declined as expected, down 32% from last year's strong volumes. Reduced U.S. soybean crush drove a 6% decline in soybean meal shipment. DDGs declined 13% as more product was fed locally, reducing rail demand, and lower gasoline consumption was reflected in the 3% reduction in ethanol volumes. Partially offsetting those declines was an 8% growth in domestic grain shipments and a 3% growth in Food & Refrigerated carloads.","Automotive shipments grew 13%, which combined with an 8% improvement in average revenue per car, drove a 25% increase in revenue. As a reminder, last year's results were softened somewhat by the impact of the disaster in Japan on the Automotive supply chain. With Global Insight's current full year forecast at 14.2 million vehicles, the Automotive industry's continued recovery was reflected in solid year-over-year growth in sales. Improved credit availability is releasing pent-up demand to replace aging vehicles with new, more fuel-efficient and technologically equipped vehicles. For the UP, that translated into 14% growth in finished vehicle carloadings, while parts shipments grew 17%.","Chemicals revenue grew 14%, as a 12% volume increase combined with a 1% improvement in average revenue per car. Petroleum shipments increased 92%, driven by continued growth in crude oil shipments originated in the Bakken and Eagle Ford Shale plays and moving to UP-served terminals at St. James, Louisiana and Galveston and Houston in Texas. Plastics volume was up 7%, with increased demand and new business. Industrial chemicals, LPG and most other Chemicals segments also posted gains. However, fertilizer was an exception, with volume down 15%, as demand for potash remained soft. The decline in fertilizer also had a negative impact on average revenue per car.","Industrial Products grew 6%, which, combined with an 8% improvement in average revenue per car, produced a 14% revenue increase. UP's franchise is well-positioned to link new sand origins in the upper Midwest to new destination facilities in the oil-rich shale plays. Combine that with the continued conversion of rigs from vertical to horizontal drilling technology, now sand carloads continue to grow even as overall drilling activity was flat, driving a 28% increase in nonmetallic mineral shipments. Increased demand for rock into the Eagle Ford Shale play, along with increased construction activity in the Houston area, led to an 18% growth in rock traffic and an 8% increase in cement. As housing starts climbed, lumber carloadings increased 8% to their highest level since 2008, although they are still well below prerecession volumes.","Offsetting some of the strength in Industrial Products markets was a 55% or 11,600-unit decline in hazardous waste, as ramp-down of government funding has impacted our uranium tailings business in Utah.","Intermodal revenue grew 10%, as 3% growth in volume combined with a 7% improvement in average revenue per unit. Although the pace of recovery is slow, continued strengthening of the economy drove international Intermodal volume up 3%. Growth was dampened slightly by the continued impact of the contract loss last year, the effect of which we finally wrapped at the beginning of May. Continued success in converting highway business to rail drove 3% growth in domestic Intermodal.","That wraps up the second quarter, so let's take a look ahead at what we see for the second half of 2012. Our current outlook is for the economy to continue its slow improvement, although that's far from certain with ongoing problems in the Eurozone and fast approaching U.S. budget and tax policy challenges. No matter what the economy does, we'll continue to focus on our strong value proposition, attracting new customers and supporting our existing customers as they continue to work to grow their business.","Clearly, continued weakness in Coal presents a sizable challenge as we look at the rest of the year. While seasonal strengthening of coal shipments is already driving a stronger run rate sequentially, against the tougher comp, the third quarter volume decline is expected to be in the low to mid-teens. In ag, the prolonged and widespread drought conditions have moderated our earlier optimism about opportunities with the fall's harvest. Recent corn yield estimates have dropped back to last year's levels, likely eliminating any upside potential. World demand for U.S. soybeans still looks strong for the fall.","The good news is for -- our diverse franchise gives us a wide range of opportunities to offset the challenges and drive growth. The biggest of those opportunities is continued strength in shale energy, delivering inbound materials as well as outbound crude oil. While the slowdown in natural gas drilling and the slower-than-expected ramp-up of customer facilities has shale energy-related carloads a little off their expected pace, we still expect it to contribute about 2 points to overall growth for the year.","Shale energy will continue to be the largest growth driver in Industrial Products and Chemicals, with other segments of those 2 businesses expected to continue as they did in the first half. Forecasted improvement in housing starts and growth in nonresidential construction in the South should boost lumber, rock and cement in Industrial Products. While global markets may challenge some chemical manufacturers, low-cost feedstocks are keeping U.S. plants competitive, and facility expansions also provide us with opportunities. We anticipate strength in plastics will continue and industrial chemicals should track with the economy. We expect continued success converting highway business in domestic Intermodal and international Intermodal should pick up, tracking ahead of last year, as a slowing-growing economy is expected to produce a positive but somewhat muted peak season.","Auto manufacturers expect sales growth to continue and that should be good for our finished vehicles and auto parts business. Put that all together and we expect to overcome the challenges in Coal, with the anticipated volume growth combining with price gains to drive revenue growth.","With that, I'll turn it over to Lance.","Lance M. Fritz","Thanks, Eric. And good morning.","Starting with safety. For the year-to-date period, we came very close to achieving an all-time record performance in our reportable personal injury rate. The second quarter reportable rate increased 9% compared to 2011, offsetting the year-over-year improvement in the first quarter. More importantly, a fatal incident that occurred in Goodwell, Oklahoma at the end of June took the lives of 3 Union Pacific employees. It was a terrible reminder of how unforgiving our industry can be, and it underscores why we are relentless in pursuing the goal of 0 safety incidents.","With respect to rail equipment incidents to derailments, our year-to-date reportable rate improved 4%, and we are even more favorable in including all derailments, not those meeting -- not just those meeting the FRA reportable threshold. In public safety, the grade-crossing incident rate increased 22% in the year-to-date period, continuing the trend we saw in the first quarter. The combined effects of our robust growth in the South, which has a higher grade-crossing density than our overall network, and growth in commercial traffic has increased our grade-crossing accident exposure. We continue to focus on community support and driver behavior to address this increased risk.","Our safety strategy helps keep our network strong and resilient, and as a result, our network remains fluid and is operating at very efficient levels.","Weather was friendlier to our operation in the second quarter compared to last year, which helped, but that wasn't the whole story. In addition to milder weather, the operating team adapted the T-plan, locomotives and crews to manage ships and mix from Coal to growing manifest and premium volumes in the South. In Texas and Louisiana, we are effectively utilizing the existing infrastructure while we build new capacity, which I'll talk more about in a minute. As a result, velocity improved 2% to 26.6 miles per hour. Compared to 20 -- 2010, average speed was up 1% despite a 4% growth in our 7-Day volumes.","Our service scorecard illustrates UP's customer value proposition. The local operating teams continue to provide great service as reflected by Industry Spot & Pull, which tied an all-time quarterly record of 95%. The second quarter Service Delivery Index, a measure of how well we are meeting overall customer commitments, also improved from 2011 levels.","While the UP team is successfully managing the continued carload surge in the South, we continue to have capacity for growth in other parts of the system, with about 420 employees furloughed and around 900 locomotives in storage.","Moving on to network productivity. Slow order miles were down over 20% from last year, which was a second quarter record for us. Our network is in excellent shape, reflecting our investment in replacement capital.","Moving to the upper right, our car utilization metric improved year-over-year and reflects the improvement in network velocity and fluidity. In the lower left, gross ton-miles per employee declined 4% versus 2011, which includes the headwind of 700 additional employees working on capital projects and positive train control, driving about half the decrease. It also reflects the 17% decline in coal volumes, which is one of our heaviest commodities. Increased premium and manifest traffic, including local train starts, also amassed productivity gains.","While not shown on the graph here, productivity gains were also achieved on the Intermodal side, as train lengths grew to an all-time quarterly record of 173 boxes per train, improving 3% on a 3% increase in Intermodal volumes compared to 2011. Lastly, our team is leveraging the robust volume growth in the South, using UP's extensive terminal infrastructure to generate a 1% improvement in the number of cars switched per employee day.","To expand a bit more on the progress we're making in the South, second quarter volumes in the South were up 7% versus last year and up 6% from first quarter levels. In fact, we're pretty much back to prerecession volumes.","During the first quarter call, we talked about the initiatives underway to handle this robust growth efficiently. Our results demonstrate the great progress we've made advancing them in the second quarter. Benchmarking against the first quarter, you can see the improvement made in terminal dwell, on-time train departure and car connections, despite volume growth of 6%. We've realigned resources, adjusted car routings to leverage available terminal capacity and modified train starts to maintain fluid operations and to increase local service frequency. In addition, the capital investments we're making in the South are beginning to have a positive impact in supporting both volume growth and improved service levels.","Our targeted 2012 capital spend is still around the $3.6-billion mark. Spending for service growth and productivity will total over $1.3 billion. It's important to note that all of these projects have a positive safety impact. Capacity, commercial facilities and equipment are the primary drivers. The major projects include additional double track on the Sunset Corridor and the Blair project, work on the Santa Teresa, New Mexico facility and various projects in the South. Our capacity expansion plans in the South are estimated at around $200 million this year, increasing threefold from spending levels in 2011.","The map shows current and future investment plans. Late in the second quarter, we cut over new capacity in West Texas that will help us serve inbound and outbound loads for the Permian Basin. In the second half of 2012, we'll be cutting over additional new capacity across the system, including projects to efficiently deliver growth in crude oil moves to St. James, Louisiana. Most encouraging is that new capacity investments are generating an excellent return, while supporting our diverse book of business, including increased shale-related volumes, growing Mexico and Intermodal business, as well as export grains to the Gulf.","So with that, we remain positive on our operating outlook for 2012 and our ability to achieve network improvements on various fronts. A more mature Total Safety Culture, stronger relationships with local communities and improved infrastructure position us well to achieve our goal of another record safety year. We will provide customers with a value proposition that supports growth with high levels of service, and we are well positioned to react to dynamic shifts in volume while generating productivity and to invest a record amount of capital that generates attractive returns by increasing capacity in high-volume corridors.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert M. Knight","Thanks, Lance, and good morning.","Let's start by summarizing our second quarter results. Operating revenue grew 7% to an all-time quarterly record of $5.2 billion, driven by core pricing gains and improved fuel surcharge recovery. Operating expense totaled $3.5 billion, increasing only 1%. Lower fuel prices this quarter helped offset other cost increases after 9 consecutive quarters of higher year-over-year fuel prices. Operating income totaled $1.7 billion, a 24% increase and a best-ever quarterly performance.","Other income totaled $21 million, down $5 million compared to 2011. Interest expense of $135 million was also lower, down 9% versus last year. Income tax expense increased to $608 million, mostly driven by higher pretax earnings.","Quarterly net income exceeded the $1-billion mark for the first time in our history. It was up 28% versus 2011. The outstanding share balance declined 3%, reflecting our share repurchase activity. These results drove a quarterly earnings record of $2.10 per share, a 32% increase versus last year.","Turning now to our top line. Freight revenue grew 7% to a best-ever quarterly record of $4.9 billion. Volume growth was up about a 0.5 points. The mix impact was flat this quarter, unlike the first quarter, where it was a large positive driver on a year-over-year basis. Growth in Intermodal traffic and shorter length-of-haul moves such as stone, offset the growth impact of higher average revenue per car moves, such to shale-related activities.","Fuel surcharge revenue added 2% to our top line growth, driven in part from the positive lag impact of our fuel surcharge programs. The continued benefit from our recently negotiated legacy contracts generated a meaningful step-up in fuel surcharge coverage, contributing over 1% in freight revenue growth and roughly $0.05 in earnings per share compared to 2011. In addition, we achieved solid core pricing gains of 4.5%. However, pricing gains this quarter were impacted by the 17% decline in coal volumes. The combination of solid core pricing and fuel surcharge coverage gains reflect the value of Union Pacific's service offerings and contributed to the record profitability this quarter.","Moving on to the expenses. Slide 23 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which was down 1% compared to 2011. Consistent with our recent guidance, more moderate inflation drove only a 1.5% increase in costs. Positives in the quarter include mild weather conditions versus last year's Midwest floods; lower new hire training costs; and generally, more efficient operations. As you know, wages for our union employees will increase effective July 1, which will drive inflation costs higher in the second half of the year to roughly 2.5%.","Workforce levels increased 2% in the quarter compared to 2011, driven entirely by increased capital activity, including positive train control. Excluding growth on the capital side, we still expect workforce levels to increase for the full year, but not at a one-for-one rate with volume growth.","Slide 24 shows fuel expense, which totaled $882 million, decreasing $22 million versus last year. The average diesel fuel price was $3.21 per gallon, which declined 2% year-over-year. The mix shift of lower coal volumes and growth in manifest and premium traffic drove a 2% increase in our fuel consumption rate, partially offsetting the impact of lower fuel prices.","Purchased services and material expense increased 5% to $542 million, driven in part by higher subsidiary contract expenses relating to the 17% growth in subsidiary revenue reflected on our Other Revenue line. Engineering, locomotive and freight car repair expense also increased this quarter, driven by increased material usage and inflation costs. Overall, our year-over-year comparison was a bit easier due to the $10 million in flood-related expenses that we incurred last year in this expense line.","Other expenses came in at $190 million, down $6 million compared to 2011, driven by lower personal injury expense. Our recent actuarial study resulted in a larger reduction to our estimate for prior year activity, compared to last year. Conversely, equipment and freight damage costs increased roughly $15 million, while property tax expense was also up compared to last year.","For the third and fourth quarters, we expect the other expense line to be more in the range of what we saw in the first quarter of this year, barring any unusual items.","Slide 26 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Depreciation expense increased 8% to $433 million, mainly driven by increased capital spending. Looking at the full year 2012, we expect depreciation expense to be up around 8% to 9% compared to 2011.","Equipment and other rents expense totaled $299 million, up 6% from 2011. Growth in Automotive and Intermodal volumes drove an increase in short-term freight car rental expense, which was partially offset by lower locomotive lease expense.","Bringing revenue and expenses together, Slide 27 reflects our operating ratio performance. This quarter, we achieved an all-time quarterly best of 67 operating ratio, improving 4.3 points compared to last year, and more than 1 point better than our previous record set in the third quarter of 2010. Lower fuel prices contributed to about 1 point of the improvement versus 2011. For 2012, we've tightened our guidance a bit and we are now targeting a sub-70 full year operating ratio, which would be a first-ever in our history.","Our incremental margin, after adjusting for fuel price and last year's flood impact, was a notable 78% for the quarter, highlighting the positive impact of core pricing gains, improved fuel surcharge coverage, operational efficiencies and growth in attractive new businesses. That said, it's also likely to be the high mark for the year.","Union Pacific's record earnings drove solid free cash flow in the first half of the year, but below 2011 due to a 37% increase in capital spending and a 54% increase in our cash dividend payments. While cash from operations improved year-over-year, earnings growth was masked by more than $600 million in higher cash tax payments. Much of that was driven by the 100% bonus depreciation program in effect last year, which significantly reduced our tax payments in 2011. Although the impact of bonus depreciation will still be a net benefit to free cash flow this year, it will result in a headwind compared to 2011, due to the catch-up of prior year's programs and a lower bonus depreciation rate in 2012. Our balance sheet remains strong, supporting our investment-grade credit rating. At June 30, 2012, our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio was 40.6%.","We continue to make opportunistic share repurchases, which play an important role in our balanced approach to cash allocation. Union Pacific's increasing returns over the last several years have enabled us to drive greater shareholder value. In the second quarter, we bought back 3.8 million shares totaling $415 million at an average purchase price of around $110 per share. Combining dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned over $1.4 billion to our shareholders in the first half of 2012, up more than 40% versus last year. Looking ahead, we have 20.2 million shares remaining under our current authorization, which expires March 31, 2014.","That's a recap of our second quarter results. Looking forward, our quarterly financial comps become more challenging, but we still expect to achieve record earnings and a sub-70 operating ratio in 2012. In addition, we're still forecasting volumes to be on the positive side of the ledger for the full year. Continued growth in domestic Intermodal, energy-related shale moves of crude oil, frac sand and pipe, in addition to strong Automotive and Chemical shipments, should offset the Coal decline.","We're committed to achieving real pricing gains, driven by the increased value of our service offerings and solid demand in many market sectors. Our prospects for 2012, supported by Union Pacific's strong value proposition and the strength of our diverse franchise, should result in greater profitability and allow us to grow shareholder returns.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Jack.","John J. Koraleski","Thanks, Rob. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, the global economic outlook has become more uncertain and coal volumes are certainly going to remain a challenge. However, we're going to continue to take advantage of the opportunities provided by our diverse franchise to drive record financial results.","I want to emphasize a point that Lance made. Union Pacific's commitment to employee and public safety is our #1 priority. That has not and will not change. We'll continue to focus on providing efficient service that adds great value for our customers. We're well positioned for upside, while remaining agile in today's changing environment. That said, we still believe in our prospects for growing profitability, generating improved returns and increasing shareholder value this year.","So with that, let's open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Let's see, I wanted to see if you could give a bit more commentary on the Coal view. Your slide shows that in absolute loads, it seems like things have bottomed, but you do have more difficult comparisons in the second half. So how would we think about year-over-year? I think you had some stockpile comments. I didn't catch them all, and then I don't know if you want to comment on natural gas within that. And then do you think the broader -- a little more detail on your outlook for Coal in the second half.","John J. Koraleski","Okay, Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, Tom. In terms of our Coal outlook, as we said earlier, our run rate is increasing as weather increase in load. Coal load demand increases also as natural gas prices increase. Our coal utility providers become more competitive in terms of using coal versus natural gas. As we said, in the third quarter, we will continue to have some tough comps as you saw on the slide, even as our volumes sequentially improve, which is why we said that third quarter will be down, again, in the low -- in the second half. The third quarter, we said, will be down in the low to mid-teens.","Robert M. Knight","If I could just to add, Tom. To your point on the trough, what that slide shows is that our low point was in the second quarter -- on an absolute basis. Forget the year-over-year for a second. On an absolute basis, we did trough out on our coal in the second quarter, and that was at a low, on a PRB basis, of around 23 trains per day, and we have sequentially grown to where we're running at around, call it, 30 trains per day PRB today. So we clearly have come out of that trough.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And, Eric, you -- I think you might have mentioned this. I just didn't catch it. What was the stockpile level that you -- days in stockpiles you think you're at today?","Eric L. Butler","We did -- I don't think we actually mentioned the absolute number, there. The report comes out this afternoon. We are expecting a reduction in the stockpiles with the report that comes out today or tomorrow. It will be around the low 20s, we think, above normal -- in terms of days above normal. So we are seeing continued, and expecting, particularly with this kind of weather that you're seeing across the country, a reduction in what the stockpile report will show.","John J. Koraleski","Tom, I'm a little skeptical of that reported information. It's going to go and show, as Eric said -- the last report that came out said 23 days of available stockpile. Our customer base is not expecting or is not behaving like they have 23 days of excess coal supplies. They are ordering more coal. They are bringing more coal sets on service. So that is a generalized number and I think it involves all Powder River Basin shipments throughout the United States. I think in our served territory, we might actually be in somewhat better position than what that average stat might indicate.","Eric L. Butler","Yes, as Rob mentioned, we are seeing our run rate sequentially improve.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. I mean, for the second question, if I could -- there is so much focus on legacy contracts this year. I don't think I've heard you talk much about legacy in 2013, but you've shown charts, I believe, $350 million in legacy business in 2013. Can you give us a sense of the timing of that? Is that all skewed to the beginning of the year, so you'd see kind of a full year benefit? And is that all coal? Or is there some other stuff in it?","Robert M. Knight","Tom, I would refer you and others to the chart that you've seen us use in the past, that kind of lays out the pie chart, if you will, of legacy, where we show in 2013, there's about $350 million of legacy renewals up in 2013. And most of that is front-end loaded, and we haven't broken out precisely, but as you know, the bulk of what's still in front of us is Coal-related.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just -- Rob, I want to just to follow up on a comment that you made, which is that the decline in Coal affected core price. Do you know roughly how much that would have affected it if it had just been, say, flat?","Robert M. Knight","Yes, roughly, it's -- if you recall, Bill, in the first quarter, we said about a 0.5 points of our pricing was hurt, if you will, by the fall-off in Coal. That was even worse in the second quarter because Coal was down more. So it was more than 0.5 points.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On core price?","Robert M. Knight","On price, yes.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, got it. Okay. And then the -- I realize that there's a lot of moving parts here and there's uncertainty, but I think -- correct me if I'm wrong. Usually, the third quarter is typically your best OR quarter, and Coal, at least sequentially, looks like it will be a little bit better. So I sort of look at kind of the sub-70s target and I say, well, given where the first half was, the second half should be better. So that feels like a pretty modest guide. Or is there a part here that we have to remember just in terms of a cost metric or something, as we model the second half?","John J. Koraleski","Go ahead out there [ph], Rob. Go for it. We're going to fight over this one.","Robert M. Knight","Bill, I mean, we're -- there's a lot of uncertainty out there in the world, so we're -- I would just say this, that we're not going to solve for the 70. Just like all the previous targets we've set, we're going to get there as efficiently as we can and do it the right way, and that's through a combination of good service, safe service, pricing it right and running it efficiently. So don't look at the 70 as a solve-for number. We're going to get there as efficiently as we can, but there's a lot of uncertainties in front of us.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","No, that's fair. That's fair. Just one last detail. I think in the past, you tried to estimate a market size for some of the shale play. Can you just remind us sort of what numbers you've thrown out?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","I'm not sure we've thrown out any absolute total market size numbers. What we have said in the past is that we would kind of double our volumes this year. And what we've said today is that, as we look at the outlook, our current outlook, that's about a 2% impact on our volume growth. I'm not sure we've given an ultimate market size impact of the shale play in the past.","John J. Koraleski","I think, Bill, one of the things we've said in the past was we expected our shale business, when you add it all up together, to be somewhere close to 400,000 carloads this year. And as Eric reported, there's a couple of customer facilities that are a little slower coming online. We're probably going to fall a little bit short of the 400,000, but not too terribly much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So, Rob, I just wanted to follow up on the yields, and you talked about how mix was kind of a neutral in the quarter after a big positive in the first quarter. How should we think about mix in the back half of the year? And then just to follow-up on the point about Coal, as the coal volume declines moderate, is it fair that we should think that the same-store pricing increases a little bit, relative to that 4.5% in the second quarter?","Robert M. Knight","I'm not giving guidance on the mix. But as you know, Scott, it really is dependent upon the -- what actually moves. So we saw a fairly dramatic shift from first quarter to second quarter on that mix, which is a result of, as I pointed out, worse Coal, more Intermodal, more manifest, lower ARC moves. We're not troubled by that, by the way, because what we're focused on -- whatever the business is that we move, we're focused on doing it, handling it right and generating strong returns, as we proved in the second quarter, even without the benefit of mix. So I can't give you guidance on the mix, other than it's not an excuse for us to turn in less attractive margins, and we'll continue to approach it that way. And in terms of your question on the core pricing, yes. I mean, just generally speaking, again, we're not giving pricing guidance, but to your point, as Coal strengthens, we should achieve the benefit of some of those renegotiated contracts as that business picks up.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay, that's great. And then, just want to understand your thoughts on grain, given what's going on in the Midwest and the drought conditions. When you talk about eliminating the upside corn potential, does that mean you guys are now thinking about grain volumes being flat, going forward, starting in third quarter? Or is there still a chance that we get positive grain volumes, given the comps being easy and what still look like strong wheat production and wheat exports?","Robert M. Knight","Yes, if you look at -- or if you go back a couple of months and look at the USDA projections, they projected this year to be almost a bumper year, one of the best years, one of the best 3 or 4 best years in terms of crop yield, crop production. That clearly has come down with the current drought conditions. I think the latest USDA projections are it's going to be relatively flat versus last year in terms of crop yield, crop production, and so our outlook in our ag business is probably relatively similar to that.","John J. Koraleski","We actually have -- I think, Scott, if you look at it, we have somewhat easier comparisons in the third and fourth quarters, so we're hopeful that at least, if it doesn't get any worse than what they're currently talking about, we're hoping that we could still do a little better from a volume perspective in the second half than last year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was curious, as we look at Coal and kind of trend out through the remainder of the year, at this point, if you were assuming normal weather, when do you get to normal stockpiles that your utilities serve? And then, how do you think about, directionality, 2013 volumes? I know this is difficult, but just curious, I mean, from your standpoint, how you're thinking about next year and -- in terms of flat, down or up.","John J. Koraleski","Justin, you're right. This is really difficult. If the kind of weather pattern that we see right now persists through the end of year, we should reach a point where we'll be okay with the stockpiles and our Coal business should be coming back to a more normal kind of a run rate for us. That's a pretty big \"if\". We've seen the weather change dramatically off and on. So you've been with us a long time. You've seen that happen from year to year. If the stockpiles stay where they are, come in on a normal range, we'll have a pretty good year next year in our Coal business, and hopefully it won't have the aberrations. We'll see. And then the other swing factor is what's going to happen with natural gas prices. Will they act the way the forward curve is kind of looking and continue to edge their way up? If that happens, we'll have a better prospect for a good year next year. If they crater on us and fall back down again, it will be a little more difficult.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So you still see Western coal, I mean, as solidly baseload. You haven't seen permanent switching that you think would impair that growth rate, looking out over the next couple of years.","John J. Koraleski","That's right. We do not see anything happening right at the moment that causes us to think the growth rate is impaired.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on the export side, there's been a little bit of news with you guys and Peabody. Just curious where you guys are trending right now in terms of exports, and how you think about that business on a go-forward basis.","John J. Koraleski","Last year, we moved about 5 million tons of export coal. We think we're on a track run to increase that 60% to about 8 million tons this year, with the recent announcement, as we continue to look for other opportunities for port capacity to export.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Capital.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jack, when we go back to your Analyst Day a couple of years ago, when you guys laid out the strategy to get to 65 or 67, I don't think anyone envisioned that you'd be getting to numbers close to that this quickly. So could you just talk about some of the risks? I mean, obviously, we've seen Coal come down. It hasn't had much impact. But what could get in the way of achieving that maybe a little bit faster than was anticipated a couple of years ago?","John J. Koraleski","Brandon, I think as we laid that out in terms of the 67 to 65, the thing that I would put into perspective for you is, we have no intention of stopping there. If we get there sooner rather than later, then the goal just drops below the 65 at some point in time. We're going to continue to look at that. Certainly right now, when you look at what are the things that could get in the way, there's a wide assortment of those things, all of which we're up to the challenge of managing. You have the U.S. economic situation that will -- taking place. Of course out here, everyone, there's a lot in the press about the financial cliff that's approaching, depending on how the tax bills and things get settled out. That's certainly a risk to us. There's always a concern about what happens with fuel prices, long-term and near-term. We're watching carefully the global positioning of the global economy. When you look at anywhere between 30% to 40%, in any given quarter, of our business originates or terminates in another country, certainly what happens in China, what happens in the Eurozone and all those things can represent risk. Interestingly enough, they can also represent opportunity for us. So as the economic climate of Europe becomes more unstable, that raises the prospects in the United States of possibly moving some of that manufacturing to our economy, and particularly if we continue to see a positive impact on energy prices as a result of shale and shale development and those kinds of things. So there's a whole variety of things that -- up to and including weather. As we're seeing this year, weather can be a friend; weather can be an enemy. All of those things kind of play their role. But that being said, the path may be a little saw-toothed in getting there, but we will get there. And when we get there, we'll reassess where we're headed and we'll keep our direction on providing the most efficiency and productivity, while adding great value for our customers.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. And maybe one for Eric, as well, on Intermodal, which has actually seen some pretty favorable growth, a little bit above the economy here. How's your Mutual Commitment Program rolling out through the year?","Eric L. Butler","We're excited about our Mutual Commitment Program. We think it is a strong leverage value for us in the opportunity -- in the marketplace. We're seeing a number of our customers adopt it, as they're recognizing the value of it. And throughout this year, in terms of the volumes that we're seeing that have gone through our MCP program, we -- they're aligned with what we expect and what we have planned, and we're excited about the continued upside opportunity.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, Rob, just to clarify, you're not in any way kind of talking down second half with the sub-70 OR. Are you just looking at that? And I guess, to that point, I guess, on the employee cost side, you mentioned that you were looking at it to go up, I guess, or union wages were going up. It was -- I guess on a per-employee basis, costs were down 3% this quarter. Should we be looking for that to spike back up on a year-over-year basis in the back half?","Robert M. Knight","Yes, Ken, a couple of points. And I am not saying things are going to get worse in the second half. What I'm simply giving is the record guidance of operating performance on a full year basis. And remember, that long-term target of 65, 67 is a full year number. And as I pointed on my comments, we've never in our history had a sub-70 operating ratio for a full year, and we're focused on doing that. But again, we're not going to solve for 70. We're going to get there as efficiently as we can. And if we get sub-70 -- the more sub we can get, the better. In terms of the point I was making on the cost side, just simply calling out that the inflation rate will go up a little bit in the third quarter as a result of the labor agreements. In -- I think I pointed out in my comments that, that labor line inflation will look more like 2.5% rather than the 1.5% that it was in the second quarter.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So we could still -- assuming if it was down 3% on a per-employee basis, if you add a point, you could still see that aiding results then, right?","Robert M. Knight","Yes, Ken, that is -- you're exactly right. Those are still very good efficiency and productivity numbers from a cost standpoint.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right, great. And then, Jack, is there any expectation for an update or proposed rulemaking, or anything out of the STB following last summer's hearings that you would expect in the back half?","John J. Koraleski","You know, Ken, the STB has made some comments that would lead us to believe they are going to have some sort of announcement, pronouncement, finding or something. We don't know what that is yet, nor do we know the timing of it. So the answer to your question is I just don't know.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So there's nothing that's heating up, at least you've heard, behind the scenes or anything to lead you to believe that something is more imminent than not.","John J. Koraleski","No. No change.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Dahlman Rose.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Two lines of questioning, one on the Intermodal front, the other on pricing. You mentioned that you're up to a record 173 boxes per train. I was wondering sort of where you think you're going to max out. In other words, how much capacity do you have left in the Intermodal network?","Lance M. Fritz","Jason, I'll take the -- this is Lance. I'll take the capacity question. We've said this before that we've got plenty of upside in terms of productivity and train size. And specific to the Intermodal business, it's corridor-specific, but I think historically, we've said we could go -- we could see getting to a \"200 boxes per train\" kind of number. But again, it just depends on where the growth is, but we've got upside potential on virtually every corridor where Intermodal is, and we're investing to enable future growth as we speak. So candidly, I just don't see a limit at this point.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. My other question is around the pricing. And the comment was made, just so I understand it, 4.5% is in the core. Coal hurt you by more than 0.5%. My question is, what percent of the business right now is sort of tied to inflationary indexes? And how do you think that, kind of, was calculated into the mix? Is that -- did that hurt that core pricing number a bit?","Robert M. Knight","So what we've historically said is that about 75% of our business is -- and that is in contracts, long-term contracts. If you look at the percent of our business that's related to ALIF [ph] or RCAF increases, that's been -- we've historically said that's about 17% of our business.","John J. Koraleski","And that number was only 1.5% in the second quarter, so...","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","It would have a negative impact on the core pricing number that you gave.","John J. Koraleski","Yes, to some extent.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Ceraso of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Group.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Some questions as it relates to Coal and pricing. Can you give us an idea -- outside of legacy, I know you mentioned the $350 million of legacy for next year, but outside of that, maybe contracts that have turned over more recently, what percent of your Coal business is going to reprice in 2013? And what should we expect if we assume -- let's say we assume natural gas is in the $2.50 to $3 range, do you anticipate that pricing can be steady? Or is it going to have to come down? What's your view if we make that assumption?","John J. Koraleski","Rob, do you want to handle the legacy...","Robert M. Knight","Yes. Let me just say this, Chris, in terms of your question, we don't give the specifics in terms of how much business we're negotiating. But just rest assured, we're in constant negotiations across our entire book of business daily. I mean, we talk a lot about the marquee, if you will, legacy renewals, but we don't give specific guidance numbers beyond that, so -- it's just a constant part of our business and a constant part of what we do in our marketing and sales team.","Eric L. Butler","Yes, let me talk about the second part of your question on -- it sounded like you were asking, do we address our prices based on natural gas prices? We absolutely price to the market. We don't adjust our prices based on commodity prices. We believe we have a strong value proposition, and we believe the marketplace is recognizing our service and value proposition, and we're continuing to price to that value proposition across our entire book of business, including Coal.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right, yes. I wasn't suggesting it was tied directly to the price, but more in line with your comment about the market. If natural gas is in the $2.50 to $3 range, what is the market for PRB coal? Is it competitive and you would expect, therefore, that prices are okay?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. I think there is a number of different kind of public assessments that suggests that for PRB coal, $2.50, $3 natural gas price is about the place where PRB coal becomes more competitive versus gas for many of our serving utilities.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, the yields in the Chemicals business were a little bit weak. I'm sorry if I missed the reason for that. Was it a mix issue? Or what was going on there?","Eric L. Butler","Mix.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","What specifically?","Eric L. Butler","Well, as you know, our fertilizer business was down, as we talked about in our comments. And also, I think we talked about last quarter in terms of the tremendous growth that we have in our crude oil business, in our crude oil franchise. We talked about last quarter, I believe, that some of that business is shorter haul, so there's a downward mix impact associated with that.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe a question on the Intermodal side. Eric, just on the -- can you give us a pricing update? I just want to get a sense of what kind of the current dynamic feels like right now. We've had fuel prices come in a little bit on the domestic side. I'm just kind of wondering with the dynamic is with truck, and kind of how you're feeling about that market.","Eric L. Butler","Yes. That's a good question. I think if you look at our results for the quarter, you could see that we're getting strong pricing in the quarter. Truck costs are going up. There is a competitive environment out there, and the Intermodal business, as you know, is historically competitive with truck. But we are seeing a pressure on the costs for truck providers, and we've had a pretty good results in the quarter in terms of our growth in Intermodal pricing, as you've seen.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So the recent move we've had, which I know has kind of bounced off of the bottom recently on fuel, hasn't necessarily had much of an impact from a market share perspective.","Eric L. Butler","We still see there's strong opportunity for pricing out there. Certainly, as you go through any period of time, you might see a period of time where a trucker wants to price something on fuel, but that doesn't change our strategy and we're continuing to drive our value proposition.","John J. Koraleski","So we have not seen much of an impact.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a little bit bigger picture as far as some headlines we've seen recently about the potential for East Coast labor issues, I'm just wondering how much does that get involved in conversations you have with customers as you're thinking about kind of the midsummer, kind of late, early fall type of a peak discussion? Does it come up at all? Are people thinking about it?","Eric L. Butler","Customers are thinking about it. We have not seen much of an impact to date. Certainly, if there were an East Coast labor impact, customers are saying that they would use West Coast options. But to date, we haven't seen much of an impact.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And from a mutual commitment perspective, does that give you just one more kind of, a little bit more leverage in those discussions? Or is that not yet kind of on the table?","Eric L. Butler","To date, we're not really seeing that being much of an impact.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Peter Nesvold of Jefferies & Company.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I think most of my questions have been addressed. And maybe just a quick one on velocity. So velocity continues to improve here. Is there any way of thinking about that on an apples-to-apples basis? I suspect with coal volumes down, that's going to help velocity, all else equal. And then I guess what I'm trying to think about is, as volumes start coming back at some point, are you going to be able to hold the velocity gains that you're putting up right now as a result of the capital projects? Or should we assume that some of that starts to revert to the mean again?","Lance M. Fritz","Yes. So the way to think about velocity, the way we look at velocity, we believe, given the profiles that we've got looking forward, we can maintain the kind of velocity we've got right now. Our capital programs target where we have constraints in the network, and so we -- presuming we're effectively attacking those constraints, which we have been, that -- those really won't get in the way too much. What might be a risk to go-forward velocity is if growth happens in a rapid, unexpected fashion, somewhere where we're highly constrained, that can be a negative. But even this year, we've shown that where we get a significant growth in the South, where we are highly constrained, we've been able to manage through that largely and still put up good numbers.","John J. Koraleski","If you're looking year-over-year, Peter, the one thing to remember is that last year, we were hurt very badly by the drought in the South and the flooding situation in terms of our overall velocity, so...","Lance M. Fritz","That's right.","John J. Koraleski","Year-over-year, our current operating environment is much more favorable.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All my questions have been answered, except one. I just wanted to touch in here on the peak season. I know one of your competitors in the East, earlier this week, talked about a little bit more of a muted peak season and I think yours, sort of, was around that same line. I think you mentioned positive but muted. I think that's where we were last year. I'm just curious as to whether that comment was relative to last year. Or are we looking at kind of the same thing as you saw last year?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. I mean, when we talk about peak season, we typically talk, rough numbers, 10% to 12% improvement in volumes for the peak season vis-\u00e0-vis the period of time before the peak season. This year, our current outlook is probably 5% to 8% improvement in volumes, which will be muted from what we typically see, but we think it will be a little stronger than what we've seen last year.","Operator","Our next question is from Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","The question is around the shale business. I think in aggregate, we think about it as a potential 400,000-carload business. Can you walk us through the length-of-haul dynamics in there? I heard you say crude was a shorter haul, but I think frac sand is long. And then right now, what's the mix of, say, unit train businesses versus manifest?","John J. Koraleski","Okay, Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. There is a variety of locations. There's a balance there, some longer-haul business, some short-haul business. As you know, a sizable position of our crude oil business is joint line business with the BN and the CP out of the Bakken. So that has an impact. The crude oil business coming out of the Eagle Ford Shale, going to St. James, that's a shorter distance. So there's a number of ins and outs in terms of length of haul, depending on where the business is flowing from and where the sand business is flowing from.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then unit train versus manifest?","Eric L. Butler","The vast majority of our crude oil business is unit train business. Historically, our sand business has been manifest business, but we're driving more unit train opportunities with the current volumes. I think our current outlook in terms of the percent of unit trains in our sand business will be about 15%.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then a follow-up, somewhat unrelated, but the Intermodal peak you just referenced, does the uptake in MCP smooth that peak? I'm just trying to separate what's happening in the economy versus how the MCP might smooth your peak, round it off [ph]...","Eric L. Butler","Yes. Again, if you recall the MCP, the intent of that was to smooth our year-round volumes. The peak driver really is market drivers, and to the extent someone does not have an MCP agreement with us, they would have to try to get boxes and service on a peak spot-price basis.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Larkin of Stifel, Nicolaus.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","We talked a little bit about labor inflation earlier on. Rob, could you give us an outlook for, overall, maybe inflation x fuel for the second half, and then through 2013? And then how much of that inflation you believe the company might be able to offset through a continuation of its productivity enhancements?","Robert M. Knight","Yes, John. Overall inflation, I'd say, is in the 2% to 3% range overall for us. And as you -- which is down as you know from last year. And our going-in position -- we haven't finalized our 2013 numbers. But I can just tell you this, that our going-in position, just at it is every year, is to offset -- we challenge ourselves to offset inflation with productivity. And there's lumpiness in there and mix will play a role in that, but that's the way we approach it. And if we hit half of that, let's say, that's doing pretty good. And if you look historically, we've achieved above that half, offsetting inflation with productivity. But we'll go in with that kind of mindset.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That's great. And then as a follow-on, on the 4.5% core price improvement year-over-year, if you backed out the impact of the legacy repricing that's taken place over the last 12 months, what would the core pricing have been in that case?","Robert M. Knight","John, this is Rob again. Roughly 1.5 points of the 4.5% was legacy, and again, that was held back because of the lack of volume in Coal that we talked about. But rough numbers, I'd say about 1.5 points of that.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein Research.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just 2 questions: one on petroleum, one Intermodal. For the petroleum business, it ramped pretty substantially, 28.8 to 55.2 on the carload side. Is that a good run-rate number? Or are you guys still in the process of bringing on more destinations and facilities? And where do you think that run rate will sort of level out over the next 6 months?","Eric L. Butler","We're still in the process of bringing on more destinations and facilities.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And do you -- can you give us a sense for how much more that will ramp? Obviously, the 92% growth is probably a little high.","Eric L. Butler","Yes. We're expecting additional growth. It will probably sequentially not be as high as the growth that we've seen, but we are expecting additional growth.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Can you give us any kind of direction, like 10, 20, 30, 50?","Robert M. Knight","David, this is Rob. No is the answer to that.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","All right. I just figured I ask. And then for the Intermodal business, the volume decline, you seem to have sort of offset the prior weakness and the pricing on it. At least the reported RPU number is down. Are those things independent? Or have you guys taken the throttle off a little bit on pricing in Intermodal to offset some of that share loss?","Eric L. Butler","I'm not sure I understand the question. Would you say that again?","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So in the last couple of quarters, you have been getting to double-digit RPU gains in Intermodal and volume declines in Intermodal. This quarter, you got a 3% gain in Intermodal volume and a 6% gain in Intermodal RPU. Are those independent? Or are those -- or are you -- or have you guys taken the throttle off a little bit on pricing aspirations in Domestic Intermodal?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, I think those are independent. I think if you look in the previous quarters, we basically were able to renegotiate some legacy things and get fuel where we had not historically gotten fuel. So that's where you see that. In terms of the volume improvement that you see this quarter, we think that, that's really market-related-driven. We are still focused and maintaining our price strategy and are excited about the results of that.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So market-driven from a domestic or international standpoint?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, in -- the international business has strengthened a little, stronger than what we expected in our earlier outlook. And our domestic business, in terms of highway conversions, are also coming very strong.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee.","Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Sal Vitale on for Jeff. Just a quick question on the fuel surcharge side. So fuel surcharge increased coverage accounted for roughly 1% of revenue growth this quarter. I think it was also similar, roughly 1%, last quarter. How sustainable is this? So at what point will this start to tail off? I mean, what percentage of your overall book of businesses currently have -- currently -- do you currently assess fuel surcharge on?","John J. Koraleski","Okay, Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. Sal, well, you've probably heard me say that we're not going to sleep at night until we have 100% of our book of business with adequate fuel surcharge recovery mechanisms in place, and we're not there yet. But we did take a big step forward with the big legacy renewals that we talked about that were both at the end of 2011 and early 2012, and that's what you're seeing the continuation of, here in the second quarter. So I would not expect that once we lap these legacy renewals, that you'll see as big a step forward as you saw in the second quarter. But we would expect it to still move directionally in the right direction because we're not ,at 100% to where we want to be.","Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And also, you said you start to lap that in the third quarter. Or is it the fourth quarter?","Robert M. Knight","No, it would be fourth quarter. End of fourth quarter is when some of that started.","Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, understood. And then just -- if I could just revisit the labor cost side. That was very impressive labor performance. So you're saying that the labor inflation for the second half should be about a point higher than it was in the second quarter. So would it be fair to assume that your labor expense per employee would be down on a year-over-year basis in the second half or flattish?","Robert M. Knight","We've got capital employees in there as well, including the positive train control. So I mean, directionally -- I can't give an answer, but that's probably not directionally off, Sal.","Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just the last question, if I could. What are you currently playing -- paying for fuel? What is your current fuel price?","Robert M. Knight","Over -- just slightly over $3 right now, and going up, slightly going up.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brad Delco of Stephens Inc.","A. Brad Delco - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Eric, I guess this is for you. A little bit more on the Intermodal pricing. It seems as if IMCs are expecting, or commented that pricing was a little bit weaker, and I thought maybe I could get an update from you on how many boxes you have parked, what your expectations are in the back half of the year. And would you expect your domestic Intermodal pricing to be maybe decelerating on a year-over-year basis in the back half of the year versus what we saw last year?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, I don't think we've publicly talked about how many domestic boxes we have stored. We view that as a competitive -- internal competitive information. We, as you know, are focused on price. We're focused on our value proposition, and we certainly understand the value of our services and that's where we're pricing them at. I can't speak to other IMCs and others in terms of how they are pricing their services, but we are pricing ours based on our value proposition, and our results in the quarter demonstrate that. And we're not changing our strategy in the future.","A. Brad Delco - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. Well, if I ask it another way, would you say your value proposition is as strong this year as it was last year?","Eric L. Butler","We are as highly confident of our value proposition. As I said -- as you said, you've seen what some of the IMCs have reported and what they have said. I would just say we have a strong belief in our value proposition and if the business is not re-investable, if the business we don't believe is supportive of our value proposition, we're okay not getting every piece of business.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Koraleski for closing comments.","John J.

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may begin.","Lance Fritz","Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific\u2019s fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Jim Vena, Chief Operating Officer; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. ","This morning Union Pacific is reporting 2019 fourth quarter net income of $1.4 billion or $2.02 per share. This compares to $1.6 billion or $2.12 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our quarterly operating ratio came in at 59.7%, a 1.9 percentage point improvement compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. ","This represents a fourth quarter record and the third straight quarter with an operating ratio that starts with a 59. That\u2019s a remarkable achievement given the volume challenges we experienced in 2019.

","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kenny to provide more details on our results. ","Kenny Rocker","Thank you, Lance and good morning. For the fourth quarter, our volume was down 11% primarily due to declines in Premium and the Energy business group. The decrease in volume partially offset by a 1% improvement and average revenue per car drove freight revenue to be down 10% in the quarter. ","Let\u2019s take a closer look at the performance for each of the business groups. Starting off with Ag products, revenue for the quarter was down 2% on a 2% decrease in volumes and flat in an average revenue per car. Grain carloads were down 1%, as fewer domestic shipments were partially offset by modest gains in exports. ","Volume for grain products was up 2% driven by an increase in ethanol from the Midwest to East Coast markets. Fertilizer and sulfur carloads were down 13% primarily due to weakness in export potash.","Moving on to Energy, revenue was down 25% as volume declined 20%, coupled with a 6% decrease in average revenue per car related to negative mix with the loss of long-haul sand volume. Sand carloads were down 53%, due to the impact of local sand as well as a slowdown in market activity. ","Coal and coke volume was down 25%, due to a weaker market conditions resulting from lower natural gas prices and soft export demand. In addition, contract changes also impacted volume in the quarter.","However, on a positive note, favorable crude oil price spreads drove an increase in crude oil shipments, which was the primary driver for the 19% increase in petroleum, LPG, and renewable carloads for the quarter and we expect to see this positive trend for crude oil to continue in 2020. ","Industrial revenue volume and average revenue per car were flat for the quarter. Both construction and plastic shipments have been strong in all of 2019 and continued to be favorable in the fourth quarter as well. ","Construction carloads increased 5%, primarily driven by strong market demand in the south for rock shipments. Plastics volume increased 2% due to plant expansion but tempered due to soft domestic demand. Forest product volume decreased 8% driven by softness in the lumber and paper markets.","Turning to Premium, revenue for the quarter was down 14% on a 15% decrease in volume, while average revenue per car improved by 1%. Domestic intermodal volume declined 8%, primarily driven by an abundant truck supply, coupled with softer demand during peak seasons.","International intermodal volume was down 23% during the quarter, reflecting weak market conditions related to trade uncertainty, and a challenging year-over-year fourth quarter comp driven by accelerated shipments in 2018 seeking to avoid tariffs.","And finally, finished vehicle shipments were down 13% for the quarter reflecting weak year-over-year auto sales, coupled with the GM labor strike. Fourth quarter U.S. auto sales were down approximately 1% from 2018. Strong light truck and SUV sales did not fully offset declining car demand.","Going forward, we will begin to report on our three business groups, Bulk, Industrial and Premium. For 2020, in our Bulk segment, we expect coal to experience continued challenges with volume in the New Year and weather conditions will always be a factor for coal demand. ","However, on a positive note, we anticipate continued strength in advanced biofuel shipments and associated feedstock due to an increase in demand. We also expect stronger beer shipments along with long-term penetration growth across multiple segments of our food and refrigerated business. ","In addition, with the recent signing of the Phase I trade deal with China, we expect to see those Ag exports resume in the latter half of the year. For Industrial, local sand supply will continue to further impact volume. ","However, we anticipate an increase in plastic shipments driven largely by a plant expansion coming online this year as well as continued strength in the construction market in the south. ","Additionally, we expect favorable crude oil price spreads to drive positive results for petroleum products. ","And lastly, for Premium, the U.S. light vehicle sales forecast for 2020 is 16.7 million units, down between 2% to 3% from 2019. Consumer preference for SUVs over Sedans will continue to partially offset the decline in car demand. ","Domestic intermodal volume is sequentially strengthening, however, will continue to be impacted by truck competition in the first half of 2020. From where we sit today, we expect a more balanced supply demand in the truck market by mid-2020, which supports intermodal competitiveness during the second half of the year. ","We expect international intermodal to return to a nominal seasonal slow but faces tough year-over-year comparisons in the first quarter due to the accelerated shipments seeking to avoid tariff increases in early 2019. ","As we began 2020, I feel really good about where we are headed. Our service product has improved significantly and the table is set for us to grow and win business with our customers. I am excited to see the benefits of an improved supply chain continue for our customers. ","And with that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Jim for an update on our operating performance. ","Jim Vena","Thanks, Kenny. As you\u2019ve already heard this morning, we continue to deliver strong results which I think speaks volumes for what is possible. Our operating metrics continue to improve and as a result, we are seeing a better service product for our customers. ","The team once again responded to the challenge of rightsizing our cost structure in the face of declining volumes while also driving significant productivity and I couldn\u2019t be more proud. ","For example, crew starts were down 20% in the quarter and outpaced the 11% decline in carloads we experienced. This, along with our Unified Plan 2020 actions drove an operating ratio of 59.7%, which was outstanding.","While we will continue to drive productivity, it cannot come at the cost of safety. As always, safety remains our number one priority at Union Pacific. ","Turning to slide 11, I\u2019d now like to update you on our six key performance indicators. We continue to see significant year-over-year improvement in our metrics. This is a direct result of our relentless focus on improving network efficiency and service reliability as part of Unified Plan 2020.","Continued improvement in asset utilization and fewer car classifications led to a 5% improvement in freight car velocity and a 13% improvement in freight car terminal dwell compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Train speed for the fourth quarter increased 1% to 26.2 miles per hour, compared to 2018. ","Now turning to slide 12, continuing our trends from the third quarter, locomotive productivity improved to 14% versus last year as efforts to use the fleet more efficiently enabled us to park units. As of December 31st, we had around 3,100 locomotives stored, which excludes 300 units that were either sold or retired. Driven by a 17% decrease in our force levels, workforce productivity increased 4% year-over-year despite the volume decrease.","Car trip compliance improved 9 points year-over-year driven by increased freight car velocity and lower dwell demonstrating our team\u2019s commitment to delivering a consistent and reliable service product for our customers. We are pleased with our progress in 2019 and we expect to see continued improvement in our service product going forward. ","Slide 13 highlights some of the recent network changes we have made as part of the Unified Plan 2020. We recently stopped humping cars at Davidson Yard in Fort Worth. We also reduced switching at our Settegast Yard in the Houston area and shifted the work to nearby Englewood Yard. On the third quarter earnings call, we talked about a change in Kansas City to stop humping cars at the Neff Yard.","Building on that change we recently curtailed operations at Armourdale yard and moved the work to a single location at our 18th Street Yard for the entire Kansas City complex. ","In addition, we continue to adjust our local operations to align with customer demand while remaining focused on delivering the quality service product. Going forward, we will continue to look for ways to reduce car touches leading to additional terminal rationalization opportunities on our network. ","Increasing train size remains one of our main areas of focus to utilize our existing network capacity and we are making excellent progress by putting more products on fewer trains, we have increased train length across our system by 16% or over 1100 feet since the fourth quarter of 2018 to approximately 8200 feet in the fourth quarter of 2019. ","Looking forward, I expect to see continued improvement in train length through a combination of transportation plan changes and targeted capital investments that I will talk about more on the next slide. ","In 2019, we invested approximately $3.2 billion in railroad infrastructure pending final approval by our Board of Directors for 2020, we are targeting base capital spending of $2.95 billion with an additional $150 million for strategic siding extensions. ","About 80% of our planned 2020 capital investment is replacing spending to \u2013 is replacement spending to harden our infrastructure, replace older assets and to improve the safety and resiliency of the network. ","We will purchase no new locomotives in 2020, although we will continue to modernize our existing fleet. Targeted freight car acquisitions will support both replacements and growth opportunities. We will continue to invest in capacity projects on our network to improve productivity and operational efficiency including investments to support the consolidation of intermodal operations in Chicago. ","We also plan strategic siding extensions to increase train length capability in targeted locations. These sidings will support our efficiency initiatives by increasing the number of long trains we can operate in each direction thus reducing demand for crew starts. ","Positive train control spending will focus on interoperability testing in an enhancement to our energy management system to reduce fuel consumption. To wrap up, we have made a number of changes to our operation in the last year and the results have been tremendous. ","However, there are still a lot of opportunities ahead of us to further improve safety, asset utilization and network efficiency. As we move forward, look for us to continue pushing the envelope as we transform our operations. Running a safe, reliable and efficient railroad for all of our stakeholders is job one and our team is committed to making that happen. ","And with that, I will turn it over to Jennifer. ","Jennifer Hamann","Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Today we are reporting fourth quarter earnings per share of $2.02 and 1.9 points of year-over-year improvement in our operating ratio to 59.7%. This is an all-time best fourth quarter operating ratio for Union Pacific and our third consecutive quarter starting with a 59%. ","As shown on Slide 17, we received a partial insurance recovery of $40 million associated with the flooding experienced in the first half of 2019. $25 million of the $40 million reduced fourth quarter operating expense adding $0.03 of EPS to the quarter as well as helping the operating ratio by half a point. ","Lower year-over-year fuel prices favorably impacted the quarterly operating ratio by 0.2 points, although our fuel surcharge lag actually had a $0.01 negative EPS impact compared to 2018. ","The good news is that in the face of significant volume headwinds, we drove core margin improvement of 1.2 points in the quarter. These results are a proof statement that true our company initiatives to improve productivity, the UP team is having great success running a more efficient reliable network. ","Looking now at our fourth quarter income statement, operating revenue totaled $5.2 billion, down 9% versus last year on an 11% volume decrease. Operating expense decreased 12% to $3.1 billion as we demonstrated our ability to be more than volume variable with our cost structure. These results net to operating income of $2.1 billion, a 5% decrease versus 2018. ","Below the line, other income increased 22% driven by reduced environmental and benefit plan costs partially offset by lower real estate sale gains. Quarterly income tax expense increased 3% on a higher effective tax rate. ","For full year 2020, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be around 24%. Although net income of $1.4 billion was down 10% versus last year, our fourth quarter earnings per share only decreased 5% to $2.02 per share as our continued share repurchase activity offset roughly half of the income impact. ","Slide 19 provides a breakdown of our fourth quarter freight revenue which totaled $4.9 billion, a 10% decrease versus 2018 driven primarily by the 11% volume decline. Additionally, fuel surcharge revenue had a 1% negative impact to revenue, down $125 million to $363 million. ","Although not able to offset the impact of volumes in fuel, the combination of our ongoing pricing actions and business mix had a 2.5 point positive impact on our quarterly freight revenue. Consistent with our guidance, throughout 2019, total dollars generated from our pricing actions for the year well exceeded our rail inflation costs. ","As Kenny mentioned, we will begin reporting under our new business team structure at our first quarter call, in mid-February, we will provide a mapping of our carload volumes to the new business groups and make available pro forma volume and revenue for prior years. At the same time, we also will start providing weekly revenue ton miles across key market segments beyond the three new business teams. ","Slides 20 and 21 provides a summary of our fourth quarter operating expenses. Starting with compensation and benefits expense, this category decreased 18% to $1 billion driven by a 17% workforce reduction or about 7100 FTEs versus 2018. ","Our productivity initiatives, coupled with lower volumes resulted in a 20% decrease in our train and engine workforce, while management, engineering and mechanical workforces together decreased 16%. ","Fuel expense fell 20% to $512 million as a result of lower diesel fuel prices and fewer gallons consumed through more efficient operations and through a combination of reduced purchased transportation, lower mechanical repair costs and less contract services and materials, our purchased services and materials expense declined 9% to $531 million. ","Turning to Slide 21, depreciation expense of $559 million increased 1% compared to 2018. Equipment and other rents of $230 million decreased 14% driven primarily by lower equipment lease expense and less volume-related costs. ","Other expense increased 5%, to $231 million, as a result of increased casualty cost and higher state and local taxes partially offset by the insurance recovery I previously mentioned. ","For full year 2020, we expect year-over-year depreciation expense to increase about 2% and other expense to be up roughly 5%. ","Looking now at productivity, net productivity savings yielded from our G55 + 0 initiatives and Unified Plan 2020 totaled approximately $215 million in the fourth quarter. These results bring our full year 2019 net productivity to $590 million which significantly exceeded our guidance of at least $500 million and marks an all-time high annual productivity savings for Union Pacific. ","This really is a remarkable accomplishment for the UP team considering the backdrop we achieved this against unprecedented flooding and a weakening environment. ","Stepping back to look at full year 2019, we reported earnings per share of $8.38 a share, a 6% increase versus 2018 despite facing volume and revenue declines of 6% and 5% respectively. Importantly, as a result of the strong productivity gains I just discussed, we held operating income flat year-over-year at $8.6 billion. ","As you know, over the course of 2019, we had a number of different items that impacted our operating ratio and earnings, but when you set all that aside, the important measure for us is improvement in our core performance, which was nearly 2 points better versus last year as we met our guidance of a sub 61% operating ratio for 2019. ","And we can\u2019t talk about a full year operating ratio of 60.6% without acknowledging the hard work and dedication of our workforce. These results could not have been achieved without them. So hats off to the teams. ","Turning now to cash and returns, 2019 was another year of both strong cash generation and cash returns to our shareholders as free cash flow after capital investments totaled nearly $5.2 billion resulting in a cash flow conversion rate equal to 87% of our net income. ","Beyond continuing our strong program of capital investments, we rewarded shareholders with two 10% dividend increases in the first and third quarters bringing our dividend payout ratio to just over 44% as we distributed $2.6 billion. We also repurchased 35 million shares of our common stock at an all-in cost of $5.8 billion reducing our full year average share balance by 6% versus 2018. ","In combination, the dividends and share repurchases added up to a total of $8.4 billion of cash return to our shareholders. In addition to the cash generating power of our business, we funded part of this cash return to the strength of UP\u2019s balance sheet. We ended 2019 with an all-in adjusted debt balance of $27.4 billion, up $2.3 billion from year end 2018.","Our solid investment-grade credit rating and a very attractive rate market allowed us to issue $4 billion of new debt during 2019, partially offset by the repayment of debt maturities. With that, we finished the year at an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times as we are continuing to increase our leverage position to the previously guided target of 2.7 times, while maintaining minimum credit ratings of BBB Plus and BAA1. ","Finally, our return on invested capital came in at 15% basically flat with 2018 as we stay disciplined with our capital spend in a challenging volume environment. ","Let me close out today with our view of the year ahead. As we look to 2020, we expect to see volumes inflect the positive side of the ledger on a full year basis growing 1% or so overall. This view takes into account expected declines in coal and sand volumes, as well as the tough year-over-year intermodal comparisons that Kenny mentioned. ","Against this volume expectation, we will continue to pursue a pricing strategy where the dollars gain exceed our 2020 rail inflation cost. This expectation is fully supported by the great service products we are providing to our customers and is integral to achieving our 2020 and long-term return objectives. ","With regard to inflation, we expect overall inflation in 2020 to be around 2% with labor inflation closer to 2.5%. We also expect our workforce to be down around 8% or so on a full year basis. Coming off of a record productivity performance in 2019, we expect to yield at least another $500 million of productivity savings in 2020 as Jim and team continue to identify and pursue efficiency savings. ","Together, we believe these activities should result in another strong step down in our operating ratio and while we don\u2019t anticipate a fuel tailwind like we experienced in 2019, we are confident in our ability to achieve a sub-60 operating ratio. In fact, we believe, we should close out 2020 with a full year number that looks more like a 59. ","As it relates to our capital allocation, our high-level guidance for capital spending, capital structure and use of free cash flow remains unchanged. The first call on cash is our capital investment, which we still expect to be less than 15% of revenue over the long-term and $3.1 billion for 2020. ","After capital expenditures, we will continue returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends, maintaining our targeted payout ratio of 40% to 45% of earnings and we should complete our previously announced three year plan to repurchase approximately $20 billion of shares by the end of 2020. That plan is now 70% complete leaving about $6 billion to repurchase this year. ","In summary, we expect positive full year volume, solid core pricing and significant productivity gains will all contribute to another year of strong cash generation and margin improvements. We are taking another positive step forward with our operating ratio in 2020 on the path to our longer-term target of a 55% operating ratio. ","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Lance. ","Lance Fritz","Thank you, Jennifer. As discussed today, we leveraged strong productivity to deliver solid fourth quarter and full year financial results. Unified Plan 2020 continues to serve as a catalyst for improved productivity and a better service product. ","Looking ahead to 2020, we are committed to operating a safe railroad and providing highly consistent, reliable and efficient service for our customers while focusing on opportunities to grow the business and improve margins. ","Our strong operating performance in 2019 gives us confidence that as we attract business to our network, we\u2019ll leverage it very efficiently generating strong free cash flow and improve financial results. ","This is going to position us to continue investing in our network and returning excess cash to our shareholders. So with that, let\u2019s open up the line for your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. ","Scott Group ","Hey, thanks. Morning guys. ","Lance Fritz ","Good morning.","Kenny Rocker","Good morning.","Scott Group ","So, I wanted to start on the 8% headcount reduction for the year. Just so I understand, is that an average for the full year? Or is that a beginning to end of year number, just because, if it\u2019s an average, it doesn\u2019t seem to really imply any additional headcount reductions from here. So I just want to \u2013 is that the right way to think about where we are from a headcount standpoint?","Jennifer Hamann","Hi, Scott. This is Jennifer. Yes, that 8% is a full year average and it does imply some further reductions from here. I think if you just roll forward where we are at into 2020, it would be around 6% or so. So, we are looking for further gains and obviously, volumes will depend on that and we are going to continue to try to improve our efficiency overall, but that\u2019s our view today. ","Scott Group ","Okay. Okay. And then, on the volume outlook, so, slightly positive. Obviously, we are starting in a [depot] [ph] net gas is below 2, right. Maybe could you just share sort of what you are assuming for coal volumes this year? ","And what are maybe the biggest tailwinds that you see in terms of the things out there, Kenny? And then, just as we think about the OR guidance and the volume outlook, volume guidance together, what\u2019s the sensitivity to operating ratio if you think the volumes ultimately stay negative?","Lance Fritz ","Kenny, why don\u2019t you take the volume question and I\u2019ll circle back on the OR question?","Kenny Rocker","So, first of all, each of our customers have a unique decision tree that they are using when they are trying to figure out whether or not they are going to dispatch coal or they are going to go to natural gas. ","I can tell you that our commercial and operating team have been really dogged in sitting down with our customers and looking at ways to improve efficiencies in the supply chain whether that\u2019s train length, whether that\u2019s cycle times, whether it\u2019s things like forecasting by days, we are doing everything we can to make sure that that supply chain is competitive. ","When you step back and look broadly at the volume outlook, you look at the petrochem industry and the plastics that we will expect to continue to grow there some other things along with that that are not as large in volume like the feedstocks that will help us out. We also expect continued growth in terms of the petro side of things. ","So, the crude oil business and then also if the weather is favorable, the rock shipments in the south, there is still a lot of upside there and a lot of growth in the south. Now, those are just the markets and you also think about the second half of the year. There is still some positives that I am expecting will happen on the trade side and that will not just impact positively on the Ag side during the, call it the September time range, but also our international intermodal side. So those are things that from a market perspective we expect to happen. Having said all those things, our commercial team has a very aggressive mindset to say regardless of whatever the market happens we need to go out there and win because we have a better service product. So we are going out there. We are creating intermodal products. ","We\u2019ve got a \u2013 this is all public information. We have a product for our international intermodal business that\u2019s with Northern Iowa Railroad and Valor Victoria. On the Bulk side, we are going out and securing more business based on the new service product that we have for our grain products moving west. So, you heard about the markets and it\u2019s also good to hear about the mindset of our commercial teams. ","Lance Fritz ","And, Scott, regarding your question on the volume to top side and the impact on OR, the way we\u2019ve wired up the plan right now and what we\u2019ve shared with everybody this morning, we do expect to see some volume growth. ","Now, take that exactly as intended which is, it can be very small, but we do expect it to be a plus sign, not a minus sign. And as you point out, the first part of the year is challenged. It\u2019s still got headwinds against tough comps on international intermodal and of course a loose truck market and natural gas pricing against coal. ","But when you take it all into account, you take some of the impacts that we expect to see from the recent trade deals and tightening of the truck market we anticipate the second half looks better. All put together, that wires up for us to something like a 59 operating ratio and that\u2019s what we are pursuing right now. Of course, there is a lot of moving parts and it\u2019s early in the year. So, we\u2019ll just continue to manage as we see the markets evolve. ","Scott Group ","All right. Thanks for the time guys. ","Operator","The next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. ","Ravi Shanker ","Thanks. Good morning gentlemen. If I can just follow-up on the last question, just what level of truck market tightening are you really envisioning? Is it just a more of a return to a normal market? Or is it something like a 2018 like, almost ELD like scenario given the kind of [five] [ph] supply side catalysts we have in place?","Kenny Rocker","Yes, we are seeing some tightening occur now and what I call it is, we do feel like we are at the floor. Again, it\u2019s some of the things play out with trade we are expecting by mid-2020 to tighten more \u2013 for me to put a hand on whether or not it\u2019s going to get back to normal level, that\u2019s hard to say. ","But we do in talking to all of our customers and seeing some of the bankruptcies that have taken place in the market, we expect for it to certainly be a better truck environment for us to compete in. ","Finally, just as we think about the truck market, I just want to emphasize on our premium - our intermodal network, our service product has improved better. Customers are seeing less dwell for their commodities. We\u2019ve talked about the reduced complexities in Chicago. And so, all of those things really create a lower cost structure that gives us a lot of confidence that we can compete in the marketplace. ","Ravi Shanker ","Got it. And just a follow-up, now that you are kind of comfortably into the PSR process and you are like sub-60 or at this point [indiscernible] 2020. What\u2019s your line of sight to G55 and kind of when you guys get there and kind of what level of incremental heavy lifting do you need to get there? ","I mean, is that mostly a top-line driven walk from this point on or do you think there is still big cost components that will get you another 400, 500 basis points more?","Jennifer Hamann","So, Ravi, this is Jennifer. You\u2019ve heard us talk about the long-term target and I think you\u2019ve also heard us say, and remember that when we first put that out there, we were not in the phases of adopting Unified Plan 2020. And so, now that we are in that we are even more confident in our ability to get there. But we have also talked about it in terms of kind of the three levers in terms of volume, price and productivity and certainly what helps us to this point has been the price and productivity. ","We\u2019ve not had as much on the volume side. And so, with the great service product that the operating teams put together, we feel very confident about our ability to start bringing that volume on and we will leverage that very efficiently. But we still have obviously great productivity opportunities ahead as well. ","We said that we are looking to get about another $500 million here in 2020. That\u2019s off of $590 million in 2019. So, those are big numbers and we feel very good about that. So, we\u2019ll continue to press on all fronts as we move forward. ","Ravi Shanker ","Great. Thank you. ","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. ","Amit Mehrotra ","Thanks, operator. Hi, Jennifer. Just I wanted to follow-up very quickly if I could on the headcount question, because I actually didn\u2019t follow the math on that. If you just take the average levels in the fourth quarter and extrapolate that, it would translate \u2013 that itself would translate to 8% decline in average headcount. ","So, I could be calculating something wrong. But if you can just offer a little bit more clarification there just given how important that is to the overall productivity of the company?","Jennifer Hamann","So, thank you. Yes, I mean, the headcount reductions are very important for us overall. We\u2019ll continue to push that. The math is, assuming some volume improvement and that we want to leverage that very effectively. So, we are going to continue to push that forward and again, we are saying 8% plus minus is what we are looking for in a full year basis. ","Amit Mehrotra ","Okay. And just as a follow-up, again, I guess, this question is for Jennifer. And that\u2019s really \u2013 how do we interpret, just conceptually at least $500 million of net productivity? And the way I\u2019ve just always thought about it is that, it\u2019s kind of like the uplift in profits that you expect in a neutral revenue environment and I just want to ask, is that a fair way to think about it? ","And also, just the guidance that you are giving for 59 OR assume some drag from mix, because if you get the $500 million plus, and you overlay some revenue growth on it, I would have just assumed the OR improvement would have been better than a 59 OR. So if you can just help us think about conceptually the $500 million relative and kind of layering on the revenue growth on top of that?","Jennifer Hamann","Sure. So, when we think about productivity and talk to you about, that does exclude volume. So, when we talk about being able to turn around and move to the positive side of the ledger, from a volume standpoint, that\u2019s where you start talking about incremental margins which we think could look very favorable for us. ","We think we\u2019ve got a great plan put together for 2020 and feel very good about the guidance that we are giving, 59 OR. Making another very solid step forward in 2020 and we are looking to do that with not much volume and off of a 6% down year this year. ","So, I think it\u2019s a good move for us and next solid step down and we\u2019ll continue to press the envelope. But we want to do it safely, reliably, continue providing the really good service product and keep moving forward. But we are not trying to meter our progress either. We are going to try to go as fast as we can. ","Amit Mehrotra ","Jim, I know you love this question. What inning are you in the PSR process?","Jim Vena","Well, baseball finished. So, let\u2019s talk football, it\u2019s right in the middle of the real exciting part. ","Amit Mehrotra ","What yard line are you on? ","Jim Vena","Well, I started on the 20 yard line, or 25 yard line and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve hit the middle of the field yet. ","Amit Mehrotra ","Okay. That\u2019s enough for me. Thank you very much. ","Jim Vena","Thank you. You are welcome. ","Operator","The next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. ","Brian Ossenbeck ","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, Jim, maybe more specific one on efficiency for you. How do you think about fuel as you look at the network here? You get longer trains, a younger locomotive fleet, better horsepower management, but you haven\u2019t really seen the improvements from the field as some of the other peers have done, I think Canada or even CSX. ","So, what level of confidence you think you have in that improving and how big of a event mover do you count on that in the next couple of years?","Jim Vena","I think, fuel is an area where we can get better. We are investing this year with more locomotives that will make it even easier for us. That\u2019s be able to get some fuel conservation. So we did a lot of work in 2019 and we see the same sort of trend line going. Every railroad is different in their topography, but we feel that there is still money left on the table that we can save and be more fuel efficient. ","Bigger trains, more cars on less trains is probably the biggest way for us to get the more fuel conservation. And I\u2019d be guessing on the final number. We are shooting for an improvement from last year and we\u2019ll continue to have that. ","Brian Ossenbeck ","But the pace of improvement \u2013 excuse me - start accelerate here, so I think you are doing about 1% or 2% last couple of quarters, but train lengths are up as you mentioned about 16% year-over-year. So is this a lagging indicator or something that needs to have a few more things fall into place before you can get the material benefit on that?","Jim Vena","I wouldn\u2019t change the trend line that what we\u2019ve done in 2019 as an improvement in the trend line in that low 1%, 1.5% sort of gain that we should be able to be more efficient on fuel. So, at this point, that\u2019s what I see for numbers. ","Brian Ossenbeck ","All right. Thanks, Jim. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. ","Brian Ossenbeck ","And again one on exports. Kenny, can you just clarify what you mean on the trade deal in terms of what type of benefit you expect on the Ag side? And then how you think about the export corn, which is down about half when you look at the current marketing year here in the U.S.? Thanks. ","Kenny Rocker","Yes, so, there is \u2013 the larger piece of the pie is really on the soybean side and that\u2019s really more of a \u2013 probably more, I call it more about a fourth quarter type look for us. Brazil comes in during the first part of the year. ","But then there are some other parts of the grain that we could see a slow uptick and as you mentioned, corn would be one of them, milo could be one of them, wheat would be one of them. I think it\u2019s too soon to tell the timing of it. We\u2019ve been talking to our customers and a lot of traders are talking and I\u2019d expect more clarity as we move throughout the year over the next few months. But what you need to hear is that, get into space one trade deal we see it as a positive. ","Lance Fritz ","Yes, Brian, this is Lance. So, the Phase 1 trade deal essentially takes China as a headwind and sets it up to be a potential tailwind. Very high level, they are committing to over doubling their purchases of U.S. goods with a concentration in Ag in some other areas. ","That if it comes true, or if even a large portion or even a half of it comes true, it\u2019s a really nice tailwind for us going into the next couple of three years. So that there is \u2013 it just basically turns a headwind into a tailwind. ","Brian Ossenbeck ","All right. Thanks, Lance and Kenny. I appreciate. ","Kenny Rocker","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. ","Allison Landry ","Thanks, good morning. Could you just maybe speak to the rate of OR improvement throughout the year? And should we expect it to accelerate meaningfully once volumes do inflect positive since you are not currently getting all the full benefits of PSR? I guess, in other words, should second half margins be a lot better than the first half?","Jennifer Hamann","So, Allison, as you know, our margins tend to be follow some of the seasonality. We tend to have some of our weakest \u2013 or I guess, highest ORs in first quarter, improve through the year. Third quarter tends to be our best margins then they go down a bit. ","Some of that has to do with weather. Some of that has to do with the volumes that we are moving. So, we don\u2019t see anything at this point that would fundamentally change that pattern. We are not going to guide to quarterly numbers. But that\u2019s how you could think of it. ","Allison Landry ","Okay. All right. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just another question on the productivity. I guess, first, does that include the lapping of weather and inefficiency costs that you saw in the first part of 2019? And then, Jennifer, I think you said that it does not include incremental on volume. ","Is that right, because I think if I do the math and back out productivity, it seems to imply low teens incremental on sort of what I\u2019d call organic growth and normally you do much higher than that? So, if you could help us and walk through that. Thank you","Jennifer Hamann","So, to the last part of the question about productivity, I think we said that that excludes volumes and so if you put volume on top of that, that helps us drive much better incremental as we move through the year. So, I think that, what was the first part of your question again there?","Allison Landry ","Does the $500 million include lapping of the weather and inefficiency costs from the first half of 2019?","Jennifer Hamann","Yes, yes. ","Allison Landry ","Okay.","Lance Fritz ","It starts from scratch. ","Jennifer Hamann","Yes, it starts from scratch. Right, right.","Allison Landry ","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. ","Ken Hoexter","Hey, good morning. And Jim, nice job on the continued improvements or team, I guess. But, maybe just thinking, I am still a little confused by some of the answers upfront, if volumes are up and you are getting pricing \u2013 core pricing gains, it seems like you are targeting up flat employee absolute number, given the 8% decline, which would make \u2013 I guess, if you are looking for volumes to increase, maybe that\u2019s the flow through. ","And then, given the productivity savings, the math would seem to suggest the larger operating ratio improvement. Is there may be a larger mix negative impact that we are looking at than \u2013 and maybe kind of you can dig into the coal impact. I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s more export \u2013 loss of export tonnage or contract losses or anything on the domestic side?","Lance Fritz ","Hey Ken, this is Lance. And I\u2019ll start by just making sure we lay a crystal clear expectation of ourselves in 2020. And that is, we expect as part of the $500 million in productivity to have both carryover productivity, which is some of the headcount question that you are asking about, as well as incremental productivity. ","If our volume is flat this year, we are going to have incremental employee productivity. If our volume grows, we will not add back resources at the same pace that we will grow. Now we are expecting growth to be pretty minor, I think is probably the right word and it\u2019s largely second half. ","So, we are building kind of a cautious plan that gives us flexibility depending on what actually occurs as the year progresses. So I just want to be crystal clear about that. There is \u2013 we are sharing with you what we are comfortable sharing at this point. But the expectation is, continued productivity, some carryover, more realize through action and we\u2019ve got plenty of actions up against that. ","Jennifer Hamann","Right, and just building off that, I mean, our headcount of 8% plus, minus really is somewhat dependent on what happens with volumes, but again, we feel confident in our ability to drive the productivity and I think you\u2019ve seen us do that this year as the volumes have fallen off. We have been very aggressive in terms of the actions that we\u2019ve taken. ","And so, again, to Lance\u2019s point, we feel good about the plan. But there is, we are sitting here on January 23rd. There is a lot of the year left in front of us and we\u2019ll take the actions that we need to take. But we are bullish about the opportunities, particularly as we look to see some volume return to us in the back half of 2020.","Kenny Rocker","Hey, I think I\u2019ll add. I think you were asking about export coal. And we said this publicly before, it\u2019s a smaller percentage of our coal book is less than 10%, but yes, it has been impacting our export. Coal has been impacted. We will wait to see what happens with both the weather and natural gas. Natural gas plays a much larger role in how our customers are going to start on what they want to do with coal. ","Ken Hoexter ","Kenny, if I could just get my follow-up with you then, if the international intermodal was down 23% significantly more than the West Coast markets noted, is that share a shift loss of contracts? Is there anything you want to highlight, I guess, as we look to balance that out?","Kenny Rocker","We actually had tougher comps. I mean, if you think, if you go back to the 2018 fourth quarter, we had a really strong quarter. And so, now what you are seeing is just the comp and we should lap that here in the first quarter of this year. I mean, yes, the first quarter of this year. ","Ken Hoexter ","Great. Thanks guys. ","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. ","Tom Wadewitz ","Yes, good morning. Wanted to \u2013 I guess a question for Jim. When I think about the \u2013 you had a tremendous pace of cost takeout or network improvement, how would you think about the duration of the big cost saves in network improvement? Is this a three year program that you\u2019ll still have a lot left to do in 2021? ","Or is it\u2019s something where you really capture \u2013 you get from the 25 yard line to the \u2013 into the end zone in 2020. So just wanted if you could offer some thoughts on that and then also perhaps what the really big buckets are that are left for network productivity? ","Jim Vena","Hey, Tom. Thanks for the question. So, if we think about \u2013 I\u2019ve been doing this for way too long. So, you\u2019d never ever stop looking to productivity gains. You always look for what you can do to make the place better. So, the team delivered a great 2019. I would like to give everybody at Union Pacific a lot of credit with what we\u2019re able to deliver. ","But that\u2019s behind us. So, moving forward, we have projects that are short-term. So we have projects across the entire company that will help us to be able to deliver more productivity. Specifically, we have also some projects that will a while. We announced over a $100 million being spent on sidings. We don\u2019t expect to get them in the early part of the year. ","That will be later and into next year. So the productivity gains are of this year. We see we have to deliver on that $500 million that we\u2019ve guided to and that means across the board and we see some more coming in the following years. ","Never ever in my career have I've gone out somewhere and not found a way to make it a little bit better and improve. So I don\u2019t see that ending this year, but there is a big bucket this year and then it will get a little tougher as the time goes on. ","Tom Wadewitz ","Are there particular areas that stand out if it\u2019s train lengths with some of the further siding investments is the big lever or a lot less than \u2013 I guess, terminal productivity and some of the changes with the hump yards? Or what would stand out as being the greatest remaining opportunity? ","Jim Vena","Train length is real important. Absolutely, train length is one that we have to deliver on. We think that we can make the terminals even more efficient. So we turn the cars quicker that helps the whole fleet. We\u2019ve got plans to put the intermodal terminals together in Chicago from six down to three. That helps us in the efficiency. ","So, the way we handle our locomotives, I think we are not going to get rid of another 2,000 locomotives. We\u2019d only run an output just over 3,000 locomotives now, but we think there is gains there. There is gains on how we repair cars. ","There is repair on \u2013 there is money on gains on how we move our people around the network. The balancing of the network. There is a long list I could go through and spend an hour taking you through it. But I am very excited with what we have on the table for this year. ","Tom Wadewitz ","Okay, great. So, just one last short follow-up. I think a number of the questions on the call are focused on the elements of your guidance. At the end of the day, it does feel like the guidance is somewhat conservative in terms of what you can do on the cost side and putting together some of the pieces, do you think it\u2019s fair for us to take away from the framework that there is an element of conservatism in the guide?","Lance Fritz ","Well, I\u2019ll start and say, Tom, that it\u2019s very early, specifically our confidence in the guidance we gave at the first part of the years and we build our plan appropriately. And then what you\u2019ve seen from us over years is we react as the year is progressing, as things change and universally, we know how to get productivity and we are demonstrating we know how to generate an excellent service product. ","One of the things we\u2019ve got to demonstrate this year is growing with that service product. Part of Kenny and the commercial team, they are going to have to learn what the network is capable of and how to sell those products and get customers signed upfront. ","Jennifer Hamann","And I would just say, to add on to what Lance said, there is a 59 OR for us would be a new record level for us. It\u2019s an area that we\u2019ve not gotten to and so, we are going to continue to push the envelope and go as far as we can. But we felt good about the performance that we had this year. ","But you know, we got there a lot differently than the way we thought we could when you think about the fact that we came into the year thinking we were going to have a couple points of volume growth that ended up down 6%. ","We certainly didn\u2019t anticipate the weather events that we encountered. So, to Lance\u2019s point, we are going to be very diligent about working hard to pull all the levers that we can and be aggressive to make improvements. ","Tom Wadewitz ","Okay. Thanks for the time. ","Lance Fritz ","Yes. ","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. ","Jordan Alliger ","Yes, hi. Good morning. Just two questions. Just back on the Ag real quickly, can you talk a little bit about how much the export Ag business is to your total Ag franchise? And then, maybe just to give some sense, what was the adverse impact from exports in 2019?","Lance Fritz ","Yes, I tell you that, if you look at our grain business, it\u2019s a significant piece. I\u2019d tell you it\u2019s been where from a third to call it 40%. What was the second part of your question?","Jordan Alliger ","Really just, how much was that business let\u2019s say, down given the tariff issues in 2019?","Lance Fritz ","I\u2019d call it easily over half. I call it easily over half. ","Jim Vena","Yes, and those impacts, Jordan, that\u2019s on basically, China getting out of purchasing U.S. soybeans and going down to Brazil. DDGs which have been on again, off again were off for a fair period of time and it impacted even a little bit of corn, a little bit of wheat. So, the impact on export grain and grain products was pretty broad.","Jordan Alliger ","By half. ","Kenny Rocker","And the only thing I would add, Jordan, is that, really we would see it also open up the imports on the international intermodal side. I mean, that has a pretty sizable improvement of volume growth there too. So just keep that in mind too. ","Jordan Alliger ","So, by half, you sort of mean half of the total decline in agriculture or I am just \u2013 didn\u2019t know what half meant? ","Kenny Rocker","There is a lot of upside here for us going forward on the Ag side and we are going to do everything we do to take advantage of it. ","Jordan Alliger ","Okay. And then just one other question. Just on the \u2013 thinking about the volumes in 2020, how much of the \u2013 call it 1% volume outlook give or take is tied to intermodal recovery, whether it be domestic or international? Just trying to get a sense for how big a part of the volume story is related to your views on intermodal?","Lance Fritz ","Yes, Jordan, this is Lance. I don\u2019t think we put a fine point on exactly what volume is going to look like next year. But let\u2019s walk you through what needs to happen to have volume growth occur. In intermodal, we need international intermodal to get back to normal where U.S. consumers feel healthy and they are consuming and it\u2019s coming in off West Coast ports. ","That\u2019s important to us. Domestic intermodal, we need both consumers to feel good. We need truck market to tighten up a bit. So the competitive mode isn\u2019t quite as price aggressive and loose as they are right now. We need the trade deals to have a real impact on agricultural exports and imports. ","We need manufacturers in the industrial economy in the U.S. to gain a little bit more confidence and get their feet back under them in terms of capital investment and risk taking and then we continue \u2013 a continuation of what\u2019s going on in the petrochem industry from the standpoint of good feedstocks to make U.S. the cost \u2013 low-cost competitor for plastics manufacturing and finding markets for that plastic. So there is a lot of moving parts there. It\u2019s not one thing and of course, those moving parts will change over the course of the year. ","Jordan Alliger ","Great. Thank you very much. ","Lance Fritz ","Yes. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question. ","Chris Wetherbee ","Okay. Thanks. Good morning. There has been a lot of questions about sort of the guidance and I guess, maybe I just wanted to think about if this way when you think about 2020, and maybe your expectations, if you were to see sort of upside to that, where do you think the most likely sort of places that will come from? ","Or is it more volume stuff that maybe is a little bit less in your control or maybe is it a little bit more productivity or things that Jim was doing with the network just a little bit more in your control. Just want to get a sense, we do see upside that the guidance is sort of where you think it\u2019s more likely to be coming from? ","Lance Fritz ","Yes, Chris, great question and thank you. So, the way I think about it is, if I could just invent the year that I would love to have in 2020, it would have a stronger upside. It would be a great mix. If I could magically make it happen, I\u2019d like to see frac sand come back stronger. I\u2019d like to see natural gas to go to $3.50 or $4 and take some of the pressure off coal. And I\u2019d really like to \u2013 Kenny hears this every day. ","But I\u2019d really like to see and experience the commercial team just relentlessly selling the new service product and getting a lot of traction quickly on convincing our customers that it\u2019s got staying power and what it means to their supply chains and being built deeply into their supply chains. That would tee up a pretty sweet year. ","From the productivity side of the world, I have all the confidence in the world that our operating team, Jim, Tom, they are going after it as hard and strong as they can and it would be a blessing to have more top-line to work with.","Chris Wetherbee ","Okay. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate the color. And then if I could just ask a question, I guess on price and mix and appreciate that the core pricing numbers are not going to be reported anymore. But when you think about some of the moving parts, I guess, sequentially from 3Q to 4Q just to help us a little bit in terms of what the pricing environment would actually look like today? ","I appreciate your comments about what you think about the truckload market, Kenny\u2019s comments about how that might change as the year goes on. But, from 3Q to 4Q, can you give us a little bit of color directionally how things were kind of moving from a price mix perspective?","Kenny Rocker","Yes, I would tell you, it\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019ve got formidable competitors on the truck side. And as I mentioned before, we do see that \u2013 it looks \u2013 it feels like it\u2019s bottoming out. We are expecting that to improve. You got to remember, we are coming from a third quarter to fourth quarter where we had improved service products, better dwell, stronger trip plan compliance and so we really inserted that into part of our value proposition. ","So, regardless of the competitive forces out there, we want to make sure that we are pricing the product to the value that we are providing. ","Chris Wetherbee ","Okay. And anything on mix as \u2013 mix from one quarter to the next?","Lance Fritz ","Jennifer?","Jennifer Hamann","I think it was slightly positive year-over-year when you think about, in particular although we had - coal was certainly down, but the intermodal piece was down significantly as well. So, a little bit positive. ","Chris Wetherbee ","Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciated. ","Lance Fritz ","You are welcome, Chris. ","Operator","The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. ","Walter Spracklin ","Yes, thanks very much. So, going back to volume, I know, Kenny, there has been a quite a few swing factors \u2013 significant swing factors in your individual items. I mean, coal was down, but intermodal minus 23% and when you give your guidance, we see a bunch of question marks in areas where there has been quite a bit of volatility. ","Obviously, you haven\u2019t put question marks in your model when you came out your plus 1% volume. So I am just trying to get a little bit of sense just directionally on what you are assuming in \u2013 say, your coal Ag and intermodal, given how big those are an impact in the overall volume? On the Eastern Rails for example, I mean, they are guiding minus 15% revenue here in coal. ","Obviously, you will be a little less than that. But is a high single-digit decline in your coal business a reasonable bogie for 2020? Intermodal, like you said, I mean, it was down 23% and it\u2019s going to have a tough comp in the first quarter, but again, are you projecting mid to high-single-digit recovery. ","Just to some way to quantify so we can gauge when we go back to investors and say, look, Union Pacific has plus 1% volume growth and it\u2019s predicated on a few things like this which gives us confidence or lack of confidence right at this point. But the question mark next to those line items that gives us a little bit of uncertainty as to what your plus 1% is implying? ","Jennifer Hamann","Walter, this is Jennifer. I am going to just going to reiterate our volume guidance and then let Kenny talk about the markets a little bit. So we said that we expect on a full year basis to get to the positive side of the ledger. We didn\u2019t say plus 1%. We said it just get to the positive side, but we are going to have \u2013 that does mean we are going to have to offset the declines in coal, frac sand and then a tough start to the year with the year-over-year comparisons relative to intermodal. ","So, we haven\u2019t sized any of those things in terms of what the level of declines are and we are not going to. But that\u2019s all kind of in that mosaic that we\u2019ve put together is to give you that guidance that we are looking to inflect positive on a full year basis. So, Kenny?","Kenny Rocker","Yes, we certainly feel the challenges with the low natural gas. But they \u2013 again we\u2019re three weeks into the month, three weeks into the year. I think it\u2019s premature to really look out ahead on what\u2019s going to happen there. Setting aside the Ag and the intermodal business, again, in terms of a timing perspective, the expectation is that the truck capacity should tighten up by mid-2020 and the expectation is that, from a trade perspective, things should get better for us in the second half of the year. ","Walter Spracklin ","Okay. Understood. And coming back on the OR and I understand the 55 long-term target, but investors are pushing back a lot now on long-term targets as something to not put a lot of stock in, but clearly, Jim, you\u2019ve done a tremendous amount of work here. ","The data look very, very positive and amid a volume environment that to say challenging, is an understatement. And so, if we were to see a normalization, is it fair to say that within the next two years, we could see, again a normalization in 2020, could we see within a two year timeframe you are hitting those \u201clong-term over targets\u201d","Jim Vena","Yes, Walter. The question of when 55 happens has a fair amount of moving parts, which is why at this point we haven\u2019t put a stake in the ground and say we think it\u2019s at this date certain. We continue to work to try to understand that ourselves and build a model and scenarios that we believe in that get the path there. ","But stepping back and just thinking broadly about it, things that help would be favorable mix, more volume growth. I have a lot of confidence, all the confidence in the world in our ability to generate productivity and a great service product regardless of what the environment looks like. And then, making sure we have a pricing environment right. ","We constantly talk about those three levers to pull and there is a lot of moving parts on those three levers being volume, price, and productivity. Certainly, productivity is going to get tougher and tougher as we get closer and closer to that 55. We are making a hell of a step. We made a hell of a step in 2019 and we are signing up for another good strong step in 2020 and I think over time, it will become a little more clear to us. ","Walter Spracklin ","And do you think, Lance, if you are half way through the year, you get to more visibility to put a stake in that timeframe half way through the year when you get a little bit more datapoints to work with?","Lance Fritz ","Walter, we are closer to that time than we were this time last year and you and the rest of our investors and analysts will be the first to know when we are ready to put a stake in the ground. ","Walter Spracklin ","I appreciate it. Okay. Thank you very much. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. ","Jason Seidl ","Thank you, operator. Morning everybody. Jim, just wanted to check in on sort of how you are viewing operational performance versus the volumes that are coming through on the network especially as we look into the back half of the year when some of your businesses might inflect, specifically domestic intermodal given your views in the truck market, sort of your year-over-year comps. Should we look at the network being slightly more challenged in 2H 2020? ","Jim Vena","Though I don\u2019t see any challenge, that\u2019s the best thing that could happen is, we\u2019ve given Kenny and the whole marketing team a service product that allows them to sell, to be able to go out there and whatever the market can give, so we should be able to win and we want to win with our customers. So, as they come on, and we see a volume increase, that\u2019s the best thing that could happen. ","In fact, an increase in business allows us to use the same trains with more railcars on it. It allows us to move things. There is some of course always if it\u2019s a unitrain business that comes on, you have to put new trains on, but we do everything we can to run them on manifest in intermodal trains. ","So, I\u2019d be very excited if the market gave us strong growth, we\u2019d put it on the same trains and you\u2019d see a incremental savings in our cost structure for the amount of revenue we bring in. So, that\u2019d be the perfect scenario for us. ","Jason Seidl ","I\u2019ll knock on wood for that then. My follow-up question is going to be for Kenny. Kenny, how do you view the shift we\u2019ve seen in some global supply chains with the trade war? We\u2019ve seen a lot come back to North America in general, Mexico and always seen some go to Southeast Asia. How should we think about that impacting volumes from here on out? ","Kenny Rocker","Well, ideally, that would be short lived some of the products that originate in the Southeast Asia. As you know, a lot of that is going to the East Coast. So with a stronger trade agreement, we\u2019d expect more to come back to the West Coast. ","I can tell you that we\u2019ve had really good engagement across the supply chain starting with the international intermodal folks to make the West Coast ports in the U.S. more competitive and we will continue to do that. ","Jason Seidl ","Okay. I appreciate the color and the time as always everyone. ","Lance Fritz ","Thank you. ","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. ","David Vernon ","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the time. I do have a long-term question on cost and then I wanted to have a follow-up as well. If you think about the business being down about some 20% in revenue ton miles last five years or so. ","When you guys think about nominal cost inflation in this 2% to 2.5% range, is it right to think that the effective cost on the unit level for the business is a little bit higher as the base of business shrinks with the decline of coal? Or is that not the right way to think about the fixed cost leverage in the business? ","Jennifer Hamann","So, David, you are talking about on a revenue ton mile basis, how should we think about our cost structure. I mean, one of our challenges that we put to the team every year is that, we want to offset inflation. But when you have some of your higher RTM, I think this is where you are getting to your heavier tonnage volumes falling away from you. ","That does make it harder for the team to be able to keep up with that. But I think that\u2019s the great power of the UP franchise is the productivity that we\u2019ve been able to drive and the work that\u2019s underway, quite frankly to get better at that, and to be even much more diligent with that and actually weight can be a help to us as we try to build those longer trains, that\u2019s going to improve our fuel efficiency. ","David Vernon ","Well, I guess, it was kind of more from an effective cost inflation perspective, right did the remaining traffic on the network have a little bit more burden to pay for every year or is that not the right way to think about it?","Lance Fritz ","Well, clearly, we are a significant fixed cost business and what we\u2019ve demonstrated in long-term variable cost, there are different pieces that have different lives in terms of being able to adjust up or down. So, in an environment that you just mapped out, which is the one we\u2019ve lived the last five years, if volume is going down and it\u2019s going down in dramatic fashion, it is hard to keep up. ","I think, one of the reasons that we are placing our employee base and the teams so much on this call is that, they\u2019ve done a hell of a job in a pretty difficult volume environment seeking out productivity even in the fourth quarter being a great example. You got volumes down double-digit percent and yet, we generated what, a couple hundred million dollars in productivity in the quarter. ","David Vernon ","Okay. And then, maybe just as a follow-up, Jennifer, if you look at your core or your mix price on the revenue side and they are being up 2.5. It looks like there is a pretty big mix tailwind, because your declines were in your lower RPU traffic. Is that implying like a smaller conservation from core price in the fourth quarter? Or is that not the right way to read that slide? ","Jennifer Hamann","No, I think we got a similar question earlier and you know, mix was slightly positive in the quarter. But not a significant driver of that number. ","David Vernon ","All right. Thanks, guys. ","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. ","Justin Long ","Thanks and good morning. So, on CapEx, you gave the guidance for this year, but I wanted to get your updated thoughts on CapEx longer term. If we are in this period where we start transitioning to a volume growth environment over the next several years, is there now enough capacity in the system to where you can hold CapEx relatively steady on an absolute basis, as we look at kind of 2021? And maybe just over the next several years?","Jennifer Hamann","Yes, so, I\u2019ll start off and then Jim might want to chime in as well, but the great power that we are seeing through our Unified Plan 2020 implementation is through the idling of hump yards, closing terminals and other facilities. We are creating latent capacity in our network that we would hope to be able to deploy again as the volumes come back. ","So, to your point, we do see, kind of a structural downshift that we are able to enjoy for some period relative to our capital expenditures and when you think about the number of locomotives that we have idled, the freight cars we have parked, that\u2019s capacity that we are anxious to deploy again and to be able to use in the marketplace. So I think you are thinking about it right. So, Jim, you might want to have some additional comments?","Jim Vena","Well, Jennifer, I think you hit the high spots. What we are doing is this, is we are able to run the capacity. If you look at the capacity in the railroad, we are going to spend some money targeted to make sure that we can operate the trains more efficiently in places where we think we can lengthen the size of the train. But on the most of the networks, this network is built, so that we can handle more traffic. I do not see big investments in locomotives, of course. ","We\u2019ve got lots of them parked. I don\u2019t see big investment in railcars. We are turning them faster, but is there going to be some targeted investments that we need for growth and for customer and just cars that are getting old? ","Absolutely, keep the place current, sustainable over the long-term. So, I don\u2019t see anything on the railroad where we need to worry about spending capital to make it more efficient or worried about some business coming on. ","That\u2019s the best thing that could happen and we will continue to spend capital with the projects that we\u2019ve announced. So, going down and building change in the intermodal franchise in Houston, in Chicago, and stay tuned, we\u2019ll announce some more. We are going to spend capital on those to make ourselves more efficient and have a better service product. So, it\u2019s a great place to be. We got lots of capacity. Let\u2019s bring the business on. ","Justin Long ","Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And as a follow-up, I may have missed your answer to this on the coal outlook for 2020. I know you expect it to be down, but is there just kind of a rough sense you can give us on the order of magnitude? And I think last year, around the beginning of the year, you lost a coal contract. Is there any way to frame up how much of a headwind that was in 2019? And exactly when you start to lap that?","Lance Fritz ","Kenny?","Kenny Rocker","Yes, again. As I mentioned \u2013 I believe this is a little bit too early to go in and say what\u2019s going to happen out there, three weeks in, yes, we did lap the contract or we will lap that contract here this year on the coal side. ","Lance Fritz ","Yes, and so being clear, that contract loss was lapped at the end of last year. ","Kenny Rocker","Correct. ","Lance Fritz ","So this, we are now fresh ground. ","Kenny Rocker","Right. ","Justin Long ","And is there any way to size that up in terms of car loads and what that headwind look like in 2019?","Lance Fritz ","No, we are not going to size that up, but what we\u2019ve expect out of coal this year is it\u2019s starting up pretty challenging, if natural gas stays at the $2, $2.25 level, it\u2019s going to be a tough year. ","Justin Long ","Okay, makes sense. I\u2019ll leave it at that. Thanks for the time. ","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. ","Brandon Oglenski ","Hey, good morning everyone. I apologize, I missed the first part of this call. But I guess, I wanted to follow-up on that last line of questioning, Jim, specifically you know with your prior employer, we saw a lot of growth in the past decade on the network whereas Union Pacific and I know there was some specific headwinds in the coal book and what have you? ","But I guess, really it\u2019s questions for Lance or Jim. What is specifically changing on the marketing or the sales front that you think you could reengage your customer base to actually drive some tonnage and revenue growth through the network?","Jim Vena","Yes, I\u2019ll start and let\u2019s break growth into two pieces. One is, what are the markets like? What\u2019s the ground and the environment in which you are competing and for us as we look into this year, we think, broadly speaking, the markets start getting a little better, right. Significant tailwinds like in trade, like a soft truck market, like the pull ahead to try to avoid tariffs in international intermodal, those things start abating and lapping and so that should create a better environment for us to compete in. ","Second part of that question is, controlling our own destiny. And from that perspective, our commercial team historically has had an excellent relationship with their customer base. It\u2019s indicative of how we have implemented Unified Plan 2020, right? At the very beginning, we said our goal isn\u2019t to break a lot of glass and alienate our customer base, so that we have to come back around and go on a charm offensive. ","Our intent was, we are going to take our customers along for the ride and keep them well informed and help them see how the changes that we are asking them to go through, as well as we are taking ourselves through to create a much better and much more reliable service product. That has occurred. ","That\u2019s in the process of occurring and now our commercial team is taking that and turning it into new business like the business Kenny mentioned up in Northeast Iowa, where we\u2019ve got a intermodal service product at the West Coast that two years ago would have never happened and now it\u2019s generating very attractive volumes. The same is true in the agricultural market, the same is going to be true across our bulk. ","Kenny Rocker","The only thing I\u2019ll add, I could rather offer few things and I want to just walk you through it. Again, the service product has improved. That\u2019s on tighter standards, so we\u2019ve got a tougher grade now for the customers that containers are being used more efficiently, because the container dwell has gone down. We\u2019ve also inserted technology into our network with our intermodal terminal reservation system, so they get clearer visibility of when they are going to get the container. ","When they can expect it? We\u2019ve reduced complexity out there in the networks. Jim talked about Chicago and alluded to Houston out there. We\u2019ve talked about Santa Teresa in the past and the fact that, on an intermodal network, we expect to do a lot of block swaps there. So, really critically being transformative here on the product. ","Brandon Oglenski ","Thank you. ","Jim Vena","Okay, Brandon. ","Operator","The next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. ","Allison Poliniak ","Hi guys. Good morning. Could we just go to the capital \u2013 CapEx conversation you guys were having before? Just in terms of, you think about it, it sounds like there is some more of a targeted CapEx approach with the projects that you are implementing. ","Your line of sight for the next few years with the projects, is this a sustainable level of base capital? I mean, should we expect a downward trend to that number over time? Just any thoughts there?","Lance Fritz ","Just let me step into that Allison. So, we\u2019ve always been targeted on our capital and by that, I mean, the very first thing we layer in is, what\u2019s it take to keep the doors open that\u2019s replacement capital and for us this year, on the track side it\u2019s $1.85-ish billion and there is a little bit more when you look over into the equipment side. ","And then, from that point, we\u2019ve got to take your mandates like PTC and then we look for opportunity to invest where either there is targeted capital for growth or targeted capital for a service product enhancement which ultimately is growth or productivity. And so, everything that\u2019s in the capital plan is built like that. ","It gets our first call on our cash and we are very comfortable that the level we are spending right now is an appropriate level. Sub-15% of our revenue and I don\u2019t really see that changing as we look forward.","Allison Poliniak ","Great. And then, just going back to the operating, you highlighted number of operating levers that you can still pull here. Not that any of them are easy, but which ones do you start to see becoming more challenging in 2020 just based on the improvements you\u2019ve made thus far?","Lance Fritz ","Well, you know what, it\u2019s always difficult to make big change, but I don\u2019t see any of them, we\u2019ve got a line of sight what we need to do. I think we are going to deliver on those \u2013 all those items that I listed of earlier on in the call and I don\u2019t see anything impacting us where we are not going to be able to deliver. ","It\u2019s we see line of sight, we know what we have to do. We got the right people that can make sure we deliver it. And I am looking forward to just \u2013 and we are doing it in a nice smart measured way so that we don\u2019t impact our service. So, I don\u2019t see anything really holding us up. ","Allison Poliniak ","Great. Thank you. ","Lance Fritz ","You are welcome. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jairam Nathan with Daiwa. Please proceed with your question. ","Jairam Nathan ","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. It\u2019s Jairam. So, I just noticed that there was a lot of talk about safety in your comments and if I look at other expenses, they were up about 5% and you talked about increased casualty cost and you are expecting another 5% increase this year. Are you kind of expecting a similar casualty number or should we see some benefits from the focus on safety?","Jennifer Hamann","This is Jennifer. No, we are absolutely focused on safety as you said and we are not expecting a similar level of casualty costs. We absolutely believe we will be much better in 2020. What that 5% up guidance includes is higher state and local taxes primarily, which is we \u2013 as we become more profitable, those taxes go up. ","Lance Fritz ","Just I want to add on safety, because I think it\u2019s really important that we talked about it for a minute and I appreciate the question. So, key foundation for a railroad and the industry and what we do every day is safety. We are not happy with the \u2013 where we are overall. Our goal is this to be the most \u2013 the best most efficient railroad in North America and that includes in safety. ","So, we\u2019ve got lots of positives that we see on one side of it, but on the other side, about how we handle and measure safety, we need to get better and we are working hard. We\u2019ve seen the trend line gets better at the end of the year and I will expect us to continue that this year. Our goal is us to be the best railroad in North America and that includes the best in safety. So, that\u2019s what we are working towards. ","Jairam Nathan ","Again, just as a follow-up, with the USMCA passing, do you see any \u2013 has that \u2013 do you see any changes near-term and how does that impact 2020 volume?","Lance Fritz ","Yes, so with the pass of SMCA it does take a little bit of a headwind and turn it into a tailwind. It was mostly about uncertainty and risk taking and where investment was occurring. So, I would anticipate that will have a kind of a long-term slow positive impact on our overall volumes. ","Jairam Nathan ","Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s all I have. ","Operator","The next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. ","Cherilyn Radbourne ","Thanks very much. Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones for me. On the locomotives that you've got in storage, historically, Union Pacific has maintained a surge fleet. So, just curious for your thoughts on what size you might need in terms of a surge fleet and whether you would plan to start returning or selling the balance of those locomotives?","Lance Fritz ","Well, two things and Jennifer could jump in any time. I think, if we could find a buyer for some of the locomotives that we\u2019ve got excess, we were able to dispose of some, we would do that. And as far as a surge fleet, Cherilyn, it all comes down to \u2013 we\u2019ve got a number of locomotives in normal status that we could just go turn the switch, fuel them up and start running them. ","So, if we needed to put them back in service, it would be pretty easy task and we are talking in the hundreds of that number. So, that\u2019s the surge. It\u2019s sitting there ready to go. ","Jennifer Hamann","Yes, and just to highlight Cherilyn, so we did in the quarter, reduced our total locomotive fleet by about 300. We sold a couple hundred. We did find a buyer and we scrapped another 100 or so. So, we are continuing to evaluate those things at all points and looking at what\u2019s the best financial decision for us to make as a company. ","But we would look forward to bringing those locomotives that are in storage and putting them back into service because we do think that\u2019s the most cost-efficient way to handle future volume growth as to leverage that existing fleet. ","Cherilyn Radbourne ","Okay. And then, on the improvement in train size that you referenced, should we assume that that most of that still resides along the Sunset corridor and that the siding extensions that are penciled into the CapEx budget are directed to that region?","Lance Fritz ","I think, we are going to seize the extension of the Sunset with the CapEx that we are putting in on the sidings that will help, but we also see \u2013 to be able to deliver bigger trains with the volume decrease, the team did a great job. ","So, if we see a volume will help us, if we have a slight uptick in volumes, but on top of that, I see benefit across the whole network. We are just starting down on the train length in every one of the corridors. So there is a little bit in all of them. A major piece will be the \u2013 through the capital investment, Cherilyn. ","Cherilyn Radbourne ","Great. That\u2019s all for me. ","Lance Fritz ","Thank you very much. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. ","Bascome Majors ","Thanks for taking my question here. On the growth question, you guys have talked about an improved service product in probably a dozen of your answers to the Q&A today. That seems to be resonating with your message and it certainly is showing up in the trip playing compliance going from, call it, low 60s to mid-70s, the span of a couple of quarters here. ","Are your customers starting to feel that, and when does the network get to sort of a stable steady fluid state where you really unleash the sales team and are confident that you can deliver industry plus growth on a go-forward basis? Thanks. ","Kenny Rocker","Yes, just \u2013 Bascome, thank you \u2013 just to give a history lesson here, last year, during the first half, we had, what I\u2019d call both weather and a lot of changes to the network and we were talking proactively with our customers about what would happen by mid third quarter, call it, the second half of the year, our service products at the operating team gave us, I mean, it really picked up and customers really got confidence there. ","We have a number of internal measurements and surveys that we do, that we look at really every day and we are seeing that our customers are communicating through and then talking with them that they see it. Our sales teams, they are sitting down with them, laying out the benefits, selling the service, quantifying the value proposition is there. So it\u2019s really setting up a good 2020 for us. ","Bascome Majors ","Thank you. And lastly, Unified 2020 Plan, I think you launched that in late 2018. Jim has been in the seat a year. Jim just took over in the CFO role and you are going to exhaust your buyback this year. Should we expect a detailed deep dive Investor Day sometime in the second half? Just anything you can do to help us on the timeline and will you be ready to give us a bigger update? Thank you. ","Jim Vena","Yes, that\u2019s a great question, Bascome. We are talking about when is the next good opportunity for us to \u2013 in a concentrated way, tell the story of what to expect. And so, stay tuned. We will \u2013 when that story is fully baked and needs to be shared, we will share it and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if it\u2019s later this year. ","Bascome Majors ","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Fritz for closing comments.","Lance Fritz","All right. Thank you, Rob, and thank you all for your questions and for being with us on our call this morning. We look forward to talking with you again in April as we discuss our first quarter 2020 results.

At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the following presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may now begin.","Lance Fritz","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Jim Vena, our new Chief Operating Officer; Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, Tom Lischer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, Union Pacific is reporting record 2018 fourth quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.12 per share. This represents an increase of 29% in net income and 39% in earnings per share when compared to adjusted results for 2017.","Total volume increased 3% in the quarter compared to last year. Industrial and premium carloadings grew 6% and 9%, respectively, while Agricultural products declined 2% and Energy volumes were down 9%.","The quarterly operating ratio came in at 61.6%, which improved 1.1 percentage points compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Strong topline growth and improved operating performance drove the year-over-year improvement during the quarter.","We launched the Unified Plan 2020 on October 1 of last year to help drive improved safety, service and operations. And I'm pleased to report that we're ahead of our initial schedule and seeing meaningful gains in on-time performance, productivity and financial results. The network design changes we implemented over the past few months have already had a measurable impact.","We've eliminated the excess network cost that we previously discussed. Cost savings are being realized by parking excess freight cars and locomotives, by cycling cars faster in our network and by reducing the size of our workforce.","We're seeing steady improvement in the key performance indicators we use to gauge progress. As a result, we announced late last year that we're accelerating implementation of Unified Plan 2020, which we now expect to be complete by the middle of the year.","Shortly, you'll hear from the team on our fourth quarter results and the status of the Unified Plan 2020 initiative. But first, I'd like to introduce Jim Vena, an old friend, who we just appointed Chief Operating Officer effective last week. Jim's leadership abilities and accomplishments over a 40-year career at Canadian National Railway are well known in the rail industry. Jim will have full authority over all aspects of Union Pacific's operations to implement Precision Scheduled Railroading principles as he leads the next stages of our Unified Plan 2020. We're fortunate to have him as the newest member of our leadership team.","I'll now turn it over to Jim for a few remarks.","Vincenzo Vena","Thank you, Lance, and good morning. First, I'd like to say how pleased I am to return again to the railroad industry. Union Pacific is a great company with a storied history and an impressive track record of financial success. I'm proud to be part of it.","While I arrived only last week, it is apparent to me that Union Pacific is committed to changing its operating model in pursuit of running a safe, more reliable and highly efficient network.","I've also observed that there are a lot of talented people here working hard to move the company ahead. There has been good progress made in recent months, improving the number of key service metrics, but we have a long way to go.","I plan to spend time right away out on the railroad interacting with employees. In fact, I've already visited the field, and I can tell you, there's a lot of opportunity out there. I'm assessing the status of Unified Plan 2020, both in terms of progress made to date and initiatives that are currently underway.","I believe that Union Pacific can become the industry leader in safety, operating efficiency, customer service and financial performance. I know the railroad has a vision in place to get to a 55 operating ratio already, and we will be working aggressively towards that goal. But first things first, Lance, let's break 60. I'm excited about the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.","And with that, Kenny, I'll turn it over to you.","Kenyatta Rocker","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For the fourth quarter, our volume was up 3%, driven by solid growth in our Premium and Industrial business groups, with a partial offset in Energy and Ag.","We generated positive net core pricing of 2.5% in the quarter. The increase in volume and a 2% improvement in the average revenue per car drove a 6% increase in revenue.","Let's take a closer look at the performance of each business team. Ag Products revenue was up 5% on a 2% decrease in volume and a 7% increase in average revenue per car. Grain carloads were down 10%, driven by reduced soybean shipment to China. This was partially offset by growth in other feed grain shipment, predominantly to the Mid-South and Mexico.","Grain products carloads were up 2% as the same demand for biofuels drove increases in biodiesel, renewable diesel fuel and soybean oil markets. This was partially offset by tariff related challenges in mills and slowing ethanol growth year-over-year. Fertilizer and soil for carloads increased 18% due to a prolonged fall application, coupled with continued strength in export potash.","Energy revenue decreased 8% for the quarter on a 9% decrease in volume, while the average revenue per car remained flat. Coal and coke volume was down 6%, primarily driven by a contract changes and retirement.","While natural gas prices were higher, it was not enough to offset the volume decline. Sand carloads were down 47%, largely due to the impact of regional sand within the Permian Basin.","Furthermore, favorable crude oil price spreads drove an increase in crude oil shipments, which were the primary driver for the 25% increase in petroleum, LPG and renewable carloads for the quarter.","Industrial revenue was up 10% on a 6% increase in volume and a 3% increase in average revenue per car during the quarter. Construction carloads increased 10%, primarily driven by increased market demand for rock shipment.","Metals and ores volumes increased 19% due to strength in energy, construction and manufacturing markets. Plastics carloads increased 10%, driven by higher production, coupled with new plant start-ups.","Premium revenue was up 15%, with a 9% increase in volume and a 6% increase in average revenue per car. Domestic intermodal volume increased 3%, driven by back-to-back strong peak seasons, continued demand for tight truck capacity and strength in parcel and LTL shipments. Auto parts volume growth was driven by over-the-road conversions and production growth at key locations.","International intermodal volume was up 21% as the new ocean carrier business continued in the fourth quarter, coupled with a strong pull ahead of shipments due to the 2019 tariff implementation.","Finished vehicle shipments were flat. Fourth quarter U.S. auto sales were down approximately 1% from the fourth quarter of 2017. However, shift in consumer preference from sedans to light trucks and SUV, coupled with stronger shipment levels out of Mexico and growth with winning new customers, enable UP to overcome declines in the overall market.","For 2019, our Ag Product groups expect uncertainty to continue in the grain market due to foreign tariffs. We anticipate continued strength in biodiesel and renewable diesel fuel shipments due to an increase in market demand for renewable fuels that will offset headwinds within the ethanol marketplace.","We also expect the tuck - tight truck capacity, combined with the value of rail, to support long-term penetration growth across multiple segments in our food and refrigerated business.","For Energy, we expect favorable crude oil price spreads to drive positive results for petroleum products. Local sand supply and softer market conditions will continue to negatively impact sand volumes. We also expect coal to experience continued headwinds throughout 2019, and as always with coal, weather conditions will be a key factor for demand.","For Industrial, we anticipate an increase in plastic shipments, driven largely by additional plant expansions coming online in 2019. In addition, we anticipate continued strength in Industrial production, which drives growth in several commodities.","For Premium, over-the-road conversion from continued tight truck capacity, as mentioned with Ag, will present new opportunities for domestic and auto parts growth.","The U.S. light vehicle sales forecast for 2019 is 16.8 million units, down about 2% from 2018. We will continue to watch the OEMs as they implement their rationalization plans.","Consumer preferences driving production shifts and new business wins will create some opportunity to offset the weaker market demand. Furthermore, uncertainty in the international trade and the potential for slower growth in the U.S. economy could also present headwinds as 2019 progresses.","Before I turn it over to Tom for his operations update, I'd like to share that we continue to work closely with the operating department as we implement service changes with the Unified Plan 2020.","Moreover, our commercial team is diligently engaged with customers to educate them on ways to better manage their railcar inventories and help them grow their business.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas Lischer","Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. I'd like to get started with a quick update on our safety performance for 2018.","Our reportable injury rate was 0.82, an increase of 4% as compared to last year. Reportable rate for our rail equipment incidents or derailments was 3.28, an increase of 12%.","In Public Safety, our grade crossing incident rate was 2.69, an increase of 5%. Safety remains our number one priority, and the entire Union Pacific team is committed and aligned to improving these metrics in 2019.","Now I'd like to share an update on our Unified Plan 2020 progress so far. Implementation of Unified Plan 2020 began in October. On our Mid-American Corridor, we initiated and cutover approximately 160 changes to our transportation plan, and the results, thus far, are very encouraging.","In this corridor, car inventory was down almost 16,000 cars. Car dwell was down almost 4 hours, driving reduction on our total daily crew starts. Other operating measures, such as car trip plan compliance, train departure and arrival performance and car connection performance have also improved.","Furthermore, we are well underway of implementing our Phase 2, our Sunset Route, which is L.A. and Chicago and L.A. to our southeast corridors. This phase includes over 200 network T-Plan changes, and over half of these are already cutover.","Next week, we will begin on our third and final phase, addressing the PNW in our Northern California corridors. Our goal is to complete the initial implementation of all 3 phases by the middle of this year, which is 6 months faster than we originally planned. Work continues on our efforts to rationalize switching yards, and we will share the results of these initiatives later this year.","As Unified Plan 2020 continues to evolve, we expect to see further gains in labor productivity, which will be reflected in train crew and mechanical and engineering work forces. Our - the culture of our workforce is changing as our employees are actively engaged in both generating new ideas and implementing those ideas to our transportation plan. I am pleased with the progresses we have made so far, not only the results but the process we are following.","Last quarter, we introduced 6 key performance indicators that we believe are appropriate measures to gauge our Unified Plan 2020 progress over time. These KPIs align our operating goals with our financial targets.","Today, we have updated each KPI chart with the current results for the week ending January 22. The chart shows the pre-Unified Plan values from September of last year and the gold bar representing the range of expectations for our performance levels at year-end 2019.","The yearend goals coincide with the data that we showed you last October. As you can see, we have made steady improvement. Freight car velocity has improved 9% since September. Operating inventory and cars per carload continued to improve due to faster car cycle time and the reduction in freight car dwell.","Moving on to locomotives. Locomotive productivity increased 7% as we consolidated train operations and parked excess power. We have stored over 1,200 locomotives since August, and we expect units in storage to continue to increase. The results of these improvements are a more fluid and a more reliable service product.","Car trip plan compliance increased 14 percentage points, and daily manifest service issues decreased 35% since September. As a reminder, the 2019 year-end goals are interim goals as we implement the Unified Plan 2020 across our network this year and beyond. Also, keep in mind the seasonality. Weather events and periodic service interruptions will drive variability in our KPI results.","The results for workforce productivity in December are down from September, due - primarily due to the seasonality of carloads, but we expect large gains over the course of this year. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of our KPIs, and we expect continued improvement in our operations this year.","So turning to capital. In 2018, we invested $3.2 billion in our capital program. In 2019, we are also targeting about around $3.2 billion pending final approval of our Board of Directors.","70% of our planned 2019 capital allocation is replacement spending to harden our infrastructure, replace older assets and to improve our safety and resiliency of the network. We will purchase no new locomotives in 2019, although we will continue to modernize our existing fleet.","Freight car acquisitions will support both replacement and growth opportunities. We will continue to invest in our - in capacity projects on our network where constraints and productivity opportunities exist.","We also plan expansions at intermodal ramps and other commercial facilities to accommodate expected growth. Planned investment in positive train control is $115 million, and that's down $43 million from 2018.","To wrap up, Unified Plan 2020 is off to a great start, and I'm very proud of the team's efforts. We have made excellent progress in a short amount of time, but we are just getting started. 2019 will be a year full of change, and the results will be a safer, more reliable and more efficient network.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert Knight","Thanks, and good morning. Before I get started, as a reminder, our results for the fourth quarter of 2017 were impacted by two adjustments that we made associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was passed in late December of '17.","These adjustments included a $5.9 billion reduction in income tax expense and an approximately $200 million reduction in equipment rents expense, driven primarily by our equity ownership in TTX. Comparisons that I make today to 2017's financial results exclude the impact of these adjustments.","With that introduction, here's a recap of our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue was $5.8 billion in the quarter, up 6% versus last year. Positive core price, increased fuel surcharge revenue and a 3% increase in volume were the primary drivers of revenue growth for the quarter. Operating expense totaled $3.5 billion, up 4% from 2017. Operating income totaled $2.2 billion, a 9% increase from last year.","Below the line, other income was $46 million compared to $33 million in 2017. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by additional real estate gains. Interest expense of $240 million was up 28% compared to the previous year. This reflects the impact of higher total debt balance, partially offset by a lower effective interest rate.","Income tax expense decreased 32% to $462 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower tax rate as a result of corporate tax reform, partially offset by higher pretax earnings. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.9%. For 2019, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be around 24%.","Net income totaled $1.6 billion, up 29% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance decreased 7% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce a fourth quarter record earnings per share of $2.12.","Our operating ratio of 61.6% was an improvement of 1.1 points compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The combined impact of fuel price and our fuel surcharge lag had a 0.5 point favorable impact on the operating ratio in the quarter compared to 2017.","Freight revenue of $5.4 billion was up 6% versus last year. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $488 million, up $195 million compared to 2017 and up $6 million versus the third quarter of 2018.","Business mix had a negative impact of 3.5 points on freight revenue for the fourth quarter. Decreased sand volumes and an increase of lower average revenue per car intermodal shipments drove the negative change in mix.","And as Kenny already stated, core price was 2.5% in the fourth quarter, which represents a three quarters a point sequential improvement compared to the third quarter.","We realized solid pricing gains across most business segments during the quarter. For the full year, as we expected, total dollars generated from our pricing actions well exceeded our rail inflation costs.","Now turning to operating expense. Slide 21 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense increased 4% to $1.3 billion versus 2017.","The increase was driven primarily by employee severance costs related to our recent workforce reduction, volume cost and wage inflation, partially offset by lower management labor cost.","Total workforce levels were approximately flat in the fourth quarter versus last year. Employees not associated with capital projects were also unchanged year-over-year. Our TE&Y workforce was up 4% due to higher carload volume and more employees in the training pipeline. Offsetting this increase was a 1% reduction in management employees and a 2% reduction in our mechanical and engineering workforces.","Fuel expense totaled $640 million, up 17% compared to last year. Higher diesel fuel prices were the primary driver of the increase in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, our average fuel price increased 15% to $2.33 per gallon. Our fuel consumption rate increased about 1% during the quarter, primarily due to mix.","Purchase services and materials expense was down 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 at $582 million. Higher intermodal contract services were more than offset by lower mechanical repair costs and joint facility expenses.","Turning to Slide 22. Depreciation expense was $555 million, up 4% compared to 2017. The increase was primarily driven by a higher depreciable asset base. For the full year of 2019, we estimate that depreciation expense will increase about 3%.","Moving to equipment and other rents. This expense totaled $269 million in the quarter, which is down 3% when compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by lower freight car and locomotive lease expense, partially offset by increased volume-related costs.","Other expenses came in at $221 million, down 8% versus last year. Increased casualty costs were more than offset by insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Harvey and other items during the quarter. For the full year 2019, we expect other expense to be up in the 5% to 10% range compared to 2018.","Productivity savings yielded from our \"G55 + 0\" initiatives totaled $65 million during the quarter, which was partially offset by additional costs associated with operational inefficiencies.","The impact of these operational challenges totaled just under $20 million in the quarter, which is down from the $50 million that we reported in the third quarter. The additional cost were primarily in the compensation and benefits cost category.","Full year productivity totaled $265 million, which was partially offset by $175 million of additional costs related to network inefficiencies. Net productivity savings for the year was $90 million.","Railroad operations improved steadily throughout the quarter. And as Lance mentioned earlier, we are pleased to report that we are no longer experiencing the failure cost associated with the inefficient network operations.","Slide 24 provides the summary of our 2018 earnings with a full year income statement. Operating revenue increased about $1.9 billion or 7% to $22.8 billion. Operating income totaled $8.5 billion, an increase of 8% compared to 2017. Net income was approximately $6 billion, while earnings per share increased 37% to a record $7.91 per share.","Looking at our cash flow. Cash from operations for the full year totaled $8.7 billion, up about 20% when compared to last year, due primarily to higher net income. As expected, capital spending in 2018 totaled $3.2 billion or about 14% of revenue. Return on invested capital was 15.1% in 2018, up from 13.7% in 2017, driven primarily by higher earnings.","Taking a look at adjusted debt levels. The all-in adjusted debt balance totaled $25.1 billion at year-end 2018, up $5.6 billion since year-end 2017. This includes the $6 billion debt offering that we completed in early June, partially offset by repayments of debt maturities.","We finished the fourth quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.3 times, up from 1.9 times in 2017. As we have previously mentioned, our target for debt-to-EBITDA is up to 2.7 times, which we will achieve over time.","Dividend payments for the year totaled $2.3 billion, up from $2 billion in 2017. This includes the effect of 2 10% dividend increases in 2018. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 8 million shares at a cost of $1.2 billion. Additionally, we received 4.5 million shares in the fourth quarter associated with our $3.6 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we initiated in June.","In total for the year, we repurchased 57.2 million shares at a cost of $8.2 billion. These repurchases reduced our full year average share balance by 6% compared to 2017.","Between dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned $10.5 billion to our shareholders in 2018. Free cash flow before dividends totaled nearly $5.3 billion, resulting in a free cash flow conversion rate equal to 88% of net income for 2018.","Looking at 2019, we expect volumes for the full year to increase in the low single-digit range. And as Kenny mentioned earlier, we should see strength in several business categories, along with uncertainty in others.","We will price our service product to the value it represents in the marketplace while ensuring that it generates an appropriate return for our shareholders. We are confident the dollars we yield from our pricing initiatives should again well exceed our rail inflation cost in 2019.","For full year 2019, we expect overall inflation to be about 2%, with labor inflation in the 2.5% range. On the productivity side, we plan to yield at least $500 million of savings this year. We will see productivity in the form of lower compensation expense, enabled by a more efficient workforce.","Labor savings and lower purchase services and materials expense will result from operating smaller locomotive and freight car fleets. Faster asset turns should reduce equipment rents and improve fuel consumption.","Regarding our operating ratio, we are pleased with the recent progress that we have made, eliminating operational inefficiencies and accelerating the Unified Plan 2020. These accomplishments, along with the expectation of low single-digit volume growth in 2019, gives us increased confidence that we will reduce our operating ratio more quickly in the near term. Therefore, assuming the economy cooperates, we are setting new operating ratio guidance for 2019 of a sub 61%, and we expect to be below 60% by the year 2020.","The plans and guidance that we established last year for capital spending, capital structure and use of free cash flow remain essentially unchanged. We will continue to appropriately reinvest in the business to maintain and improve the condition of our infrastructure. We will invest capital to support growth and productivity initiatives that meet our cost of capital threshold, and we expect return on invested capital to grow.","As Tom mentioned earlier, we plan to spend around $3.2 billion in 2019 on capital expenditures, which is flat with 2018. Longer term, we expect capital investments to continue to be less than 15% of revenue.","After capital expenditures, we will continue returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends, maintaining our target payout range of 40% to 45% of earnings.","We expect to take another step forward to increase our debt-to-EBITDA ratio towards our ultimate goal of up to 2.7 times, while maintaining a minimum credit rating of BBB+ and Baa1. The amount by which we increase our debt-to-EBITDA ratio in 2019 will depend on the strength and stability of both the economic and financial markets.","We will continue with our previously announced 3 year plan to repurchase approximately $20 billion of shares by 2020. This plan is now over 40% complete with the $8.2 billion of share repurchases that we completed in 2018.","So to wrap up. Positive full year volume, core pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars and significant productivity benefits will all contribute to another year of strong cash generation and an improved full year operating ratio in 2019. In the longer term, we remain firmly committed to reaching our goal of 55% operating ratio beyond 2020.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance.","Lance Fritz","Thank you, Rob. As discussed today, we delivered record fourth quarter financial results, driven by strong volumes, solid topline revenue growth and improved operating performance. Looking ahead to 2019, we're going to build on the momentum achieved during the past quarter as we continue implementation of Unified Plan 2020 under the guidance of a leader with extensive Precision Scheduled Railroad experience.","We'll continue to pursue other \"G55 + 0\" initiatives as well as we make further gains in safety, service and efficiency. We're optimistic that the economy, the strength of our diverse rail network and improved service performance will drive positive volume growth this year and provide further price improvement opportunity.","We remain focused on increasing shareholder returns by making appropriate capital investments and returning excess cash to shareholders through growing dividends and share repurchases. I am confident that we have the right organization in place, with an appropriate mix of UP veterans and new thought leaders, to achieve our goals for the year.","With that, let's open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company.","Jason Seidl","Thank you and good morning, gentlemen. I wanted to touch on a few things. One, if we look at your outlook on the pricing side, you said - Rob, I think you said the pricing would well exceed your inflation rate. And you said your inflation rate was going to be about 2%. Do you consider the fourth quarter number well exceeding the rate of inflation that you guys posted?","Robert Knight","Jason, yes. I think I'll repeat for everybody else's benefit, how we calculate price. It is an all-in yield number. It's not a same-store sales type of calculation. It's the dollars that we generated across our entire book of business. And so when we say well exceed inflation dollars, we're comparing that dollar, if you will, that we generate across the entire book of business from pricing actions against the dollars that we incurred as a result of inflation. So yes, we did well exceed inflation dollars in the fourth quarter. And we expect to continue to do that again in 2019.","Jason Seidl","Okay. Fantastic. And the next one, shocking, was going to be on PSR. Can we talk a little bit about the pace of improvement? And maybe compare UP's network to some of the other networks that have seen PSR implemented? And is there anything at UP that would cause it to go slower or cause it to go faster?","Lance Fritz","I'll start it out, and then I'd like to turn it over to Jim for his perspective and then Tom as well. So the bottom line is we're focused on implementing the principles through Unified Plan 2020 on our railroad. And we see lots of opportunity to improve our car dwell, to decrease inventory, to improve cars per carload, to improve labor productivity across the board.","We have benchmarked other railroads that implemented Precision Scheduled Railroading. And with puts and takes, we understand what they're achieving, and some of them are setting up some pretty strong benchmarks for us to pursue. But our focus is getting the efficiencies and the improvement here. Jim?","Vincenzo Vena","Lance, so all I can really add is a question. Is there any real difference in the speed? No. There is no real difference. And we're going to do it as quickly as possible to be able to look at every piece of the company to see how we get it to be as efficient as any other railroad in North America.","Jason Seidl","Thank you very gentlemen. Jim, welcome aboard.","Vincenzo Vena","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hey, thanks, good morning. I appreciate you taking the questions. So Lance and Kenny, obviously, the regulators have been a bit active here with some increase before the government shutdown. So maybe you can just give your perspective. It seems like they have appreciated the communication that you've had with them and with other stakeholders, but it didn't stop them from launching the inquiry into some of the accessorials and demurrage fees.","So maybe just give us an update on that. And whether or not you think, when they come back, if adding two new board members will change how this might play out?","Lance Fritz","Brian, this is Lance. So you're absolutely right. The STB has expressed interest in understanding our implementation of Precision Scheduled Railroading in the form of Unified Plan 2020 and also our approach to customers and helping them change behavior. We've been crystal clear with the STB in terms of what our efforts are, what our approach is and what the endgame is.","And I'll leave it to Kenny to dive a little deeper. He has done a tremendous job being in front of the STB, explaining what we're doing, and then being in front of our customers, explaining what we're doing and why.","Now I'll touch just one last base, and that is there are incremental members of the STB being named and now sworn in. And the STB has a very big docket in front of it of proposed rule changes.","So we're working very diligently to help the STB members understand, from our perspective, the potential impacts of some of what has been proposed, what better alternatives exist and helping them work through that docket in a good, swift logical fashion. So Kenny?","Kenyatta Rocker","Yes. So Brian, thanks for the question. I say this humbly, but we've done a really good job of being proactive and communicating and being engaged with the STB. I can tell you that engagement has been very consistent. Lance sent out a letter that will be public on the accessorials. He said that, Monday, we'll be sending out something later this week here in the near term, really just updating the STB on where we are on the accessorials and how Unified Plan 2020 is going.","Brian Ossenbeck","All right. Thanks. I appreciate that. Just as a follow-up, maybe on the headcount and the productivity side. Maybe this is for Tom. The KPIs are great. I appreciate the updates, but it looks like there is some seasonality given that the daily car miles per FTE hasn't moved up. You gave the average for December. They're the ones who were kind of the last 7-day moving average.","Can you just give us some context as to where these were in the fourth quarter? And how you would expect, especially the productivity, how big of a factor is that in the $500 million of targets - target savings rather you're expecting this year? That would be helpful.","Thomas Lischer","So our - on the TE&Y side, our training pipeline is kind of what threw it off a little bit from the actual people side. On a sequential basis, the number is actually coming down from -- for the fourth quarter, ending pretty well in December. That is going to continue moving forward. We're in the early innings as far as the labor productivity goes. So I would just look forward to seeing what happens going forward.","With the other side of it, our engineering and our mechanical areas, we've made the adjustments in those labor productivities as we've made - say for example, the locomotives come out, we've made adjustments there. But we are in early innings on that side, and we just see that improving going forward.","Robert Knight","Right. This is Rob. If I can just add on to your point on the $500 million or at least number of productivity we expect to generate in 2019. Recall, the goal that we put on that particular KPI of a 10%-ish improvement is what we're focused on.","And yes, to get $500 million-plus productivity, you can assume - without precise numbers, you can assume that labor productivity across the board is going to be a significant part of that.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. Thanks for all the details. I appreciate it.","Robert Knight","Yes.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee","Hey, thanks. Good morning. And welcome back, Jim. Glad to have you back. I wanted to touch base - just to follow-up on that comment, Rob, maybe on the efficiencies for $500 million, if you can get a little bit more granular and sort of give us a sense of maybe how you think about the net benefit of that as we move into '19. So it sounds like you're lapping some service issues, that $175 million of service from 2018. I'm not sure how we think about that in 2019. And then how we think about the $500 million in the context of inflation and the pricing that you're able to get?","So I guess, maybe in other words, how much of that $500 million do you think really is net that drops to the bottom line as you run through the PSR initiatives?","Robert Knight","Yes. Chris, I get your question, and I'll probably frustrate you because I won't give as much detail around that, that you're asking. But I do get it. And yes, we are lapping some of those inefficiency costs. And that's why we have the at least $500 million figure out there.","So yes, there is some so-called low hanging fruit of some - we won't reincur some of the inefficiency costs that we had primarily earlier in the year. So that's a good guide. But we are where we are. I mean, so we're going to improve $500 million at least off of where we ended the year on a full year basis. And it's going to come across the board.","It's largely driven by the efficiencies that we've been talking through the Unified Plan 2020, but it's - every stone is going to be turned over in the organization, not just within operations.","So all of that contributes. And yes, we have the headwind of the, call it, 2% inflation in there, but $500 million to the bottom line of productivity is what we're striving to get at least.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay, okay. No, that's helpful. I appreciate that. And then maybe just turning to the volume side. So there has been some announcements, I think, from a service perspective around the Intermodal business. And you were talking about sort of rolling out some of the PSR work to the Sunset Corridor.","I just want to get a sense of, within the 2019 volume guidance, how do you think about Intermodal? Is there some maybe contraction or calling of some less profitable business that's included in that number? And maybe is that -- or is that sort of a variable that could impact the outcome as move through 2019?","Lance Fritz","Kenny?","Kenyatta Rocker","Yes. So I'll take that. Thanks for that question. First of all, we have a very positive outlook on our Intermodal franchise, both as we parse out the Intermodal and the domestic side.","We're still in the early innings on what all we want to do with the network. Jim, Tom and myself would be working out the team as we look for more productivity and make sure that we have the most reliable, consistent service product out there.","Lance Fritz","Yes. I want to circle back, Chris, on overall volumes. So if you look around the globe, you can certainly find spots that cause you concern, right? Europe's slowing down. You can even read some reports that maybe it's ebbing into negative growth territory. Clearly, we've got trade potential impacts with China, both real now and future potential. So those are clear overhangs that we're keeping an eye on.","Having said that, we have touched base with our customers and continue to do so. And as we look at the economic indicators in the United States, we still see support for what we consider low single-digit volume growth. And we're poised to be agile if that doesn't happen, but it feels like the U.S. continues to plug along. And so we're prepared for that.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. Thanks very much for the color. I appreciate it.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long","Thanks and good morning. So I would guess the productivity guidance you've provided for this year is more back-half weighted as you'll have PSR fully rolled out on the network.","So is it possible to help us understand the productivity gains you're assuming in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year? I just wanted to get a better sense of the second [half run rate co] PSR.","Lance Fritz","Rob?","Robert Knight","Yes, Justin. I mean, we aren't detailing it quarterly, the way you're asking. But I can just tell you that we're not sitting around waiting for the back half of the year to come. We're going after it. As you heard both Jim and Tom and Kenny talked about earlier, we're going after it now. And we feel like we finished 2018 with pretty good momentum.","So without giving details of precisely how much it's going to show up in each quarter, I can tell you that I don't view it that way. I look at it as an opportunity in front us. We're going to go after as much opportunity on the productivity front as we can.","Lance Fritz","Yes. You've seen the numbers, whether it's year-over-year or what we talked about middle of the year to now, locomotives, year-over-year, that number is down 1,200. A number like that from peak to now is down about a couple of thousand. I mean, we are entering the year on pretty good front-forward posture.","Justin Long","Okay. That's helpful. And just to clarify on the guidance for a sub-61 OR this year. Does that assume $500 million of productivity? Or does it assume something higher than that?","Robert Knight","Yes, Justin, this is Rob. It assumes the economy cooperates. It assumes that we generate and we see positive volume, although we won't use volume as -- lack of volume as an excuse. But our assumption is positive volume on the low single-digit side. It assumes pricing dollars generated above inflation dollars. And it assumes at least $500 million of productivity. So all of that has to be -- we're counting on all of that. We're going after every one of those aspects.","Justin Long","Okay. And I guess, lastly, for Jim. Congrats on the new role. And I wanted to circle back to some of the longer-term OR commentary. I'm guessing, given your limited time at the company, your input on the targets, thus far, has been pretty limited.","So is it reasonable to expect that after a quarter or two of getting out on the network, seeing the railroad, we could potentially revisit this 2020 target and maybe put some numbers around the timing of getting to that 55 longer term?","Vincenzo Vena","Well, thanks for welcoming me, Justin. But you knew I was not going to answer that question. I've been here for 10 days. It's pretty hard to say how much of the railroad I've seen have been out in the field. I'll tell you this much. There's opportunity out there. There's opportunity in how fast we turn the assets from locomotive cars. There's impacts to engineering.","But what I'm really happy to see is the whole team, before I showed up, was working towards an improved service, improved assets, improved speed, all the things that count.","So we're going to do, as a team, everything we can to do it as fast as possible without truly affecting service to the point where we're affecting the customers that pay the bill every day.","Justin Long","Okay, great\u2026","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group","Hey, thanks. Morning, guys.","Lance Fritz","Morning.","Scott Group","Before I really get going, Rob, can you just quickly quantify the insurance and severance items in the quarter?","Robert Knight","Yes. The insurance recovery that I called out was in the neighborhood of $15 million, call it, $0.01 EPS. And the severance was 20 - roughly $25 million.","Scott Group","Okay. Helpful. So Jim, welcome. And I'm not sure exactly how you're going to answer this based on how you just answered that last question. But UP has told us that they think structurally, they should have the best margin of any railroad. Given sort of your background and history, do you agree with that?","Vincenzo Vena","Thanks, Rob. So you guys have already got out that we're absolutely the best. Listen, Scott, seriously, there is nothing holding back from what I've seen from before and where I've been on-site from the franchise and what we can do. There are some things that we can do real fast short term. And there's others that we're going to have to target some capital in places to be able to run the trains and the cars as quick as possible, and we'll do that. But I don't see any reason for us to push against the best in the industry.","Do I realize that - and I know some of those people in the other railroads. There's no way Keith is going to make it easy. There's no way JJ is going to make it easy. And there's no way Foote's going to make it easy. So we're going to work hard to see what they have -- we can do to be in the same ballpark and play the same game.","Scott Group","And when we've seen precision railroading at past railroads, it has been associated with closing hump yards and yard rationalization. Do you think we'll start to see that from UP?","Vincenzo Vena","Everything is on the table. So I visited a hump yard last week, and there is no ifs, ands or buts. We have opportunity. So everything. Flat yards, hump yards, there is nothing that's not on the table. And I'd be remiss to say, listen, we're going to shut down x amount of yards with 10 days on the job. But we're going to spend a lot of time to make sure we get the plant set up to handle the business as efficiently as possible with great service. So that's where we're headed.","Scott Group","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Vincenzo Vena","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Great job on a solid performance in accelerating the plan, Lance. But Kenny, maybe you can delve into kind of what kind of changes have you already launched with customers in changing how the business is run. Can - any examples you can give us on things that have changed as you roll out PSR?","Kenyatta Rocker","Sure. Thanks for that question, Ken. So first of all, what we've done is we've been very proactive with our customers and we've been very granular with them on the changes that we want to make. So specifically, we tell them exactly what will happen. We talk to them about when and then we talk to them about what they can expect, and so we've done that at every turn.","We've also sat down with our customers and talked to them about how to have the most efficient supply chain in terms of what we're trying to accomplish from a rail perspective.","As Tom mentioned earlier, we've had quite a bit of a decrease in our rail inventory. A significant part of that is on the private cars fleet, and a lot of that is because our commercial team has been proactive in working with the customer to let them know how to run an efficient rail service with us.","Lance Fritz","Yes. And Kenny, those conversations haven't been easy, right? So customers aren't just immediately embracing the conversations you're earning with them. But your team is doing a tremendous job helping them understand how they can change their operating processes so that they receive better service net-net overall.","Kenyatta Rocker","Yes, that's right.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Appreciate that. And then if I can get one in for Jim as well. And Jim, welcome. But what - from your perspective so far and kind of how Lance has described, he stressed a lot about what fits our railroad in precision railroading principles.","And given your background at your prior firm, what is different? Maybe you can explain to us from your perspective in the way Union Pacific has previously talked about PSR principles versus the precision railroading we saw. And then your thoughts on how that relates maybe to headcount reduction or timing of that?","Vincenzo Vena","Well, Ken, nice to hear your voice again, so thanks for welcoming me back. So I don't think there's anything different, substantially different. The network can be a little bit different. The customer, payers can be a little bit different. But the end result for PSR is pretty simple.","You want to have great service. And I'll admit it right upfront, there's always -- and Kenny knows there's going to be some noise on the way there. There's -- and when you are more efficient in how you turn the locomotives, you need less of them. You need less people to service them. And I could go through a long list to tell you. I don't see anything major difference.","But I'll let Lance talk about if there's really that much structurally different, and I think that's what it is, structurally we're a little bit different than the railroad I used to work at. But at the end of that, the principles are you run a real efficient railroad to the point where, down the road, we'll be able to attract new business because we're more efficient that we were not able to attract at this point.","Make ourselves more competitive at every place where we competing, not only against railroad but against trucks. So it's a real positive. And the quicker we can get to that efficiency, it just helps us drive the bottom line in this company to a new point. So that's what we're doing.","Lance Fritz","Amen, Jim. Ken, I think you shouldn't read too much into - and I've said this over and over. When I talk precision scheduled railroad principles, it's Precision Scheduled Railroading. It's all the things that build it done the UP way, which just means at right speed, engaged with customers, and you're seeing how we implement it in full. So it's not like a piece here, a piece there, and I think we've been crystal clear about that as well.","Ken Hoexter","Appreciate that and the time. Thanks, guys.","Lance Fritz","Yes.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison Landry","Good morning. Thanks. I wanted to, Jim, ask you, in previous iterations of PSR, the shedding of marginal traffic across the entire book not just intermodal. The resulting disruption of traffic flow seemed to allow Hunter to halt the system and redesign it very quickly, like we saw at CSX and CP.","And it doesn't seem like we've really seen that so far at UMP, and I'm not hearing that from you guys today. Maybe that's due to the fact that the STB is keeping a pretty close eye out on the customer impact.","But in your experience, is shedding business a necessary part of this process in order to fully realize the benefits of PSR implementation? And if you don't think so, I'd be curious to hear any thoughts on why maybe Hunter did it that way?","Vincenzo Vena","Well, Allison, thanks for the question. First of all, too early for me to say what impacts and what the efficiency will do to the business that's out there right now. I'd be truly guessing, and I don't like to guess. But if you have everything on the table, you need to deal with the flows of traffic, how well it fits into the plan to be efficient.","And other places that have done PSR or scheduled railroad before, there has been some impact. But it's a logical decision to go through. You try to do it as little as possible. But at the end of the day, you got to be smart enough to move ahead and operate the railroad in a very efficient manner. So Allison, sorry, I just can't give you any more than that. I'd be guessing, and that's not what I'm doing.","Kenyatta Rocker","And then, Allison, this is Kenny. I just want to say we're working together as a team, Tom, Jim and I, to really educate the customer on how to fit in our network. I can tell you, we're not going in this thing looking to say, hey, we may lose this business because we're shipping. We're going in to win and grow our franchise.","Allison Landry","Okay, that's helpful. And Jim, I can appreciate you not wanting to guess. And then I wanted to see if you may be able to elaborate on the comments you made that perhaps you'll target some capital to be able to run the trains as quick as possible. Can you give us some sense of what that could relate to or maybe an example? That would be helpful? Thanks.","Vincenzo Vena","Real quick example from what I'd seen already is we want to build the length of the trains up. The technology is in place to operate the trains at a larger size than we are today and we might have to target some places where we can meet larger trains.","And that's where we're going to do, and we want to do that fairly quickly. We want to be able to turn on that. And I Rob's on board, Lance is on board, the whole team is on board. It just makes the place more efficient. So that's an example.","Robert Knight","And Allison, I would just - this is Rob. I would just add, of course, all of that will be embedded in the guidance that we gave of less than 15% of revenue as we look. So we'll work -- we might move capital dollar from this project to that project. That kind of decision will -- may be made, but within the overall structure that we've guided.","Allison Landry","Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.","Robert Knight","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, good morning and congratulations on the strong momentum at the railroad and also on bringing Jim onboard. Sounds like you got just a lot of momentum, a lot of opportunity. You've - so you've had a lot of questions on PSR and kind of how you're approaching it. You've got your own KPIs.","I just wanted to get some thoughts on how you think the review of the train schedule, how we might consider that. I think that's been a key component of schedule railroading at CP, CSX when it was rolled out, running fewer trains, taking train miles out and so forth.","Can you offer some thoughts on has that already been done? Is reduction train starts kind of a key component? I know you've talked more about car miles per day, but just if you could offer some thoughts on that or if that's still to come in the future.","Lance Fritz","Hey, Tom, this is Lance. So I'll start in outlining for everybody on the call our process of adjusting our transportation plan, which Tom mentioned in his comments, and then give it over to Jim and Tom to add detail.","So recall, Tom was talking about the Mid-American quarter, 160 T-Plan changes. In the Phase 2, 200. And we're just launching on Phase 3. So that is - those changes are exactly what you're talking about, Tom. That's about balancing the network. It's about blending. It's about taking what used to maybe be a unit train, but it wasn't efficient as a unit train and turning it into manifest and blending those networks. And then also looking for opportunities to knock off train starts, which ultimately ends up being a productivity tool for crew utilization.","So all that - Phase 1 is under way. The process has been for us to bring in from the field the individuals who have to execute the work. We hold them accountable for designing a T-Plan that is highly reliable and efficient, and then they work with our network planning team to make it real. So that's how Phase 1 happened, the Phase 2 happened, it's how Phase 3 is going to happen this coming week. And a little more technicolor, Jim or Tom.","Vincenzo Vena","Go ahead, Tom.","Thomas Lischer","So we are - to your point, we are looking at train size and the train schedules to maximize footage across the territories that we can operate. Jim alluded to some capital opportunities that we're studying right now to get a quick turn on.","But this is going to be an evergreen process as we continue. We're going to continue to look for the efficiencies, not only at the local or the node type area but the line side to drive those efficiencies across the network.","Vincenzo Vena","Listen, the only thing I could add and maybe it'll save some of the questions later on. Bottom line is we're going to use less cars to move the same amount of business because we're going to make them run faster. You do that by running them through terminals quicker than we are today, substantially quicker than we are today.","You're going to run less locomotives because they're going to get over the road quicker and we'll be able to turn them into terminal. And we're going to be more efficient in how we handle them through the shops and how - even the equipment department, the mechanical people, how they handle the locomotives, how long they're out of service.","We're going to go after the engineering people to see how efficient they are with capital to make sure that we're not blowing capital. We don't need to add to capital. We'll use the capital we have to be able to fix the railroad and make sure we've got the most optimal railroad.","I can keep on going for a long time. The bottom line, what we want is good service with moving trains with more cars on them in an efficient manner. The locomotives are better. So we're going to touch - we've already touched, and we're going to touch the railroad across the whole company. It's not just one segment. It's exciting, right? There is nothing better to see when this thing comes through. Some of them will be real quick changes that we can make, and we've made changes already.","We just dropped -- Tom and I went through, and we dropped a couple hundred more locomotives in the first 10 days. So is there more to come? Yes, there is. But let's be smart about it. So I'm excited. It's fun. And it's not like me going to Tibet or China or something because it's a different -- but this is pretty good in Omaha. I'm enjoying it.","Tom Wadewitz","So that all makes sense. And I don't mean to overly focus on one metric, but can you offer a thought on how train starts may have changed? I mean, are they down - what percent they might be down? Or what - or is that - the train start reduction is something that would come later on?","Lance Fritz","Tom, do you want to give a little commentary kind of qualitatively on what's happening with train starts?","Thomas Lischer","They're moving down, aligned with our expectations. We see some opportunity here going forward in the next couple months.","Lance Fritz","Yes, and you see it across the board, Tom. So we're finding opportunity to take manifest train starts down because we're finding opportunity where we have 4 starts between terminals and we really only need 2. And then we're also finding opportunity where we used to run a bulk train once every 2 weeks, and we're just sucking those cars into the manifest network.","So we're not going to have that bulk train start and growing train size and the manifest network. We're seeing all of that, and there's lots and lots of opportunity to continue.","Tom Wadewitz","Right, okay. Thanks for the time, I appreciate it.","Lance Fritz","Yes.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Mehrotra","Thanks. Congrats team. Best of Luck, Jim. Jim, I know you've been at the company for, I guess, 10 days now, including the weekend. But you've been obviously at the rail industry for several decades. And I'm sure you had a good sense before you came in, in terms of what Union Pacific does well and maybe what can be improved upon.","And I think you've touched on a few things from an efficiency perspective. But if you can just help us understand the DNA of UNP as you looked from outside in, what they've done well, what you think at least can be improved upon. I think that will be helpful in just understanding the opportunity?","Vincenzo Vena","Well, listen, you pass judgment when you look from outside in. It's a great company, great franchise. So it's got all the -- and great people. It really has, and we're going to put some extra focus on operating efficiency. And I think they -- UP has already started doing that before I showed up, so -- which is nice. And they got a great team from -- sitting around the table here with me. We've got strong people from the finance side, the marketing side.","So I think it's a great opportunity, great company and we don't want to be where we are. We want to be close to the best of the best down the road, so that's what we're driving for.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay, okay. Let me just ask maybe a more specific one for Rob on the comment - the earlier comment Rob made with respect to the OR target this year being predicated on volume growth, productivity growth, just a lot of things that's rolling up into that OR target.","But we are in a little bit of a transition period with respect to volume growth just given the uncertainty out there and your own guidance for this year. So Rob, how should we think about how much of the OR improvement is, in fact, predicated on the volume and revenue growth assumptions in the plan?","Or is there just so much cost opportunity because you have that at least $500 million productivity target out there that there is enough cushion to say if volume growth is flat or maybe even slightly negative this year?","Robert Knight","Yes, no, I get your question. And I'm not going to give you a precise number today. Having followed us a long time, we don't use, as I said earlier, the lack of volume as an excuse to not achieve our productivity. But volume is our friend. So I can't split the hairs the way quite the way you're asking it, but our outlook right now is the economy is cooperating.","And our outlook is that volume will be on the positive side of the ledger, in the low single digits, and we're not going to stop at $500 million. We're going to get at least that, and we're going to be as aggressive, as you've heard us talk all morning here, and looking for opportunities that we are pretty confident we know are out there and additional ones that no doubt will come as Jim and the team get further engaged.","So we're going to go after -- and by the way, we're not just going to stop at -- we're going to get as far below the 61% as we can. So when we say sub-61%, we're going to do as good a job as we can pulling all the levers.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. I'm going to ask one more just because I understand the answer, but I guess it wasn't overly precise because you just can't - you're not - you guys can't provide that, I guess, and I understand that. But maybe on the CapEx because you have provided a precise number on CapEx. Now it's a little over 13% in sales.","Can you just talk about the filter? Has the filter changed in terms of what's being green lit in terms of new projects? And what's caused that reduction? And all the incremental cash flow, I guess, could that go now back to share repurchase? Would that be the number one use of the incremental cash flow? And that's it for me.","Robert Knight","Yes, Amit, this is Rob. And one of the things you've heard me say for several years now, we are very proud about the process that we have as an organization around our disciplined capital spending. So we have a joint effort that heavily involves, of course, operations, marketing and finance to really grind and make sure we're making the right decisions with an eye on long-term reserve - returns when we make capital investments.","So we're not starting a railroad. We want to make capital investments. I'm -- as a CFO, I'm the happiest guy in the room to make a capital investment because I know we only do that when the returns justify it.","So when you look at it, our discipline process around our capital, I would say that the process has not changed. What may well change, as Jim alluded to earlier, is specific projects here or there, where he sees and the team sees the opportunity to generate strong returns going forward. Those dollars may be redirected to different projects, but the process at a macro level is unchanged.","Amit Mehrotra","Got it. Thanks, guys. Congrats again and good luck in 2019. I appreciate it.","Robert Knight","Thanks, Amit.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ravi Shanker","Thanks. Morning, guys. So you guys have made some pretty good progress with the PSR implementation already and it sounds like you're going to be done with it in 6 months. Is there a risk that Jim's full impact may not be able to come through because you're pretty much going to be done with the plan before he gets ramped up at the railroad? Or if Jim does come in and find a bunch of things to do, I mean, maybe that could extend the pace of implementation.","Lance Fritz","Ravi, let's be really crystal clear. Phase 1 of implementing this whole thing, when we're doing that in 3 phases, that will be done by mid-summer. This is an evergreen, right? So it's not like one and done, and then we live with that T-Plan and it's set in stone.","This is a relentless pursuit of efficiency and enhanced reliability on our service product to customers. And we're never done. So my expectation with Jim is that you're going to be after it with the team with Tom and Lynden and Kenny forever. For -- it's an evergreen process, Ravi.","Ravi Shanker","Sorry, Jim, don't put your feet up just yet.","Vincenzo Vena","I was just wondering whether you thought - listen, I'm over here just relaxing. So I really appreciate it, Ravi. Thank you very much.","Ravi Shanker","No worries. And just as a follow-up, Rob, maybe Phase 1, you're going to be done by mid '19. And maybe this is related to the first question. But can you just talk about some of the items that will kind of bridge the OR gap between the 61% at the end of '19 and 60% for 2020? Again, are those related to PSR? Are those unrelated to PSR items?","Robert Knight","It's all of the above. I mean, PSR principles and the UP 2020 clearly will be, I think, a major piece of it. But remember, we've got our \"G55 + 0\" initiatives, which the difference between that and the Unified Plan 2020, really, in my mind is the \"G55 + 0\" initiatives is implied to mean everyone in the organization, whereas Unified Plan 2020 is really heavily operational. But everyone in the company is focused on driving productivity in everything we do.","And I would say as we look to the sub-61% to the sub-60%, to your question, it's going to be driving all of the things we've been talking about today. The productivity, the efficiencies that will be evergreen and continue.","It will be our relentless pressure and focus on getting as much price in the market as we possibly can. And at this stage of the game, we see positive volume being a contributor as well. So it's going to be all those levers.","Ravi Shanker","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Matt Reustle with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Reustle","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Somewhat of a follow-up to an earlier question in terms of pricing initiatives. At this point, do you think you're actually driving any shift in mix from customers that are receptive to the pricing terms versus those that aren't?","Lance Fritz","Kenny?","Kenyatta Rocker","Yes, thanks for that question. No, we haven't seen that right now. I can tell you that we're pricing to the market, we're pricing to our value proposition. And as our service product becomes more reliable, we're optimistic about our opportunity to continue to do that.","Lance Fritz","And I want to add a little bit to that, Matt. So saying that we're deliberately trying to move mix with price is -- that's probably not precisely accurate. Saying sometimes that happens because when Kenny's team is pushing and trying to get as much as they can for the value that we're delivering, sometimes they break business. And when that happens, it can affect mix. And that - I don't doubt that has happened historically, and I don't doubt it's going to continue to happen.","Matt Reustle","Absolutely. Understood, okay. And then, Rob, regarding the $12 billion remaining on the buyback, right now you're running about $3 billion in free cash flow after dividends per year so that leaves a $6 billion gap there. At your current EBITDA level, you could do another $4 billion in debt raise and not breach the leverage targets.","So how do you think about bridging that $2 billion gap over the next 2 years? Is it free cash flow growth, is it EBITDA growth? And you referenced it in your remarks. How comfortable are you that you can achieve that if you do see a deterioration in the macro environment?","Robert Knight","Yes. I mean we expect to make progress. And we will -- it will all be predicated on how our earnings growth project and how we actually deliver in actuality. And right now, as you can tell from our tone, we're feeling pretty good about that.","So I would anticipate that we'll continue to move up the scale, if you will, on the guidance that we've given and continue to make progress on the - completing the buyback, working up towards that 2.7 times that we talked about. We made good progress in 2018. We expect to continue to make good progress in '19 and '20.","Matt Reustle","And ultimately, you think there's enough, whether it's CapEx takeout or cost takeout opportunities, where you can still achieve that full $20 billion even if you had an environment where volumes were declining or slowing down in particular areas?","Robert Knight","Yes. But of course, we always take a look at what's happening in our business. And if you had a recession or something like that, which we're not projecting, I mean, we obviously take that into consideration.","Matt Reustle","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Walter Spracklin","Yes. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. And welcome back, Jim. My question is around PSR and the implementation that we've seen or terms of implementation that we've seen in the past. And we've seen examples where it was attempted and failed and examples where it was attempted and achieved.","And it seems that in those areas where it was attempted and achieved, it was done in a fairly aggressive fashion with a very short time frame that typically resulted in a fair degree of disruption. And that's disruption's at the customer level, the labor level, the regulator level.","Mike, where we've seen it fail is where we've tried to water it down a bit and tried not to be as disruptive, and it hasn't worked. What I'm trying to figure out now, which way - what is the risk that we see a, perhaps, adjustment to PSR that puts it - puts the PSR implementation at risk?","Lance Fritz","So I'm going to start by saying I'm not sure I'm going to buy into the premise of the question. I'll say Jim can talk perfectly about the experience at CN, kind of the mother ship of the concept. And that happened over a fairly long period of time and continues to happen. So Jim, why don't you share those perspectives with us?","Vincenzo Vena","Walter, nice hearing from you. To start off, there's things that you can do real quick. And is there going to be some noise? I give it. Kenny is going to have some noise, but we got to be smart about how we do it so the noise does not affect us both from regulatory or customer. So we have that.","But you move fairly quick and you see some advantages. The first few points are easier to drive and quicker. It took us, at the old company, a long time to get the last piece. That's a cultural change with people. It's how people think, it's how people do. So all those things take a little bit longer. And there is something that we find -- as you go through the process, you're going to have to spend capital to be able to extend sightings and tweak things to put it in.","And so all that's in the mix. And listen, this whole question about whether we're going to succeed, I'll be honest. I could have just stayed doing what I was doing. I've got income back to sit around and enjoy myself and enjoy Omaha and everything that the network has to offer. I'm here to deliver. The team is here to deliver. We're going to have a lot of fun doing it. It's going to be an exciting time, and we're going to deliver it, Walter. I'm not worried about it.","Lance Fritz","Absolutely. And I want to come back to maybe one of the fundamental differences, maybe not, of how we're going about it. And that is Kenny has talked over and over about being in front of the customer, making sure they know what we're up to. That doesn't mean that the conversation goes smoothly and comfortably, but it means that they know.","And the endgame is we want them to understand what we're doing, what it takes to fit well in this newly designed network, what those behaviors look like so that the service to them is highly efficient, highly reliable and consistent, which is the endgame. That's what they want. And so maybe that's a stylistic change. It doesn't slow us up, but it does change I think how the customer perceives what's going on.","Walter Spracklin","Yes. That makes sense. Okay. Just moving over to pricing. Perhaps, Kenny, you can address. You pointed and highlighted a fairly significant change sequentially in your pricing, a lot higher than I would expect from a quarter-to-quarter basis.","Was there any kind of lumpy contracts, resign? Was there the benefit of spot business that -- from the tail end of the trucking? Can you perhaps give us a little bit of color on why that lifted so much? And could we see a continuation of a very significant sequential lift if whatever factors were at play in the fourth quarter continue into 2019?","Kenyatta Rocker","Yes. So first of all, we still have the competitive forces that we talked about in the past. They're still there. There wasn't anything unique or - that we want to call out. Like I stated, we're just going to continue to price to the market. We're going to price to the value proposition that we have. And a more reliable service product is going to give us more opportunity.","Walter Spracklin","So nothing specifically that caused the increase in the fourth quarter? Like, was it - like even - without being specific to different customers, was it just higher renewals? Or any color at all?","Robert Knight","Yes, this is Rob. As we said in our opening comments, we pretty much got -- saw positive pricing, except for the areas that Kenny just mentioned, where we continue to face some competitive pressures. We pretty much got good price across the board. So there was no single driver or marquee story line there. It was just steady hard work and good service and it came in at the 2.5.","Walter Spracklin","Okay, okay. Thanks very much for the color.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mike Baudendistel with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Baudendistel","Great. Thank you. I just wanted to ask you, I mean, a lot of the other rails that have gone through PSR had first seen customer service deteriorate before it has later gotten better. Do you expect that to apply to Union Pacific?","Lance Fritz","So far, it hasn't, and that's not our objective. Right now, we're making pretty radical changes. And I'm sure you can find some number of customers at UP who could tell you that they're not real happy because we fundamentally changed the service product. Broadly speaking, the networks providing a better service product to most of our customers, and that's our intent.","Thomas Lischer","So first, to build on that a little bit, we've seen actually a 35% reduction in our service issues on our manifest program. So where we put in the - our Unified Plan 2020, we rolled that out. We've seen really good improvement in the overall reliability. Obviously, there's more opportunity to get better here.","Mike Baudendistel","Great. Sounds good. And also, just wanted to ask you, you said you don't need any locomotives in 2019. I think you've said that before. Is it primarily because you purchased a lot of locomotives the last few years? Or is it because you're running the network more efficiently and you can park some more now because of the existing fleet?","Lance Fritz","It's because we have a lot of locomotives in storage right now. We just don't need to add to the fleet. I will remind you, we did say that we're going to continue to modernize some of our heavily used units in the fleet, and that's for an eye towards improving reliability. Reliability of the fleet is really critical as we continue to grind efficiency on the resource.","Mike Baudendistel","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question is from the line of David Vernon with Alliance Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.","David Vernon","Hey. Good morning, guys. I had another sort of philosophical question around the whole PSR thing. I think where we've seen this work really well in the past is a very tight integration between sales and operations. In fact, most times, you've had sort of like a President of the business kind of controlling both functions. And it's really a shift from designing operation -- services with operations to the light customers to really selling the schedule that's most sufficient to run.","I just wanted to get a sense for how you guys are addressing that kind of tension between sales and operations, either organizationally or through incentives or through business process changes, to make sure that as you are implementing this stuff, you are getting that tight integration that you need between the selling functions and the operating functions to really get the most out of this initiative. So if you could talk to that, that would be great.","Lance Fritz","Well, I'll let the guy doing it speak to that.","Vincenzo Vena","Okay. So let's think about it. There is going to be some impacts. I keep on saying it, and I'll say it again. From all the questions that we've had, people have said there's going to be impacts, and there's going to be impacts. As soon as you change things, you start charging people the merge for using your car and you make sure you collect the bill so that they give you the car back and they take it on arrival so it doesn't sit in your yard, that's a big change. And we're going to make those changes. We're going to make it quick.","The Chief Operating Officer and the Chief Marketing Officer, sorry about that change in title. I apologize. But, okay, they can work hand-in-hand if we have the same goal, which we have the same goal. If there's some tension, at the end of the day, if we all understand where the goal is at the end - and I'll tell you, JJ and I had a great relationship, okay? And there's no reason for Kenny and I not to have the same relationship where we know what the goal is.","And we know where there's going to be some impacts and we know there are some tough decisions to make. And I'm absolutely sure that Lance will keep the feet to the fire to make sure that we come to a solution that makes sense. And so that's my two piece.","Lance Fritz","That's exactly right, Jim.","Thomas Lischer","With the initial implementation, Kenny and I have been a lockstep, having those conversations with the customers. As we make changes, we're very tight on what we're doing as we go forward.","David Vernon","So no organizational changes or sort of incentive changes around kind of how you're actually taking the product to market?","Lance Fritz","Yes. You've seen our organizational change when we added Jim into the team. And what we did was we took a great team and we made it all that much better, which is why you're hearing confidence from us in terms of what we're going to accomplish in 2019 and beyond.","And I'll tell you that we have good robust dissent debate, right, about what should we do in this situation. And the endgame is putting a filter on what it'd take to be the safest, best service product which is most reliable and consistent and most efficient railroad in North America. And those are the decisions that we're going to make.","So yes, we fight about it. And usually, it's a fight about which is going to get us faster, which is going to get us more, which is the better path, not should we even take this path.","David Vernon","Thanks for that. Maybe, Kenny, just switching gears real quick and a follow-up. In your discussions with steamship customers, are you hearing anything from the steamship lines about how they're going to be adapting their service schedule to North America with the introduction of IMO 2020 later in the year?","Kenyatta Rocker","Yes. So I was just in [Asia] a couple months ago. Right now, we haven't had any extensive conversations about that, but we're going to stay close to our customers and be engaged with them.","David Vernon","All right. Thanks.","Kenyatta Rocker","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ben Hartford","Yes, thanks. Maybe, Kenny, just a follow-up on the inbound ocean freight situation. Could you provide a little bit of context as to what the present environment is? We're hearing a lot about, obviously, pull forward. You mentioned that in your remarks, the inbound ocean freight. Data into the West Coast has been strong here. Warehouse capacity is tight.","So any sort of perspective, particularly post Chinese New Year, as we get into March and the spring ramp what type of activity do we see? Do we see transloading activity and domestic intermodal pick up in a low and - on the international intermodal side? And how much of a volume risk do you see post Chinese New Year given the pull forward that we are seeing at the present time? Thanks.","Kenyatta Rocker","Yes. So thanks for that. We definitely saw it in the fourth quarter, as I alluded to in my earlier comments. As we're talking to our largest customers now and as you probably have read in the press release, there's still some strong volume out there, and we do see that.","Based on the pull ahead, there's also some of that with the spring deal on the retail side. And we're going to just continue to stay close to our customers to see how volume shakes out.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey. Thanks, everyone for getting my question here. I know it's been a long call, so I'll just keep to one. But Lance, I guess, if we look back at the recent history at Union Pacific, your other West Coast rail peers have really outgrown, and specifically CN.","So I guess - and I feel like Union Pacific has always had more of a balanced plan on margins, pricing and volume. With the transition to more of a scheduled railroad, does this create a lot of opportunities to maybe have targeted expansion with your customers? Or should we be thinking volume is more in the cars looking ahead?","Lance Fritz","Yes. Thank you for the question, Brandon. So the way we think about it is our Unified Plan 2020 is all about consistent, reliable service, better service, which our customers are starting to see and we're going to grow on that. And the most efficient service, generating the best returns because we do think we should be in the lead or with the leaders of the pack in that sense.","I anticipate that customer service product, coupled with the work that Lynden's team and IT have been doing with sales and marketing on the experience and targeted technology investments towards an enhanced customer experience, that makes us more attractive than competition in the marketplace, whether it's truck or another railroad.","So I do think, over time, we should have growth opportunity that presents itself to us that we don't have right now. But that's yet to be seen. That's the strategy, and we're intent on pulling that off on implementing that.","Brandon Oglenski","Well, thank you. Welcome back Jim.","Vincenzo Vena","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.","Bascome Majors","Hey, thanks for taking my question here. Jim, welcome back. First of all, you're coming in as an unquestionable change agent in a very large organization. Clearly, you have a tremendous amount of experience that suggests that this will be a successful foray much like your last ones. But inevitably, some of those decisions are going to be unpopular, and there's a lot of people at UP to object to them.","How do you get -- or how did you get the conviction that you had the leeway you need from the rest of the management team and the board to make the tough decisions that you're inevitably going to make over the next couple years? And if you could just talk a little bit about that process and how you got comfort level with taking this role, I think that would be really helpful? Thanks.","Vincenzo Vena","Bascome, thanks for the question, and nice to hear your voice again. So when you make a decision to change and come back to work, Lance and I spent a considerable amount of time, and the same thing with Rob and with Tom, to go over and make sure that the vision was aligned with what we need to do to be able to deliver and be able to take this company to where it should be.","So at the end of it, I would not have come on board if I wasn't comfortable that everybody -- and it wasn't a push to get them to have the same goals and objectives and understanding what we had to do to get there. So that was the easiest part. So you communicate, talk before. And we both agreed that, listen, it's what the goals and objectives are.","I would -- if I was worried about the decision-making with the board and with Lance or anybody else in the company, I would've stayed at home. I would have done something else. I'm not worried about that. And so that was the process that we took, Bascome.","Bascome Majors","Thank you. Welcome back.","Vincenzo Vena","Appreciate it. Looking forward to the next few years.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I will turn the floor back to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments.","Lance Fritz","Well, thank you, Rob, and thank you all for your questions. We're looking forward to talking with you again in April and going over what our progress is at that point.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time."],"21287":["Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 18, 2012  8:45 AM ET","Executives","John J.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you. Mr. Koraleski, you may begin.","John J. Koraleski","Thank you, Rob. And good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me here in Omaha today are Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer; Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Lance Fritz, our Executive Vice President of Operations.","Union Pacific achieved an all time record quarter, generating an earnings milestone of $2.19 per share, an increase of 18% compared to the third quarter of 2011.","Despite a 12% decline in coal volumes and significantly weaker steel and scrap metal markets, we generated best-ever financial results this quarter across the board.","We achieved solid core pricing gains, we managed our network efficiently and we delivered on the benefits of our diverse franchise with growth in many of our other markets.","In addition, our focus on providing safe, efficient, high-quality service is reflected in the substantial achievements made this quarter in both employees' safety and customer satisfaction.","Putting it all together, we're creating value for our customers and we're driving increased financial returns for our shareholders.","So with that, we're going to get started this morning. We'll start off with Eric Butler. Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Thanks, Jack, and good morning. Let's start with a look at customer satisfaction, which came in at 94 for the quarter. It's up 3 points from third quarter last year, and it sets a new best-ever mark, topping the 93 received in the first 2 quarters earlier this year. We appreciate customer recognition of the strength of our value proposition, and we're working to make it even stronger.","In the third quarter, volume came in at about flat versus last year as the diversity of our franchise provided enough opportunities for growth to offset volume declines in 3 of the groups. Chemicals and Automotive continued to lead the way with very strong growth, and Intermodal was also up. Offsetting that good news was continued weakness in Coal and Ag and the first down quarter this year for Industrial Products as the global steel markets softened. The Coal decline continues to have a significant impact on overall volume. Setting Coal aside, the other 5 groups were up 3%.","Core price improved 5%, but with the lower fuel surcharge offsetting expanded fuel surcharge coverage, average revenue per car grew 4%. The combination of flat revenue and improved average revenue per car pushed freight revenue to the $5 billion mark for the first time.","Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 groups. Ag Products revenue was down 4% as the 2% drop in volume combined with the mix driven 2% decline in average revenue per car. Third quarter saw a record low UP grain shipments, with the decline driven by weak corn volume. Corn shipments were off due to reductions in livestock feeding, increased feeding from local crops that were less likely to move rail and a decline in ethanol production that impacted volume to forward ethanol plants. Record soybean shipments in September, a result of strong world demand, only partially offset the weakness in corn.","Grain products shipments also declined, down 7%, largely driven by ethanol and DDGs. Ethanol volume was down 12%, with producer's margins under pressure due to reduced demand for gasoline, lower exports and higher corn costs. DDGS fell 28% with an increased consumption by feeders close to the point of production, favoring movement by truck.","Food & Refrigerated shipments again provided some good news, growing 9%, with import beer, barley and canned goods leading the way.","Automotive volume grew 13%, which combined with the 2% improvement in average revenue per car produced the 15% increase in revenue. Growth rates in auto production and sales remained strong in the third quarter, driven by pent-up demand and improved credit availability. The average age of cars on the road remains high by historic standards, and consumers are replacing them with new, more fuel efficient and technologically equipped models. For the quarter, UP finished vehicles shipments increased 13% and parts volume grew 12%.","Chemicals volume grew 18%, which combined with the slight mix driven decline in average revenue per car to produce a 17% increase in revenue. Petroleum carloads were up 95%, with continued robust growth in crude oil where volume increased 300%. Plastics shipments grew 8%, supported by increased market demand and new business.","Industrial Chemicals and LPG again posted solid gains. And fertilizer shipments were up 1%, the first quarterly growth that we've seen this year.","Now turning to Coal. You could see from the chart of weekly loadings that volumes picked up from the second quarter levels as expected, but continued to tracked below last year. Low natural gas prices and high stockpiles continue to challenge the coal market, and as a result, our volume was down 12%. That comparison was made a little tougher by the boost last year as volume got from the makeup of flood impacted shipments. Revenue declined 5% as the 9% improvement in average revenue per car only partially offset the drop in volume.","Southern Powder River Basin coal shipments reflected a soft demand, with tonnage down 13%. Also contributing to the decline was the continued impact of 2 contract losses last year, which more than offset business wins.","While Colorado\/Utah coal faces the same challenges in the U.S. market, demand for this high BTU coal in the international market led to increased shipments to Europe and Mexico, driving tonnage up 2%.","Industrial Products revenue grew 2% as the 4% improvement in average revenue per car overcame a 2% decline in volume. Although overall drilling activity has slowed, growth to new sands facility and continued expansion of horizontal drilling, which requires more sand per well for frac-ing, drove an 11% increase in our nonmetallic minerals shipments. Our rock shipments were up 6%, with strong demand into the Eagle Ford Shale play and construction activity in the Houston area. The housing market also continued to show some signs of life, boosting lumber shipments to 12%. Unfortunately, the strong shelling in those markets was offset by declines in steel and scrap, export ore and hazardous waste.","Export scrap steel shipments to the Pacific Rim have declined as global steel demand has softened, and the slowdown in drilling activity has slowed the rapid growth in shipments by drillers that we saw earlier this year. As a result, steel and scrap shipments declined 11%.","Production issues at the mine led to a significant drop in our export iron ore move, driving a 31% decrease in metallic minerals shipments. The iron ore shipments recently resumed, and we expect a slow return over the coming months.","Finally, as in prior quarters this year, a ramp down in government funding impacted our uranium tailings move, leading to a 35% decline in hazardous waste shipment.","Intermodal revenue grew 8% as a 7% improvement in average revenue per unit combined with the 1% increase in volume.","With the economic recovery continuing its slow pace, retail has proceeded cautiously in the third quarter. As expected, that produced a muted peak season, with our third quarter international volume up 1%. Continued success converting highway business to rail, both in containers and trailers, puts domestic Intermodal volume up 1%.","Let me close with the look at what we see for the fourth quarter. While you can probably find support for a wide range of economic scenarios, we expect the economy to at best hold steady, and it wouldn't be a surprise to see some slight weakening as we move toward year's end. Given that, here's what we see for each of our businesses over the next few months, both the good news and the challenges.","As we've seen with strong September loadings, world demand for soybean and soybean meals should give Ag and export opportunity in our refrigerated and beer business should continue to grow. Unfortunately, the diminished corn crop is expected to impact opportunity in both export and domestic markets, and we expect to see third quarter challenges that dampened ethanol and DDGS to continue. As a result, Ag will likely be down in the low single-digit range.","Seasonally adjusted auto sales in September hit 14.9 million, the highest level since March 2008 despite lower incentives offered to purchasers compared to last year and the previous month. We take that as an encouraging sign that the auto industry momentum will carry through the fourth quarter.","Crude oil should continue to drive Chemicals growth, and most other chemicals markets are expected to continue the solid performance we've seen throughout the year.","Export demand is a bright spot for Coal, but low natural gas prices and high stockpile levels should keep overall Coal volume tracking below last year, with the decline expected to be in the low- to mid-teens.","Although the pace has slowed, shale energy-related growth should continue in Industrial Products, with the softening in the global steel market expected to continue to be a challenge.","International Intermodal should stay ahead of last year, and we expect continued success converting Highway business to rail in domestic Intermodal.","Put it all together, and the fourth quarter will look likely much like the third. While the diversity of our franchise will help offset the challenges, we will again look to expected price gains to drive revenue growth.","With that, I'll turn it over to Lance.","Lance M. Fritz","Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Let's start with safety. Year-to-date, we've achieved an all-time record low reportable personal injury rate, 10% better than last year through 3 quarters. The improvement accelerated in the third quarter, which was 23% better than last year's third quarter.","Moving to rail equipment incidents or derailments. Our year-to-date reportable rate improved 1% compared with 2011. While not visible in this number, we have made progress in our focus area of yard and industry track derailments.","In public safety, the grade-crossing incident rate increased 15% year-to-date. The combined effects of higher rail traffic in the South, which has more great crossing density than our overall network, and our growth in highway commercial traffic has increased our grade-crossing incident exposure.","On the positive side, we've made progress in isolating high-risk areas and have taken steps to improve or remove crossings of concern. And we continue to focus on community support and driver behavior to address this increased risk.","Our safety strategy helps keep our network strong and resilient, and as a result, our network remains fluid and continues to operate efficiently.","During the quarter, Hurricane Isaac disrupted operations in the eastern portion of our network. We were well-prepared and sustained little damage, and quickly restored operations. In comparison to last year's drought, the weather impact this quarter was minor.","In addition to milder weather, the operating team adapted the TE [ph] plan, locomotives and crews to manage shifts in mix including growth in manifest and premium volumes in the South. In Texas and Louisiana, we are effectively utilizing the existing infrastructure and building new capacity. As a result, velocity improved 6% to 26.1 miles per hour.","Our service scorecard illustrates UP's customer value proposition. The local operating teams continue to provide great service as reflected by Industry Spot & Pull, which tied the second quarter record of 95%. The third quarter Service Delivery Index, a measure of how well we are meeting overall customer commitments, also improved from 2011 levels.","While the UP team is successfully managing the carload surge in the South, we have growth capacity in other parts of the system with about 500 employees furloughed and around 870 locomotives in storage.","Moving on to network productivity. Record low third quarter slow order miles were down 35% from last year. Our network is in excellent shape, reflecting the investment in replacement capital that has hardened our infrastructure and reduced service failures.","Moving to the upper right, car utilization improved 6% year-over-year and reflects the improvement in network velocity and fluidity.","In the lower left, Intermodal train lengths grew to an all-time quarterly record of 176 boxes per train, improving 2% on a 1% increase in Intermodal volumes compared to 2011. And holding our own in manifest train lengths is noteworthy given that much of the manifest growth occurred in the South, which is the most train size constrained area of our network.","The chart in the lower right demonstrates our team is effectively leveraging volumes through UP's extensive manifest terminal infrastructure to generate a 2% improvement in the number of cars switched per employee day compared to last year. We've used the UP way to reduce variability on our operation while increasing the role every employee place on their work teams. Employee engagement is an important part of our operating strategy and has had a significant impact. Our employees are bringing their expertise to bear on standardizing their work and removing variability.","To expand a bit more on growth in the South, third quarter volumes in the South were up 5% versus last year and up 6% year-to-date. In fact, traffic in the South is back to pre-recession volumes. We've met the challenge with agility, repositioning horsepower and manpower to adapt to shifting demand. We've adjusted car routings to leverage available terminal capacity and modified train starts to maintain fluid operations and to increase local service frequency.","In addition, the capital investments we continue to make in the South are generating an excellent return and are having a positive impact. They support our diverse book of business, including increased shale related volumes, growing Mexico and Intermodal business and export grain shipments to the Gulf.","So with that, we remain positive on our operating outlook for 2012 and our ability to achieve network improvements on various fronts. A more mature total safety culture, stronger relationships with local communities and improved infrastructure position us well to achieve our goal of another record safety year. We will provide customers with a value proposition that supports growth, with high levels of service. And we are well-positioned to react to dynamic shifts in volume while generating productivity, and to invest a record amount of capital that generates attractive returns.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert M. Knight","Thanks, Lance, and good morning. Let's start by summarizing our third quarter results. Operating revenue grew 5% to an all-time quarterly record of $5.3 billion, primarily driven by core pricing gain. Operating expense totaled $3.6 billion, increasing 1%. Operating income totaled $1.8 billion, a 13% increase and a best-ever quarterly performance.","Below the line, other income totaled $28 million, up $11 million compared to 2011. Interest expense of $137 million was down 4% versus last year, driven by lower average interest rates. Income tax expense increased to $635 million, mostly driven by higher pretax earnings. Net income was up 15% versus 2011, setting an all-time best for any quarter. The outstanding share balance declined 3%, reflecting our share repurchase activity. These results drove a best-ever quarterly earnings record of $2.19 per share, an 18% increase versus last year.","Turning now to our top line. Freight revenue grew 4%, topping the $5 billion mark this quarter. Volumes were down slightly, about 0.5 point. The revenue mix impact was flat-ish year-over-year. Growth in higher ARC shale related moves was offset by lower steel and scrap shipments, in addition to shorter length of haul moves including stone.","In addition, rising fuel prices throughout the quarter resulted in a negative lag impact on our fuel recovery, creating a headwind of roughly 1% in freight revenue. As you may recall, we benefited from a tailwind on fuel recovery in the third quarter last year.","Similar to the first half, we saw the benefit from renegotiated legacy contracts, with a meaningful step up in fuel surcharge coverage, offsetting the 1% fuel recovery headwind and contributing roughly $0.05 in earnings per share compared to 2011.","In addition, we achieved solid core pricing gains of 5%, which was a key contributor to record profitability this quarter. The 0.5 point improvement from the second quarter pricing gains resulted from the sequential uptick in our coal volumes.","Moving on to the expense side. Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which was about flat with last year. Lower volume, reduced new hire training costs and solid operations mostly offset labor inflation. And you'll recall that last year in the third quarter, we incurred about $18 million of drought-related labor expenses, making for an easier comp this year.","Workforce levels increased 1.5% in the quarter compared to 2011, driven primarily by increased capital and positive train control activity.","Slide 23 shows fuel expense, which totaled $880 million, decreasing $36 million versus last year. Lower volumes and a lower consumption rate drove the reduction in fuel expense.","The average diesel fuel price of $3.19 per gallon was basically flat with last year. However, we saw fuel prices rise substantially throughout the quarter.","Charting out fuel prices on a monthly basis, this graph illustrates the negative lag impact that we discussed on the fuel surcharge side.","Purchased Services & Materials expense increased 7% to $542 million due to the higher contract expenses incurred by our logistic subsidiaries. The revenue generated from these expenses is reflected on our Other Revenue line.","Locomotive and freight car repair expense also increased this quarter, driven by increased contract expenses, material usage and inflation costs.","Depreciation expense increased 10% to $447 million, mainly driven by increased capital spending. Looking at the full year 2012, we expect depreciation expense to be up around 9% compared to 2011.","Slide 25 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $300 million, up 2% from 2011. Growth in Automotive and Chemical volumes drove an increase in short-term freight car rental expense, which was partially offset by lower locomotive and freight car lease expense.","Other expenses came in at $200 million, down $7 million compared to 2011. It was a bit better than what we had projected back in July, in part due to lower than expected volumes. Lower equipment and freight damage expense, as well as other cost control measures, also contributed to the decrease. These reductions more than offset the higher property tax and personal injury expenses. And as Lance just showed you, we continued to see improvements in our safety performance. But remember, our comp was more difficult this quarter due to a more favorable prior year adjustment in the third quarter of 2011. For the fourth quarter, we expect the other expense line to be similar to the third quarter results, barring any unusual item.","Now let's turn to our operating ratio performance. We achieved an all-time best quarterly operating ratio of 66.6%, improving 2.5 points compared to last year and nearly 0.5 point better than our previous record set last quarter. Our performance highlights the positive impact of core pricing gains, growth in attractive new business and continued focus on productivity initiatives, which more than offset the 0.5 point headwind on fuel recovery versus last year.","Union Pacific's record earnings drove solid free cash flow of $640 million year-to-date, which reflects $625 million more in capital spending and a 42% increase in cash dividend payments versus 2011.","In addition, cash from operations of $4.4 billion dollars includes more than $450 million in higher cash tax payments driven by the catch-up of prior year's bonus depreciation programs and a lower bonus depreciation rate in 2012 versus 2011.","Our balance sheet remains strong, supporting our investment grade credit rating. At quarter end, our adjusted debt to cap ratio was 40.2%.","We continue to make opportunistic share repurchases, which play an important role in our balanced approach to cash allocation. In the third quarter, we bought back 3.1 million shares at an average purchase price of around $122 per share. Year-to-date, we've repurchased almost 11 million shares averaging around $114 per share.","Combining dividend payments and share repurchases, we've returned over $2 billion to our shareholders year-to-date, up more than 27% compared to last year. Looking ahead, we have about 17.1 million shares remaining under our current authorization program which expires March 31, 2014. That's a recap of our third quarter results.","Closing out the year, we're all mindful of the potential financial cliff, consumer sentiment and global economy driving uncertainty in the marketplace. That said, we'll play the hand that the economy deals us. We'll continue to be nimble and agile, aligning resources with demand.","With respect to the fourth quarter, we're facing by far the toughest comparison for any quarter that we've seen this year on a number of fronts. With the additional challenges of coal down in the low- to mid-teens, lower Ag shipments and weakness in steel and scrap moves, overall volume in the fourth quarter will likely be flat to modestly negative compared to last year. Yield could also create a headwind again if prices remain at their current high levels.","Although our fourth quarter operating ratio will likely be challenged by higher fuel prices and potentially lower volumes, we're confident that solid core pricing gains and our ability to leverage our diverse franchise will drive at least a sub-70 operating ratio again this quarter. Combine that with our 68% operating ratio year-to-date which was achieved with flat volume, it's safe to say that we're well on our way to outpace a full year sub-70 operating ratio for the first time in our history and to achieve record earnings again this year.","Going forward, we remain positive on the longer-term prospects and our ability to generate increased shareholder returns. We look forward to discussing these opportunities with you at our Investor Day conference in Dallas later this month.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Jack.","John J. Koraleski","Well, thanks, Rob. And as Rob said, as we look out over the next several months, the political and financial challenges in the United States and abroad have increased the economic uncertainty. In this environment, we're going to continue to be agile, just like we were in the third quarter; we'll adapt to changing market conditions; and we'll leverage our diverse franchise. But longer term, we are very positive about future prospects for the Union Pacific.","We continue to make strategic investments that strengthen and enhance the franchise, supporting future business opportunities. Going forward, we remain confident in our ability to provide excellent service, increase customer value and generate strong returns for our shareholders.","So with that, let's open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Scott Group of Wolfe Trahan.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So one for, I'm not sure, Jack or Eric, on the coal side, so can you give us just a sense on where stockpiles are with your customers? And as you think about coal volumes next year, I understand another big decline on fourth quarter, but when you look out to next year with gas prices where they're at, what are you hearing from customers and about maybe switching back to coal with gas at $3.50? Directionally, what are you thinking for coal volumes next year? And if there's any color also you can give with respect to pricing and the legacy contracts next year if there is less upside given kind of the structural issues with coal that you see out there.","John J. Koraleski","Okay, Scott, we'll let Eric take a shot at that. Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Let me talk about stockpiles first. I think the industry stockpile number is somewhere around 20 days above normal. If you dissect the eastern versus the western utility, I think you'll see a significant difference. We think, in our serving area, most of our customers are seeing stockpiles about 5 to 10 days above normal, that's significantly lower than what the likely stockpiles are in the east. There's a lot of uncertainty in the market in terms of coal market share versus natural gas and other sources. Certainly, as the price of natural gas increases, that makes it more favorable for coal, and so the futures market for the price of natural gas is going up, and logically, that should make it more favorable for coal. A lot of uncertainties out there, a lot of uncertainties in terms of the current utilities have put in, agreements to use natural gas for a period of time. So over the long-term, if natural gas goes up, coal improves its competitiveness against natural gas.","John J. Koraleski","Yes. And I think Scott, as you think about it, your question about pricing, we're not going to get into the details of it. But I can tell you right now, we are not straying away from our strategy which is to price to reinvestable levels. And if we can't get to reinvestable levels, we'll walk away from the business. And we've stayed strong with that. It's paid a great -- a bit benefit for us overall. And we're still -- that's where our head is. We'll win some, we'll lose some. We feel very good about our capability to take legacy contracts, bring it up to market levels, and that's where we're going to stay.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to ask you a bit about the trend you see in crude oil. I think through the year, you've had some capacity, I think some receiving terminal capacity that's come on that has given you step ups in your crude oil activity. What do you think the near term view would be on crude oil? Do you see a further step up in fourth quarter or would you see kind of stability the next couple of quarters relative to what you had in the third quarter?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","We're not giving volume guidance for crude oil, but we are seeing -- we have seen a ramp-up throughout the year, as you mentioned, and there are investments that are continuing to be made, particularly at St. James. We think as the investments come online, that provides the capacity for growth. And we will see ourselves being able to continue to take advantage of the growth opportunity.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And I guess as a second question or a follow-up. Rob, you've seen some, I think, favorable effects this year, probably productivity, but also I think maybe contract-related in terms of some of the benefit expenses on the employee costs, sort of, per worker. And I wonder if you could get some commentary looking maybe to 2013, would you expect some of those effects to continue or do you think the inflation on a per worker basis is likely to step up a bit?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. Tom, I think, generally speaking, that the trends you're seeing right now should continue. And just to kind of elaborate a little bit, our labor line inflations, we'll call around 3%, but we challenge ourselves every year to offset 100% of inflation with productivity. We don't always get 100%, but we strive to get at least half -- offset half of the inflation with productivity initiatives. So that mindset will not change as we head into 2013.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Rob, in your remarks in the first and second quarters, you noted the negative impact on pricing from the loss of coal because, if I remember correctly, you repriced a fair amount. I realized there was a sequential improvement, but was it still a negative hit in the third quarter given how much coal was down?","Robert M. Knight","It depends on what you're comparing it to, Bill. What I pointed out is that -- and you're exactly right, in the second quarter -- just to remind everybody what we said, in the second quarter, we reported 4.5% core price, and of course, the way we measure price, frankly, the most conservative way I can think of measuring it, is an all-in yield calculation against our entire book of business. And we said that, that second quarter 4.5% core price was negatively impacted by the falloff in coal volumes to the tune of about 0.5 point. What we then saw in the third quarter was as coal volumes still below last year, but coal volumes sequentially improved from the second quarter, that picked up about 0.5 point. So if you looked at the difference between the 4.5% in the second quarter and the 5% that we just reported in the third quarter, that variation is driven largely by that increase in coal. So to your point, we're still not running the same levels of volumes that we ran last year but I didn't put a number around that, but it clearly was a negative impact versus had we run 36 trains per day out of the Powder River Basin, for example.","John J. Koraleski","The interesting thing about that, Bill, is in the tough coal environment, as Rob said, we're conservative in terms of our outlook on or how we calculate the price. What happens when the calendar flips is we now go year-over-year and we won't see the full potential of that pricing show up as core price, but where you'll see it is on our operating ratio and our bottom line improvements.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Meaning, that as coal -- if coal came back next year?","John J. Koraleski","Absolutely.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","But you would still show it as core price, I think, right? That it would grow if that business comes back at higher prices, no?","John J. Koraleski","It's a year-over-year comparison. So for the legacy business that we repriced this year, that becomes the new base for next year. And so, what you'll see is just the incremental increase from next year over this year. You won't see the full benefit of the step-up in core price. Where you'll see it is in the operating ratio and in the bottom line improvements margin.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just maybe a question on incremental margins. You guys have done a really nice job for the last couple of quarters with incremental margins even in the absence of volume. As you look out to the next quarter or 2 in a kind of flat or maybe modestly negative environment, can you sustain that type of incremental margins just given how strong the core pricing is? I mean, how should we think about that a little bit in 4Q and then even maybe into 1Q?","John J. Koraleski","Rob, why don't you take that?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. I mean, you're exactly right, Chris. We've turned in fabulous incremental margins and really what will -- what would drive that as much as anything is the volume swings that can occur from quarter-to-quarter. But we're focused, as I've said before, on core pricing gains, productivity initiatives. And to get to our 65% to 67% OR guidance that we have out there by full year 2015, it assumes that we'll get 50%-ish or better incremental margins from here to there. And so, we aren't giving specific quarter-by-quarter incremental margins, but that -- you can take that to mean we're going to continue to be as focused on all of those initiatives that help drive those incremental margins between now and then and then beyond that.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just switching gears onto the pricing side, just when you think about the Intermodal market and obviously a lack of a beginning of a peak so far, how do you think about the pricing dynamic and the competition with truck, I mean, has there been any pressure on that as we moved into October or even in the third quarter for that matter?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","We still are hugely excited about our Intermodal strategy. We think there's lots of upside in terms of conversion from truck to rail. We believe our rail value proposition has a value proposition to truck and over the road moves. And we're committed to pricing to the market and ensuring a reinvestable return. And our outlook in terms of the opportunities for conversion and the value associated with that remains.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.","Erin Lytollis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is Erin Lytollis in for Walter. Just on the Intermodal again, what would you characterize as the addressable market for truck load conversions within your network area? Can you provide some color around that?","John J. Koraleski","Anne, in the past, what we've said is as we looked out at the potential truck market, that would be susceptible to rail conversion in the west. It's about 11 million annual truck load benefit. It's a really big number. So we have a lot of opportunity there. Eric, do you want to expand on that?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. The number as a whole is very large, and what we do is we narrow that down to the potential volume moving within a radius of our Intermodal ramps, both on the origin and the destination side. And if you kind of narrow that down and look at what we think -- what portion of that 11 million we think is really attainable, it's probably closer to a 3 million to 4 million number.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter, Bank of America.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But when you talk -- Eric, when you talk about the lost coal contracts, when do you loop those 2, and can you give an idea of -- if you're down low-double digits, what percent do those lost contracts represent?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","We don't talk about specific contracts with customers. I guess, I'm not sure.","John J. Koraleski","Hey, Ken, I think we're going to lap those contracts in January. The ones from this year that we lost, we'll lap that in January.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I know we're not talking about specific contracts, but can you give us an idea of what the run rate would be?","Robert M. Knight","Ken, this is Rob. You're asking the run rate on volume or price or what? I'm not sure I understand.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","On the volume side, if you lost 2 and you're going to start lapping those, what the underlying run rate would be?","Robert M. Knight","We haven't given that guidance. I mean, it's really the factors will drive -- while we did have the loss of the contracts that we've referred to you before, of course, what will drive what our volumes actually end up doing, I realize this isn't exactly what you're asking, but what will drive that as Eric elaborated is the price of gas. Weather is a huge driver in terms of what our volumes will be in the coal business. And last year, recall, we had a very mild winter. We started the year off with very mild weather conditions. And so, weather will be as big a determinant as any in terms of where the volumes are.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. If I can get my follow-up then on, in the south, you talked about Mexico cross-border -- can you talk about Mexico cross-border volumes and when you're done double tracking the Sunset Corridor?","John J. Koraleski","Sure. If we look at Mexico in the third quarter, our Mexico business was up about 6% compared to being flat for the rest of the network. The primary growth factor was Automotive business which is performing nicely certainly given the start rate that we saw in September at $14.9 million. So that's all good. If we look at the Sunset Corridor, we are not on an accelerated Sunset Corridor double tracking any longer. We don't really need that capacity as much as we did in the past, so we're finding that out on a logical basis, on a need basis. We'll probably complete somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 miles this year, which would put us somewhere over the 70% double tracked by the time we get to the end of this year. And Lance, do you have anything to add to that?","Lance M. Fritz","You've got all those numbers right.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays Capital.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Could I just come back to the fourth quarter outlook for a sub-70 OR. It just sounds like you're a little bit more cautious there. And if I look at the average performance of your company in the last 10 years, it's about flat from where we were in the third quarter. So are there some unique items here? I know few of the headwind, but it should be less of a headwind than it was in 3Q. So what could be driving that OR a little bit higher from the third quarter then?","John J. Koraleski","Brandon, we're not actually cautious. We think we'll have sub-70, and we think we'll have a great operating ratio for the year. Rob, do you want to expand on that?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. Just a couple of points. Your comment that the fuel shouldn't be as much of a headwind, I mean, that we'll see. We'll see what the fuel prices. How that actually plays out would be caution number 1. Number 2, as Eric walked through the pluses and minuses in each of the commodities, we -- there's a lot of uncertainty out there and we gave guidance here that the fourth quarter volumes will be flat to slightly down. And so those all will be factors. I mean, you're right. On a historical basis, you're 100% right. But as we head into the fourth quarter this year, we'll see how those other factors play out.","John J. Koraleski","The one added risk that we have, Brandon, for fourth quarter as you get into winter operations, and if we were to get dumped on with a major blizzard or something like that, we'd have to see what happens with that.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So maybe more cautious on the economy, but still delivering what you guys can, then?","Robert M. Knight","Absolutely, absolutely.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And can I just ask a follow-up on pricing then, because I think, it sounded like you're saying the core pricing comps could be down just a little bit from where they are this year next year, and is that because you don't have a lot of legacy to be repriced early in the year?","John J. Koraleski","Hey, Rob, why don't you take that?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. We previously, as you all have seen, shown sort of a pie chart, if you will, of legacy renewals that come up because that's dependent upon what the volumes actually turn out to be. But we've said that there's roughly $350 million of legacy revenue that we'll be competing for and repricing next year, which frankly, a lot of that's front end loaded. But we haven't given guidance specifically on what our pricing will look like next year with and without that legacy, other than to say that we're going to continue to have a mindset of reinvestability. We'd say it's going to be an inflation plus kind of pricing environment, but we haven't changed our view of and our expectations of what we expect to achieve on pricing.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Ceraso of Credit Suisse Group.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just wanted to ask a question about your expectations for Automotive. I understand sales have been strong, but is it fair to say that the comparisons on vehicles that are being produced than what you're carrying get notably tougher in the fourth quarter, so maybe we should expect a slower growth in Q4 than what you've seen year-to-date?","John J. Koraleski","Chris, we're kind of looking at each other here. We're expecting if the economy stays the way it's planned, the SARS rate in September of 14.9 million, that would give us some nice momentum going in, and we're still in October doing well on the Automotive business. Eric, do you have any view?","Eric L. Butler","No. I mean, the overall economic outlook, as I've said in terms of Automotive sales, is staying strong and recent SARS rate is still growing. I think the Global Insight in our Automotive industry is both projecting continued strong sales. And we have a huge Automotive franchise and we'll play in that and get the benefits of that.","John J. Koraleski","Our customer base is very positive, very interested in service and making sure that we stand tall in terms of providing equipment and great turnaround times, consistent and reliable. So it's a good outlook for us for the fourth quarter.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up about the peak season. Any comments about how that's shaping up and what you're seeing with regard to surcharges, are those sticking?","Robert M. Knight","The peak season, as we said, last quarter, we expected it to be muted, and it is muted. Our volumes in the third quarter, as we said, were up about 1%. October volumes, interestingly enough, month-to-date, you could see the public car loadings, they're up a little bit more. They're up about 3%, 4%. So the peak season is still muted. We are remaining focused on our strategy, and we're pricing for our value of our service. Our MCP program is still we think a great strategic advantage for us and we're going forward with it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question, I guess piggybacking way back on Tom Wadewitz's question on shale. I was curious in terms of how you're thinking about crude oil versus pipeline, obviously, a bigger issue in terms of takeaway from Bakken south to the Gulf, maybe less so Bakken East in terms of the interchanges as you head to eastern refineries. How should we think about the timeframe for some of that pipeline infrastructure supplanting the crude by rail opportunity that you have, what do you think your window is? And I mean in terms of the growth opportunity, how big a factor is that?","John J. Koraleski","Go ahead, Eric.","Eric L. Butler","Interestingly enough, you used the word supplanting. The oil companies have made huge investments, both in terms of infrastructure and in terms of railcars. And our view of the world is that people don't make those investments just for a short-term kind of swings and usage. So we think crude by rail is here to stay. We have a value proposition. It allows a lot of flexibility in terms of moving crude quickly to different destinations in terms of moving by rail versus moving by pipeline. There will be more pipelines that will be implemented, but we think crude by rail will play a role in the market for the foreseeable future.","John J. Koraleski","Yes. Correct me if I'm wrong, Eric, but what we see is pipelines are going to come in and that may slow our growth rate, so you won't be seeing a 300% year-over-year improvement in oil shipments like you saw this year, but we don't expect our oil shipments to go down.","Eric L. Butler","Right, that's accurate.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. And then, it's kind of a follow-up, more of a second question. But Jack, in terms of what you're seeing from the broader economy, I just want to reconcile, I mean, when I look at West Coast port volumes in September, when I look at what ISM did in terms of reaccelerating off of the summer, even airfreight data. The economic data looks like you got a little bit better, and you could argue politics there probably a little bit, but not when it comes to ports and airfreight. How do you reconcile that with what you guys and most of your competitors are saying you saw in the economy, and are you seeing any inventory restocking taking place that would be beneficial in terms of a flow-through here into Q4?","John J. Koraleski","Justin, so I'm going to give you Jack's view of the world and what I look at internally. So I kind of take my business and I say, okay, take the coal downturn off the table, take the shale business, set it aside because those really aren't the economic barometers. And to the level that I can, take out the global impact on the steel market because that was really the game changer, the difference point between third quarter and second quarter for us, and the rest of the business, things like lumber up 12%; things like the automobile business up 13%; rock business up 6%; domestic Intermodal which was a record for us last year, still trending higher again, so we're in all likelihood going to have a record performance again this year. That says that at this point in time, the consumers aren't really pulling their horns in and that the overall economic activity is kind of a slow growth, which is what we expected going into the year. And at this point in time, in our volume levels as we've gone into the fourth quarter, despite all the handwringing over the fiscal cliff and sequestration and all those other kinds of things in our fundamental kind of economic barometers. And also I should add to that, the Industrial Chemical business, which is all pretty solid for us. We're not in bad shape. The economy seems to be just kind of moving ahead in kind of a slow growth trajectory, and that's where we are.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research","I just wanted to ask a question with respect to the very strong growth you saw in your Logistics business in the quarter, just hoping you could give us a bit of an update on what's going on in that part of the business. And a comment directionally, if you would, on how the OR on that revenue compares versus freight revenue.","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","I'm assuming you're referring to our union -- all of the -- our subsidiary businesses, Union Pacific Distribution Services, our streamline subsidiary. As we look at where that fits in our strategy, those are huge leverage values for us in our strategy, those entities are really looking to provide in addition to rail services for our Autos customers, our Intermodal customers, other transload customers. And we continue to see upside opportunity for those value-added services.","John J. Koraleski","And when you look at that business, Cherilyn, it's not different than any of our other business. It's held to the same reinvestability standards, and that's how we look at those components as well. Rob, do want to add to that?","Robert M. Knight","Yes, I just want to add to that. As that -- and because we're expanding our services here, as Eric just outlined, which is a great value-add to our customers, but in terms of the precise margins that we gain on that, it's a good question, and it isn't as good a margin, but it's asset light business. So...","John J. Koraleski","It's for the railroad.","Robert M. Knight","Yes. I mean, it's great business for the railroad, yes, but in terms of -- it does -- the reality of it is, and it's a great business for us, we love it, but in terms of the incremental margins overall and our overall financials, it can put a little pressure on that. But that's okay for us because again overall, we're making the progress as an enterprise that we're making, and this is all value-added, helps our customers and helps our bottom line.","Eric L. Butler","Yes, those Logistics business are a core part of our growth strategy.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research","So for a 20%-plus growth in the quarter, that would have had at the margin some kind of a dampening impact on the -- both the OR and the incremental margin.","Eric L. Butler","Very little, but yes.","John J. Koraleski","Very little because, again, that business that moves on the railroad -- so we're distinguishing between the subsidiary company and the railroad, the business that moves on the railroad is at reinvestable levels.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Anthony Gallo of Wells Fargo.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Headcount growth has been outpacing gross ton-miles. Could you speak to what you expect for headcount growth? And within the gross ton-mile movements, how much of that is the mix versus or -- well, could you elaborate on what might be driving the changes in gross ton-miles?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. Let me talk about the headcount first. I mean, let me remind everyone what we've said, we expect our overall headcount to move with volumes. So if volumes are up, we expect headcount to move up, but not necessarily one-for-one because of productivity initiatives. Now what drove our increase in headcount this quarter with flat volume was, as they had pointed out, stronger capital programs and included in those capital programs was a Positive Train Control work. So if you look at the headcount increases, they're really kind of going towards those capital projects as opposed to per se volume today. As you look at the -- your question on the sort of the revenue ton-miles and gross ton-mile question, really the bottom line answer is mix. And what you're seeing is less coal volumes, which are heavier freight carloads for us, and more, for example, autos volumes, which are lighter, if you will, from a gross ton-mile perspective. So really the answer to that question is a mix.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess a related question, fuel consumption was down more than gross ton-miles were down, what's going on with fuel consumption as it relates to those miles?","John J. Koraleski","Lance, you want to handle it?","Lance M. Fritz","That C rate improvement is really just about traction in what we've talked about previously, which is, it reflects a fluid network. The better the network, the better our C rate, all else equal. Increased in continued traction with programs like Fuel Masters where we incent our engineers to run their trains in a fuel-efficient manner and the fuel efficiency of our locomotive fleet. So you see all of it getting traction in this quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Peter Nesvold of Jefferies & Company.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just want to make sure I'm capturing your coal expectations accurately. So coal started to decline for you in the first quarter, down 8% or so year-over-year, and it was down 17% year-over-year in 2Q. Does it seem reasonable to expect that maybe coal volumes flattened out for you by second quarter of '13, and maybe we'd have to assume $3 gas and kind of 1.5%, 2% GDP on that? Or do you think where inventory stockpiles are right now that we could see year-over-year declines through the end of '13?","John J. Koraleski","Yes, that's a really tough question for us to answer, Peter, because so much of it depends on weather, natural gas prices and all of those kinds of issues. Maybe, Eric, do you want to take a shot at that?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. There's a lot of uncertainty out there. We're looking at it closely, trying to evaluate what '13 is going to be. And as Jack said, there's a lot of factors, and we're looking at them and trying to get our arms around them.","John J. Koraleski","This is kind of reminiscent for me. A couple of years ago, we were at this time sitting on incredibly high stockpiles and thought we were going to be in trouble, and then we had one of the coldest winters on record and we saw those stockpiles dissipate very quickly, and we ended up having very strong coal loadings. So weather can have a big impact on us, and that certainly is a big point of uncertainty for us.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Could you tell us how much of the business is contractually committed for '13? Or how many -- what percentage of the business is renewed for '13 at the moment? How much remains?","John J. Koraleski","Sure, Ben. As we look at it right now, we have about 70% of our business that's already locked in place, and there's a 30% kind of a number that's out there. And as we look at that, that's pretty constant as we go throughout the year because of the way pricing takes its place and it's not all a year end, some things come up quarterly, different times of the year. So at any one point in time, we have about 70%, and I would say that's -- Eric, you want to add to that?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. And the 70% is really the percent of business that's under some kind of customer specific agreement. It's either a 1-year contract, multi-year contract, a shorter-term contract. The 30% is what's under our public agreement or tariff. And as Jack said, we have -- we're repricing all year long, throughout the year.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. And then back to a point that was made during the prepared remarks. Somebody had made the comment that 4Q will look like 3Q. I wanted to clarify what you were referring to, is that EPS, earnings, OpEx, something along those lines that you were referring to?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. I think, Ben, the reference that you're probably referring to was Eric's comments on the markets and the volumes that we're seeing because in his last slide, he went through sort of pluses and minuses within business group. But from a volume standpoint, we see sort of things continuing, and I further gave guidance on the fourth quarter volume that we've got to be flat to slightly negative.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So I should interpret it as volumes, not necessarily earnings?","Robert M. Knight","That's right.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Matt Troy of Susquehanna.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I was wondering if you could just give us an indication of how much of a percentage of your coal book of business ex-legacy is up for renegotiation next year. I would guess, just based on the average contract duration, it's something maybe 20%, 25%, but just maybe trying to frame that for what might be up for negotiation. And then secondarily, given the fact that this is the second time in, let's call it, half a decade where stockpiles have been challenged, now we've got nat gas very low, what might be changing? Where are you getting pushback or sensitivities in the negotiations with the utilities in terms of contract negotiations? Are you looking for concessions on take or pay, or liquidated damages? Where are the touch points in this, we'd call it, new era of coal we find ourselves in today?","John J. Koraleski","Okay, Matt. Hey, Rob, why don't you talk about the legacy and then we'll let Eric take the...","Robert M. Knight","Let me just say we're out of gate. We're not going to get into as much specific that you asked. I mean, you asked a lot of kind of specific questions, negotiating strategies and things like that, that we're going to probably be very general here in terms of your questions. But in terms of the legacy, if you look at our coal book of business, our contracts are 3 to 5 years, so as Jack said earlier, we're constantly renegotiating contracts. We've got both legacy renewals next year. And I refer you to the pie that we've used in the past in terms of how much legacy renewal, overall enterprise-wide that come up for renewal next year. But behind even that, then there's just always negotiations taking place throughout the year in our coal business, in all of our businesses for that matter, so there's nothing unusual there. But if we have 3- to 5-year contracts, then yes, call it 20%, 25% kind of level of business that's up for renewal every year.","Eric L. Butler","And in terms of negotiation, we've said before, our -- all negotiations are difficult negotiations. Our coal customers are very smart, savvy transportation providers, and they always negotiate every factor that they can negotiate, and they're always tough.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And I guess as a follow-up then. In terms of the threshold and switching threshold with natural gas in the low $3 range, is -- it would be nice to hear you folks say just given the periodic rumors you hear in the market that you remain committed to pricing at an inflation cost plus basis or have margin targets and would not be pricing to incent the movement of coal to bring it more competitive relative to that switching cost. The discipline is still there, is that fair?","John J. Koraleski","Matt, not only is that fair, but again, let me just kind of reiterate for you that we need to get our business, every carload that moves on Union Pacific at a reinvestable level, and if it's not, we will walk away from it. We've had a number of customers come to us and say, if we don't lower coal rates, they're going to go out of business. Unfortunately, if their businesses is dependent on the value of their transportation contract and not on their intrinsic product that they're producing, they're probably going to go out of business anyway. And we also have to be sensitive to all of our other coal customers that are paying us. So we take a very pragmatic approach. And we are absolutely committed to pricing to market. We are absolutely committed to bringing legacy up to market rates. We're absolutely committed to our reinvestability threshold. And we think when that's all said and done, we will outperform inflation in terms of our total pricing.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel, Nicolaus.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just was wondering about your comments with respect to the southern part of the network, could you just remind us how do you define the southern half of the network? Could you sort of review with us what's really driving that tremendous growth there, I guess you're back to where you were before the downturn? And then with respect to the comments about train length constraints in the South, have you contemplated, or are you, in fact, reallocating some capital dollars to relieve some of those constraints if in fact the growth down in that part of the world is sustainable here going forward?","John J. Koraleski","Sure, John. Lance, you want to handle those?","Lance M. Fritz","Sure. So John, the southern region for us is essentially east of El Paso to New Orleans and south of Kansas City. When we're talking about the South and significant growth, it's mostly about Texas and Louisiana, and it's mostly about shale-related activity or Industrial Chemicals or the Petro-Chem industry that's benefiting from low natural gas feedstocks. And when we talked about capacity constraints in train size length in the South, the short answer is yes, we do know where our bottlenecks are and we are investing capital where -- when we relieve those bottlenecks, we generate an excellent return. As well as, the South is just our most significant concentration of single track, and it's a significant concentration of manifest traffic at its terminals. And those things tend to retard train length. But net-net, John, as we look forward, we will stay ahead of any of those constraints that meaningfully impact the ability to get solid productivity on that traffic growth.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And then maybe just a follow-on question. With respect to the great strides you've made in improving network fluidity, could you attribute any of that improvement to the reduction in sort of the heavy tonnage coal traffic? Does that make it easier to run the rest of the network more fluidly? Or are you just on the same trajectory you've been for many years in terms of continuous improvement in network fluidity?","Lance M. Fritz","Yes, I wouldn't attribute it to a decrease in coal movements. As a matter fact, our coal network tends to be one of our most highly productive networks that we run. So it's actually a headwind depending on what measures you're looking at when coal declines. I would attribute the improvement to, as we've mentioned, effective capital investment, the UP way and the full engagement of all of our employees on improving their workplace and improving the productivity of their work. And we're seeing that pay off, and that's got a very long run rate.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I think you mentioned a response to an earlier question, the cross-border traffic at Mexico is up 6% primarily in Autos. Could you please comment on potential for increased Mexico Intermodal traffic given your, what, 6 intersections I think?","John J. Koraleski","Sure, Eric?","Eric L. Butler","We -- if you look at the improvement of the Industrial Production and manufacturing in Mexico, we think Mexico is going to be a huge growth opportunity for us, both on the Automotive side, on the carload side and the Intermodal side. We have 6 gateways, as you mentioned. We are working with both Mexican rail carriers, and we have great franchise lanes from those border points to the consumption markets in the U.S. So we continue to see Mexico and the outlook for our cross-border business as being one of our growth stories.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And maybe just as a follow-up, taking a step back, revenue to and from Mexico this year is probably just under $2 billion for Union Pacific. If memory serves you on about 26% or so of Ferromex, and this has been for more than a decade. What would make you interested in owning more than this share, and is there any structural barrier to greater ownership stake?","Eric L. Butler","Sure. Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. Keith, you're right, we own 26%, but it really is an investment. We have great partnership with the FXE, but if you look at our book of business, we interchange just as much, if not more, with the Kansas City, Southern Mexico. So we're agnostic, if you will, in terms of that relationship. And we're comfortable with that 26% ownership as it is. The other point I was going to just make about Mexico is, as you're pointing out, it is one of the strengths of our franchise. It's a differentiator between us and others in that we are the only railroad that crosses at those 6 border crossings. And if you look at our overall volumes, our Mexican business in the northbound and southbound is running about 6% positive volume growth versus our overall enterprise of being flattish in the third quarter. So it's outpacing our overall. And that's because of the great service relationship and the diverse franchise footprint that we have.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Sterne Agee.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask, if you looked at the changes in yield that were caused by product mix versus the changes in yield that may have been brought about by length of haul, whether it's carrying grain to the ports for export or chemicals a certain distance, what's your best guess at what the impact was to yield between the 2?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. Jeff, I'd say -- let me give you the mix answer because it really is a combination of things. Length of haul was down about 1% overall. But really in terms of kind of looking at the yield, it really is a mix within a mix story. I mean, if you look at each one of our commodity groups, there really is kind of a mix here. Mix, meaning length of haul within each commodity group and sometimes within each customer base. And our focus on repricing to reinvestability, there was mix within that in terms of what you saw in the coal business, for example. So I don't have a straight answer for you other than to say that overall, our length of haul was off about 1%.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Crissey with UBS.","Kevin Crissey - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm trying to reconcile what our utilities analyst is saying and some of the utilities have been saying in the West about the pricing that they're seeing from the rails relative to 2011 levels, kind of 25% decline in pricing overall, maybe not so much in the West or maybe it is. So I'm trying to reconcile that with the discussion of overall pricing and maybe with the -- some lost contracts. So have you seen -- how can we reconcile that with inflation plus pricing? And is it the length of contracts so that when we hit -- when we're lapping 2011, it's going to be -- you're going to see declining pricing at that point rather than today, and how is BNSF related to that?","John J. Koraleski","Well, Kevin, that's an interesting question from the perspective that, again, just to kind of start at a high level and reiterate, our goal is to get business to market levels and to get business up into reinvestable territory. That's our threshold. And obviously, our goal would be to go past the reinvestable level. So -- and in the event that you see us lose business, I think you could assume from that, that we could not meet that criteria and we were prepared to walk away from it because our franchise gives us plenty of opportunities to fill the gap and take advantage of the capacity to move other freight with other customers. So I don't know how you reconcile what your analyst is reviewing and what customers are telling them. Eric, maybe you want to add a little bit to that?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. I would say your question is a good one. We can't reconcile it either. So I mean, your question is a good one.","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. Can I just reiterate that we say, overall, we look at our enterprise, as Jack has said several times, we're looking at an inflation plus sort of pricing environment. And the other thing I would -- your question reminds me to say here is that we're well aware of some of the reports out there that you're referring to about a 25% reduction, that is not us, I mean we're not confirming that, that was a comment, and I think frankly, the way I interpreted that comment that I know others have picked up on was somebody had an incentive to make that comment based on what they expected as opposed to there being an absolute rate reduction at 25%. But I can assure you, that's not what's happening in our book of business.","Kevin Crissey - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. But let's say even if 25% was way out of the range of a real number, even if competitors were out there at a reduced rate, that wouldn't show up in the results really because maybe -- versus 2011, it's down, but versus the recontracting of 2007 pricing, it's probably still up, just not as up as much maybe people thought it would be. So would we see -- if that were the case, would we see a delay in the pricing affect because you're renegotiating 5-year old contracts?","Robert M. Knight","This is Rob. I would just -- Kevin, I would just say that you've asked sort of theoretical questions. Again, we're not going to confirm or debate what theoretically could happen. And again, we're not giving specific guidance on our pricing other than to -- by commodity, other than to say that overall, we expect positive pricing, reinvestability based -- market based, and we expect that to be inflation plus kind of pricing overall, like we've seen looking backwards.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein Research.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So Eric, just a quick question on the Chemicals business. We're obviously seeing a lot of projects on the whiteboard or in the planning stages for the Chemicals manufacturing industry. And I wanted to get a sense from you about when that might actually turn into some volume. Is it a '13 or a '14 type of thing as far as your industrial development team is kind of working with those customers to look at rail capacity?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, David, that's a good question. I think at the last quarterly release, what we talked about was with the relatively low natural gas prices, there were 6, 7, 8 large chemical companies that have announced expansions, particularly in the Gulf region, in our sweet spot. If you look at the ramp-up or the construction timeline for most of those, those are late '14, '15, '16 kind of timelines, which is I think what we talked about at our last earnings release.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. And just a quick follow-up, perhaps, Rob, could you let us know exactly what the fuel surcharge revenue line was for the quarter?","Robert M. Knight","Fuel surcharge revenue line was -- let me look that up here real fast -- around $630 million in the quarter.","Operator","Our last question is from the line of Brad Delco with Stephens.","A. Brad Delco - Stephens Inc., Research Division","The focus on Intermodal, I was wondering, could you guys provide any color on the commentary about pricing to reinvestable levels? How close are you to that on the Intermodal side? Or maybe asked a different way, has your pricing changed at all on a year-over-year basis, maybe on a relative basis to what kind of price increases you were looking at last year?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","We don't historically talk specifically about pricing by commodity group. If we look at our kind of historic Intermodal book of business, Intermodal historically has been priced at, call it, a 30% discount to truck. We think that our value proposition allows us to narrow that discount to truck, and that's part of our strategy that we're doing. And then if you look at the kind of the impact of the trucking industry, the regulations changes on drivers, increased fuel, their costs are going up. So as their cost goes up, that gives us additional headwind in terms of our value proposition. So we are narrowing the gap between the historical discounts that Intermodal has had to trucks.","A. Brad Delco - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And then maybe one quick follow-up. Any plans or color you could give on capacity additions as it pertains to containers and the fleet for next year?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","I think quite honestly at this point in time, we're looking at it, but we haven't made any decisions.","Robert M. Knight","That's right.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Koraleski for closing comments.","John J. Koraleski","Well, great. Before we wrap up this morning, just let me reiterate that we recognize there are uncertain economy issues out there, and it's going to bring us some challenges over the next several months, but we're actually very confident that our team is going to remain agile, just as we were in the third quarter. We're going to continue to leverage the opportunities of our diverse franchise. We continue to see strong pricing for the balance of this year, and I think we're going to have a very successful end to the year.","So thanks so much for joining us on the call today, and we look forward to seeing as many of you as we can in our Investor Day in Dallas at the end of this month.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may now begin.","Lance M. Fritz","Good morning everybody and welcome to Union Pacific's fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Cameron Scott, our Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rob Knight, Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015. This equates to $1.31 per share, which compares to $1.61 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Another quarter of solid pricing gains were not enough to offset the 9% decrease in total volumes. Carload volume declined in five of our six commodity groups with coal and industrial products down 22% and 16% respectively. Automotive continued to be a bright spot for us in the quarter with the volume up 8% versus 2014. ","On the cost side, we continued to adjust resources throughout the quarter and also made solid progress with our productivity initiatives. We will hear the team talk about some of the highlights here this morning. As a result of these efforts we achieved a quarterly operating ratio of 63.2%. We continue to be laser focused on running a fluid and efficient network while safely providing value added service to our customers and delivering solid returns for our shareholders. ","So with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Eric. ","Eric L. Butler","Thanks, Lance and good morning. In the fourth quarter, our volume was down 9%, with continued gains in automotive more than offset by declines in the other business groups. While we generated core pricing gains of 3.5%, but it was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharge and significant mix headwinds as average revenue per car declined 8% in the quarter. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 16% reduction in freight revenue.","Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups. Ag products revenue was down 12% on a 5% reduction and a 7% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain was down 12% in the fourth quarter. High worldwide production and a strong U.S. dollar reduced grain exports by 23%. Solid growth in domestic grain shipments partially offset the export decline. Grain products decreased 4% for the quarter driven primarily by softer export of soybean meal and DDG [ph] demand. ","Ethanol shipments were down 3% driven by lower exports. These declines more than offset a 14% increase that canola meal shipments due to another strong canola crop. Food and refrigerator product volumes were down 1% for the quarter as strength in the year was offset by declines in fresh and frozen food shipments.","Automotive revenue was up 1% in the fourth quarter as an 8% increase in volume was largely offset by a 6% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments were up 8% this quarter, driven by continued strength in consumer demand. 2015 annual sales of the U.S. were 17.5 million vehicles, levels last reached 15 years ago. This seasonally adjusted annual rate for the fourth quarter was 17.8 million vehicles, the fourth highest quarterly sales pace on record. On the parts side, strong vehicle production increases and a continued focus on over the row conversions to over 8% increase in volume. ","Chemicals revenue was down 7% for the quarter on a 2% reduction in volume and a 5% decrease in average revenue per car. Lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads continued to impact our crude oil shipments which were down 42% in the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting this decline was continued strength in the LPG markets including Propolene, Propane, and Bueten demand. Finally petroleum products volume was down 6% primarily due to weaker residual fuel oil shipments as a result of a slowing in China\u2019s production and export sectors. ","Coal revenue declined 31% in the fourth quarter on a 22% volume decline and 11% decrease in average revenue per car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 24% in the quarter as mild weather and low natural gas prices dampened coal demand. Temperatures in the fall was 3.3 degrees warmer than average and set a record for the lower 48 states. Coal inventory levels are 105 days through December, 39 days above normal, and 43 days above last December. ","Colorado, Utah tonnage was down 40%, driven again by soft domestic demand and reduced export shipments. Nationwide electricity generation by coal dropped from 37% market share in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 32% in 2015 as natural gas captured to share loss from coal. ","Industrial products revenue was down 23% and a 16% decline in volume and 8% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Reduced rig counts and shale drilling resulted in a 42% decline in minerals volume, primarily driven by a 52% decrease in frac sand car loadings. Metal shipments were down 27% from softening industrial production, reduced drilling activity, and a strong U.S. dollar. ","Specialized markets were up 7% in the quarter driven by increased waste shipments. Intermodal revenue was down 14% in the fourth quarter and a 7% lower volume and an 8% decrease in average revenue per unit. Full year 2015 domestic intermodal achieved its seventh consecutive year of record volume. However, our fourth quarter results were down slightly as continued highway conversions were offset by the discontinuation of Triple Crown business and sourcing shifts. ","International intermodal volume was down 12% in the quarter in a challenging market environment primarily due to market volume headwinds for several of our ocean carrier customers. Imports in the Trans Pacific strait remained sluggish due to weaker than expected domestic U.S. retail sales. ","Let's move to how we see our business shaping up for 2016. In Ag products we expect high global grain inventories and the strong U.S. dollar to have a continued impact on the export environment. Food and refrigerator should continue to see growth in import beer. We expect soybean meal to have another strong export year but we will likely fall short of the record level reached in 2015. ","Turning to autos we expect low interest rates and gasoline prices to continue to positively impact demand driving both finished vehicles and part shipments. However, we are cautious as the auto sales sustaining these record levels. We expect the coal market will continue to be dampened by low natural gas prices and high inventory levels. As always weather conditions will continue to influence demand. ","In chemicals we expect most of our markets to remain solid in 2016 with particular strength in LPG markets. Low crude oil prices and unfavorable spreads will continue to present significant headwinds for crude by rail shipments. Fertilizer shipments will also be impacted by grain export headwinds. ","In industrial products, low crude oil prices will also challenge our minerals and metals volumes. We expect our lumber franchise to grow with demand from the slowly strengthening housing market and demand for construction products in specialized markets should be solid. ","In intermodal we anticipate highway conversions will continue to drive domestic intermodal volumes. However, high retail inventories and sluggish retail demand are expected to mute growth in our international intermodal volumes. ","Wrapping up, while the strong U.S. dollar, low energy prices, and sluggish retail sales will continue to drive headwinds and uncertainty in some of our markets, we are optimistic in others. Mexico continues to be an opportunity driven by energy reform and Mexico's autos manufacturing market. ","With our growth depending on both the national and global economy we will continue to strengthen our customer value proposition and develop new business opportunities across our diverse franchise. With that I will turn it over to Cameron. ","Cameron A. Scott","Thanks Eric and good morning. Starting with our safety performance of our full year reportable personal injury rate improved 11% versus 2014 to a record low of 0.87. Successfully finding and addressing risk in the work place is clearly having a positive impact as we achieve annual records on our way to an incident free environment. ","With respect to rail equipments incidents or derailments, our reportable rate increased 14% to 3.42, driven by an increase in yard and industrial reportables. While our reportable rate took a step backwards in 2015, we are confident that our strategy aimed at eliminating human factor incidents and hardening our infrastructure will lead to improved results going forward. ","In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 3% versus 2014 to 2.28. We continue to focus on reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns to drive improvements in the future. ","Moving onto network performance, after making a step function improvement in our operating metrics during the third quarter we have continued to make solid incremental progress. As reported to the AAR, velocity and terminal dwell improved 13% and 5% respectively when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Record fourth quarter velocity of 27 miles per hour was at the best ever at a level of volume handled during the quarter. ","In fact the last quarter we ran at this velocity was six years ago when our network was handling 7% fewer car loads. The strength and resiliency of our network allowed us to mitigate the impact from flooding events in the Eastern portion of our network during late December thereby minimizing service delays to our customers. But while we have made significant improvement in our metrics we know there is still more work to do as the team continues a relentless approach to further improve service and reduce cost. ","While we noted back in October that our resources were more closely in line with demand at that time, further declines in volume prompted us to make additional resource adjustments in the fourth quarter. In addition to adjusting to lower volumes, our improvement in network performance has translated into fewer recruits, lessening resource demands of our network. ","By the end of the year, we had around 3,900 TE&Y employees either furloughed or an alternative work status compared with 2,700 at the end of the third quarter. Overall, our total TE&Y workforce was down 18% in the fourth quarter versus the same period in 2014. Around half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline. Our active locomotive fleet was down 13% from the fourth quarter of 2014. As always, we'll continue to adjust our workforce levels and equipment fleet as volume and network performance dictates. ","In addition to efficiently rightsizing our resource base, we also realized gains on other productivity initiatives such as train length. While we are unable to overcome the volume decline within intermodal, we ran record train lengths in all other major categories. We were also able to generate efficiency gains within terminals as productivity initiatives led to record terminal productivity even with an 8% decline in the number of cars switched. ","In addition to process improvements, capital investments have also enhanced our ability to generate productivity and increased the fluid capabilities of our network. In total, we invested $4.3 billion in our 2015 capital program. For 2016, we are targeting around $3.75 billion pending final approval by our Board of Directors. More than half of our planned 2016 capital investment is replacement spending to harden our infrastructure, replace older assets and to improve the safety and resiliency of the network.","The plan includes 230 locomotives as part of a previous purchase commitment. This commitment wraps up with the acquisition of an additional 70 units in 2017. We also plan to invest an additional $375 million in positive train control during 2016.","In summary, we finished 2015 on a solid note. In 2016 we are carrying that momentum forward as we continue to focus on those critical initiatives that would drive future improvement. Above all, this includes safety, where we expect once again to yield record results on a way towards zero incidents. ","In the face of uncertain volume environment, we will continue to adjust our resources to demand while also focusing on other productivity initiatives to further reduce costs. And where growth opportunities arise, we will leverage that growth to the bottom line to increase utilization of existing assets. As a result, we will create value for our customers with an excellent customer experience. With that, I will turn it over to Rob.","Robert M. Knight, Jr","Thanks and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue was just over $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 15% versus last year. Significantly lower volumes and even more challenging business mix and a negative fuel comparison more than offset solid core pricing gains achieved in the quarter.","Operating expenses totaled just under $3.3 billion, decreasing 13% compared to last year. Significantly lower fuel expense along with volume related reductions and productivity improvements drove the expense reduction. The net result was a 19% decrease in operating income to $1.9 billion.","Below the line, other income totaled $28 million, down $43 million versus the previous year, primarily driven by 2014's real estate gains. Interest expense of $164 million was up 12% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during the year. Income tax expense decreased 23% to $665 million, driven primarily by lower pretax earnings.","Net income decreased 22% versus 2014 while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce quarterly earnings of $1.31 per share, which fell well short of last year's record $1.61 per share.","Now turning to our top line, freight revenue of approximately $4.9 billion was down 16% versus last year. Volume declined 9% and fuel surcharge revenue was down $438 million when compared to 2014. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel price was $0.11 headwind to earnings in the fourth quarter versus last year. And keep in mind we did report a $0.05 positive fuel benefit in the fourth quarter of 2014. This includes the net impact from both fuel surcharges and lower diesel fuel costs. ","As we expected, a challenging business mix did have a negative impact on freight revenue in the fourth quarter. The primary drivers of this mix shift were significant declines in frac sand, steel shipments, and bulk grains partially offset by a decline in international intermodal volumes. A 3.5% core price increase was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter. Slide 22 provides more detail on our pricing trends. ","Pricing continued to be solid throughout 2015 and represents the strong value proposition that we provide our customers in the marketplace. Of the 3.5% this quarter, about 0.5% can be attributed to the benefit of the legacy business that we renewed in 2015. With the exception of a few smaller contracts in the out years, 2015 marks an end to any further legacy re-pricing opportunities. ","Moving on to the expense side, slide 23 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense which decreased 5% versus 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes and improved labor efficiencies. Labor inflation was around 4% in the fourth quarter driven primarily by agreement wage inflation. Looking at our total workforce levels our employee headcount declined 7% when compared to 2014. Reductions in TE&Y, training related activities, as well as employees associated with capital projects all contributed to the workforce decline. At this point in time given current volume levels we are being very cautious with our hiring plans for 2016. ","On average for the year we would expect overall force levels to be down somewhat depending of course on how volume ultimately plays out for the year. Labor inflation is expected to come in around 2% for the full year. This is driven primarily by agreement wage inflation, partially offset by lower pension expense. This is also consistent with our all in inflation expectations in the 2% range for the full year. ","Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $424 million down 48% when compared to 2014. Lower diesel fuel prices along with a 14% decline in gross ton miles drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year our fuel consumption rate increased 1% driven by negative mix while our average diesel price declined 39% to $1.61 per gallon. ","Moving onto to our other expense categories, purchase services and material expense decreased 11% to $589 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume related expense and reduced repair cost associated with our locomotive and car fleets. Depreciation expense was $517 million, up 6% compared to 2014. In 2016 depreciation expense is expected to increase slightly compared to last year. ","Slide 26 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $305 million, which is up 3% compared to 2014. Lower volumes and improved cycle times were more than offset by a favorable one time item in 2014. Other expenses came in at $235 million, up 3% versus last year. Higher state and local taxes and increased personal injury expense were partially offset by a reduction in general expenses. ","Other expenses for the full year were flat when compared to 2014 consistent with our full year guidance. For 2016, we expect the other expense line to increase between 5% and 10% excluding any large unusual items. ","Turning to our operating ratio performance, the fourth quarter operating ratio came in at 63.2% and 1.8 points unfavorable when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year I am pleased to report an operating ratio of 63.1 which is 0.4 points improvement from 2014. Even with the sharp decline in volumes, right sizing our resources to current demand, ongoing productivity initiatives and solid core pricing have all been key drivers to improving our overall margins. ","Slide 28 provides a summary of our 2015 earnings with a full year income statement. Operating revenue declined about $2.2 billion to $21.8 billion. Operating income totaled almost $8.1 billion, a decrease of 8% compared to 2014. And net income was just under $4.8 billion while earnings per share were down 5% to $5.49 per share. ","Turning now to our cash flow, in 2015, cash from operations totaled more than $7.3 billion down slightly when compared to 2014. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled $524 million for the year. This was down just under $1 billion from 2014 primarily driven by lower earnings along with higher cash capital and dividend payments. This includes the two dividends that we incurred in the first quarter of 2015 resulting from the timing change in our dividend payments. ","As expected the net impact of bonus depreciation on 2015 cash flow was close to neutral as the benefit from 2014 bonus depreciation offset cash tax payments associated with prior years. Taking a closer look at 2016 we will see the benefit from both 2015 and 2016 bonus depreciation since the legislation was passed just before year end. We are factoring in the two years worth of benefit in 2016 against payments from prior years, the expected net impact from bonus depreciation will be a tailwind of roughly $400 million on this year\u2019s cash flow. ","Slide 30 shows our 2015 capital program of $4.3 billion. And as Cam just mentioned we are targeting a capital plan in 2016 of about $3.75 billion pending final approval from our Board of Directors in February. This would be a reduction of over $500 million from last year\u2019s capital program. The chart on the right shows the returns on these investments over the last few years. Return on invested capital was 14.3% in 2015 down 1.9 points from 2014 driven primarily by lower earnings. ","Taking a look at the balance sheet, while cash from operations was down slightly year-over-year we increased our balance sheet debt by 24% resulting in an all in adjusted debt balance of about $17.4 billion at year end 2015. We also finished the year with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.7 which increased from 1.4 at year end 2014. Longer term we are continuing to target a debt to EBITDA ratio of less than 2 times. ","While we did increase our debt levels to reward shareholders, we also maintained a strong balance sheet which is a valuable asset particularly in the face of economic and strategic uncertainties. In 2015 share repurchases exceeded 35 million shares and totaled about $3.5 billion up 7% from 2014. Over the past five years, we have repurchased 15% of our outstanding shares. Adding our dividend payments and are share repurchases we returned more than $5.8 billion to our shareholders in 2015. This represents roughly a 20% increase over 2014 continuing our strong commitment to shareholder value. ","So that\u2019s a recap of our fourth quarter and full year results. Looking ahead to 2016, we do have some significant hurdles. Our energy related volumes will continue to be a challenge. Compared to last year's strong first quarter we expect this year's first quarter coal volumes to decline around 20% or so. And given the headwind we currently see with coal it is likely that total volumes for the first quarter will be down in the mid single digits. ","For the full year we currently expect total volumes to be slightly negative depending on coal and the strength of the overall economy as the year plays out. Fuel prices will have a negative impact on earnings at least in the first quarter given the $0.08 positive fuel benefit that we reported in the first quarter of 2015. While it is still early we are preparing ourselves for volume and mix pressures particularly in the first quarter and likely throughout March of 2016. ","We are counting on record productivity and solid pricing to drive an improved operating ratio again this year as we work towards our longer term operating ratio target of 60% plus or minus on a full year basis by 2019. And as always no matter what the environment we remain committed to running a safe, efficient, productive railroad for our customers while generating strong returns for our shareholders. So with that I will turn it back over to Lance. ","Lance M. Fritz","Thanks Rob, and as we discussed today this past year was a difficult one in many respects. But our team did outstanding work in the face of dramatic declines in volumes and shifts in our business mix. Overall economic conditions, uncertainty in the energy markets, commodity prices, and the strength of U.S. dollar will continue to have a major impact on our business this year.","However, our velocity is at an all-time best for the current level of demand. The network is fluid, and we are driving towards further improvement. We are well positioned to efficiently serve customers in existing markets as they rebound. The strength and the diversity of the Union Pacific franchise also will provide tremendous opportunities for new business development as both domestic and global markets evolve. When combined with our unrelenting focus on safety, productivity, and service these opportunities will translate into an excellent experience for our customers and strong value for our shareholders in the years ahead.","So with that, let's open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Robert Salmon ","Hey good morning and thanks for taking the question. Rob, with regard to your comments about the legacy pricing, further we saw about half a point in the fourth quarter. When you re-priced some of the legacy contracts, you had pulled forward some from 2016, should we still be considering some sort of incremental benefit in 2016 to the core pricing metric as we look out or should that effectively be zero for next year?","Robert M. Knight, Jr","Yeah, I would say, basically, effectively zero. I mean, there might be a tad bit of little carryover, but I think for your modeling purposes, those are pretty much behind us.","Robert Salmon ","Got it. And then I guess shifting gears Eric to the intermodal segment, you had called out some headwinds in the fourth quarter related to Triple Crown and some sourcing ships. Can you kind of quantify how we should be thinking about that Triple Crown headwind for 2016 or your quad specifically, the volume challenge that you guys saw and should those sourcing ships that we saw in the fourth quarter continue to weigh on intermodal load growth for the domestic volumes as we look out?","Eric L. Butler","Yeah, Rob. As we indicated, we still we always expect our highway conversion strategy which we are firmly focused on to continue to drive growing domestic intermodal volumes. And so, we continue to see growing domestic intermodal volumes despite headwinds from Triple Crown and other things that occur all the time. We do expect as I called out to see headwinds on the international intermodal side, just because of all of what's going on with the trends in simple [ph] trade in the China markets. But on the domestic intermodal side, we continue to see our strategy working, which is growing volumes through highway conversions.","Robert Salmon ","Got it, appreciate the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Brandon Oglenski ","Yeah, good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question. Lance or Eric, I mean, can you guys just give us some context here because I have only been covering the industry for about a decade, but the volumes seem pretty bad right now. I mean, maybe not quite as bad as 2009 and yet we are still getting jobs growth in the U.S. So how do you look at the environment right now? Is the U.S. headed into a broader recession or is this just limited to energy and industrial and other specifics in your business that maybe look worse than the broader economy?","Lance M. Fritz","Brandon, this is Lance. The impact on all railroad has been acute as you point out in energy, in commodities affected by the strong dollar like export grains, steel markets, and those are not necessarily indicative of a broader U.S. reality. I will share with you though there is also questions that we have about U.S. consumers. There are indicators that the consumers are healthy like the unemployment rate is at a comfortable 5% level, the consumers are buying automobiles as Eric outlined. But labor participation rate isn\u2019t that great and fourth quarter retail sales for goods was not that great. So I will let Eric give you a little more technicolor.","Eric L. Butler","Yes I am not sure there is much else I would add to that. I would say the consumer is spending, there is consumer confidence, household income is going up. There appear to be a shift between consuming on products or goods, spending on services. There does appear to be that shift so it does some of the changes is impacting our business and the industrial space. ","Lance M. Fritz","Yes Brandon one last thing, early in the year we talked about the impact on energy from low natural gas prices and the effect on coal, the effect on crude oil and natural gas exploration to development and we said ultimately that should be a benefit to other industries we serve like plastics manufacturing and consumers. And we just haven't seen yet the offset, the positive offset from the headwinds that we\u2019ve experienced. ","Brandon Oglenski ","Well I know it\u2019s difficult for a lot of investors on the line here too. Well Rob can you talk a little bit about the outlook for an improving operating ratio? What are the big drivers here especially with the uncertainty in volume?","Robert M. Knight, Jr","Yes the big driver, I mean volume obviously is our friend and I guided as you picked up that we expect full year volume to be slightly down. We\u2019d obviously like to see that improve from there but given that slightly down sort of view of the world and a positive improving operating ratio is our conviction around our ability and our focus on continuing to drive productivity and our ability to continue to provide quality service to our customers enables us to get price in the marketplace. ","Brandon Oglenski ","Okay appreciate it. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","Chris Wetherbee","Hi there, good morning. Want to touch a little bit on the outlook or stay on the outlook for 2016. Rob, I know you don\u2019t give earnings guidance specifically but if you can get sort of slightly down volumes, you have an improving OR, mix is going to be negative certainly in the first quarter or so of the year, I mean how do we think about the other puts and takes that potentially sort of impact that whether you are sort of flat to down or flat to up, I am just trying to make sure I understand how much you can control on the expense side to maybe offset some of this negative mix that we are expecting?","Robert M. Knight, Jr","Chris, I mean and the reason that I am not giving earnings guidance is because of all those unknowns. We are confident we can control what we can control which again is the productivity, quality of service, continue to drive positive price but there is so much uncertainty at this point in time in terms of what the absolute volumes will be and what the mix of those volumes will play out. So, that\u2019s why we are not at a position right now to give earnings guidance but I assure you we are focused on driving improvement on every aspect that we can and we certainly would like to see as positive results as we can drive.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay and then maybe just to follow up on that, in terms of the expense side what you can control you talked about headcount a little bit in the outlook and I think you said it would be down a bit, I guess you are entering the year with it down little bit more than that and kind of trying to chase that volume number down, I mean how do we think about sort of headcount for the full year in a little bit more detail?","Robert M. Knight, Jr","I mean Chris, as we\u2019ve said all along and I\u2019ll say it here again for 2016 is that volume will drive what our headcount ultimately is although there is still productivity. So volumes are slightly down. I would expect that we would have down headcount driven by volume and layering on our expectation of driving further productivity. So it will flow with directionally with what volume is but we are very focused getting to see what the mix actually plays out, very focused on driving productivity in those numbers and being as efficient as we can. ","Lance M. Fritz","Chris we outlined for you the expectations for volumes in the first quarter in a few specific areas. I would say we are in a much better posture entering 2016 from a realizing productivity in a headcount perspective, getting the resources right for the volumes than we were entering 2015. We are just in a very different place. ","Chris Wetherbee","That\u2019s helpful, thanks for the time, appreciate it?","Operator","The next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your questions.","Allison Landry","Good morning, thanks. So following up on the previous question, how much of a volume decline do you think that you can handle while still generating positive earnings growth. You did mentioned expectations for a slight decline but if car load has tracked down 5%, 6%, 7% is that sort of where you are thinking about the tipping point?","Robert M. Knight, Jr","Allison, this is Rob. I mean I can\u2019t give you and not giving guidance on the earnings. So I mean I get the point of your question but really the driver will be what's the mix, what volumes actually move, and etc. But I can just assure you that there is obviously a tipping point at some point, if that were to go so negative it would flip the other -- flip negative. But we are going to squeeze out productivity and continue to drive price where we can and so I can\u2019t give you a direct answer as to where that tipping point is. But we are focused on regardless of what the volume is on controlling what we can and driving positive OR and earnings.","Allison Landry","Understood, thanks. And then my second question would be what your expectations for overall cost inflation are for 2016? Thank you.","Robert M. Knight, Jr","Yeah, as I said Allison, overall inflation assumptions for us in 2016 are around 2%.","Allison Landry","Okay, excellent. Thank you.","Robert M. Knight, Jr","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Scott Group ","Hey thanks, good morning guys.","Lance M. Fritz","Good morning Scott.","Scott Group ","Rob, just wanted to clarify a few things that you said. In terms of headcount down slightly or something like that, I mean, we're going to be starting the year down 9% or so year-over-year. Are we talking about down slightly from kind of where you are ending the year at that 44, 45 level?","Robert M. Knight, Jr","Basically that guidance or that view of the world Scott, that where I say it\u2019s slightly down is a year-over-year assumption at this point in time. And again full year. And again, what will drive that is what the ultimate volumes end up being.","Cameron A. Scott","Scott, just a little point of detail. At the tail end of many years, there is a lot of moving parts that affect headcount, the absolute headcount number. But the average is the one that\u2019s most useful.","Scott Group ","Are you thinking about adding headcount from where you are right now because if you take where you are right now, I mean it should imply pretty meaningful drop in headcount?","Cameron A. Scott","We are going to continue to match headcount to whatever the volume situation is. The other thing to note is headcount comes in and out on capital programs as for instance in the winter time we start shutting down capital spend because of the weather and spooling it backup in the spring. There is just a lot of moving parts quarter-to-quarter sequentially.","Scott Group ","Okay. In terms of pricing, wanted to ask, so I think BN has talked about giving up some price to incent some coal demand. Are you guys doing anything similar like that and maybe if you can talk overall on pricing, it sounds like you expect solid pricing in 2016. Is it reasonable to expect some kind of deceleration in the pricing environment, just given what the volumes are doing or can we -- do you think we can hold steady around this 3% range actual legacy?","Eric L. Butler","Hey Scott, this is Eric. So I cannot speak to what the BN does with pricing strategy. They do their own independent strategy and I cannot speak to what they do. We continue to hold on our strategy of pricings for our value. We are driving a value proposition that we want to be an industry superior value proposition and we are going to price accordingly for that. We do think that there are places in the market and the economy that are growing and we think that those provide value for us to continue to price according to our long held strategy.","Scott Group ","Okay, alright. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Alex Saraci with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your questions.","Alex Saraci ","Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Rob, I know you didn\u2019t give explicit earnings guidance, but in the past two years you had noted in your slide deck record earnings and that was note -- that kind of was notably absent this time around. So I just want to confirm that we should interpret the lack of that expectation for record earnings to be what it is, that you won\u2019t at this point you do not expect to achieve at least the $5.75 in earnings per share that you achieved in 2014, which was the last record. I just want to confirm, you are essentially expecting this year to be below that figure?","Robert M. Knight, Jr","That is correct. Now nothing would please us more than to see the economy turn and things are going to go favorable. So we are going to fight like heck to do the best we can. But yes, you are correct. At this point in time, we do not see record earnings.","Alex Saraci ","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, just to touch back on the pricing discussion, you noted that you expect inflation to be 2% in 2016. In the past, you've always kind of suggested nominal pricing, above inflation. Is that still your expectation for 2016 to achieve pricing above that 2% inflation level?","Robert M. Knight, Jr","Yes. But as you know, we don\u2019t set our prices based on what current year inflation numbers are. And as has been pointed out we\u2019ve discussed here today we priced the market. Every market is a little bit different. We clearly don\u2019t have the benefit of the calling half point legacy renewal that we\u2019d enjoyed in 2016 but having said all of that yes we are still focused on pricing above inflation. ","Alex Saraci ","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much for the time. ","Operator","The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead with your questions. ","Thomas Wadewitz","Yes, good morning. I wanted to ask you a little bit about the volume side. So you commented on first quarter and I think Eric in his slide with the 2016 outlook gave us the view by segment. If I look at that view by a segment it is either kind of plus and minus or I guess for coal it is minus, minus. But it seems like by segment it is pretty negative but on a full year basis you are saying it is down only slightly. So I assume slightly is not down 3 or 4, its maybe down 1 or 2. What -- how do you kind of bridge those two together? Is it just the function of the comps get so much easier in second quarter or are you expecting kind of adjusted for seasonality improvement in demand later in the year or how do you put those two together because it kind of by segment looked a little more negative than the comment about a slight decline on a full year basis?","Robert M. Knight, Jr","Let me just start off and Eric may want to comment further and to maybe more specific, but this is Rob. I would just say that Tom to your point we clearly are highlighting and as you know that the comps particularly, the first quarter is particularly challenging and that\u2019s why we are calling out the down volume in the first quarter in coal clearly you know 20% or so range. So the comps do change throughout the year but our view of the world right now is that the energy environment which impacts our coal impacts our shale impacts our metals. It supports the shale activity on top of the continuing strong dollar. Those are going to continue to be hurdles and pressures for us. But the comps do change as the year plays out and I think that\u2019s what's driving sort of maybe the math that you are wrestling with. ","Lance M. Fritz","Eric you got anything else to add?","Eric L. Butler","No, that\u2019s it. ","Thomas Wadewitz","So you would say it is more comps than anticipation of improved market later in the year?","Robert M. Knight, Jr","I\u2019d say that\u2019s a bigger driver. ","Thomas Wadewitz","Okay, I appreciate that. What about mix? If I look at your slides in third quarter mix I think it was a 1% year-over-year headwind and that got a lot more challenging in fourth quarter which I think was the big thing we missed in our assumptions for fourth quarter with that 4% mix headwind. I know it\u2019s a tough one to forecast but do you think mix in 2016 is more like the 4% or more like 1%, that\u2019s a pretty material consideration?","Robert M. Knight, Jr","Tom, this is Rob again. I would say again as you know we don\u2019t and is very difficult, in fact frankly impossible to precisely predict exactly what mix is going to be. But I would say just sort of directionally if you look at the full year mix impact in 2015 it was about 1.5 negative and you are right, the fourth quarter was particularly bad at down at 4. We do expect to still see mix headwinds as 2016 plays out. I don\u2019t anticipate that it would be for the full year as bad as we saw in the fourth quarter. We do have a comp challenge in the first quarter but as the year plays out things should get easier and while mix will be headwinds for the full year it should sort of get better than what we saw in the first quarter, we\u2019ll see in the first quarter and what we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. ","Cameron A. Scott","Recall Tom first quarter of 2015, we grew frac sand shipments, coal was still relatively healthy, grain was healthier than what we saw as the year progressed into later quarters. So markets have really changed pretty dramatically from the first quarter of 2015. ","Thomas Wadewitz","So the mix comps might be similar to the volume comps that they get to be used your beyond first quarter. Maybe what\u2026","Robert M. Knight, Jr","We\u2019ll see. ","Thomas Wadewitz","Okay, thank you for the time. I appreciate it. ","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your questions. ","Jason Seidl","Thank you, hey Lance, Rob, Eric, Cameron how is everyone doing. ","Cameron A. Scott","Jason. ","Jason Seidl","I want to go back on the pricing side and focus on intermodal and any of the truck competitive merchandise traffic that you are hauling. Clearly right now it seems that there is excess trucking capacity and all the data points at least we track are pointing to truck pricing going down both contractually and on the spot basis, how should we look at your ability to not only price but grow the intermodal business ex under the headwinds that we talked about with Triple Crown as we move throughout 2016?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, this Eric, Jason. So, a big reason as you know for kind of the shrinkage in truck pricing is fuel is coming down which is a major cause. So, our customers are also seeing a cost reduction benefit as fuel goes down because of the fuel surcharge going down. So they are seeing that natural cost reduction benefit. So the gap if you will between the value proposition for intermodal rail service versus truck I think that, that gap is still there in terms of intermodal providing a value proposition to manufacturers. We have talked in the past about just by laws of physics steel wheel on steel rail is a lower costing, rubber tire on asphalt or concrete. So there still is a value proposition there that we think gives us a leverage to continue to drive highway conversions which we demonstrated in 2015 and we are going to continue to focus on in 2016.","Lance M. Fritz","And Eric your team continually works with trucking companies themselves in terms of helping them with their cost structures and they look at intermodal conversions as an opportunity to modify their own cost structures as they compete in that marketplace and those opportunities continue as well. ","Jason Seidl","Okay, now that is good color. As I look on the Ag side, it seemed like there was a couple of puts and takes but net, net for the year, would you guys say you were positive or slightly negative for Ag?","Lance M. Fritz","Eric.","Eric L. Butler","I am not sure I understand the question. ","Jason Seidl","In terms of your outlook for 2016?","Eric L. Butler","Oh, we don\u2019t give volume guidance for 2016. I think if you look at the Ag markets overall I think the Ag producers are expecting pretty good yields for 2016 of course depending on weather and number of acres planned in all of that. Maybe not record levels but pretty good levels. I think a large factor will depend on worldwide Ag production, strong dollar, and how competitive U.S. Ag is. In worldwide market there is a lot of corn, a lot of wheat in storage right now. And presumably as U.S. Ag becomes more competitive pricing wise in worldwide markets that's got to move and when that does move, presumably we as a transportation provider will have a benefit in moving in. ","Jason Seidl","Okay, gentlemen thank you for the timing as always. ","Operator","Thank you. Next question is coming from the line of Ken Hester [ph] Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.","Unidentified Analyst ","Great, good morning. Lance, I want to revisit one of the earlier questions in terms of looking back in market downturns and looking at the volumes, how do you figure out how to stay ahead of that in terms of furloughing employees and cutting -- dropping locomotives in terms of them being not -- I guess not overdoing it so you can catch that rebound. How have you acted differently this time versus whether it was at the end of 2014 and beginning of 2015 when we ramped up maybe too much and then versus what you saw in 2008-2009, maybe can you give us a little feedback in terms of how you prepped for that. ","Lance M. Fritz","Sure Ken. We have been clear historically about time lags in decisions that are just the nature of our business in terms of hiring somebody to operate a train. That is about a six month process. So, we have to by nature when we are planning crews look out 6, 12, 18 months. And when we are talking about capital planning or locomotive acquisitions those lead times get longer. So it all begins with our business planning process and making sure that we have tight connectivity between what Eric and the commercial team are seeing and then how we are boiling that into a transportation plan and the resources necessary to run it. ","Every time we see a significant shift in volume, whether it is significant growth or significant shrink we try to learn from that situation. As we are going into 2016 we think our business planning process is tighter, we think our connectivity between what Eric sees in the marketplace and secondary and tertiary indicators of demand more of that is being absorbed into our estimating process. And so I shouldn\u2019t miss the opportunity to talk about also doing a better job of shrinking some of the timelines let's say in terms of hiring and bringing a crew on board or acquiring equipment. We are also better candidly at when we have to store equipments, storing it quickly and efficiently and we are also better at trying to find the right mix of the right employee base where they are located and training them for alternative jobs. So we are just getting a little better in all those ways and that adds up I think into a better posture overall. ","Unidentified Analyst ","And to clarify that you don\u2019t see that as rounding into like of 2008-2009 not that deep of a recession but into I guess so far what you seen doesn\u2019t seem a recession environment to you?","Lance M. Fritz","Ken it is hard for me to speak and predict on whether the economy is going into a recession. Certainly our volume drop off as the 2015 year progressed quarter to quarter and as we are entering 2016 is dramatic and it is dramatic in historical reference but it is nothing, it is not approaching what we experienced in 2008 to 2009. I will tell again, a 6% decrease year-over-year and a quarterly 6%, 7%, 8%, 9% decrease year-over-year is pretty dramatic volume change. ","Unidentified Analyst ","Great, if I could do a follow up just a quickly comment I guess yesterday or a couple of days ago one of the other rails noted your quotes on M&A and said that I guess prior you had talked about how it impacted Union Pacific and you are opposed to that. Maybe can you clarify your comments -- on your thoughts on industry M&A, why it would or would not matter to you given your operating in your own region, and does it -- in industry change impact Union Pacific?","Lance M. Fritz","Ken we do not support mergers or consolidation in the current environment. We think that the regulatory outcomes, the regulatory impact would be substantial. The Service Transportation Board has been clear. That in the next merger that they consider it has to enhance competition not just maintain it. It has to improve operations for customers and they also have to consider downstream impacts whether one merger triggers a string of consolidations. We\u2019ve shared with you, we are focused on safety, we are focused on efficiency, we are focused on an excellent customer experience. We don\u2019t think a merger enhances those efforts. Matter of fact we think it would have a negative impact on service and be a headwind disincentive to capital investment. ","Unidentified Analyst ","Thanks for the time and thought, appreciate it.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan Chase. Please go ahead with your question. ","Brian Ossenbeck","Yes, hi good morning, thanks for taking the question. So, obviously one area of growth year-over-year looks like it is going to continue into next year, but how much of that is attributable to Mexico and what type of impact do you see when it comes to we are seeing it is from reported first half be tooling and change over staff of the border and do you think this should really have an impact on your length of hall or mix of business in that vertical? ","Lance M. Fritz","Brian, before I hand it over to Eric I just want to say we are very bullish on Mexico in general in the long term. It\u2019s a vibrant economy, it has got a vibrant middle class, and our access to the six primary rail gateways to and from Mexico give us a real great opportunity to participate in that economy. Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Brian historically Mexico produced about 1.7 million vehicles. I think full year 2015 the number is probably closer to about 2.9 million vehicles. I\u2019ll call it 17.5 that were sold with all of the plant expansions and new plants I think it is on its way to 4 million or 4.5 million in the next call it year and a half to two years. As it has been said we have a great franchise for Mexico and we think that that will be a strong part of our business portfolio going into the future. As always, the issue is when the sales drive total volume and so our total volume will be aligned with whatever sales are. And our strategy is to have a franchise to move it wherever it is manufactured.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay, then just quick on that, was it about 60% of your auto comes from -- is attributable to Mexico, I am remembering correctly?","Eric L. Butler","Historically, we've said that, yes. And that\u2019s about what it was, yes.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. And then just one another quick one on train lengths. I think in the last call, you mentioned you have about 90%, about 70,000 foot capable I guess in terms of sidings. Third quarter is around 6000 foot average train lengths. So include you are highlighting some of the best ever lengths in three of the five areas. How much further and I guess how much faster do you think you can take that up and when would you hit the upper limit? I know it's different in every market and I guess the intermodals clearly got some headwinds here. But I think that\u2019s really the one for good economics to really work, that\u2019s when you really need to get the longer trains, so you might be simply focused on that and just some general comments about train lengths?","Lance M. Fritz","Cam, you want to talk a little bit about the productivity opportunity in train lengths?","Cameron A. Scott","Coal is about the only program that is nearly optimized although there is opportunities still within coal. Every other commodity group has plenty of train size productivity opportunity and you will see us continuing to make progress, balancing customer needs along the way.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay, thanks for your time guys.","Lance M. Fritz","Thanks Brian.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura Asset Management. Please go ahead with your question.","Matt Troy ","Yeah, good morning everybody. I have a quick question about coal, specifically a lot of pushback we get from investors with respect to UNP specifically as you have a competitor who due to some service issues and perhaps much larger portfolio strategy has invested significant amount of CAPEX out West and there is concern given the structural market share loss in coal and the competitive dynamic has structurally changed in their favor. If I look at a 20-year market share chart of coal, you and the BN used to swap share and were about 50% each every year. And then in 2011, we saw a split and then again in 2014. So there has been roughly a 10% shift where what used to be 50-50 is now 60-40. I was wondering if you could just put some color around that. I know that there were service issues in your line last year, but even if I normalize for that spike, the line and the trend is pretty consistent over a five year basis. I am just wondering how you can address structurally the investor concerns that something hasn\u2019t changed in the West as it relates to coal?","Lance M. Fritz","Yeah Matt, I think if you go back historically and go back to the '80s when really the Powder River Basin franchise was developed for us certainly in addition to our competitor, I think it\u2019s been roughly call it a 55-45 split over time and as opposed to the 50-50. But we don\u2019t look at markets in terms of what share we have in a market. We look at it in terms of what's the value of that market, what's the value of that franchise where we think we have value, a value proposition to offer the market and we sell our value proposition and we are comfortable with the outcome in terms of the business that we win or lose based on the value proposition that we sell.","Matt Troy ","Right. So I guess, again in the context of people choosing to invest or not invest in your stock, if I look at the economy and volumes Burlington Northern positive on volumes last year in coal. Union Pacific down double-digit in coal. You are saying you are comfortable with that?","Lance M. Fritz","What we are comfortable with Matt, is the diversity of our franchise. Coal remains a nice book of business for us, generates an attractive return, that\u2019s how we look at all of our book of business in terms of can we generate an attractive return and we invest for that and we price for that. And I think our track record speaks for itself. We\u2019ve done a pretty fair job of making that happen. ","Matt Troy ","Okay, understood. My quick follow up would be then if I look at down cash flow, you yourself said I mean reducing the CAPEX budget by North of 500 million you have got some other tailwind, you talked about bonus appreciations, pretty material number as in terms of incremental cash flow potential. You slowed the pacing of share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Just wondering with that excess potential cash flow in 2016, is there an opportunity to step up share repurchases, what are the guiding factors in terms of either debt ratios or what not, in terms of how aggressively you are willing to use what should be some surplus cash flow in 2016? Thank you. ","Lance M. Fritz","Rob do you want to take that. ","Robert M. Knight, Jr","Yes, Matt you are right. I mean our expectation coming off of certainly with last year's low number from cash flow that we will hopefully positively generate increase in cash flow. And yes, we\u2019ll continue our philosophy of being opportunistic in the marketplace as it relates to shares. So I would expect that we will continue to do that. And as I called out by the way in the third quarter that was a high watermark if you will that we\u2019ve seen at least in modern times of the rate of which we were buying back shares and that clearly was not our ratable rate in terms of shares. But we were opportunistic in terms of when we buy and how much we buy and that attitude and that philosophy will continue in 2016. But if we can generate stronger levels of cash that gives us greater opportunities and as we continue to walk up our debt to EBITDA as we said and as we have, it gives us further opportunity. ","Lance M. Fritz","Job one is generating cash from operations it all starts there and we are laser focused on that.","Matt Troy ","Understood, thank you for the time. ","Operator","The next question is from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. ","John Barnes","Hey, thank you for taking my questions. So following up on that question around cap or cash flow I hear what you are saying in terms of your opposition to M&A, but if it were to take place Burlington Northern has already said that they are going to be involved if there is a waiver consolidation. Given the cash flow that you are looking at generating in 2016 do you feel the need to maintain some of that is dry powder in the event that you were forced to react to a consolidation wave in the sector?","Lance M. Fritz","John in addition to saying we don\u2019t support rail mergers at this time we\u2019ve also said we\u2019re paying close attention to the situation, we\u2019re monitoring it and as things evolve we\u2019ll do what is in the best interest of our shareholders and our stakeholders. If you look at our capital structure we are in a solid position strategically if we had to do anything. But what we are focused on right now is that in the current environment we think mergers are not in the interest of our customers and just monitoring that and keeping close tabs on it. ","John Barnes","Okay, alright. And then my follow up is look I hate to ask you a such a short term type of question but Eric you mentioned in your commentary from intermodal risk perspective, record high inventories and you talked a little bit about your thoughts on the consumer. We got the Chinese New Year kind of right around the corner. Normally there is typically kind of a surge in activity ahead of that, do you anticipate or are you hearing from your shipper base, customer base yet that there may be some intention to use that period as an opportunity to kind of clear the desk a little bit, maybe clear the baffles on inventory and so you come out of maybe 1Q in a little bit better inventory situation or do you anticipate that you will still see maybe that normal pre Chinese New Year type of surge in intermodal volumes? ","Eric L. Butler","We are hearing nothing specific from our shippers surrounding the Chinese New Year to disclose here. I would say that every BCO is looking at rationalizing their inventories because they expect the holiday season higher than I think expected on inventories with sluggish retail sales. I think across the Board you hear every customer talking about trying to right size their inventories. ","John Barnes","Very good, alright, thanks for your time guys, appreciate it. ","Lance M. Fritz","Thank you John. ","Operator","The next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead with your questions.","Justin Long","Thanks and good morning. I was wondering if you could provide more color on the magnitude of the record productivity you noted in your comments and how much of that is predicated on a slightly down volume environment, in other words if volumes end up being worse than you expect this year, is record productivity still achievable?","Lance M. Fritz","I will make one quick comment and that is what we saw in 2015 was both cost coming out because of volume getting the structure right and a much more fluid network in the second half of the year generating excellent productivity opportunities. ","Robert M. Knight, Jr","Justin, I would just add, this is Rob, I would just add that kind of what gives us the confidence that marker that I would point you to is our improvement in our operating ratio throughout the full year and I am confident that we will continue to do that. In terms of at what pace we can do it, when they were all about doing it as quickly and as efficiently and safely as we can but what will drive sort of the timing of that productivity as we move with volumes is going to be the mix of factors and the timing of when do our volume changes. And as you know throughout 2015, the first half we are kind of chasing volume down and then we were able to sort of take advantage as things neutralize or straighten out a little bit in the back half. And so that will be a factor too in terms of what volume swings may or may not occur. But we are focused on squeezing out productivity as on everything we do and that's all I can point you to is that we will look at every stone and uncover it and look for opportunities. ","Justin Long","Okay, great. And I know you are not giving specific EPS guidance for 2016, but just putting together the pieces here slightly down volumes, core price increases, record productivity, better OR, the benefit of share repurchases just from a directional standpoint would it be correct to say that your thinking about EPS being up year-over-year?","Robert M. Knight, Jr","Rob, the reason I am not giving guidance on the earnings is because there are so many uncertainties of which mix by the way is another headwind I would remind you of that. I did call out and that will dictate I think in large part exactly how this year plays out. So with all the uncertainties out there, we are going to certainly focus and fight like heck to take advantage of whatever the economy plays us to turn in as positive of earnings and returns and cash generation as we can. But we are not giving guidance as to exactly what the earnings will end up being for the year. ","Justin Long","Okay, fair enough. Thanks for the time. ","Lance M. Fritz","Sure thing Justin. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your questions. ","Jeffrey Kauffman ","Thank you very much. Lot of my questions have been answered but let me come back to the cash flow question if I can, could you remind us of where you ideally want to have your debt levels whether you think about them as a debt to cap or debt to EBITDA and when I think about the positives to your 2016 cash flow, you mentioned about 400 million bonus depreciation, about 500 million less spend on CAPEX and for better or for worse with the shares down the way they are you can buy back shares that won't cost as much to still get your numbers on the share repo. When you look at 2016 given the increased uncertainty, are you more likely to say okay, we are going to buyback whatever shares we are going to buyback but with the excess cash flow we just may not need as much debt to fund it or is your view that you are still under levered and you are willing to go to higher debt to cap levels?","Lance M. Fritz","Rob?","Robert M. Knight, Jr","Yes Jeff, I would just remind you that guidance that we have given which we are comfortable with is working towards that debt to EBITDA of 2x and we have said sort of that is marker out there. I think we still have a little bit of a room from the improvement we made on that metric in 2015. So I would expect that we will continue to march forward if you will and as I pointed out, we do expect largely because of a reduction in and we hope to generate stronger cash on the front end but we also have the benefit of lower CAPEX and the benefit of the bonus depreciation that I outlined. So, and we may do debt this year. When we look at that that would not be an unrealistic expectation that you will see us take on additional debt this year. All of that gives us additional -- gives us opportunities to generate stronger free cash flow and gives us opportunities to continue to be opportunistic in the marketplace.","Jeffrey Kauffman ","Okay, and so basically you were saying we have -- I think you are at 1.7 times debt to EBITDA and you are saying we can go to 2x so we can take on a little more debt but more likely we would use the cash flow just to fulfill our obligations?","Lance M. Fritz","I don\u2019t think Rob said that. I think he said we are going to generate cash, we have got room in our balance sheet and we will see how the year plays out.","Jeffrey Kauffman ","Okay, thank you. Thank you very much sir. That's all I have. ","Lance M. Fritz","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your questions. ","Ben Hartford","Thanks, Eric could you remind us what your percent of car loads yields are tied to the underlying price of a commodity that it holds? ","Eric L. Butler","I am not quite sure what you are asking. If you are asking about our pricing strategy and we don\u2019t really talk publically about our pricing strategy. We have historically said we don\u2019t think philosophically that need to tie transportation to slings in commodity markets, you have said that philosophically but we don\u2019t talk about our pricing strategy publically. ","Ben Hartford","I\u2019d say I guess I am not interested in the strategy specifically, is there a percentage that you provide of car loads that have the yield component that is specifically tied to the price of the underlying commodity?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, again that we don\u2019t talk publically about our pricing strategy. We don\u2019t talk about what are -- how our prices developed. ","Ben Hartford","Okay thank you. ","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question. ","Cleo Zagrean","Good morning and thank you. I wanted to talk about mix in terms of length of haul. I\u2019ve seen lengths of haul getting shorter this quarter not just for coal but also chemicals and industrials, is there a structural change going on, what are the drivers of that and where do you see that trend? Thank you very much. ","Lance M. Fritz","Eric, do you want to talk about that? ","Eric L. Butler","Our length of haul is down slightly this year and again it is other things that we have been talking about in terms of the mix headwinds with our coal business, some of the mix headwinds with our frac sand business, our long haul grain export business, those are all mixed factors that has impacted our length of haul which was down slightly this year. ","Lance M. Fritz","And I don\u2019t think we see anything structural that\u2019s some kind of long term trend. ","Cleo Zagrean","Okay, appreciate that. And then my follow up is tied to one of your comments earlier that you haven't seen the benefit from low oil prices that not just you but many of us were talking about, some kind of silver lining, so what are you hiding from your customers, do you get the sense or that they are postponing decisions just due to uncertainty or they are signaling to you that there is simply lower demand and what do you think might trigger both of the industrial economy that would reflect in your volumes and I know that\u2019s a long question but maybe tied to that if you could discuss the way you focus your business development as a result? Thanks very much. ","Eric L. Butler","Cleo I\u2019ll focus the answer on your question about not seeing the benefits of low oil. There is multiple moving parts in there. We are seeing capital investment occurring specifically along the Gulf Coast in our chemical franchise. Those investments just haven't yet turned over into operating units and so that\u2019s a matter of time. That\u2019s an end of this year 2017-2018 kind of impact. We are still hopeful for that impact. The other part of it is consumers doing something with the windfall of lower energy cost and that\u2019s where it is really hard to see that showing through in the goods that we shipped for retailers. And their feedback is while maybe services consumption is relatively healthy, goods consumption isn't necessarily showing that. ","Cleo Zagrean","Okay, so then your business development remains focused in the chemical Gulf Coast footprint?","Eric L. Butler","Our business has a wonderful franchise that we\u2019ve talked about. One of the wonderful parts of that is this Gulf Coast franchise. And with low natural gas as a feedstock to many of those manufacturers that\u2019s a benefit to them and we think ultimately will be something we can participate when they increase production. ","Cleo Zagrean","Thank you very much. ","Eric L. Butler","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Sami Hazboun with Investors Group. Please go ahead with your question. ","Sami Hazboun","Good morning, thank you for taking my question and I apologize in advance if any of these questions have been asked, I missed part of the call. With respect to the headcount reduction I see that its principally and obviously within the running trades of the TE&Y. Taking that a level above, are there any plans to review the support and\/or indirect headcount as a consequence of the volume environment and I have a couple of other questions with specific volume things?","Lance M. Fritz","Sami, this is Lance. We in the third quarter of last year and into the fourth quarter we announced and executed an involuntary force reduction on our non-agreement to our management ranks and that has been executed. And then as we look forward, we continue to look for opportunity to get our overall structure sized right for the markets that we are serving. Attrition is our friend in that effort. We typically get an attrition rate of 7% or 8% a year and we will use that to our advantage as and if we need to continue to adjust our overall structural cost. ","Sami Hazboun","Thanks for that Lance. On the industrial side, with respect to frac sand, did you call out exactly how much of that was down and how much it now composes as a percentage of revenues?","Lance M. Fritz","Eric?","Unidentified Company Representative ","We did in both the prepared remarks and I think in the materials that were sent out, we\u2026","Sami Hazboun","So I just take minerals as mostly frac sand?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, the minerals is down 52% and the majority of that is frac sand. ","Sami Hazboun","Alright, thank you very much gentlemen. ","Lance M. Fritz","Thank you Sami. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead with your questions. ","David Vernon","Hey, good morning. Rob I think you called out $0.11 headwind from fuel in the fourth quarter, have you guys thought about -- I am trying to range what we can expect from the fuel headwind for next year, I mean obviously there is a lot of moving parts to that as well but if you just assume that oil prices kind of stabilize here and we move forward, could you talk a little bit about how big the absolute steel headwind could be in 2016?","Robert M. Knight, Jr","Yeah, I didn\u2019t put a number on the full year but it could well be a headwind. I did call out that the first quarter, remember that we had about $0.08 of positive last year. So, we clearly have that as a hurdle facing us as the first quarter continues to play out. Of course how fuel and the timing within an quarter will dictate exactly what that number ends up being year-over-year. But we do see that as a headwind certainly in the first quarter and could continue at some pace throughout the year. ","David Vernon","But similar to the volume comp issue, you would say that if oil pricing were to stabilize then worst than the fuel impact would be front-end loaded?","Robert M. Knight, Jr","Depending on what mix is and where the volumes actually are that's a fair assumption, yes. ","David Vernon","Okay, and then I guess just as a general question, it seems like on some of the published surcharge tariff tables fuel prices are getting to the point where surcharges actually zero out, is that kind of a correct read to those tables, or do you think that the fuel revenue will still got to be positive as we get through most of 2016?","Lance M. Fritz","Rob?","Robert M. Knight, Jr","Well as I said those are publically seen and the calculations for those you probably have an accurate calculation. ","Eric L. Butler","David, I am with Rob, I would just remind you and others that remember we have some 60 plus different surcharge mechanisms that have different starting points, different components, different timing mechanism around them so it is very difficult to draw any kind of a straight line conclusion. But clearly at these low prices some of them are totally new edge. ","David Vernon","Alright, excellent. Well thanks a lot for your time. It has been a long call and good luck through the next couple of tough quarters on the volume side.","Lance M. Fritz","Thank you David. ","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments. ","Lance M.

At this the time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operation Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President, and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may now begin.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Good morning, everybody. And welcome to the Union Pacific's third quarter earnings conference call, with me here today in Omaha, are Beth Whited, our Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, our Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.2 billion for the third quarter of 2017. This equates to $1.50 per share, which is up 10% over last year. Total volume decreased 1% in the quarter compared to 2016. Carload volume decreased in four of our six commodity groups, driven primarily by a 10% decrease and agricultural products and associated grain carloadings. Partially offsetting this volume was a 15% increase in industrial products, with particular strength in frac sand shipments.","The quarterly operating ratio came in at 62.8%, which was up 0.7 points from the third quarter of 2016. During the quarter, our company faced the unprecedented challenge of Hurricane Harvey. I want to thank the men and women of Union Pacific who worked tirelessly and heroically to quickly and safely to restore our network and our operations from the storm and the related flooding. Given these challenges, I'm pleased with our results, and look forward to continuing to build on the foundation provided by our six-track value strategy. Our team will give you more of the details on the third quarter, starting with Beth.","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Thanks, Lance, and good morning. We announced during the third quarter that effective January 1, we will transition reporting to our newly established four business groups: agricultural, energy, industrial, and premium. Until then, we will continue to report on the six business teams.","For the third quarter, our volume was down 1%, driven primarily by agricultural products, automotive and chemicals, with an offset in industrial products. We generated positive net core pricing of nearly 2% in the quarter, with continued coal-related and intermodal pricing pressure. Despite these challenges, we remain committed to achieving core pricing gains that offset inflation and align with our value proposition.","We saw a 4% increase in freight revenue due to a 5% increase in average revenue per car, with a slight offset due to decreased carloads. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each business group.","Ag products revenue was down 2% on a 10% volume decrease and a 9% increase in average revenue per car. Grain carloads were down 19%, primarily driven by a delay in harvest and lower U.S. exports of feed grains in wheat as a result of high global inventories. This was partially offset by domestic strength in the Mid-South poultry and Idaho dairy markets.","Grain products carloads were down 10%, predominantly due to weaker competitiveness of U.S. exports rail (03:21) shipments to the Gulf Coast. Food and refrigerated volumes were at 5%, driven by continued strength in import beer with strong summer demand. Domestic sugar shipments also remained strong with the movement of surplus inventory to accommodate new crop production. Looking at the rest of the year, we may see some benefit from the delayed harvest. However, high global production of both feed grains and wheat, coupled with a lower quality domestic wheat harvest will continue to create headwinds in our export markets.","Domestic business is expected to remain stable. We expect food and refrigerated shipments will see growth driven by Cold Connect penetration, weather recovery and tightening truck capacity. We also anticipate sustained strength in sugar and import beer trending with consumer demand.","Automotive revenue was down 3% in the quarter, on a 5% decrease in volume, and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 9% as a result of lower production levels in response to softer vehicle sales, coupled with high inventories as well as planned outages for model changeovers. These reductions were partially offset by new West Coast import traffic and production growth in Mexico.","The seasonally adjusted average rate of sales was 17.1 million vehicles in the third quarter, down 3% from third quarter 2016. On the parts side, over-the-road conversions and growth in light truck demand maintained our parts volume, despite lower overall production levels.","The US light vehicle sales forecast for full year 2017 is 17 million units, down almost 3% from the 2016 record rate of 17.5 million. For the rest of the year, we remain cautious with respect to auto sales due to current sales trends, high inventory, and rising incentives. Hurricane replacements may provide some short-term opportunity.","Chemicals revenue was up 2% for the quarter, on a 5% decrease in volume, and 8% increase in average revenue per car. Petroleum and LPG shipments declined 17% as we continued to see headwinds on crude oil shipments, which were down 82% to about 2,000 carloads, due to the lower crude oil prices and available pipeline capacity. Chemicals volume, excluding crude oil, was down 2% in the quarter. Plastics carloads were down 6%, with seven plastics plants impacted by Hurricane Harvey. Fertilizer was up 6%, driven by continued strength in potash exports.","For the fourth quarter of 2017, our chemicals franchise is expected to grow modestly. We are back to normal pre-hurricane levels. In addition, we anticipate strength in plastics with continued domestic and export demand, coupled with the new facilities and expansions coming online.","Coal revenue decreased 2% for the quarter, on a 3% decrease in volume, and flat average revenue per car. On a tonnage basis, Powder River Basin was down 4%, while other regions were up 6%, as coal unit and unloading outages reduced PRB volume. Colorado\/Utah loadings benefited from strong export shipments to the West Coast and to the Gulf Coast. Natural gas prices were similar to a year ago and coal stockpiles have been below normal for the majority of the year. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, coal volumes are expected to be flat versus fourth quarter 2016, due to normalized demand. As always, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand.","Industrial products revenue was up 26%, on a 15% increase in volume, and a 10% increase in average revenue per car during the quarter. Minerals volume increased 80% in the quarter, driven by a 120% increase in sand shipments, due to improving well completions and increased proppant intensity per well. Specialized markets volume increased 23% in the quarter, driven by a 22% increase in waste, as a result of West Coast remediation projects and a 130% increase in military shipments, due to increased deployments and rotations.","Looking forward, we anticipate proppant intensity, well completions and business development to drive continued growth through the fourth quarter. We see growth in military and waste shipments, with an offset in rock volumes due to less projects work in the south.","Intermodal revenue was up 3% on a flat volume and a 2% increase in average revenue per quarter. Domestic volume was down 1%, due to a challenging competitive environment, offset by partial growth. International volume was up 1% in the quarter from stronger west-bound shipments. Excluding the Hanjin impact in 2016, international volume would have been up 5%. We expect international intermodal volume to hover around 2016 levels for the remainder of the year. We have now lapped the effects of the Hanjin bankruptcy, creating easier comps. However, we expect slowing from normal seasonality, as well as headwinds from ocean carrier industry consolidation and increasing overcapacity in the fourth quarter, resulting in lower ocean rates.","For the domestic market, we remain optimistic that truck capacity will tighten further in the fourth quarter, providing an opportunity to drive higher levels of over-the-road conversions. We are also well positioned for holiday sales growth later in the quarter.","To wrap up, this slide recaps our outlook for the remainder of 2017 mentioned in the previous slides. We anticipate continued progress in our food and refrigerated, plastics, fertilizer and sand markets. Over-the-road conversions in both automotive and intermodal will also continue to present opportunities for growth. Our diverse franchise remains well positioned for growth for the remainder of the year as the U.S. economy continues to build momentum in the face of a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy. Our team remains fully committed to developing new business opportunities and strengthening our overall customer value proposition.","With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance.","Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.","Thanks, Beth, and good morning. Starting with safety performance, our reportable personal injury rate was 0.78, almost even with the year-to-date record of 0.77 achieved in 2016. Although we continue generating near-record safety results, we won't be satisfied until we reach our goal of zero incidents, getting every one of our employees home safely at the end of each day. With regards to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate improved 5% to 2.97. And in public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 1% versus the 2016 to 2.52, as we remain focused on improving crossings where we can impact public safety the most.","Moving on to network performance, as reported to the AAR, velocity declined 2% when compared to the third quarter of 2016. As Lance mentioned, we faced a particularly tough challenge in the quarter, dealing with the impact of Hurricane Harvey. The record-setting rains negatively impacted Gulf Coast operations and our network fluidity system wide.","In the aftermath of the storm, over 1,700 miles of track were out of service, and more than 2,400 route miles were affected. The team showed tremendous dedication as they worked extremely hard around the clock restoring operations back to normal in only 10 days. Continued implementation and testing of PTC across a growing number of routes in our network also negatively impacted velocity during the quarter. Terminal dwell increased 7% compared to last year. Whereas the effect of the hurricane did contribute to the increase during the quarter, we also see opportunities to improve car connections within our transportation plan.","Looking at our resources, all in, our total operating workforce was down nearly 550 employees in the quarter when compared to last year. Our engineering and mechanical workforce was down more than 800 employees, driven primarily by fewer employees required on capital projects as a result of the productivity initiatives implemented during our G55 + 0 efforts. While our TE&Y workforce, excluding those in training, declined with volume during the quarter, our overall TE&Y workforce increased as we began to refill the training pipeline. As always, we will continue to adjust our resources as volume and network performance dictate.","Despite the challenges experienced during the quarter, the team has remained focused on generating solid productivity results. We achieved best ever train size performance in our grain and manifest categories during the third quarter, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of best ever performance in our manifest network. The team also achieved third quarter records in our automotive, intermodal and coal categories. We were also able to generate productivity gains within our terminals as cars switched per employee day increased 3% during the third quarter.","To wrap up, looking forward, we will continue fine tuning our safety strategy to generate positive results year-over-year. And while we have made solid operating productivity gains throughout the year, our progress is far from over. Ultimately, running a safe, reliable, and efficient railroad creates an excellent customer experience and increases returns for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","Thanks and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue was $5.4 billion in the quarter, up 5% versus last year. Positive core price and increased fuel surcharge revenue offset the slight decrease in volumes for the quarter. Operating expense totaled $3.4 billion, up 6% from 2016. This includes the impact from Hurricane Harvey and the one-time expense associated with our workforce reduction plan. Operating income totaled $2 billion, a 3% increase from last year.","Below the line, other income totaled $151 million, up about $122 million from 2016. This increase includes the impact for both a large land scale and the settlement of a previous litigation matter. Interest expense of $180 million was down 2% compared to the previous year and this reflects the impact of a lower effective interest rate, offsetting a higher total debt balance.","Income tax expense increased 17% to $789 million, driven primarily by higher pre-tax earnings and the impact of the Illinois tax rate increase. Net income totaled $1.2 billion, up 6% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combine to produce third quarter earnings per share of $1.50.","The operating ratio was 62.8%, up 0.7 percentage points from the third quarter of last year. The combined impact of fuel price and the surcharge lag benefit had less than 0.5 point negative impact on the operating ratio, and had a neutral impact on earnings per share in the third quarter versus last year.","I want to take a minute to recap the one-time items, which we have called out over the past few months. Slide 20 provides a summary of these items, along with the third quarter impact on earnings per share and operating ratio. Above the line, we had the one-time cost associated with our workforce reduction, as well as the negative impact from Hurricane Harvey. Below the line, we had the negative impact of the Illinois state income tax adjustment which was more than offset by the positive impact from the large land sale as well as the litigation settlement. The net impact of all of these items resulted in a $0.06 headwind on our earnings per share and a negative 2.3 points on our operating ratio in the quarter.","Turning now to the top line, freight revenue of $5 billion was up 4% versus last year, despite a 1% decrease in volume. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $227 million, up $54 million when compared to 2016, and down slightly versus the second quarter of this year. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the third quarter was a positive 2%. The primary drivers of this positive mix were year-over-year growth in frac sand shipments, partially offset by decreases in grain carloadings, finished vehicle volumes and chemical movements.","Core price was nearly 2% in the quarter continuing the positive trend that we had experienced throughout the year. And as Beth previously mentioned, we are still facing some challenges with our coal and intermodal businesses. Excluding coal and intermodal, our core price was about 3%. For the full year, we continue to be on track with our pricing initiatives to generate a revenue benefit that exceeds our rail inflation costs.","Turning now to operating expense, slide 22 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense increased 9% versus 2016, including the impact from the workforce reduction plan which represented a majority of this increase. Excluding the workforce reduction impact, comp and benefits expense was up about 2% versus last year. We expect full year labor inflation to be in the 4% to 5% range. Productivity gains and a smaller capital workforce resulted in total workforce levels declining just under 2% in the quarter versus last year or about 700 employees. This does not include the impact of our workforce reduction plan, which will be reflected in our fourth quarter results.","Fuel expense totaled $450 million, up 15% when compared to last year. Higher diesel fuel prices and a 2% increase in gross ton-miles drove the increase in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 1% while our average fuel price increased 13% to $1.77 per gallon. Purchased services and materials expense increased 9% to $615 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher freight car expense associated with lease turnbacks, subsidiary contract services and hurricane-related costs.","Turning to slide 23, depreciation expense was $528 million, up 3% compared to 2016. For the full year 2017, we now estimate that depreciation expense will increase around 3% to 4%. The increase is primarily driven by a higher depreciable base, including our Positive Train Control assets that we put in place to date.","Moving to equipment and other rents, this expense totaled $275 million in the quarter, which is down 2% when compared to 2016. Lower locomotive and freight car lease expense were the primary drivers. Other expenses came in at $230 million, down 15% versus last year. The primary drivers were lower state and local taxes and an easier comparison in bad debt expense, given the Hanjin bankruptcy writeoff in 2016. For the full year 2017, we would expect other expense to decrease about 5% versus 2016.","Looking at our cash flow, cash from operations for the first three quarters of the year totaled about $5.4 billion, down 1% compared to last year. The decrease in cash was primarily related to a lower bonus depreciation benefit in 2017 compared to 2016, which was mostly offset by the increase in net income. Taking a look at adjusted debt levels, the all-in adjusted debt balance totaled about $19.4 billion at quarter end, up $1.6 billion since the start of the year. We finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of around 1.9 times, which is close to our target ratio of just under 2 times.","Dividend payments for the first three quarters totaled nearly $1.5 billion, up from almost $1.4 billion last year. In addition to dividends, we also bought back 27.1 million shares totaling $2.9 billion through the end of the third quarter. This represents a 34% increase over last year in terms of dollars spent. Of the 27.1 million shares repurchased year-to-date, we bought back 11.8 million of these shares, totaling about $1.3 billion in the third quarter. And since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased over 32% of our outstanding shares. Between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned about $4.4 billion to our shareholders through the first three quarters of this year, which represented 127% of net income over the same period.","On the productivity side, our G55 + 0 initiatives yielded around $70 million of productivity in the quarter. While this number is light relative to the first half of the year, indirect effects related to the hurricane and its impact on overall network operations likely overshadowed some additional productivity momentum. This brings our year-to-date total through the first three quarters to around $270 million. And with these results, we continue to progress as expected, and we are on track to meet our $350 million to $400 million productivity goal for the full year.","Looking forward to the balance of the year, we expect fourth quarter carloadings will increase slightly year-over-year, and we still expect full year carloading growth to be up in the low single digit range. With positive full year volume, positive core price, and significant productivity benefits, we are still on track to improve our full year operating ratio, including the net impact of all the one-time items that I just mentioned.","We are intently focusing on achieving a targeted 60%, plus or minus, operating ratio on a full year basis by 2019. And we remain committed to reaching our goal of a 55% operating ratio beyond 2019 as we continue the momentum of our volume, pricing, and productivity initiatives.","Before I turn it back to Lance, I would like to mention two other items. One, I would like to announce that we will be hosting an investor day on May 31, 2018, in Omaha, Nebraska. More details to follow, but we look forward to seeing you all here in Omaha next May. And finally, as you all know, Mary Jones has announced her retirement effective December 1. She is sitting right next to me right now. And we would like to thank her for her 37 years of service, including a record 18 years as Treasurer. So thank you, Mary.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thanks, Rob, and thank you, Mary. That was a great tribute.","Closing out, for the last few months of the year, we expect our business to be similar to this past quarter, with year-over-year challenges in coal and automotive somewhat offset by strength in other areas such as industrial products. As the economy continues to ebb and flow, we will focus on executing our value strategy. We'll use innovation to enhance our customer experience, while continuing to drive resource productivity throughout the organization as we progress our G55 + 0 initiatives. Looking ahead to 2018, our engaged team is laser focused on building on our recent success. Our goal is to continue creating long-term enterprise value for all four of our stakeholders as we improve our top line and progress toward our margin improvement targets. With that, let's open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. Due to the number of analysts joining us on the call today, please ask one primary question and one follow-up question to accommodate as many participants as possible.","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, great. Thanks for taking the call. I wanted to talk a little bit about sort of the pricing environment and as you look out into probably not the fourth quarter, but maybe 2018, just get a rough sense of maybe how you're starting to think about it as you're having discussions with customers. It looks like you had some acceleration on the core number this quarter and last quarter. How should we be thinking about just roughly the sort of pricing environment as we move into next year?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Beth.","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Chris, we are optimistic that the trucking tightening that we're seeing right now and what may come with the ELD implementation is going to provide an environment where we'll have an opportunity for pricing as well as some volume growth. But at the same time, we still do see that other things that will impact us will be other competitive modes of transportation, what's going on with economic demand, et cetera. As you know, we're still very committed to ensuring that we have pricing in place that offsets our inflation.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. All right. That's helpful. And with the backdrop that we're seeing with economic growth maybe picking up a little bit, we have some tightness. I guess, coupled with the moves you've done with some head count reductions, any sense of how we should be thinking about productivity? I know you need to get productivity every year in order to get to your longer term OR targets, but how should we be thinking about 2018 maybe in relation to 2017?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, we'll let Rob take that.","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, Chris, as you know, as part of our G55 + 0 initiative, we're all about continuing to drive robust productivity numbers as we have this year and as we have the last several years. So without giving you a number, I would just say that the unrelenting focus on continuing to drive productivity is embedded in our organization. And as we've always said, we do find benefit in our productivity initiatives with positive volume growth. And at this point in time, we are believing and hoping that the volume for 2018 will be on the positive side of the ledger.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, absolutely. We would love to see some growth to help us leverage. But in the absence of it, we'll continue to generate productivity.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the time, guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your questions.","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you, operator. And Mary, congratulations, this will be your last call that you'll have to deal with guys like me. Wanted to focus a little bit on the OR in the quarter. Rob, I think you mentioned some of the puts and takes from fuel being about 0.5% (sic) [0.5 point] (27:09) you said, and I think with the other stuff, it looks like if we would draw everything out, you guys are probably closer to a 60% OR. And Lance, I think you describe the fourth quarter as looking very similar to the third quarter. Did I get all those puts and takes right for looking forward?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah. So I'll start with fourth quarter looking like third quarter. That was largely right. You take the unusual items out, we expect continued robust productivity. We talked about slightly positive volumes. And so the environment, as we see the fourth quarter, looks about like the third quarter. Rob, you want to talk about...","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, Jason, I would just say you're right in terms of the way you were doing the math. Fuel was a headwind in the quarter of about 0.3 point and the items that I itemized were 2.3 points of headwind. That's the force reduction in the hurricane impact, which we certainly don't think those two are going to repeat. So if you do that math, you get down to a low 60% core performance, which we're very proud of in the third quarter.","Now, I wouldn't straightline because fourth quarters are always little bit different. You got different mix, you got different volume. But I would just tell you, we're continuing to be focused on the same initiatives that drove what we think is an outstanding performance in the third quarter to repeat in the fourth quarter. But I wouldn't straightline any of those numbers, per se.","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Follow-up I guess is going to be a little bit about the pricing side. The way I look at it, is obviously, you've had pressures in two of your bigger commodity groups, but it looks like one commodity group should at least start to get better here, let's say, in the next quarter or so. Is the way to think about it as more of a slow recovery in both those two groups, one of which is going to be just driven by what's going on in the truck market. And if that's correct, when do you think you'll start seeing the positive impacts from that?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","So I'm assuming the two groups you're referencing are coal and intermodal, which we called out.","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's correct.","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","And certainly coal is more of a rail-to-rail competition than truck. There's not as much truck activity in that segment. And so we'll continue to price into that environment, ensuring that we're reinvestable and getting the kind of returns that we want.","On the intermodal side, I agree with your assessment. There's lots of different competitors in that space, trucks and rail, IMCs, et cetera, and the tightening of trucks should provide a tailwind, but we are also continuing to keep an eye on what's happening with our competitors in that market space. And at this point, we're pretty hopeful that we're going to see the ability to get additional pricing and volume.","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you for the time, as always.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Sorry, I just kind of jumped over to the call here, so I've missed some things, I think. But how would you view, I guess, the volume impact looking into next year as you've got \u2013 the economy feels pretty good, you've got a number of probably kind of puts and takes in terms of maybe frac sand coal, things that could be headwinds. But are you optimistic looking into 2018 that you can see, I don't know, meaningful volume growth, call it, 2% type of volume growth, or do you think that there's some headwinds that are going to make that maybe difficult to achieve?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Hey, Tom. This is Lance. I'll start by kind of sharing our overall perspective and then let Beth fill in some blanks. So overall as we look into 2018, we are somewhat optimistic, right? There's a number of markers that look promising. One is the truck market; it is becoming kind of consensus knowledge that truck capacity might very well tighten, the ELD will have an impact of some kind, and that's a good environment. That's good for us when that occurs.","It feels to us like the overall economy continues to move along. I'd like to see it accelerate a bit. But consumers feel, to us, like they are buying stuff at a reasonable pace not a kind of a pre-recession normal pace yet. I think that'll show up in housing starts. So there's a number of relatively positive things. There's some continued headwinds, though, as well, right? Coal remains somewhat of a question mark. What exactly happens in the grain markets, and the worldwide feed and grain markets are still somewhat of a question mark. And of course we continue to face a robust competitive environment, notwithstanding that that environment, at its base level, looks like it's improving.","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","If you want to talk a little bit more specifically about a few markets we're pretty excited about, we continue to feel good about our ability to grow the new Cold Connect platform that we have, focused on food and refrigerated products. Mexico remains a great opportunity for us. There's certainly uncertainty around what happens with NAFTA, but we believe that market is a growth opportunity for us across a variety of submarkets. And, of course, the plastics expansions will give us some opportunities in 2018 and beyond.","Frac sand, as you called out, may have some headwinds, but we view it as there's more than one place that oil is being drilled for in the United States and certainly in the Permian, you're going to see some in-basin sand come online, but we do view the entire pie for frac sand as growing. And we think that we have opportunities in other places like the Eagle Ford and Oklahoma, possibly in the Front Range as well for frac sand shipments. So I think we feel pretty good about some potential there. And if we see housing really go up, that would be a great opportunity for us.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","So, I mean, if you put it \u2013 without saying, oh, it's going to \u2013 volumes are going to grow at a certain level, when you put the puts and takes together, do you say, yeah, we got to get to volume growth next year, and maybe it's a couple points, maybe it's plus or minus, but is it reasonable to think you put them all together, it's more positive than negative?","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","Tom, this is Rob. As you know, we're not going to give precise numbers around what that volume all adds up to, but we are confident that you add up everything that Lance and Beth just went through, it's going to be on the positive side of the ledger. So we'll work to be as successful in that as we positively can, but I would just reiterate all the things we just said are a fabulous commercial for the wonderful diversity that we have in our network and the strength that that offers us. So we have lots of opportunities to grow our business. And at this point in time, it all adds up to a positive volume assumption.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then just one quick one, and I apologize if you mentioned this, but how much of your book would you touch in terms of repricing in 2018, what percent?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","We're kind of typically in around a two-thirds under contract or under letter quote environment with more of a one-third that's quoting on either a spot basis or a tariff basis.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","So the letter quote would be one year, presumably? Do you know how much per letter?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, sorry. I should have been clearer about that. Yeah.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","How much (35:13)","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Those have the potential to roll off sometime in the year next year.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Right, so how much would the letter quote be? Is that like (35:20)","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","We're not going to get into those details, Tom.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. It sounds like you've got a lot of the book you could touch next year, so all right. Great. Thank you for the time. Appreciate it.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks. And good morning. So historically, we've always heard a lot from the rails about the addressable market for highway conversions as it relates to the intermodal business, but given the tightness we've seen in truckload, I was just curious if you could speak to what the opportunity looks like within your general merchandise network. Is there any way to frame up that addressable market or growth potential that you see from highway conversions in general merchandise?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, thanks Justin. This is Lance. Taking at a very high level, historically, and we still believe this, we've talked about a very large addressable truck market. Our current product today takes us comfortably down into a market where, if the length of haul is 500 miles-plus, it's an opportunity for us. And there's lots and lots of truckload capability there. What we're focused on is making sure that the experience with us in that journey of shipping product feels as good, if not better, than it feels all along the way with truck. I'll let Beth talk more specifically to the opportunities within that market.","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, so we do believe that the intermodal market, and possibly even conversion into boxcar off the highway is a big opportunity for us, and our focus is really on taking advantage of our great franchise where we offer intermodal service in many more lanes than our direct competitor, which we think gives us opportunities to grow at a decent pace as the market turns our way with truck capacity tightening.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Great. And as a follow-up and maybe this one is for you, Beth. I think there's going to be a lot more focus on the chemicals business as we get into next year, could you help us think about the potential growth in your chemicals franchise as we get into 2018 and beyond? And do you think we'll be at a point where that chemicals business can start growing at a pace that's above GDP?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","So there are, as you know, close to $200 billion that have been put into the Gulf Coast chemical franchise to grow mostly plastics, although there are industrial chemicals investments happening as well. And while that is a very substantial investment and a wonderful opportunity for us, it certainly isn't the size of some of our other markets. We would hope to see growth in those markets in the tens of thousands of carloads, not in the hundreds of thousands of carloads.","And some of the things that'll be a governor for us is not all of that plastics in particular is going to want to move domestically. A lot of it will have an export solution. A lot of it will go out of the Port of Houston, but we will do our best to participate in providing our customers with supply chain solutions, should they not be able to use the Port of Houston because of capacity constraints and want to use a West Coast port where we've developed an opportunity to do that near our Dallas Intermodal facility.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","The good news is \u2013 and Rob talked about this \u2013 our franchise is built for the long run and overall global economic growth for the long run. So you get that beautiful chemical franchise on the Gulf Coast and it'll start out producing and shipping at certain quantity and certain direction, but really, who can make the call over the course of the next 10 or 20 or 30 years, other than we're pretty confident consumption is going to increase worldwide and we've got a wonderful franchise to be able to ship it.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Makes sense. Thanks for the time this morning.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO. Please proceed with your questions.","Fadi Chamoun - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Thank you. Good morning. So if we were to think about volume being up, say, 2% next year, how should we think about the head count? I mean, if you're sort of aiming to that kind of 60-ish percent operating ratio in 2019, I would think head count would have to stay kind of flat or even down a little bit to get you to that number. I'm just trying to reconcile a little bit this sort of 2019 target with the outlook for the head count.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, Fadi, without getting into the details, we've outlined the moving parts this morning, so we're going to have pretty substantial reduction in our general and administrative overhead, which we've already talked about. Then as we look at how we react to volume, it's the moving pieces of what we can do on productivity, so that we're not growing our head count one-to-one with volume growth. That's our intent year-over-year, it's what we've been able to do and we're going to continue to do that next year.","Fadi Chamoun - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just following up on some of the pricing questions. Earlier in the prepared remarks you talked about the fact that you're still seeing some pressure in intermodal and coal, but just given that the core pricing gains have accelerated for two consecutive quarters, is it fair to infer that some of these pressures that you've been facing have begun to ease a little bit? And if yes, maybe if you can talk about what might be driving that.","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","We have maybe seen a little bit of easing in the competitive pressure, but it's not substantial. We're still \u2013 I would say that we're getting good pricing, and I think Rob referenced that, outside of those two markets. That's more like a 3%, so that's helping us to continue to put up good pricing numbers.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then as a follow-up question, one of your competitors discussed expectations for rail inflation for 2018 and cited something around 1.9%. Is that how you're looking at it as well? And maybe you could just share your view about that. And, Rob, I know you mentioned the labor inflation of 4% to 5% this year, but could you remind us what the expectation for all-in inflation is for 2017?","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","Yes. Allison, this year \u2013 you're exactly right, this year, we've said that all-in inflation's around 3%, with labor, 4% to 5%. As we look to next year, we haven't finalized our numbers yet, but I would say both are going to look closer to 2%...","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay.","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","All-in and labor.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. Lance, I guess I wanted to follow up off of Tom's question about the volume outlook in 2018, and it's really not prescriptive for guidance next year. But when you think about your franchise and we think about railroads in North America, there's clear examples of networks that can drive a lot of growth. It does seem to be a robust economy, both from an intermodal and industrial energy perspective. So I guess as I look back at your slides at your last analyst meeting, there's always this modest volume outlook. Is there anything structurally you can do on the network that can really leverage this low-cost base and really, the irreplaceable assets that you have that can drive a faster growth outlook looking forward? Or are you guys really just capped with the ebbs and flows of GDP?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thanks for the question, Brandon. I'll start backwards and go forwards in the question. We are not capped as either an industrial production growth rate, a GDP growth rate. When you think about our ability to grow, we're not behaving in a vacuum. So part of the equation is how our franchise lays what's happening in the underlying economies that we serve. So fundamentally, our growth is built on global trade, industrial production, the industrial economy, and U.S. consumption of stuff.","And in that context, then, we face competition, either modal competition or direct rail competition. So when I build that model in my mind, when I'm setting my own expectations, I feel pretty optimistic about how our network lands on areas of potential growth. We serve Mexico; we enjoy virtually 70% of the to and from freight rail business with Mexico. Virtually 40% of our business is originated or terminated outside the United States. We serve very large population and growing population centers in the western two-thirds of the United States. And we touch a lot of different pieces of the economy.","So from a potential perspective, I feel pretty good about it. After that, it's all about can we find a business that's reinvestable and secure it in the competitive environment. And that's always a wild card and we're always positioning ourselves to be the high value, best option with our customers, and we're going to continue to do that. But to your point, Brandon, nothing would please me more than to see a really strong, robust growth environment because we know how to leverage that very, very effectively.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate that. And Beth, I just wanted to circle back to your international intermodal comments. It does seem like we're seeing peak ocean volumes right now, so can you walk us through again why you guys aren't seeing a lot of that expansion? I think it's because you've seen port shifts with the carrier consolidation, but could we talk through that again?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","I would say I believe we are seeing the volume. Last year we still had some Hanjin loads which, of course, they went away and their volume kind of dispersed across the other carriers. So if you took the Hanjin impact out, where we are sitting at a 1%, but if you took that Hanjin out of the comparison, we'd be at 5%, which is pretty commensurate with what's actually happening in the market.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.","Thanks very much and good morning.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Good morning.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.","I wanted to ask one on productivity. The train length question gets asked a lot, but you've also had pretty good gains in terminal productivity year-to-date. Just wondering if you can give us some color on what's driving that?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Cameron?","Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.","Inside our terminals, volume remains very predictable and very stable, and that allows you to really bear down on the productivity inside each and every terminal. So that looks very positive as you think about the year 2018. The only area of growth that we see where we might struggle a little bit is out in West Texas, as Beth mentioned. The rest of the network looks very positive.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.","And then just separately, I appreciate this is low value traffic, but just curious whether China's pending restrictions on scrap are having an impact on international intermodal in so far as they reduce the potential source of back haul traffic?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, it is \u2013 scrap paper is a portion of the back haul traffic and it is, I'd call it, a mild concern. We are pretty actively looking for other match-back opportunities and we've implemented some programs with our customers to \u2013 and with the steamship lines to use their containers for domestic loads in places where we might not have domestic containers, which doesn't give them a match-back all the way to China, but it might give them a match-back to the West Coast. So we're pretty focused on helping them fill that gap and being good partners in that regard.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Cherilyn, that's something we don't talk a lot about but that's a manifestation of \u2013 kind of a granular manifestation of the value of having the franchise that we do is that we have a lot of exposure to match-back opportunities for West Coast exports, and that can be a real value-add for our international steamship partners.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.","Thank you. That's all for me.","Operator","The next question is from the line of David Vernon with AllianceBernstein.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for the taking the time. I wanted to ask you a question about the domestic intermodal market and what you guys can maybe do to help capitalize on that conversion opportunity, because the volume growth, on a reported basis, for intermodal has always been a little bit lighter. You guys have done a great job taking up yields.","I'm just wondering as you think about how you work with your channel partners, how you manage the two box pools that you have, how you take that intermodal product to market through streamline. Is there something you can do that you can sort of accelerate that domestic opportunity? And then as you think about what's happening in the eastern market with one of your partners kind of redesigning maybe some of its intermodal services, if that's going to create some either opportunities of challenges for you. If you could comment on, that'd be great.","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, so we continue to be very bullish on the opportunity that intermodal provides domestically for Union Pacific over the long term. And we are unique, as you've described, with our two box programs and the ability to bringing assets to bear and help customers meet their supply chain needs. So we are very focused on \u2013 we're always looking at opportunities to get into new markets, provide new services, provide stronger value proposition to customers, and with that, we work across all the channel partners. We see very strong parcel growth this year. But as you say, the overall domestic has been a little weaker, and that's really been more of a competitive pricing situation. And we are and will continue to be focused on yields.","We believe that with the tightening of the truck capacity, that's going to open up some opportunities for us. You said a little bit about the CSX's changes in their intermodal network. At this point, I think they're rationalizing some lanes that are local to them that maybe don't make as much sense for them to stay in. And we're just staying in real close communication to make sure that we preserve the viability of that UMAX product and put it in a position where it can grow as we have opportunities.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Recall, David, that we've got those two branded box programs, one each with each of our good partners in the east, the NS and the CSX, and they are both robust potential growths engines.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And maybe Rob, just thinking about the CapEx, obviously the 3Q numbers probably impacted a little bit by the weather and some idling of work crews. Wanted to get your thoughts on the ability to kind of keep CapEx at a little bit lower level here as some of the growth is in some of the lighter weight traffic areas and you've got some idle capacity from kind of the coal traffic coming off.","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, David, I would just say. I assume you're talking about looking forward 2018 (52:00)","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah, long-range. Well, yeah (52:02).","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","I mean we constantly, of course, as a matter of process are always in tune to being as disciplined and wise about every capital dollar we spend, and it's based on a very rigorous evaluation of what the expected returns are. But the guidance I would give you is that 15% of revenue spent. I mean, again, as you know, that's not how we build our budget, but that's still the right way to look at it looking forward.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah, and then...","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","And one thing, David, I heard you say that I want to make sure we don't leave you with this impression, and that is all the potential growth is happening in areas where we've got excess capacity. We do have excess capacity in parts of our network, but clearly there are other parts like down in Texas where the capacity is much more constrained.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah, no, I was just wondering if there was going to be any need to step up a little bit of growth CapEx to pursue the intermodal opportunity broadly, or if you feel like you can kind of work that through the existing capita in both, obviously addressing bottlenecks as they happen.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, Rob's got it right from the standpoint of long term, we're comfortable with where we've guided.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks a lot for the color.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thanks. Morning. So I apologize if some of this was addressed, we're bouncing between a couple calls. Hopefully, it can be coordinated better next time. Just for you on sand, what percent of your sand business is going to Permian versus other basins? And then what's the strategy as some of the local stuff comes online, if it's going to come, there's nothing we can do about it, or do you think about changing the pricing on the longer haul stuff to compete with the Permian sand?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Well, I don't think we've ever provided exactly what the percentage is of Permian, but we have a good-sized book of business into the Permian as well as the Eagle Ford, smaller books of business into Oklahoma and the DJ Basin sort of area. And off the top of my head, I couldn't even give you the percentages if I had to. But what I would say is they all provide some growth opportunities. Permian will certainly be challenged by in-basin sand coming on that's of a certain mesh type. We do believe there will be opportunities to continue to bring some of the coarser meshes in from the Wisconsin and Minnesota range and continue to compete in Permian.","And I would say the Permian overall pie, I think, is still going to continue to grow even with in-basin sand coming on. So we'll certainly be looking to grow there, but we'll be looking to grow in Eagle Ford, Oklahoma, and Colorado as well. And as far as lowering rates to try to compete with local sand, that's a pretty tough proposition. And I think we're always going to stay very focused on being reinvestable and getting a good yield for the assets that we're employing.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, that makes sense. So if I just heard you right, you think even Permian sand volumes are up next year.","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","I think the whole Permian sand consumption is up next year. It remains to be seen how much of that will get filled with local sand versus sand coming in from another location.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Oh, okay. That makes sense. Okay. And then Lance, just in terms of the head count reductions, is that \u2013 I guess I'm surprised that that doesn't take up the productivity target for the year, so maybe just a thought there. But more bigger picture, do you think \u2013 is this one of, hey, there's many things like this we can do or is this, hey, this was one specific opportunity and we did it, but don't think that there's lots more like this? I'm just trying to understand if this was a one and done or one of many.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, so Scott, I'll take your first question about productivity targets. We have not changed our productivity targets. This decrease in our overhauled general and administrative head count is going to be absorbed into those. Our communication with you and our drive amongst ourselves has always been we've set out our marker and we're doing everything in our power to get and accelerate productivity, as well as growth, as well as price, so that we can meet or exceed the markers that we've laid out.","And in terms of this particular action, reducing our overall head count by 800 plus or minus in this one action, clearly, I don't think that we're going to be taking that kind of action over and over and over again. Candidly, it's something we'd prefer not to do if we don't need to. But I would say that we have many granular projects inside of Grow to 55 and 0 [G55 + 0] that have anywhere between some relatively small impact to some relatively large impact that we're pursuing. And that will inform how much productivity we build into our plans in 2018 and beyond.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your questions.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks very much. So just clarification on the inflation for next year, I know you mentioned labor in there. Can you just break out labor as to what you expect labor inflation to be in 2018? I know you signalled it for Q4, but just wanted to confirm on next year what you were expecting in the labor side.","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, Walter, I earlier said that \u2013 to the question of inflation, and I was talking about 2018, that we expect overall inflation and overall labor to be closer to 2% versus what they're running this year. And at this point, I'm not going to break out the labor component but, of course, not only do you have wages in there, but you also have the moving part of the health and welfare.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Right. Okay. But you're not breaking that out for 2018 yet?","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","Not at this point, no.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Okay. And just the tax rate is still going to be steady at 37.5%?","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, that's a reasonable assumption, yeah.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Right. And then the last one, the other line \u2013 in your other line in operating expenses, it does tend to move around a lot. I know you've got \u2013 your guidance has been kind of \u2013 was up and now it's kind of down, and just wondering whether is that a line item that we should, when we look at our 2018, look at 2017 as an exceptional year in terms of being down, or is this a representative year now that we can build on some normal growth rate in line with your overall inflation going into next year? Just want to make sure, because that's a lumpy line item, whether there was something in 2017 that made it a little bit not necessarily repeatable for next year.","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, Walter, I'm going to disappoint you, because we're not going to give guidance on that number, not because we're withholding but because there is a lot of moving parts, to your point. And it can and will be lumpy. So stay tuned. But we generally say in the $150-ish million neighborhood is what it's looked like historically for other income. But it can be lumpy. I mean, you have lots of moving parts in there.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Sure. I was referencing your other in the other expenses.","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","(59:44)","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","We expect to be lumpy as well, not maybe as lumpy as other income. But we're not going to give guidance on that because you're right, there are a lot of moving parts. But we've typically said in the $200 million range, but I would caution you that it can move up and down with unusual items.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Ariel Rosa with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.","Ariel Rosa - BofA Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, guys. So wanted to start out on the network fluidity metrics, I think we saw a come couple of those tick up in the quarter, I was hoping you could just delineate what might have been due to the impact of Hurricane Harvey versus what you think in terms of fourth quarter and kind of resumption of positive progress, and how you're seeing kind of network fluidity, not only for your network but also kind of interchanges with other carriers.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Interchanges with other carriers look very fluid across the network, up and down the Mississippi. No issues there. Our own velocity was greatly impacted by Hurricane Harvey. In fact, it's one of the larger events that our network has suffered from a weather perspective.","The opportunity looking towards 2018 lies in our train crews becoming more familiar with the PTC technology that we've rolled out, both on the west and the northern region, and we feel that that is something that we can tackle internally. It's not a technology problem, it's our crews becoming more proficient at using the technology.","Ariel Rosa - BofA Merrill Lynch","Okay that's helpful. And then just to switch gears a little bit, obviously, there was the land sale this quarter, was hoping you could maybe discuss that in a little bit more detail and what additional opportunities there might be for additional land sales?","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, we did announce the land sale earlier, but we announced it because of the size of it and wanted to give some perspective on the financial impact. But we're not going to give any details on that specific transaction. But I would just say that we have a sophisticated professional real estate organization, so our selling real estate, when we find an opportunity, is something we continually do. I mean, again, it can be lumpy, as I indicated in the other income question earlier on the call, but I would say that's something our professional real estate folks are always looking at, but it will be lumpy, and we're continuing looking at where there are opportunities, where it's an asset that is no longer needed, long term, for the benefit of the rail. And that's kind of how we approach it.","Ariel Rosa - BofA Merrill Lynch","I'll tell you what, maybe if I could ask a follow-up and just ask it slightly differently. Where are you, when you look at your network, where would you say you are in terms of resource needs versus where you'd like to be? You said some capacity tightness in Texas but maybe some loose capacity, other areas; across your network, where do you feel are you on just general research needs?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah. So let's just walk you around real quick. The major east-west line from the Pacific Northwest, California, NorCal that runs through Wyoming and on into Chicago; in the Wyoming, Nebraska, Iowa, Chicago areas, we've got a lot of capacity there. It was built up for our coal business, and our coal business is about half of what it used to be.","If you're over on the West Coast, West Coast has good solid open capacity. We'd love to use that for more shipments up and down the I-5 and growth in Las Vegas, the SoCal area and Phoenix. When you move over down towards Texas, and let's say north-south between Chicago and Texas, and just next Texas and Louisiana themselves, the north-south routes have good solid capacity availability. We still have capacity in certain routes in Texas and Louisiana, but that's the area where when we're focusing on new capacity, when we're focusing on significant capital spend, it is likely to occur there.","Ariel Rosa - BofA Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's great color. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your questions.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah, thanks for taking my question here. I wanted to follow-up on a couple of earlier questions on what a tightening truckload market means for UP? And specifically, do your contractual relationships with your key domestic intermodal partners, do they allow you the flexibility to push a bit harder on pricing next year or in tight years, in general, compared to the last few years that have been weaker? Or are those escalators fairly fixed and really predefined on a year-to-year basis?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Beth?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Well, we don't typically give a lot of color on specific contractual arrangements with customers, but I would say that we have opportunities out there, most of the bid process for domestic intermodal happens in the spring time, as you know, as they go out to bid for their whole books with beneficial cargo owners. So if truck capacity remains tight and maybe even tightens with ELD, certainly we would hope to see some opportunity to address pricing in that bid period. And we are very hopeful that our long-term partners are able to get pricing in their markets and that that will flow to us as well. And additionally, we really, really would like to see the volume growth along with it.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah. And I think in international intermodal, which it felt like part of your question was towards, that tends to be long-term contracts.","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Yes. Sorry about that. (01:05:38)","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Understood. So in the domestic business, just to clarify, you should see some benefit in the parts of your business where you own the boxes and control some of the assets, perhaps coincident with the bid season, but some of the longer term contracts, either in international or domestic, may be kind of less flexible to the near-term rise in the market. Is that a fair way to put it or (01:06:04)","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, I think that's a very fair characterization.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","All right. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning and appreciate getting me on the call here. Just a couple of quick ones. Cam, I know you mentioned some of the rollout with PTC have an impact on velocity. Was wondering if you could \u2013 if you have a chance to quantify that, and then also, what sort of milestones you're looking at next. It sounds like you've got a better handle on what you need to do in some of the regions, but are there any other milestones that you're looking at that could be significant, maybe not this year, but perhaps in 2018, getting to going live beyond that?","Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.","The velocity impact is somewhere between half mile an hour and mile an hour right now as we see it, because we have rolled out completely on the west and on the north. The vast majority of that opportunity lies within the training and familiarity of the technology with our crews, so it is something we can address.","Ahead of us is the southern region implementation in 2018. We see no issues with meeting all the federal requirements in that year. And we'll continue to problem solve the technology when we run into areas that need a technology patch to solidify the whole PTC system.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Hey, Brian. Giving you a little kind of color on that velocity number that Cam just shared. That's a very loosey-goosey number, right. We try to parse that together as best we can. It's kind of hard to tease that out specifically. Leave it said that it's a real impact and the most important thing that Cameron has in front of him is we believe the impact is all about crew behavior. So in your mind's eye, if you think about this, there's a screen in front of the crew and inside the PTC system, pretty much all it does is warn you when it's thinking you're going to need to take action.","So half the time, the screen is flashing at you a warning, and I think human behavior is to not have the screen tell you about a warning. That's a little bit of a design issue that I think the overall industry is going to have to get into, because that drives behavior then to be more cautious than necessary, and that then retards the overall velocity on the system. So it's a pretty complex number of moving parts, it's hard to say exactly what the impact that is. But Cameron's given you a general idea of it is impactful and we've got to route forward to address it.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, so it sounds like it's more user interface and not something in the technology that you've encountered so far.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah. Totally.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just one quick follow-up on just cross border activity into Mexico. Obviously, we saw a new agreement between a competitor and the KCS at Laredo, was wondering if you've actually seen any sort of impact on your business through that gateway so far? Thank you.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, we continue to grow through that gateway over the long run. We are familiar with all competitive products. And we understand, to our chagrin, we're not going to be able to handle every single carload that is made available to and from Mexico, but we are very pleased with our partners and our products and we're doing everything in our power to profitably grow those products.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for your time.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Diane Huang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, this is Diane on for Ravi Shanker. Thanks for squeezing us in on the call. Just a question regarding the tentative agreement reached between a group of labor unions and the costs on rails. Can you share your initial thoughts on how that agreement stacks up versus your expectations? And also, on the agreement, it looks like it states a 2.5% to 3% pay increase in 2018 and 2019, so wondering why that differs from the 2% labor inflation that you guys expect next year. Thank you.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thanks for the question, Diane. Not surprisingly, I'm not going to be able to make too many specific comments on either the negotiation or this specific tentative agreement. I will tell you that tentative agreement is in industry with about 60% of the industries collectively bargained employment population, and it is out for ratification, as we speak.","Diane Huang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Do you have a timeline for \u2013 or what is your expected timeline for the ratification?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Well, we don't have a specific timeline for it. All I can tell is you that each committee has to ratify vote, and once that's accomplished, then we can call it a done deal and start implementing. I think that's the detail I can give you.","Diane Huang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you for the time.","Operator","The next is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good morning, everybody. So I joined a little late. Sorry if this question was asked and answered, but wanted to just understand the breakdown between contracted and maybe transactional business next year, especially given the expectation for what truck capacity may do next year. Just specifically, how much of next year's businesses are already contracted and maybe how should we expect if there is any lag between your ability to see core pricing growth for the overall enterprise versus maybe the backdrop of the overall market? Thanks.","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, we did get this one earlier and so I'll give you the same answer, which is that we see typically that our business is about two-thirds contracted and then about one-third moving in any particular year.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's easy enough. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thank you, Amit.","Operator","Thank you. We've come to the end of our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing remarks.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thank you very much, Rob. For the last few months of the year, we expect our business to be similar to this past quarter, with year-over-year challenges in coal and automotive, somewhat offset by strength in other areas such as industrial products. As the economy continues to ebb and flow, we're going to focus on executing our value strategy. We'll use innovation to enhance our customer experience, while continuing to drive resource productivity throughout the organization as we progress our Grow to 55 and Zero initiatives. As we look ahead to 2018, our engage team is laser focused on building upon our recent success.","Operator","Thank you.","Lance M.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz, you may now begin.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's first quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Cameron Scott, the Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of nearly $1 billion for the first quarter of 2016. This equates to $1.16 per share, which compares to $1.30 in the first quarter of 2015. Total volume decreased 8% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in four of our six commodity groups, with coal and industrial products down 34% and 10% respectively. Automotive continued to be a bright spot this quarter, with carloads up 7% versus 2015.","Our quarterly operating ratio [OR] came in at 65.1%, up only 0.3 percentage point from the first quarter last year, as solid core pricing and productivity improvements helped offset the significant decrease in total volumes. In this challenging volume environment, we've continued our intense focus on operating safely and efficiently, managing our resources, and improving our customer experience.","Our team will give you more of the details, starting with Eric.","Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.","Thanks, Lance, and good morning.","In the first quarter, our volume was down 8%, with the gain in automotive and solid chemicals volume more than offset by declines in the other businesses. While we generated core pricing gains of just over 2.5%, it was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharges and significant mix headwinds, as average revenue per car declined 6% in the quarter. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 14% reduction in freight revenue.","Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups. Ag products revenue was down 6% on a 4% percent volume reduction and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain volume declined 7%, as strength in domestic feed markets was more than offset by soft export demand. Domestic feed grain was up 4%, as animal counts increased and there was less local grain available in our key domestic destination markets in the Mid-South and West. Exports declined 26%, as ample worldwide production and the strong dollar continued to hamper U.S. grain exports.","Grain products volume declined 6% in the quarter. DDGs were down 29%, driven by a decline in exports to China and increased inclusion in feed rations in the Midwest. Soybean meal carloads were down 9%, as U.S. exports declined from last year's record sales. Ethanol volumes were flat despite lower margins and higher inventories. Food and refrigerated product carloads grew 3%, driven by continued strength in demand for import beer.","Automotive revenue was down 1% in the quarter, as a 7% increase in volume was more than offset by an 8% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments increased 5%, driven by consumer demand for technology and safety features. The seasonally adjusted annual rate [SAAR] for first quarter automotive sales was 17.1 million vehicles, above last year levels of 16.7 million vehicles but below the fourth quarter pace of 17.8 million vehicles. Lower fuel prices sustained increased demand for light-duty trucks and sport utility vehicles over passenger cars. On the parts side, strong vehicle production increases and the continued focus on over-the-road conversions drove a 10% increase in volume.","Chemicals revenue was down 2% for the quarter on flat volume and a 3% decrease in average revenue per car. Year-over-year crude oil shipments were down 32% due to lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads. Chemical volumes excluding crude oil shipments were up 4% in the quarter. Fertilizer was down 8%, due primarily to weak global potash demand. Soft domestic agricultural economics also was a headwind for fertilizer volumes. Strength in other areas, including growth in industrial chemicals and LPG volumes, offset the declines in crude oil and fertilizer shipments.","Coal revenue declined 43% in the quarter on a 34% volume decline and a 13% decrease in average revenue per car. Powder River Basin rail shipments were down 38%, and Colorado\/Utah volumes were down 35% in the quarter, as the warm winter, low natural gas prices, and soft exports continue to negatively impact coal demand. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this was the warmest winter on record. With natural gas prices around $2.00 or less for much of the first quarter, PRB coal inventory levels are at 108 days, 41 days above the five-year average.","Industrial products revenue was down 18% on a 10% decline in volume and a 9% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. Mineral volumes were down 38% year over year for the quarter. Frac sand carloadings decreased 49% due to reduced drilling activity and market shifts to local ground sand. Metal shipments were down 13% due to the strong U.S. dollar, weak commodity pricing, reduced drilling, and increased imports. Demand for construction products, particularly rock and cement, improved 5% in the quarter, driven by favorable weather conditions which supported construction activity. Waste volume was also up 14% during the quarter, driven by growth in dirt shipments.","Intermodal revenue was down 9% in the quarter on 3% lower volume and a 6% decrease in average revenue per unit. Domestic shipments declined by 3% in the quarter, primarily driven by high inventory levels and continued sluggish retail sales. The U.S. Census Bureau reported business inventories were unchanged during the quarter, and further declines in sales pushed the number of months it would take to clear shelves of inventory to the highest level since 2009.","International Intermodal volume was down 3% due to trans-Pacific market challenges. Slower global trade continues to pressure trans-Pacific rates, resulting in ocean carrier rationalization, and market share losses by Union Pacific-aligned carriers. The return of competitive premium services at P&W also contributed to our volume declines in Intermodal.","To wrap up, let's take a closer look at our outlook for the rest of the year. Many economic projections continue to forecast market volatility and a sluggish economy. Although we face economic challenges, our diverse franchise continues to provide growth opportunities. In Ag products, strong worldwide crop production suggests little change to the current export environment, and we expect Gulf wheat will continue to be softer in the first half of the year due to large global wheat supply and U.S. competitiveness in world markets. Partially offsetting global macroeconomic conditions, we anticipate strength in domestic corn, driven by increased poultry production. We also expect import beer growth.","Turning to autos, light vehicle sales are forecasted at 17.8 million vehicles, a 2% increase above the 2015 seasonally adjustable annual rate of 17.5 million vehicles, driving both finished autos and parts, including over-the-road conversions. While we expect low gasoline prices will continue to sustain demand, we remain cautious with respect to auto sales supporting these levels.","Due to declines in the demand for coal, we expect volume to be down significantly. High inventory stockpiles and low natural gas prices will continue to impact demand. As always, electricity consumption will be driven by weather conditions.","Our Chemicals franchise is expected to remain steady through 2016, with growth in LPG markets and industrial chemicals. Strained agricultural economics and soft wheat exports are expected to put downward pressure on the fertilizer market this year. Year-over-year weakness in crude shipments is expected to continue for the balance of the year.","In industrial products, mineral volumes are expected to be down as a result of weak drilling demand. We anticipate strength in lumber and construction volumes, with rock as the biggest driver of growth. The strong dollar could continue to create headwinds for our metals market.","Finally, in Intermodal, we see growth potential in domestic Intermodal from highway conversions, though muted by high retail inventories and sluggish retail sales. With trans-Pacific market challenges, we expect continued volatility in international Intermodal. As we navigate worldwide economic uncertainties, we will continue to stay focused on strengthening our customer value proposition and cultivating new business opportunities across our diverse franchise.","With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an operating update.","Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Railroad Co.","Thanks, Eric, and good morning.","Starting with our safety performance, our first quarter reportable personal injury rate improved 12% versus 2015 to a record low of 0.75 [incidents per 200,000 employee-hours]. These results continue to validate the effectiveness of our comprehensive strategy in finding and addressing risk in the workplace.","With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our first quarter reportable rate of 3.23 [incidents per 1 million train miles] increased slightly versus last year. However, enhanced TE&Y [Train, Engine & Yard] training and continued infrastructure investment helped reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those that do not meet the reportable threshold, to a record low.","In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased to 2.37 [accidents per 1 million train miles], as we took a step backward from last year's solid performance. However, we are confident that our focus on reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns will drive improvement in the future.","In summary for overall safety, the team has carried forward the momentum from last year's record results as we progress towards an incident-free environment.","In addition to safety, we have continued to make significant incremental progress in our operating metrics. As reported to the AAR [American Association of Railroads], velocity and terminal dwell improved 11% and 7% respectively when compared to the first quarter of 2015. In fact, our first quarter velocity of 27.3 miles per hour was the best ever at the level of volume handled during the quarter. We were able to generate this solid performance even in the face of March flooding events that impacted operations on several key routes in the southern region of our network. To minimize delays and disruptions for our customers, we temporarily utilized a portion of our surge locomotive fleet and recalled TE&Y crews, mostly from alternative work status, as our employees worked around the clock to restore operations.","Moving on to resources, driven by the decline in volume and improved network fluidity, our total TE&Y workforce was down 22% in the first quarter versus the same period in 2015. Almost half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline. In lieu of hiring new employees, we have recalled some furloughed employees to backfill attrition where needed. As a result, the number of TE&Y employees either furloughed or in alternative work status has declined slightly from 3,900 [employees] at the beginning of the year. Our active locomotive fleet was down 15% from the first quarter of 2015.","In addition, we also continue to adjust other aspects of our business to lower demand. At the end of the first quarter, we had around 600 total engineering and mechanical employees on furlough as well.","While balancing our resources continues to be a key focus, we also continue to realize efficiency gains through many other productivity initiatives. One primary area where we continue to make progress is in train length. While we were unable to overcome the volume decline within Intermodal, we did run record train lengths in all other major categories. We were also able to generate efficiency gains within terminals, as initiatives led to record terminal productivity, even with a 5% decline in the number of cars switched. Overall, we've continued to intensify our focus on productivity and efficiency across the network.","In summary, we've made solid progress to start off the year and completed the quarter on a strong footing. Moving forward, we expect to further momentum as we focus on those critical initiatives that will drive improvement. First and foremost is safety, where we expect once again to yield record results on our way toward zero incidents.","While near-term uncertainty remains in the current volume environment, we will continue adjusting our resources to demand while also realizing productivity through other company initiatives to further reduce costs. This includes our capital investments, where we have adjusted our 2016 capital program down by $75 million to $3.675 billion. Over the longer term, we are in a tremendous position to leverage volume growth to the bottom line through increased utilization of existing assets. As a result, we will enhance our value proposition with an excellent customer experience.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","Thanks, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our first quarter results.","Operating revenue was $4.8 billion in the quarter, down 14% versus last year. Significantly lower volumes, a challenging business mix, and lower fuel surcharges more than offset solid core pricing achieved in the quarter.","Operating expenses totaled about $3.1 billion. Strong productivity improvements, along with volume-related reductions and lower fuel costs, drove the 14% improvement compared to last year. The net result was a 15% decrease in operating income to $1.7 billion.","Below the line, other income totaled $46 million, up $20 million versus the previous year, primarily driven by gains from real estate sales and lower environmental costs. Interest expense of $167 million was up 13% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Income tax expense decreased 17% to $587 million, driven primarily by lower pre-tax earnings.","Net income totaled nearly $1 billion, down 15% versus 2015, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce quarterly earnings of $1.16 per share.","Now turning to our top line, freight revenue of $4.5 billion was down 14% versus last year. Volume declined 8% and fuel surcharge revenue decreased $334 million when compared to 2015. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel prices was a $0.10 headwind to earnings in the first quarter versus last year. And keep in mind that we did report an $0.08 positive fuel benefit in the first quarter of 2015.","As expected, a challenging business mix did have a negative 2.5% impact on freight revenue in the first quarter. The primary drivers of this mix shift were significant declines in frac sand, steel, and export Ag shipments, partially offset by a decline in Intermodal volumes.","Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at just over 2.5%. Slide 21 provides more detail on our pricing trends. Pricing continued to be solid in the first quarter of 2016 and represents the strong value proposition that we provide our customers in the marketplace.","Moving on to the expense side, slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 11% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes and improved labor efficiencies. Labor inflation was about 1% in the first quarter, driven primarily by health and welfare, which was partially offset by pension favorability.","Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count declined 11% or more than 5,000 when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Remember that we still were realigning our resources and had a number of employees in the training pipeline at this time last year. Sequentially, total workforce levels were also down 2% from the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year and longer term, we expect our force levels will continue to trend with volume. But as always, we expect to offset some of the volume variability with productivity. Labor inflation is still expected to come in around 2% for the full year. This is driven primarily by wage inflation and health and welfare, partially offset by lower pension expense. This is also consistent with our all-in inflation expectations in the 2% range for the full year.","Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $320 million, down 43% when compared to 2015. Lower diesel fuel prices along with a 13% decline in gross ton miles drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate increased 1%, driven by negative mix, while our average fuel price declined 36% to $1.25 per gallon.","Moving on to our other expense categories, purchased services and materials expense decreased 12% to $569 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume-related expense and reduced repair costs associated with our locomotive and car fleets.","Depreciation expense was $502 million, up 2% compared to 2015, driven primarily by a higher depreciable asset base. For the full year, we still expect depreciation expense to increase slightly compared to last year.","Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $289 million, which is down 7% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes, improved cycle times, and lower locomotive lease expense were the primary drivers of the decline. Other expenses came in at $249 million, down 4% versus last year. A decrease in personal injury and casualty expenses were partially offset by higher state and local taxes. For 2016, we expect the other expense line to increase about 5% excluding any large unusual items.","Turning now to our operating ratio performance, the first quarter operating ratio came in at 65.1%, 0.3 points unfavorable when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Fuel did have a negative 0.5-point impact in the quarter. Even with the sharp decline in volumes, our enhanced focus on productivity, right-sizing our resources to current demand, and solid core pricing have all been key drivers to strong operating ratio performance.","Turning now to our cash flow, in the first quarter, cash from operations totaled almost $2.2 billion, up slightly when compared to the first quarter of 2015. The timing of tax payments, primarily related to bonus depreciation on capital spending, along with changes in working capital more than offset the decrease in net income. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled $1 billion for the quarter.","Taking a look at the balance sheet, our cash balance at quarter end was unusually high as a result of our $1.3 billion debt issuance in March. This increased our all-in adjusted debt balance to about $18.3 billion at quarter end. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.8 times, up from 1.7 times at year end, as we continue to target a ratio of less than two times.","In the first quarter, share repurchases exceeded 9.3 million shares and totaled over $700 million. Since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased almost 27% of our outstanding shares. Adding our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned about $1.2 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter.","So that's a recap of the first quarter results. As we look to the second quarter and the remainder of the year, there are a number of factors which will impact our results. Our energy-related volumes, especially coal, will continue to be challenged. We acknowledge that coal volumes in the first quarter finished well below what we had anticipated coming into the year, primarily due to unseasonably warm weather that persisted throughout the winter along with continued low natural gas prices. That said, we are still going to try again to give you our best sense of where we think second quarter coal volumes will be. If volume levels stay where they are today, coal could be down as much as 30% or so for the second quarter versus last year.","In total, we would expect second quarter volumes to be down around 10% or so. Overall volume comparisons should get easier in the second half. So at this point, for the full year, we expect total volumes to be down in the mid-single-digit range. The impact of fuel prices on net earnings should start to moderate in the second quarter, assuming fuel prices and spreads remain approximately where they are today. While we still expect some mix pressure for the remainder of the year, the magnitude should be less than what we have experienced in the last couple of quarters.","In addition, as Cam just mentioned, we are tightening the capital plan somewhat and reducing our capital spending by $75 million to $3.675 billion for the full year. This is a reduction of over $600 million from last year.","We are still counting on record productivity and solid pricing to drive an improved operating ratio for the full year. In an uncertain volume environment, we are focusing our efforts on the steps we can take to make Union Pacific a better company. Key to this is our Grow to 55 plus Zero initiative, which is our effort to drive our operating ratio to 55% over the longer term. The entire organization is energized and aspiring to new and improved levels of performance, in productivity, in innovation, in customer experience, and of course in safety. This is the mindset that will drive not just our operating ratio but ultimately our earnings, our cash flow, and our returns in the years ahead.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thank you, Rob.","As you've heard from the team, 2016 has brought a continuation of many of the same trends that we experienced throughout most of last year. An energy market recession, low commodity prices, the strength of the U.S. dollar and soft global economy, and muted domestic retail demand have all contributed to overall market weakness across many of our business lines. And it's likely that many of these themes will be with us for some time. That said, we are stronger coming into this year than we were a year ago. We've improved the fluidity of our network, with service metrics at all-time bests. We also achieved a record industry-best employee safety rate, as we work toward our ultimate goal of zero injuries.","It's challenging to do business is such an uncertain market, but we will continue to be agile and adapting to new business environments, making our company more productive, more innovative, and ultimately more successful for the long term. We will continue to leverage the strength and diversity of the Union Pacific franchise to drive new business opportunities, to provide an excellent customer experience, and to generate strong long-term value for our shareholders.","With that, let's open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is coming from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your questions.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning, gentlemen, and thank you for taking my questions. I guess the first is going to be a bigger picture one. You talked about, Rob, I think cost inflation being at around 2% this year. Yet, we have seen some of the core pricing, at least sequentially, trend down to 2.5%. That's not a huge delta for you guys to play with. Where do you see core pricing going forward, and what is pressured sequentially? It looks to me probably to be more Intermodal and coal, but I'd love some commentary on that.","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","Jason, I would remind \u2013 I know you know this, but I would remind everyone that if you look and compare the results to last year, remember we got about say 0.5 point of legacy pricing that was embedded in full-year results. The previous year and as we called out, the legacy activity is pretty much behind us, so that 2.5% is comparable to something legacy-like, if you will.","Having said that, we don't give specific guidance by commodity group in terms of our pricing. In fact, our commitment still is to be an inflation-plus environment. We're going to continue to work as hard as we can providing a quality service product to our customers so we can continue to garner positive price above inflation as we move forward.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. My follow-up question is going to be on Ag volumes specifically, potentially export Ag. The SOLAS [Safety of Life at Sea] weight regulations are coming up here in July. It seems that basically people \u2013 shippers here in the U.S. seemed to be reacting more negatively toward it, particularly some people on the agricultural side. What's UP's view on it, and do you think it could be a potential negative impact, even if it's just a short-term?","Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.","So you're right, the regulations just came out here I think in the last \u2013 clarity on the regulations just came out in the last 30 days. And it really put a lot of the requirements for implementation upon the shipping community, which is part of the reaction that you get. Like most regulations, I think the shipping community will figure out a way to manage to that. And long term, if you look at our Ag business, it really is dependent on the fact that the U.S. still is a great producer. Generally speaking, long term it is in the sweet spot in terms of world competitiveness. We have had wins this year with the strong dollar, but it's in the sweet spot, and the U.S. as a producer will continue to be a good producer. And we as a transportation provider will continue to have the benefits of moving that business.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, so there are no real concerns on your part with SOLAS?","Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.","Not for the long-term, no.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, perfect. Gentlemen, I appreciate the time as always.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thank you, Jason.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead with your questions.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. I wanted to ask you on the comp and benefits. So you did well with the head count reduction. And I know, Rob, you say that moves with volume. But how would you think sequentially head count changes? And also, is there anything the per-worker? The per-worker change was pretty low, which was notable in contrast to CSX, which saw more of a mid-single-digit increase in that. So I just wondered if you had any thoughts on those two, on how your head count changed and per-worker.","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","Tom, I would say that first of all on the per-worker, really what drives changes from that from quarter to quarter is largely \u2013 in our case is largely driven by the mix of employees that show up in capital or happen to be working on capital in that quarter or not working on capital. That is generally why you might see swings from one quarter to the next. Because other than that, it's just basically straightforward in terms of the inflation that shows up on the labor line.","In terms of our head count going forward, as I said and as we've always said, we're going to continue to squeeze out productivity. Headcount will move as volume does, but not one for one because we are continually focused on identifying continuing productivity initiatives. And I think you saw that certainly in the first quarter with an 11% reduction in the head count. That was good productivity initiatives. But we're not done. The whole theme of the G-to-55 initiative is a focus on continued productivity. So I would expect that trend will continue in terms of moving with volume but offset by productivity results.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And as a follow-up, just in terms of pricing, do you think that the pricing environment took a little bit of a step down as you saw on the core price and now it's stable, or would you say that there are pressures that are building a bit further as you look forward on just the contracts that get negotiated through the year? Is that pricing getting worse, or is it just a step down and stable where we are?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Before I turn it over to Eric, this is Lance. Just globally, of course we would prefer an environment like 2014 where volume is growing robustly and there's a lot of demand for our services. That's a more favorable environment to be in. We're in a less favorable environment, but even so, we're still committed to doing what exactly what Rob said, which is pricing for our value, getting a reinvestable return on it, and pricing above inflation. Eric, any more?","Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.","No, I think that's it. I would say we all know that low fuel prices are allowing trucks to be plentiful. They're very tough competitors. Sluggish retail sales is a headwind to the economy. But within that, we think we have a great value proposition, and we're going to continue to price towards our value proposition.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, well thanks for the time, and nice job on the cost side.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead with your question.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe Rob or Cameron, as you think about the drivers of productivity in the drive to 55% as an operating ratio, can you help us frame where that's going to come from? Is it the application of technology? Is it business process? And I know it's a broad question, but I guess some investors have had a little bit of feedback around where is this going to come from. And I'm just wondering if you can give us some color in terms of the big broad-brush strokes where you think this productivity can come from in the business?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Cam, let's start with you.","Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Railroad Co.","Okay. We mentioned train size earlier in the presentation. Every commodity group that we have has headroom for additional train size productivity. And we feel very good about our progress. We've made record train sizes in every commodity with the exception of coal, which was fairly optimized for a number of years in a row, and we'll do that again this year.","Variable costs in every department within the operating team is a very big initiative for us, transportation, mechanical and engineering. And initiatives like recrew rate, where we've made enormous progress over the last 18 months coming down to record recrew performance. So those are some examples.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","I also want to add \u2013 let's not shorthand, when Rob is talking about Grow to 55 and Zero, productivity isn't just about cutting heads. It's more predominantly about doing things more efficiently, getting more out of our assets, getting more out of a gallon of fuel. And the growth side is equally important, as Eric and his commercial team, in the context of all the headwinds we see on the energy side of the world, growing all the other commodities where we have opportunity, and there's lots of that opportunity.","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","David, I promise we will not have three responses to every question here, but this is near and dear to all of our hearts. And I would just add to the discussion that Cam and Lance have had is that we're looking at every stone that we can turn over in the company. Cam obviously talked heavily about the operations, which is where the big dollars are and the big opportunities are, but we're not leaving it at that. And Lance talked about the growth opportunities. But aside from that, we're challenging the entire organization, even the administrative groups, to turn over every stone of looking for additional opportunities to be more efficient than ever before. And to your question, yes, technology, where it can enable that, whether it's in core operations or in a support activity, we are certainly looking to leverage that even further.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Excellent. And then maybe just as a follow-up, as you think about some of the stranded asset issues that may come with the coal network running at obviously levels that we've never seen before, at least in the last 10 or 15 years, how much of a headwind should we expect in terms of some assets being stranded out there or costs being stranded out there, with the decline of coal?","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","David, this is Rob. I would say that that's not the case in our network. Again, if you look at \u2013 we don't have stranded assets. We don't envision there will be stranded assets. Because if you look at it again, using coal as the obvious example, we've still got the lines going up to the PRB mines. Those lines, while less volume traveling over them perhaps right now than maybe at their peak, they are still the same lines that we've enjoyed. So we don't have a situation. Now having said that, we're going to squeeze to be as productive as we can on our asset base. You see that in our locomotives and certainly our head count related to that. But as it relates to stranded assets, I don't see that as an issue for us.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Excellent, thanks a lot for the time, guys.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thank you, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your questions.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to ask a couple high-level questions. Eric, you mentioned the strong dollar still a headwind on grain, crudes, and excess inventories in that market. But it's come off from the peak, the dollar has clearly had a nice run for a long time. How long do you think it needs to stay at this level, or roughly how much lower do you think it needs to go before you start to see some relief? And I guess what would be the first place you would expect to see that?","Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.","I'm not a central banker, but I would say the dollar is still very high in any relative sense. It has dropped a little from the peak, but it still is very high. And as you know, dollars impact the competitiveness of U.S. exports across the board. So whether it's Ag, whether it's things like steel, whether it's things like our iron or metals business or other commodities business, it impacts all of those things. And so I don't have any prediction of how much the dollar needs to fall. It still is very high in any relative historical sense.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. But to clarify, it sounds like you're not seeing anything at this stage?","Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.","The dollar is still a headwind. The strong dollar is still a headwind to U.S. exports.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then to follow up on oil, it's again another macro factor, clearly been moving off the lows. How much upside do you think can be to the frac sand business? Are you starting to see any signs of activity there? I know you had another tough quarter on tough comps. You mentioned some regional sourcing that's starting to work its way into the business. But are you starting to at least hear some more optimism that completions would start to move forward here and get some more sand down the wells? Thanks.","Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.","I think the public numbers still show drilling rigs down about 45% or 49%, 50%. So, Eric, there's not a lot of drilling activity that has picked back up with the slight bump up in fuel. Certainly when the drilling activity picks back up, we would expect to participate in that in the various markets that we operate in.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","The good news on that is, the shale energy producers have done a tremendous job in getting their own cost structures in line and getting productivity as they had experience with this new approach to drilling. And so the strike price for when activity picks up is lower than it was three or four or five years ago, but we're still not at that point.","Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. I appreciate the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, good morning. Rob, just following up on Tom's question before, you talked about the cost per employee coming down a bit. Would you expect that to increase with incentive comp? Or you mentioned pension reductions. Can those outweigh it? Can you just walk through the pension savings and incentive comp impacts as we move forward through the year?","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","I wouldn't anticipate a material change or much of a change at all in the pension. And incentive comp for us, Ken, is not a big mover because we don't have a wide-based plan that affects a wide percentage of our employees. So if you boil it down, the big driver is going to be \u2013 again, I would use that 2% labor inflation number that we expect for the full year. And again, the timing of that can change quarter to quarter depending on how many employees are actively involved in capital or not involved in capital. That's really going to be what changes that number going forward. So I don't see any big changes.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So nothing that materially changes the productivity gains you saw in the quarter?","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","No, not as it relates to the comp per employee.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, Eric, just thinking about Intermodal, obviously given the pressures you talked about, maybe one more to throw out at you with the Panama Canal opening up soon. I know that over the past few years, you and Lance have thrown out that you don't expect much change. But as you see plans and new teaming up amongst the container liners that's going on, is there any thought of any shift of capacity given the impact of the port strike a year ago and thoughts on how that distributes the Intermodal volumes?","Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.","Ken, there are a lot of moving parts, as you know, and there are a lot of ins and outs. I don't think anything substantially has changed our perspective that we've given over the time. A couple of the key factors we always look at is that West Coast port entry still is the fastest option to get to the Eastern markets, usually by two weeks. Another factor is with all of the rationalization going on in the container shipping industry, all of the alliances and the mergers and all that's going on, there does seem to be a migration to the larger ships. About half the new capacity coming on is with ships greater than 12,000 or 13,000 TEUs [20-foot Equivalent Units] on it. Those ships cannot go through even the expanded Panama Canal.","So I think as you look at this trans-Pacific rationalization, there are even larger ships posting right now on the West Coast that cannot go through even the expanded canal. I think the West Coast ports still will remain a very strong, viable competitor. And fundamentally we're not changing our perspective and our outlook that we've had over the last couple years.","Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, I appreciate the insight. Thanks for the time.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead with your questions.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks and good morning. So first question I wanted to ask, there's a lot of noise in the volume numbers right now between volatile comps, the impact of flooding, and what's going on in coal, and it's pretty tough to get a feel for the underlying demand environment. From your perspective through the first three or four months of the year, what's your view on the demand environment and the economy relative to where your outlook was at the start of the year?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Eric, do you want to take a stab at that?","Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.","So clearly, as Rob said earlier, the coal side was a lot softer than what we anticipated. Again, warmest winter on weather, we did not expect these low natural gas prices. The shale impact is significant. But if you set aside the shale impact, the energy, the coal impact, you do have some variability going on in terms of retail sales that is probably a little softer than what we anticipated. But if you look at net-net everything else, I think it's pretty solid growth and aligned with what we expected and aligned with the slowly strengthening economy. So you have a retail sales, international Intermodal market issue. You've got a shale\/coal energy market issue. But if you look at everything else, I think it's pretty aligned and slowly strengthening.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, thanks, Eric. And as a follow-up, one of the big discrepancies between your year-to-date volume performance and your Western competitor is coming in Intermodal. So I'm just curious if you're seeing more competitive pricing dynamics and any market share shift. Or is there another explanation for this discrepancy?","Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.","Yes, Justin, I think it's as I said in my prepared comments; that if you look at the international Intermodal side of the business and all of the rationalization that's going on there with the steamship carriers and the alliance changes and some of the mergers, that clearly has had more of an impact on our book of business based on the shippers that we certainly have been aligned with vis-\u00e0-vis our Western competitor.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","And, Justin, taking a step back, when you think about Intermodal, you break out international Intermodal and domestic, we still are quite bullish on domestic Intermodal over the long run. There is still a rich opportunity to take trucks off the highway, and we think we're going to be able to grow that product for the foreseeable future.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, great. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead with your questions.","Matthew Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks, just more a broader question as it relates to CapEx. I know if I go back to 2000 \u2013 2005 timeframe, your volumes today are relatively flat, but your CapEx budget is up 100%. It's doubled, so you're spending twice as much to handle the same level of traffic. I know you've layered in PTC [Positive Train Control]. I know given the long-lived nature of the assets that there's inflation, but I'm just curious. Is it time for you and your rail peers to rethink the brackets or the goalposts in terms of percentage of revenues you're spending on CapEx? I know you've got to take a long 10-year \u2013 20-year view, where most people in the market take a one-month or two-month view. But I'm just curious. In a slower growth environment, which seems to be stubbornly persistent, you took $600 million down year over year, which is impressive. Is it time to rethink more broadly what capital is required to run these railroads? Thanks.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thanks for the question, Matt. As Rob reminds our investment community all the time, we are constantly reviewing our capital spend in the context of projects that are generating attractive returns, our overall volumes, and where those volumes are moving. If you look at us compared to 10 or 15 years ago in capital, there are a couple of very big moving parts. One is PTC, which...","Matthew Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Right.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","...full year last year was a $300 million or a $390 million number that didn't exist at that time. Another big moving part can be locomotives. We're in the market for locomotives more in the past few years than we were 10 or 15 years ago. And the third big moving part is in maintenance capital. I recall back in those days, we were spending in the neighborhood of maybe $1.2 billion, and in these days we're spending more like a $1.8 billion number. And for that, we have a much more robust network that's operating at very high levels.","Having said all that, as we look forward, our capital spend will depend on the first three things I mentioned. First and foremost, what's the outlook for volume, what's that environment look like, where is that volume showing up, and what are the projects that we have in front of us that generate attractive returns? In my mind's eye, you're still going to see us spend down in our Southern tier of our network. That's still an area where we would like to continue to enhance our capacity. And you'll still continue to see us invest at a fairly robust level for maintaining the railroad, although that also ebbs and flows with how much we're consuming in GPMs.","Matthew Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","I appreciate the thoughtful answer, and just one follow-up. I'm looking for a silver lining in what is otherwise a choppy volume environment. I was surprised at the strength in industrial chems, up 16%, just given that they historically have had \u2013 rail chemical traffic has had such a high correlation with economic expansion. I was wondering if you could perhaps just put some additional color there given that strength. Was that share driven? Was that new customer driven? Just some greater clarity there would be extremely helpful. Thank you.","Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.","So as we regularly say, we are continuing to focus on business development. And we have a huge number of business development initiatives underway across the board, which are really overshadowed by the coal and the shale fall-off and some of the rationalization we're seeing in international Intermodal. If you look at our chemicals business, the Gulf Coast franchise, while many of those plastics expansions will not come on till next year, as we've talked about in the past, we still have lots of opportunities in terms of LPG growth. Mexico energy reform, there's a lot of growing interest in terms of moving products there, and we are working on a number of different initiatives with that.","And so there is general economic strength that we're seeing in our industrial products business in terms of construction coming back, housing coming back. Chemicals has the benefit of plastics going to the automotive industry as you see automotive sales. And so there's a slowly strengthening economy out there and we're doing a lot of business development to go after it, which again is being overshadowed by just the huge volume numbers for coal and shale and the other headwinds we have.","Matthew Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Understood, thank you very much for the time and detail.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your questions.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks, good morning. Given everything that's happening with coal, similar to what your Eastern peers have done in the past few years, are you having to explore potentially changing contracts with your customers and moving more towards a fixed to variable structure?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Eric, do you want to handle that?","Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.","So, Allison, as you know, we have a standard answer where we don't really talk about specific contract negotiations. I will say we negotiate aggressively and assertively, and we're in a very competitive environment. And for any particular contract negotiation, we probably have dozens if not hundreds of terms that we're negotiating. And like always, as markets change and we look to be competitive, we evaluate a bunch of those terms and conditions and what works for us and works for our customer base.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thanks. And as a follow-up question, if we look a little bit out to the future and see volumes will eventually come back to the network, could you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the operating leverage and earnings power of the company, just in light of the fact that you've taken out a significant amount of costs over the last few quarters?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","So as you just lined up, volume is our friend. We're looking forward to the point where we're growing on the top line because it does make it easier to drop that to the bottom line. Having said that, in the place we are right now, we're in the process of getting our overall structure to match where our markets are today. And then from that point moving forward, we'll continue to be aggressive on our productivity, on our efficiency, on our business development, and generally that model is very attractive when we grow.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thank you for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, good morning. I wanted to touch a little bit on the flooding. You haven't mentioned it on the call. I just wanted to get a sense if you can quantify any impact, if it was material, both from a cost and maybe from a volume standpoint if maybe we see a little bit of lost volumes come back a bit in 2Q. Just give us a sense of how to think about that.","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","Chris, this is Rob. It was yeoman's work by the operating team because it was a significant challenge for them, but they did a fabulous job. I would say that the impact to us was less than $0.01 in terms of EPS for the quarter.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, that's helpful. And then I wanted to follow up on mix. So mix obviously improved from the fourth quarter, and it feels like it was a little bit less bad than maybe some were thinking for the first quarter despite the fact that some of the bulk commodity groups were down pretty significantly. As you think about the rest of the year, how can this trend? Is the first quarter likely to be the low water mark in terms of the headwind for mix? How do we think about that going forward?","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","Chris, this is Rob. You know we don't give guidance on mix. And the reason we don't is because we are in so many different markets, which we're very proud of in terms of the diversity of our network. There are a lot of moving parts, as you know, and there's mix even within each of the commodity groups.","Having said that, you're right. We are coming off of unusually high negative mix challenges, and we do think our best look at the balance of the year is that will moderate. Again, we're at high water marks here, I would hope, at 2.5% and certainly last quarter's 4% negative impact on mix I would hope is an all-time high water mark. But we do think our best guess is that's going to moderate, but it's difficult to actually put any finer point on it.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks for the time, I appreciate it.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thank you, Chris.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I just want to take a longer-term view here and ask you about coal. Obviously another step down in the next couple of quarters. But when you look to 2017, is this a market that can be flat or even up next year, or what's your view there?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Let me take a stab at that, Ravi. So the way we think about coal is it's facing a large number of headwinds right now: low natural gas prices as an alternative; pretty significant inventory overhang on piles right now; and a weak electricity generating market, some driven by weather.","So as those headwinds persist, coal is going to continue to have some difficulty. We're going to have to chew up some of this excess inventory before we see coal demand really strengthen. What it might look like two, three, four, five years from now, we still think it's a pretty important part of the overall electricity generating base the United States. It's not going back, we don't think, to where it was four or five years ago. And you can make an argument either way, that it strengthens a bit or that it might decline a bit. Our best guess is we're probably in the relative sphere where it's going operate other than the really significant headwinds that we're facing in this particular timeframe.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And as a follow-up, going back to the flooding, again, we heard there was a lot of cooperation between a number of rails to get everyone out of that mess. But just generally talking about the competitive environment, what are you seeing out there in terms of some of the actions that some of your peers might be taking?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","I think if you're asking specific to the floods, we did a great job of making sure our customers had alternatives and satisfying their needs and keeping them well informed. If you're asking in terms of the overall operating environment...","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","...we are in a competitive environment. We compete every day for every piece of business that we enjoy. And we compete on the basis of providing our customers the best experience they're going to get in the marketplace, and everything we do every day is oriented towards making that happen.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your questions.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So a few things I wanted to clarify. Rob, any coal liquidated damages in the quarter, and are you expecting any for the year?","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","Scott, for us I'd say minor, and I would anticipate that it will be minor for the balance of the year.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So that's just not a number that you guys disclose?","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","Correct.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Your point, Rob, about there was more capital than expense employees in the quarter \u2013 I think that was your point \u2013 is that something that is just a first-quarter event, or does that continue all year where we see comp per employee, because of that, less than the 2% wage inflation you talked about?","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","Scott, the point I was trying to make on that, number one, you can always have those swings depending on what capital projects are going on, but that was more of a sequential comment. Generally speaking, you would start to ramp up some of your capital projects in the first quarter that perhaps you weren't running as you finished the fourth quarter. So that was more of a comment, this particular go-round, relative to the sequential look. Year over year in the first quarter, not as material of an impact, but that can change from time to time. But I think if you look at it, again, the first quarter was pretty clean in my view. When you look year over year in terms of 11% head count reduction, really is representative of very solid, outstanding productivity performance. And of course, remember the year before we had our share of challenges.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","I guess I'm just thinking from a comp per employee, because you talked about inflation of 2%, and comp per employee was down 1%. I'm just trying to understand if that's a number that can continue the rest of the year.","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","I wouldn't give guidance on that. I think probably the best way to think about it is that 2% inflation generally speaking should look like the guidance we're getting on the labor inflation line, which would be closer to 2%.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. If I can just ask one more, Eric, maybe can you let us know? Where are coal stockpiles now relative to targets? And if you think back to last cycle, how long does it take for the stockpiles to come down? Is it one good weather season, is it two, three? I don't know.","Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.","The actual numbers I think are 108 days, which is about 41 days above, call it a five-year average \u2013 and I think no, 41 days above last year. And how long it takes to come down just depends on all the factors we've talked about.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you, guys.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your questions.","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, look, I believe at some point we're going to see some recovery in volumes. I guess we all hope that, right? But in the meantime, as you go through these cost reduction efforts and align resources with the carload volumes and that type of thing, how long can you do that before you get some ramp up in carloads and protect the profitability of the railroad? Obviously, profitability was down in the quarter, but you did a nice job of protecting the OR and that kind of thing. How long can you continue that until you run out of cost reduction initiatives and start to cut into the muscle of the organization?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","John, we can do it for as long as is necessary. We've demonstrated that we understand how to use attrition as our friend, how to use initiatives like Grow to 55 and Zero. We know how to get our cost structure right. We're in the middle of doing that and we're going to continue to do it. My expectation is that we don't have to do that forever because I do expect us at some point to start growing the top line.","We're in a unique environment right now with a lot of headwinds. Some of those headwinds represent structural shift, like in coal, where a portion of that book of business is probably permanently reduced. But in the big scheme of things, at some point those headwinds abate, we start growing again. And even in that environment, we're still focused on making sure that we have the structure right, that we have our costs right, and that we're constantly looking for efficiency.","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, all right. And then secondly, Rob, you commented in your presentation about a significant increase in the cash balances because of the debt issuance. You've reduced the CapEx budget a little bit, which I would imagine probably juices the cash flow a little bit. Can you just talk a little bit about, I guess with rail M&A off the table, there's no real need to be hoarding cash for some kind of move in that arena? What do you think the plan is on use of cash going forward? Is there any alteration? Should we expect any acceleration in share buyback, just given the cash balances at this point?","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","John, I would say no. I wouldn't read into the fact that we happened to finish the quarter with a high cash balance as a change in anything we're doing. It's going to be the balanced approach. We need the cash for working capital, for taxes, for dividends. And we'll continue to be, as we have been, opportunistic on the share buyback as we move forward.","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right, very good. Thanks for the time.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please go ahead with your questions.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.","Thanks very much and good morning. I wanted to ask one on grain. Because there's so much in storage, you could make case that there's potential upside in the back half just on the basis that some will have to move to make room for this year's harvest. But you still seem pretty cautious, and I'm just curious if that's because it's early in the season or something else.","Eric L. Butler - Union Pacific Railroad Co.","This is Eric, Cherilyn. There is a lot of grain in storage. There is about 200 million bushels that were carried out from last year. I think the USDA estimates are that can grow by another 500 million bushels based on the number of acres that are being planted and the types of yields that are expected. So there is a lot of grain out there. We believe that eventually it has to move. And so we are certainly optimistic that when it does move, we're going to get our fair share of that, and it will move. It's just right now, U.S. grain is not competitive on world markets. The strong dollar is an issue. There are other issues in terms of really good crops in other places, growing regions around the world. But we do think it will ultimately will move, and we're going get our fair share of it when it does.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then in terms of the locomotives that you've got in storage, are any of those potential lease turn-back candidates, or are you comfortable with that as a surge fleet?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Cam, do you want to start by talking about locomotives in storage?","Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Railroad Co.","We have a really good mix of high-horsepower and low-horsepower in storage. And particularly on the low-horsepower fleet, as we look out over the next three to four years, there are some very nice lease return-backs that we will do. And we're very confident we can hold our low-horsepower fleet size and return those leases without any impact to our customers.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.","Great, thank you. That's all for me.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead with your questions.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for getting my question in. I know it's been a long call. But, Lance or Rob, you guys did guide to an improved operating ratio this year. So can you just talk about the confidence that you have in achieving that, especially with volume down 10% in 2Q, as well as talk a little bit more about the fuel headwind that you were discussing in 1Q?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","I'll let Rob talk about the fuel headwind. From the standpoint of operating ratio, we wouldn't be reaffirming it and talking about it if we didn't have confidence and faith in achieving it. We believe that given any reasonable outlook, we are going to improve our operating ratio this year.","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","I would just add to that, Brandon, that clearly we'd rather have positive volume. And just as a reminder, we did guide that we think full-year volumes will be down mid-single digits. That's a challenge. But to Lance's point, what we're expressing here is confidence in our ability to continue to be squeezing out productivity initiatives and continue to price appropriately in the marketplace.","On the fuel, the guidance we're giving on fuel is that while it was a $0.10 headwind in the first quarter, largely driven by the $0.08 benefit the previous first quarter last year, we think that's going to moderate. If fuel prices stay where they are, our expectation would be that that headwind will moderate, largely because we lap the fall-off in fuel from the previous year.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, got you. So that was just the year-on-year impact \u2013 or the lag impact from last year.","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","That's exactly the quarter-over-quarter look, yes.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, and just one real quick one for the model. You did do a debt offering in the quarter. Where should your run rate interest expense be going forward?","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","I would say probably comparable to what we saw in the first quarter.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, all right. Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. These go ahead with your questions.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Good morning.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Cameron, thanks for the detail on some of the initiatives behind the Grow to 55. But of the 45 projects that you guys have specifically identified, how many of those have kicked off or are going to kick off this year? And then what's the cadence of the remaining projects over the next couple years? I just want to try to understand the pipeline of opportunities there.","Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Railroad Co.","Absolutely. Within the operating department team, we have 12 projects that we've identified that we kicked off late 2014 and into 2015. Many of those projects are gaining very, very good traction into 2016, and we have a couple of others lined up for the end of 2016 going into 2017. So they're broad-based. They're well measured. We feel very confident, to an earlier question, that when we identify one of these productivity projects that we can hold that productivity as volume comes back to us so we have great leverage out into the future.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, that's great. And then, Rob, my follow-up, there just remains a lot of concern over there about the impact of mix, the decline in coal, and what it's doing to the holistic margin profile of the railroad. So I totally get it that you don't give margins by commodity. But how should we think about the stratifications of margins by commodity maybe say versus past? So have they tightened over the past couple years, meaning are they much closer to corporate average today versus maybe a more disparate profile in the past, or is that an oversimplification?","Robert M. Knight - Union Pacific Corp.","As you know, we don't break it out by commodity, but clearly the mix that we've seen the last few quarters is a challenge. I'm particularly proud of the fact that with reductions in volume and the headwind that we faced in the mix, we have continued to drive outstanding operating ratio performance. So that's the focus.","Irrespective, you've heard me say this many times. We're going to play the hand that the economy deals us. We're not going to use the challenge that we're facing right now of a mix headwind as an excuse not to make continued margin improvements, and that's what we're all about. That's what driving our initiative of G55. That's what's still driving our plus or minus 60% operating ratio by full-year 2019 focus. We have to live in that world. But clearly, those challenges that we faced here on the mix have been challenges.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, that's great and good job on the costs, thanks.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners. Please go ahead with your question.","Donald Allen Broughton - Avondale Partners LLC","Good morning, gentlemen.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Good morning.","Donald Allen Broughton - Avondale Partners LLC","Obviously, you've done an admirable job in what is a fairly high fixed cost business at managing costs and bringing them down aggressively in line with \u2013 or almost in line with the rate in which you've seen revenues fall. Help me think about this, though. If we see further volume declines, can you be as productive? In other words, I'm assuming that as we furlough 1,400 locomotives, you're not furloughing the youngest, most efficient locomotives. You're furloughing the oldest, most in need of maintenance, least efficient locomotives. So as we make further cuts, is it realistic to expect that you can be as effective in your cost control as you have been so far, or am I thinking about that incorrectly?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","No, it is reasonable to expect us to continue to be able to be effective at adjusting our cost structure, even in the face of further volume declines. Now we're not saying we anticipate things get worse from where they are right now. But if they were to, we have the ability to continue to adjust our cost structure. We've demonstrated, to this point, there are still levers to be pulled. We'd much prefer to grow, but we will pull those levers as we need to.","Donald Allen Broughton - Avondale Partners LLC","But will cost cutting be as productive in the future as it has been in the past?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","From my perspective, there are ample opportunities to be more efficient everywhere I look on the railroad. We will continue to be able to generate productivity from that perspective. And as we have to take larger chunks of cost out, we'll continue to evaluate that and do that effectively as well.","Donald Allen Broughton - Avondale Partners LLC","Fantastic. Thank you, gentleman.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, everyone. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thank you very much and thank you for your questions and interest in Union Pacific today. We look forward to talking to you again in July.","Operator","Thank you.

Welcome to the Union Pacific First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Koraleski, you may begin.","John J. Koraleski","Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today here in Omaha are Rob Knight, our CFO; Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Lance Fritz, Executive Vice President of Operations.","This morning, we're pleased to announce that Union Pacific achieved record first quarter financial results, leveraging the strengths of our diverse franchise despite significantly weaker coal and grain markets. Earnings of $2.03 per share increased 13% compared to 2012. We efficiently managed our operations in the face of dynamic volume shifts across our network as evidenced by our record first quarter operating ratio and customer satisfaction results. Putting it all together, it translates into greater financial returns for our shareholders.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric.","Eric L. Butler","Thanks, Jack, and good morning. Let's start off with a look at customer satisfaction, which came in at 94 for the quarter, tying an all-time quarterly record. It is up 1 point from the first quarter last year, setting a new first quarter record, and along the way, March tied our best ever month at 95. We appreciate customer recognition of the strength of our value proposition and continue to work to make it even stronger.","As expected, some key markets were a challenge in the first quarter, and as a result, overall volume was down 2%. While Chemicals, Intermodal and Automotive grew and Industrial Products was flat, it wasn't enough to offset the challenging market conditions that drove steep declines in Coal and Ag products, whilst the coal demand have continued to have the largest impact on overall growth. Setting the decline in the coal loadings aside, the other 5 groups grew 2.5% despite the drought related to shortfall in Ag. Note that the volume comparisons were subject to last year's leap year which included an extra day of carloadings.","Core price improved 4%, which combined with the modest benefit from positive mix and increased fuel surcharge revenue produced nearly a 6% improvement in average revenue per car. With the price-driven average revenue per car gains outpacing the volumes decline, freight revenue grew to 3% to $5 billion.","Let's take a closer look at each of these groups, starting with the 2 that saw declines. Coal volumes were down 19%, as high coal stockpiles created by last year's low natural gas prices continued to impact demand. Core pricing gains and positive mix led to a 16% improvement in average revenue per car, holding the revenue decline to 6%. High stockpiles and inventory reduction initiatives by specific utility drove the decline in the Southern Powder River Basin shipments, with tonnage down 19%. Although coal stockpiles started to decline from last year's peak, they remain above normal levels.","Also contributing to the decline was a previously mentioned loss of a legacy customer contract at the beginning of the year, which more than offset business gains. Colorado\/Utah coal shipments also declined, soft domestic demand, mine production problems and the weak international market for Western U.S. coal limited shipments, with tonnage down 15%.","Before we move on to Ag, please note that this slide shows the ease in comp we had year-over-year in the second quarter. Ag Products revenue declined 9%, with volume down 9% and a 1% improvement in average revenue per car. Last summer's drought continued to impact grain carloadings, with first quarter down 19% from last year.","Domestic feed grain shipments declined as tight U.S. corn supplies, especially in UP served territories led to reductions in livestock feedings and increased reliance on local feed crop. Export feed grain shipments also declined with improved world production and lower U.S. supplies. Grain product shipments were down 4%, as reduced demand for gasoline has increased use of lending credits from previous years to meet the mandate to over 10% decline in ethanol shipment. A reduced supply and greater emphasis on meeting local demand impacted DDG volumes, which fell 26%. Food and refrigerated shipments also declined 3%, driven by lower sugar imports from Mexico and new restrictions in Russia and China that imported limit -- that limited import of U.S. meat and poultry.","Automotive volume grew 2%, which combined with an 11% increase in average revenue per car drove a 13% increase in revenue. The growth rate of the Automotive industry continued to outpace that of the overall economy during the first quarter. Drivers that helped the momentum in the Automotive market last year continued into the first quarter, largely pent-up demand and an improving overall economy. New fuel-efficient models equipped with more features and technology appeared to be compelling consumers to replace vehicles.","In addition, a rebound in the housing and construction market have increased demand for light trucks. While sales continued to grow, our finished vehicles shipments lag as OEMs had unscheduled downtime to deal with product refreshes and dealers sold off existing inventories to support sales. Parts volumes increased 5%, while pricing gains and the previously announced Pacer network logistics management arrangement increased average revenue per car.","Chemicals revenue increased 14%, reflecting a 12% increase in volume and a 1% improvement in average revenue per car. Crude oil volume increased 11% from the previous quarter, more than doubled when compared to the first quarter of 2012. Growth was driven by increased shipments from Bakken, Western Oklahoma and West Texas shale plays UP served terminals, primarily in St. James, Louisiana and the Texas Gulf Coast.","Plastics volume was up 3%, driven by the increased domestic demand and new business. Growth in the export market was the primary driver of the 4% growth in soda ash. Strong demand from Eastern Origins, Louisiana, as well as new business at the Gulf Coast led to growth in LP Gas, with shipments up 13%.","Industrial Products revenue increased 6% even as volume remains flat, driven by a 7% improvement in average revenue per car. Nonmetallic materials volume was up 11%, as continued growth in shale-related drilling increased fracs and shipments. Growth in housing starts and residential improvements increased the demand for lumber, with shipments up 18%. Hazardous waste shipments declined 63%, as costs on government spending resulted in production curtailments during the first 2 months of the year, impacting uranium tailing shipments. The slow start for pipeline projects, lower steel production and softer demand for export scrap was reflected in the 10% decline in steel and scrap. Continued mining production issues continued to hamper our expert iron ore shipments, leading to a 5% decline in metallic minerals.","Intermodal revenue grew 9%, as a 4% improvement in average revenue per car -- per unit, combined with the 4% increase in volume. Although the pace of recovery is slow, continued strengthening of the economy drove International Intermodal up 8%. While we continued to secure highway conversions with multi-carrier and premium LTL customers, overall domestic Intermodal shipments were flat, as these gains were offset by declines in select markets.","A closer look at the remainder of 2013. Most economic projections continued to forecast slow economic growth. Although we face continued challenges in some markets, our diverse franchise still provides opportunity to grow in others. Despite softness in coal demand and the previously announced loss of a customer contract at the beginning of the year, we expect coal volumes in the second quarter to see slight gains against an ease in comp last year. This assume the continuation of recent trends in natural gas prices and further coal stockpile reductions.","For the full year, we still expect coal volumes to be down slightly. We'll continue to feel the impact of the drought on last year's grain crop through the first half of this year, with second quarter Ag product volume expected to be down in the low double digits. Expectation for a more normal crop harvest in 2013 should provide opportunity later in the year.","First quarter Auto sales were at a seasonably adjusted annual rate of $15.2 million, the highest quarterly level in 5 years. The steady pace is expected to continue throughout the year, which combined with declining dealer inventories, should be good news for our Automotive business.","Crude oil should continue to drive Chemicals growth, but the pace will ease against the ramp up of volumes realized throughout 2012. Most other chemical markets are expected to remain solid.","Industrial Products should also continue to benefit from shale-related growth, with increased drilling activity and a ramp up in pipeline projects after a slow start to the year. The housing recovery continues to gain momentum, which is expected to drive demand for lumber. Iron ore moves are expected to decline due to softer export demand and mining production issues.","Successful conversion of highway business is expected to drive Domestic Intermodal growth, while modest economic growth and the strengthening housing markets should ease International Intermodal ahead of last year.","For the full year, our strong value proposition and diverse franchise will again support business development opportunities across our broad portfolio of business. Assuming the economy cooperates, we will see a more normal summer weather patterns, we expect a slight volume increase combined with price gains to drive profitable revenue growth.","With that, I'll turn it over to Lance.","Lance M. Fritz","Thank you, Eric. And good morning. Let's start with our safety results. Our first quarter reportable personal injury rate increased from first quarter 2012. The reportable incident rate was abnormally high in February but moderated substantially in March, and continued to show improvement year-over-year at the start of this quarter. Severe injuries declined sharply in the first quarter, reflecting our work to reduce the risk of critical incidents and the growth and maturation of our Total Safety Culture.","Rail equipment incidents or derailments improved to an all-time quarterly record. This improvement is largely the result of reduction in track cost derailments, which is a direct reflection of the investments we've made to harden our infrastructure. We also reaped the benefits from technological advancements and equipment defect detection.","Moving to public safety. Our grade crossing incident rate increased about 14% from the first quarter 2012. Our grade crossing incident exposure is increasing due to growing rail and highway traffic in the South, which has a higher grade crossing density than our overall network. Driver behavior was a meaningful contributor, with an increase from vehicle striking our trains or not properly stopping at crossings. As I've said in January, we continued to focus on identifying and improving or closing high-risk crossings, and reinforcing public awareness and safe driving practices.","Now let's take a quick look at the traffic pattern shifts we continued to experience on the network.","volumes on the southern region of our network continued to grow. In the South, we are near all-time peak carload volume last seen in 2006 and we are moving it more efficiently, with train speed up about 14% compared to 2006. While service was good by historical standards in the South, we experienced modest operational challenges during the first quarter, which were reflected in our monthly velocity and terminal dwell numbers. We responded aggressively by leveraging our fluid routes and terminals and realigning critical resources. As a result, we completed an aggressive first quarter capital renewal program in the South, and I am pleased to report fluidity has improved substantially over the last few weeks.","We are also making continued capacity investments to support volume growth across our diverse portfolio of businesses in the South. We expect 2013 capacity spending to top 2012, which includes critical double track additions, siding extensions and terminal capacity. These projects, along with continued process efficiencies, should support further improvement in network fluidity and service performance.","The first quarter service results were solid, and our network is well-positioned to handle future volume growth. Velocity was basically flat compared to the first quarter of 2012, with the modest slippage I mentioned in the South, offset by a strong results in other parts of the network.","We continued to provide outstanding local service to our customers with the first quarter best 95% industry Spot & Pull, which measures the on-time delivery of pulling of a car to or from a customer. Our Service Delivery Index, the measure of how well we are meeting overall customer commitments, declined modestly compared to the first quarter of 2012. The decline reflects tighter service commitments to our customers, with service challenges discussed earlier and the mix shift from coal to manifest.","Network fundamentals remained solid. We are increasing capacity in the southern region and we have available capacity in many other parts of the network, as well as roughly 450 employees per load and about 800 locomotives in storage.","Moving on to network productivity. Slow order miles declined 25% to a best-ever quarter -- first quarter level. Our network is in excellent shape, reflecting the investments in replacement capital that has hardened our infrastructure and reduced service failures. And we continued to leverage existing resources as our Intermodal and Manifest business volumes grow. During the first quarter, we turned the 4% growth in Intermodal volume into an average train size increase of 2%. Intermodal, Manifest, Coal and Grain Train Size lengths offset new first quarter records. Continued deployment of DPU locomotives, our capital investment strategy and process improvements should continue to drive efficiency gains going forward.","Car utilization was 1% unfavorable versus the first quarter of 2012 due to mix. Mix being equal, our car utilization rate would have been unchanged from last year's first quarter. The UP Way is playing a vital role in these results. Employee engagement is critical to the success of our average strategy, and as the team's doing the work to take ownership of improving the process and outcomes.","We remain optimistic on our full year operating outlook for 2013, and our ability to achieve continued network improvements on various fronts. Our first quarter results were solid, and there is room for improvement. I am encouraged by what I am seeing at the start of the second quarter, and for the full year, my expectation is that we will operate at record safety levels, while improving service and bringing more productivity to the bottom line. We are committed to operate a safer railroad for the benefit of all of our stakeholders, our employees, customers, the public and our shareholders. We will remain agile managing network resources in response to dynamic market shifts while handling growth with efficient and reliable service. Our continuous improvement efforts, particularly the UP Way, will generate further efficiency improvements that add value for our customers. And we will continue to make smart capital investments that generate attractive returns by increasing capacity and high-volume quarters, while also supporting our safety, service and productivity initiatives.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert M. Knight","Thanks, Lance, and good morning. Before I get started, I'd like to make everyone aware that the 2012 Fact Book will be available tomorrow morning on the Union Pacific website under the Investors tab.","So with that, let's start by summarizing our first quarter results. Operating revenue grew 3% to a first quarter record of nearly $5.3 billion, driven mainly by solid core pricing gains. Operating expense totaled $3.7 billion, increasing 2%. Operating income grew 8% to $1.6 billion, also setting a best-ever first quarter mark. Below the line, other income totaled $40 million, up $24 million compared to 2012. A onetime land lease contract settlement added roughly $0.02 in earnings per share compared to last year, which we do not expect to repeat going forward. For the full year, we're projecting other income to be in the $100 million to $120 million range barring any other unusual adjustments.","Interest expense of $128 million was down $7 million, driven by lower average interest rate of 5.6% compared to 6.1% last year. Income tax expense increased to $588 million, driven by higher pretax earnings. Net income grew 11% versus 2012, while the outstanding share balance declined 2% as a result of our share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce a first quarter earnings record of $2.03 per share, up 13% versus 2012.","Turning now to our top line. Freight revenue grew 3% to nearly $5 billion. Volume was down a little over 2 points, partially offset by more than a 0.5 point of positive mix. Fuel surcharge recovery added roughly 0.5 point in freight revenue compared to 2012. We also achieved solid core pricing gains of 4%, which was a key contributor to our record first quarter financial performance. Lower coal volumes, again, hindered further pricing gains.","Moving on to the expense side. Slide 22 provides the summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which was about flat compared to 2012. Lower volume costs and productivity gains mostly offset inflationary pressures of about 2.5%. And as Lance just discussed, shifts in traffic mix and significant capital replacement work in the South had an impact on operations and associated costs during the quarter.","Workforce levels increased 2% in the quarter, mostly driven by a shift in traffic mix to more Manifest business, which require additional resources. Increased capital and Positive Train Control activity also contributed to the growth.","Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $900 million, decreasing $26 million versus 2012. A 5% decline in gross ton-miles drove the reduction in costs. Although our average fuel price was flat year-over-year, our consumption rate increased 3%, mainly driven by lower coal volumes.","Moving on to the other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense increased 6% to $557 million due to higher locomotive and freight car contract repair expenses. In addition, under the new Pacer agreement, we're seeing higher costs in the form of logistics management fees and container costs not incurred under the previous agreement structure. These costs, both the purchased services and equipment rent expense line, and are recouped in our Automotive freight revenue line.","Depreciation expense increased 2% to $434 million. The impact that increased capital spending in recent years was partially offset by a new equipment rate study that we discussed with you earlier this year. Looking at the full year 2013, we expect depreciation expense to be up in the 2% to 3% range versus 2012.","Slide 25 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $313 million, up 6% compared to 2012. Increased container expenses and growth in Automotive and Intermodal shipments resulted in higher freight car rental expense. Lower freight car and locomotive lease expense partially offset these increases.","Other expenses came in at $237 million, up $21 million versus last year. Higher property tax expense and increased equipment and freight damage costs were the primary drivers. Lower personal injury expense partially offset these increases. For the remainder of 2013, we expect the other expense line to moderate slightly, more in the neighborhood of $225 million a quarter barring any unusual items.","Turning now to our operating ratio performance. For the first time in our history, we achieved sub70 first quarter operating ratio of 69.1%, improving 1.4 points compared to last year. Our performance highlights the positive impact of solid core pricing gains and network efficiency, and is also noteworthy given the fact that we had 2% decline in volume levels this quarter. Looking ahead, we remain committed to achieving a full year sub-65 operating ratio by 2017.","Union Pacific's record first quarter earnings drove strong cash from operations of more than $1.5 billion. Free cash flow of $401 million reflects the 12% increase in cash dividend payments versus 2012.","Our balance sheet remains strong supporting our investment-grade credit rating. At quarter end, our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio was 40.2%, which includes our March debt issuance of $650 million. Opportunistic share repurchases continued to play an import rant role in our balanced approach to cash allocations. In the first quarter, we bought back nearly 2.9 million shares, totaling $394 million. Since 2007, we purchased over 94 million shares at an average price of around $80 per share. Looking ahead, we have about 12.2 million shares remaining under our current authorization, which expires March 31, 2014.","So that's a recap of our first quarter results. Looking at the second quarter. Although our full comparison is much easier, we'll see ongoing challenges with weak grain volumes. However, assuming continued growth in the other market sectors, we would expect our second quarter volumes to be flattish year-over-year.","Aside from volume levels, we'll continue to target inflation-plus pricing gains. We'll also realize the benefits from continued productivity and network efficiency. For the full year, assuming the economy continues along its positive trend with industrial production growth of around 2%, we would expect to see volumes on the positive side of the ledger. We're well-positioned to achieve yet another record financial year, with best ever marks in earnings and operating ratio, driving even greater shareholder returns this year.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Jack.","John J. Koraleski","Thanks, Rob. While there is still much uncertainty in the year ahead our diverse franchise does really support our continued focus on profitable growth opportunities. We continued to pursue evolving business development prospects supported by our value proposition and the efficiencies that rail transportation provides. We're also well positioned for upside, but we are just as prepared if our environment should take a turn for the worse. We remain committed to providing safe, efficient, reliable service for our customers to drive greater customer value, and increase shareholder returns in the future.","So with that, let's open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to ask you about one of the popular topics, the crude-by-rail here. How would you view the potential impact of a decline in oil prices and also changes in the WTI brand spread? Or if you look at other spreads that might be helpful for inland crude moves, is that a material source of risk in the near term to volumes? Or are your contracts set up in a way that you have commitments, and so you don't have much sensitivity to the price and the spread moves?","John J. Koraleski","Tom, I think certainly, it depends on the order of magnitude of the moves that were to take place. We don't see anything in the horizon at this point in time that gives us any concern. But Eric, why don't you explain on those?","Eric L. Butler","Tom, there are couple of factors. We've said previously, crude-by-rail provides a great value proposition to the producers in terms of agility, in terms of being able to get to destinations that they previously couldn't get to. So all of that -- those value factors remain. Certainly, if the price of oil goes to levels, pick a number, below 70s, mid-60s, that's going to impact the amount of production, which, as the total production numbers come down, the total numbers that will go crude-by-rail will come down. So that clearly will have an impact if price of oil goes down. In terms of the spreads, we're probably less concerned about the spreads narrowing. Again, as the value proposition we've talked several times in the past publicly with crude-by-rail that, again, gets you to destinations, allows -- the producers flexibility and agility. So we think that even if the spreads get to some narrow -- some low single-digit numbers, there are still a value proposition for crude by rail. The biggest factor is if crude production goes down, then certainly, that impacts us.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And what about the structure of the contracts that you have in place into the St. James market? Are there some commitments that are multi-year where you would have some minimum volumes into those markets? Or is it set up in a way that, if things really changed, that there would necessarily be volume commitments?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. We said, we don't really talk about specific customer agreements. What I would say that you can look at is the fact that the destination providers and the origin producers, they're investing huge dollar amounts of capital to do crude-by-rail, both in terms of freight cars and facilities. So that should be a comforting indicator in terms of their long-term commitment to crude-by-rail.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Rob, can you just talk about the outlook there that you just ran through? If you look at truck carloads for the second quarter, do you still see coal moderating? Is Ag accelerating on the downside? Maybe if you can give a little bit more insight onto some color on what's in that in your targets there.","Robert M. Knight","Yes. Ken, just kind of reiterate what both Eric and I talked about. Keep in mind, as I think you know, the coal falloff that we saw year-over-year in the first quarter being down 19%. Last year, you recall, we sort of hit the trough on coal, so we do have clearly an easier comp on coal as we head into the second quarter. But as Eric mentioned, we do envision that the Ag drought will continue certainly through the second quarter, and we estimate that's going to be down in the, call it, low double digits, which is a little bit worse year-over-year, if you will, compared to what we saw last year. So when you add it all up, the guidance that we're giving is -- assuming all the other markets remain about constant with what we saw in the first quarter, that feels flattish to us. But full year, again, if the economy continues to cooperate, which thus far it is, all of those things will sort of neutralize, if you will, when we get to back half of the year. We think at the end of the day, at the end of the year, we'll have volumes that, overall, on a positive side of the ledger.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And If I can do my follow-up on pricing. Was there any -- on the coal side, were there any contract settlements within that -- within the yields? And then also within pricing, you mentioned the Pacer agreement a couple of times. Can you kind of talk about or walk through the level of increase? I know you don't like talking about specific contracts, but maybe just magnitude of what we're looking at or continued to go forward on that contract? And then similarly on pricing on Domestic Intermodal side, I think you mentioned it was flat. Can you just kind of run through what you're seeing impact on those -- on that as well?","Robert M. Knight","Ken, this is Rob. Let me take the first point, and you asked about the settlements in the Coal line. There's a little bit in there. We're not calling out precisely what it is. But it's a little bit of an impact on the ARC and the coal. And in terms of the other pricing discussions, we don't break out by  -- we don't talk about pricing on particular arrangements or agreements. So Ken, I'm not sure what your question was.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess you mentioned that the Auto pricing was up significantly because of the Pacer agreement, so you kind of called it out on there. I mean, can you give us, I guess, an understanding of what Auto would be like without the agreement? I mean, it was a big number in terms of the 10% increase. Is it half of that in terms of magnitude?","Robert M. Knight","Ken, this is Rob again. I mean, the impact on the Autos ARC of that new agreement, it's a 50-50 [ph] in that number. So clearly, it's deflated [ph], if you will, the ARC number. But that pacer agreement, as I think, everybody is aware, as previously announced, is really kind of a neutralizing effect. I mean, it's showing up both on the revenue and expense line, but it doesn't change the full year economics to us, the bottom line. But there is a positive impact that's showing up in that ARC number on the Autos line. And you will see that, full year.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, just on the Domestic Intermodal, as you had mentioned, something on [ph] flat there. I just wanted to understand that as well.","John J. Koraleski","Domestic Intermodal.","Robert M. Knight","Yes. We are continuing to see strength in our Domestic Intermodal business at the minute [ph]. I think I mentioned our conversion strategy is going well. We're continuing to price with the market, and we're continuing to be pleased with the performance in that business.","John J. Koraleski","The volume was flat in the first quarter, Ken. Is that -- was that your question?","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Oh, it's volume, okay. It's not price, yes.","John J. Koraleski","It's volume, not price.","Robert M. Knight","Ken, this is Rob. If I can just make one clarifying point on the Pacer questions you asked. I said that the Autos ARC reflected that this new agreement, but it's not reflected in our 4% core pricing number that we report. That's not -- that doesn't factor anything related in that number.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Trahan.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of those things from the last question. With the coal yields being so strong, if it's not legacy repricing, can you give us a sense of maybe what's driving that strength and if you think it's sustainable? And then, Rob, you mentioned that you're getting good coal yields even without the volume. As the volume starts to come back, can the coal yields -- or should they get even better from what we found in the first quarter?","John J. Koraleski","Scott, when you look at the pricing of our coal overall, there was some legacy impact from prior contracts that have been settled, and there was also -- that's the normal escalations that we have in our new contracts going forward. There were some incremental fuel surcharge. There was a little bit of liquidated damages, but not very much. So that's really it.","Robert M. Knight","Scott, if I  can just make one comment. The ARC number that we reported in the first quarter for -- in addition to the comments that Jack just mentioned, there is the mix effect in there. So that -- again, if you look at our overall pricing as an enterprise, we report a 4% price. And as I mentioned in my comments, it's hindered somewhat by the lack of volume in coal. But if you're searching [indiscernible], we don't break it out by commodities what the pricing actually was. But it is appropriate to take into consideration that the ARC number we reported in coal did have some mixed effect in it.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So when you add up all those kind of moving parts of maybe some liquidated damages that don't continue, and maybe coal coming back in some parts of the network, is this kind of double-digit run rate on ARC still sustainable for the year?","Robert M. Knight","It will depend upon the mix. Again, what we're looking at overall in our pricing is to be inflation plus kind of pricing overall, and that's how we approach the business overall. But when you look any individual commodity groups ARC, you can get swings either way depending on the mix of traffic that we move that quarter.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","That makes sense. And just last thing on the Domestic Intermodal. I'm a little confused if you're talking about the highway conversions going well, but domestic volumes were flat. What's offsetting that in the quarter? And just any color you can give us there would be great.","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. As I mentioned, in a couple of select markets, there were some competitive select markets that had some volume reductions and...","John J. Koraleski","Hey, Scott, let me take you back to our past comments, which is, as we take our prices up, there are some business is that's going to fall away from the railroad because it doesn't meet our reinvestable standards. And so we saw some of that. So we were taking some prices up, we've got some new business in highway conversions and we lost some business that needed our reinvestability threshold.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to ask a question on the cost side. When we look at compensation and benefits, it's actually been flat to down for the last 4 quarters or so. How should we think about headcounts and wage inflation, and some of the offsetting efficiencies that you're getting in the network for the rest of the year?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","The way we -- the guidance that we've given on the head -- let's me start with the headcount question first. Overall headcount for the year, we would expect to float with volume. So again, our projection is that, assuming the economy cooperates, that our volume will be on the positive side of ledger. So the way I would look at it is that we expect volume to be up year-over-year, but not necessarily 1:1 because there is certainly productivity savings we will achieve throughout the year. On the cost side, the way I think I would guide you to look at, the way I would expect cost to flow through is we think our labor inflation is going to be around 3%. There were some timing issues that resulted in it being flat, you're right, this quarter end, a previous couple of quarters. But probably the right way to look at it is expect that, that inflation on the wage lines would be around 3% going forward.","John J. Koraleski","Rob, one other thing to note and we mentioned it in our commentary, headcount will also flux with CapEx and with mix shift to manifest.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","From that guidance, Rob, then, I mean, should we be looking for more normal comp and then inflation of 3% throughout the year, I mean, depending obviously on the volume outlook then?","Robert M. Knight","I think that's the right way to look at it.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then quickly on purchase services. You mentioned that the Pacer agreement did escalate costs there. Is that the new run rate that we saw in the quarter for the rest of the year as well?","Robert M. Knight","There could be lots of factors. Obviously, volume overall will play a part in there. But that particular item that we saw in the first quarter will repeat throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jack or Rob, can I just ask you to comment a little bit on the return of capital approach? When you think about sort of the circumstances that might cause you to be a little bit more aggressive there or maybe change the way you think about leverage, because I know you do debt-to-capital. But I think if you look at it on a debt-to-EBITDA basis or in interest coverage basis, you've been pretty conservatively levered. So maybe you can just comment a little bit on what's circumstance you might be willing to be more aggressive in that regard?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. Bill, I mean, as we've said before, we haven't changed our approach. We don't look at just debt-to-cap because we use that as one of the measures that we talk publicly about. We look at all the measures. But where it all starts is we're focus on generating the cash, to begin with. We'll continue then to deploy the cash by making investments in capital projects where we're confident the returns there. We expect [ph] the 30% payout on the dividends, so we would expect that as earnings continue to grow, we expect the dividends to continue to grow along with it. And then we will continue to be opportunistic on the share repurchase activities that, in fact, we've been deploying for the last X number of years. So in terms of when you add it all up, Bill, as you've heard me say before, we are still comfortable in that 40s -- low 40s debt-to-cap ratio. That's not how we drive our business, but that's the kind of resulting measure that we are still very comfortable with it.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Rob, you also made a comment in your comments about core price, and I just want to make sure I understood it, and that is that some of the coal that's repriced didn't move, and I think, if we think back to '12, that kind of caused the reported core price metric to be a little bit lower in light of otherwise been the case. Was that a material impact this quarter again? I would have thought we're certain to lap it, but maybe you can just give a little clarity there.","Robert M. Knight","Yes, Bill, compared to sort of normal run rates, which is always the elusive part of that calculation, we call it about 0.5 point of price that did not materialize, had the higher levels of coal volume moved under those repriced contracts. So we reported 4% core price had it been sort of normal run rates of volumes in the coal world on those repriced contracts, it would've looked more like 4.5.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right. And then one last one just on nat gas, how soon is it at nat gas prices like this when we see the customers start to react? Is that a lag of like 6 months or 12 months? How do we think about that?","John J. Koraleski","Bill, actually, overall, we have seen customers start to make the shift back from natural gas to coal. The bigger problem right at the moment is there's not much demand for electricity or the demand for electricity is softer. So even though we've actually seen some customers start shifting back and taking more coal, we have not seen a substantial increase in coal shipments yet.","Eric L. Butler","If -- this is Eric. If you look back at last year this time, coal market share of electrical generation was down in the low 30% -- it's probably 32%, 33%, 34%. Today, it's about 40%. So clearly coal has regained market share at 4, 4.20 natural gas. As Jack said, the demand for overall electrical generation is still down as the economy is still coming back. And we're in shelf months in terms of weather patterns. So both of those are impacting the overall electrical demand.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.","Robert Salmon","It's Rob on for Justin. Eric, could you talk a little bit more with regard to your coal outlook? This morning, Peabody raised their expectation in terms of the coal burn by about $20 million on both the high and low end for the U.S. What sort of growth are you guys expecting in terms of consumption across your utilities, and would that imply upside to what's baked into your guidance currently?","Robert M. Knight","I think -- and, Rob, in our comments, we kind of indicated -- we said flat to slightly increase from the second quarter with the easier comps. The fundamental issue really is going to come down to the overall demand, and then how competitive coal will be against the natural gas. So you need the economy to come back strong. You need the large steel mills to start using electrical generation. You need normal weather patterns in the summer. And as all of those things happen, you'll see the demand for electricity go up. And again, as I said, current natural -- current coal market share has grown back to 40%. It will never get back to the 50%, that it historically was, but it's better than the low-30s. So I haven't seen that Peabody outlook. But my guess is that they're expecting normal weather patterns and continued economic growth in the economy to drive electrical demand.","Robert Salmon","No, that's fair. Coal's always a tough one to model. Looking forward, I guess, Rob, circling back on Bill Greene's prior question. When you're saying with coal getting back to kind of normal type burn levels, would flat year-over-year in Q2 imply normal coal levels and we should be thinking about kind of a 4.5% core improvement looking forward?","Robert M. Knight","It's always difficult to predict what normal is. But we are assuming, as Eric said, the positive news of coal being a greater market share. We do have the easier comp. And if volumes materialize, we would hope to see that in our margins on that business that we've repriced. So I guess I would say that we are looking at things to be more normal as we look out for the balance of the year.","Robert Salmon","That's helpful. And I guess before I turn it over, Lance, if you could talk to the Intermodal train length extension, you saw over kind of 2% year-over-year improvement on Intermodal boxes. Could you talk how that played out on both the domestic and the international train starts across your Intermodal franchise?","Lance M. Fritz","Sure. Off the top of my head, I do not have the detail on how that splits out between the 2. I can tell you that we do have sized opportunities on both. I would say they're probably more on the domestic side. But we've got plenty of train size opportunity both sides.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe just a question on the coal inventories. Eric, I know you mentioned that they're still elevated, could you just give us a rough sense of kind of where they stand relative to historical norms? I mean, are we still pretty far away from getting back to normalized levels?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. So the numbers haven't come out for the latest month. But as of the numbers that came out in March, they still showed overall for the whole country, 11 days above normal. There's probably some pretty wide swings in that number between Eastern utilities and Western utilities. I would expect a large number of the utilities in our serving area are putting -- getting pretty close to normal. There are probably some that are below normal because they've taken some aggressive inventory actions. So I would expect that we can see next month as the number come out, you'll see some pretty normal and may even perhaps below normal inventory numbers.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And is there any reason to think that the level of what should be normal changes at all going forward just with the relationship between natural gas and kind of where we are currently with the shale activity, or kind of old normal is the right way to think about it?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. I don't really see a huge change for the coal-centric utilities. They're still -- it's in their best interest to burn coal, and they're in essence competing against the natural gas-centric utilities. And so they're going to get their burn patterns up and they need a certain run rate to protect their burn pattern, to protect against outages. So I don't see a significant shift in what has been historical normal inventory patterns for coal-centric utilities.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And I just want to come back to, and I apologize, just on the mix aspect within coal yields. I'm trying to get kind of a handle on how to think about that. Can you give us a little bit of color of what kind of drives the big mix changes? It's just seeing more volume that had been repriced, legacy volume that have been repriced moving relative to other business within the commodity group, or I guess we're just trying to think about how to project this out in the next couple of quarters. So if there's any little bit of color around the positive mix dynamic in the first quarter would be helpful.","Eric L. Butler","Yes. So when we talk about mix, we're talking about the mix of Southern Powder River Basin coal, Colorado\/Utah coal, export coal, et cetera. And so if you look at some of the places where there are volume -- volume reductions, we've had positive mix in other areas because of some of the new Southern Powder River Basin coal opportunity that we have.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Ceraso of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So not to beat a dead horse, but I do have a couple of follow-ups on coal. First of all, can you just give us a ballpark out of the, let's say, 19 percentage point decline that you had in coal in Q1? How much of that was associated with the loss business? Was it 5 points out of the 19 or something in that neighborhood?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, Chris, the contract that we've spoken about previously was about 5 percentage points on the volume.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then if I kind of put together all the things that you've talked about so far that coal is back up to 40% of the burn, that inventories at the utilities in the west are back to normal or maybe below normal, your comps are getting easier. If we start to see increased volumes of coal, should we expect that the pricing gets better because you'll start to move some of the stuff that you didn't move last year, where you had recontracted at higher rates?","John J. Koraleski","It's really largely dependent on which customers grow, and what areas and how those kind of play themselves out.","Eric L. Butler","And again, as we've talked in the past about our pricing calculations, certain things may not come up in our pricing calculations, but they will show in improved margins as repriced business that those volumes come back, you'll see that in our margins even if you don't see it in our pricing calculation.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just one follow-up. The depreciation, bonus depreciation, Rob, what -- how much of a drag on cash flow do you think that might be for UP in 2013 versus 2012?","Robert M. Knight","Of course, as you know, we're getting still the benefit in 2013 of 50% bonus depreciation. So, which is what it was last year. So that is not a huge driver in 2013. But starting in 2014, we'll start to feel the impact of -- assuming there's no bonus depreciation beyond '13, we'll start to feel more of an impact. There's a slight benefit this year when you add it all up.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up again on the Intermodal side. I think when we look at the highway conversion opportunity, I think, largely, the assumption has been that given your length of haul, you have somewhat less of an opportunity than perhaps some of your eastern peers. Have you looked at the market for hauls of above, say, 500 or 600 miles to address what that upside opportunity is, and can you share that with us if you had a look at that?","John J. Koraleski","Sure, we have. Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Walter, I guess I'm not necessarily sure I'm tracking why a longer length of haul should result in fewer opportunity. We actually think the opposite that longer length of haul should result in more opportunities. The current total size of our Intermodal book of business is about 3 million units a year, closely equally divided between domestic and international. We size the domestic attainable market opportunity, and we talked about this in Dallas, I think, last fall. We size that as somewhere around 10 million units. Now, not all of that will be easy to convert. If you look at customers, there's a stratification of large, mid-sized and smaller customers. The large customers, the Walmarts, the Targets of the world, they are very intermodal centric already because they see the benefits of Intermodal. They could tune their supply chains to Intermodal. If you go to the mid-sized and smaller customers, we certainly -- that's the target rich environment, and we're working aggressively to sell the value of Intermodal to them, and some of that requires them to tune their supply chains a little differently, but that's the market opportunity, the business development opportunity, and frankly, why we're so excited about the future potential.","John J. Koraleski","And Walter, when Eric talks about the 10 million opportunity, that does not include another 2.5 million to 3 million trucks that moves back and forth between Mexico and the United States. And as you know, we're building a new Intermodal facility down in Santa Teresa to really target that Northern Mexico, the maquiladoras and those kinds of things, which will hopefully make a dent in that 2.5 million to 3 million unit opportunity as well.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's great color. Can you give us a sense of the available capacity on average of your Intermodal trains? Roughly how much incremental volume could we see go onto your new -- or Intermodal network without at fairly high incremental margin?","John J. Koraleski","Sure, how about Lance?","Lance M. Fritz","Sure. So again, that depends very much on the length that the opportunity show up in. But just giving you an aggregate sense, I think we've averaged, what, 170 units a train in the first quarter, and most of our lanes could probably handle 250 plus\/minus units. Again, very dependent on where it shows up and lanes specific.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And you're fully -- - double-stack capable roughly your network?","Lance M. Fritz","Virtually everywhere.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research","I just had a question about your Ag business. Obviously, the USDA is forecasting some pretty large crops this year. I just wonder as you look out over your draw territory, what's your read on soil moisture conditions and I guess, the risk of continued dryness in some areas and floods in others?","John J. Koraleski","Well, I tell you what, right here in Nebraska, after the past month or so, we're about ready to stick a fork in this drought. We've had some nice heavy rains and heavy snows and things like that. And hopefully, that is doing its job in terms of replenishing the moisture content ground. Eric, you want to put some technical around that?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, if you look at last year, Cheryl, the USDA said last year was going to be 1 of the 5 best years in all of history, and then we know what happened. So I take forecast with a grain of salt that this time of the year simply because so much of it is weather dependent. As Jack said, it appears to be a great start in our growing season, nice moisture in our key breadbaskets, we're all excited about that. We're not out of the woods yet, and we do need it to continue. And you not only need it certainly for the spring planting season, but you also need moisture in the critical parts of the heat of the summer. So there's a long tail left before we can feel comfortable about the predictions of what will happen in the harvest at the late -- latter part of the year.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research","Okay. And switching gears, just in terms of the public crossing accidents that you're experiencing in the South, which is really a function of your growth there and the whole region's growth, how disruptive for you from an operational standpoint are those? And how quickly do you think you can bring that back down?","John J. Koraleski","Okay, Lance?","Lance M. Fritz","Yes, sure. Excellent question. And just to predicate, this is an extremely frustrating statistic for us. We've been working very hard on impacting the trend for the past several years particularly down in Texas. The short answer on how disruptive, it varies, but generally speaking, it's a couple hours of downtime as the accident gets investigated and cleaned up. So they are -- they have an impact. It's variability. It's not same order of magnitude typically as a derailment. And in terms of when can we start moving the needle on the number, I'm telling you we're doing everything in our power right now to try to impact that number. As we look at it in large aggregate, we're about on top of last year's statistics. They're pretty volatile. So what you saw in the first quarter is a little degradation. But in general, absolute number, we're a bit worse but trying to navigate on top of last year's number. It involves a lot of things like an audit and blitz of our railroad to find where the risk is. The risk moves and grows rapidly with development of industry around us and in engaging the local authorities to care as deeply about the issue as we do to impact driver behavior. So there's a lot of activity going on there.","John J. Koraleski","That's a very difficult issue, and sometimes, you just -- I was surprised actually that we don't have the power to even put a stop sign up without getting the approval of local authorities, and sometimes, they just say no. So there are some pretty significant obstacles out there towards changing driver behavior and getting everybody on the same page as we are as to how important this is.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'd like to follow up on the comment about cross-border. Can you just remind us how much Mexico contributes to the bottom line presently? And given the tremendous growth prospects, what do you think it might look like over the next few years?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. Tom, we don't give the bottom line, but I'll give you the top line. It represents about 10% of our business levels currently, and it's been growing nicely the last several years across the board. The mix of the commodities has been growing at a pace greater than our overall volumes have been growing.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a more housekeeping-related question. With regard to the $40 million in other income, we estimate that -- I think you mentioned land sales contributed about $0.02 a share, what's the remainder of the $40 million?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Miscellaneous transactions. I don't -- I wouldn't call anything out in particular that was driving that. That's relatively -- the balance would represent a relatively normal run rate for us.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","I guess my questions more longer term here. I look at your 65% OR target by 2017, and to me, it seems fairly attainable. I mean, you just reported a first quarter that had fewer working days in it, you had a record OR, coal's under pressure, Ag's under pressure. Talk to me about that goal that you have out there and what some of your underlying assumptions are in terms of some of the commodity groups and also your core pricing which also seems fairly strong x coal at 4.5%.","John J. Koraleski","Sure, we think it's attainable, too. Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Jason, I mean, you've heard me say this over the years. I mean, it's not an end game, it's the next target that we've put out there, not unlike when we set the original 75% target. We got there as efficiently as we could and got there a little early. Then we set the low 70s, got there as efficiently as we could and got there a little early. We hope to get to this -- the previous sub 67% earlier as we mentioned last fall, and I'd say the same -- make the same comment about the sub 65%. So we're going to get there the same way we're going from where we are today to the sub 65% is the same way we got from the high 80s down to where we are today. And that is efficient safe operations, leveraging productivity, providing great service to our customers allows us to price it fairly. Fuel can obviously be a whipsaw on us, depending on what fuel does in terms in the calculation on the operating ratio. But I would just take comfort that we're going to -- that our assumption is a normal economy. If the economy cooperates and fuel prices are normal, if you will, and we're going to go after it as efficiently and as quickly as we can.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","And in terms of your assumptions for coal and its market share versus nat gas in that 65% OR?","Robert M. Knight","I mean, we don't get into that level of detail other than I would say, it's sort of a normal. I mean, we certainly think that Powder River Basin Coal is here to stay perhaps at lower levels than what we historically experienced, but our assumption is that it's sort of a normal from here on out if you will.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. And my follow-up question, on your Southern region, it seems like you had a little bit of challenges operationally. And is it starting to feel better already in 2Q, and how should we look at that throughout the year?","John J. Koraleski","Sure. Lance?","Lance M. Fritz","Yes. It is starting to look better. The actions that I mentioned in my comments regarding utilizing fluid routes, terminals, making sure we adjusted our resources rapidly, that made a difference in the tail end of March, and we're looking much more favorable in the South right now in the first few weeks of this quarter.","John J. Koraleski","Plus, we had our maintenance programs were very heavy in the first quarter, that was planned. Those are now starting to be completed and some additional capacity projects coming on as we go through the year with capital, and each one of those adds a margin of fluidity and improvement in our variability.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. So all things being equal, we should start seeing that come out in your weekly performance numbers?","John J. Koraleski","Yes, I expect so.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","This is probably related to Jason's question there, I guess, on how the improvements were accomplished in the Southern region fluidity, but related of years' $1 billion or so growth in productivity CapEx, at this point, can you cite a couple of projects that are perhaps most material likely to impact income or ROIC over the rest of the year and next?","John J. Koraleski","Lance?","Lance M. Fritz","Sure. So we've got some new capacity and commercial facility spending, that will have some impact. We've got a very large facility in Santa Teresa. It includes an Intermodal ramp that we think is going to really aid what Jack talked about in terms of cross-border truck traffic and conversion to Intermodal, plus a fueling facility. We've got some excellent work going on in terms of more fluid operations to our crude oil destinations. We should see benefits of that over the years. We've got capacity that's being spent up in the northern tier of our network, as well as in Texas to enable incremental, more fluid frac sand movement. We've really got it spread all over the railroad, largely concentrated in Texas from Louisiana, but there are key projects all over the railroad that are unlocking critical pieces of capacity for us.","John J. Koraleski","There are some things, Keith, that we have kind of scaled back given the volumes that we're seeing and in the way the economy is running like for instance, the double tracking of the Sunset Corridor, where we're 70% done with that and -- but we're pacing it a little differently to watch in terms of the volume, but long-term potential is the ability to take that from 55 trains a day to 90, which would be a huge step forward for us. We have the Mississippi River bridge that we're continuing to work on, that is a key bottleneck that would be eliminated as we go through that project. In the Blair -- we have a Blair cutoff that is not order of magnitude, that big, but anything that would save 3 to 4 hours of transit time on the trains that go through our Central Corridor to Chicago eventually helps the bottom line enormously.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe a one quick shorter-term question perhaps for Eric. We're seeing stronger growth in housing at last. Lumber improved 18% probably as a result of that. Could you comment on where and how material housing improvements are showing up elsewhere, be it light trucks, some Intermodal, et cetera?","Eric L. Butler","Great question. We're excited about the housing improvement finally. It -- housing is actually running ahead of the original Global Insight estimates, and I think the housing or the lumber producers are pretty positive about the trends that they're seeing and the housing start numbers that they're seeing. Housing, in addition to impacting lumber, it's also going to impact our Intermodal business. As you know, once homes are built, you have to furnish them. And so both on the International Intermodal business and the Domestic Intermodal business, we think that housing will have an impact on that. We think housing will also have an impact on ancillary business like our steel wheel book rebar business, which goes into construction. Our cement business, our cement business, we think that that will strengthen as housing strengthen. So all of those are things that will go as housing goes.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Eric, it sounds like you're using future tense though, that those are still sort of pending improvements, am I reading that correctly?","Eric L. Butler","No. I've been around here long enough. I remember when housing was regularly 1.7 million, 1.8 million starts a year, so even though we're back up to around 970 off a low of -- below 600, 970 still feels low to me. So I will feel like it's back regular normal when it gets above 1.3, 1.4, 1.5.","John J. Koraleski","But if you look, Keith, like in our cement business, I think it was up about 6% in the first quarter. Our plastics business, which include things like PVC pipe and those kinds of things that they're using in housing construction were also up in the first quarter. So we are seeing the residual impact that goes along with the incremental lumber.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Mims of FBR Capital Markets.","John R. Mims - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just one quick one for me just this late in the call. Eric, I stepped away for a minute, could you repeat what you were saying about International Intermodal, and maybe add to any comments related to outlook for any sort of a peak season in '13?","Eric L. Butler","What I was talking about International Intermodal is that as housing starts increase, you need to furnish the homes, and so we do see a trend between International Intermodal upswing as housing start improves, that was the connection that I was making. Last year, what we said was that it was a muted peak season. I think we used those words last year. It's early in the year, and it's -- at this point in the year, what happens, and peak will determine on the economic conditions, consumer confidence, retail sales, all of those things will determine kind of what happens in peak volumes.","John J. Koraleski","Right now, we are expecting the Intermodal peak to be stronger than last year. The order of magnitude is -- we're not sure we'll get it, really depends a lot -- bidding season is just coming in right now for a lot of those international contracts between the retailers and the ocean carriers and things like that, so there's still a lot to be determined in terms of how that'll play out for the summer.","John R. Mims - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Right. Okay. So as of right now, though, it's still just more of a read on the macro versus you having real conversations as far as staging capacity with the liners or with the major shippers?","John J. Koraleski","Right, that's right.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just to expound on that, I guess, this 8% growth in the first quarter, I'm assuming that's not a run rate for the balance of the year, and that the first quarter, you did benefit to some degree from certain shippers shifting away from the East Coast to the West Coast ahead of any sort of East Coast ILA strike during the first quarter. Is that the right? Is that the right way to think about the volume, the first quarter volume?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. We do not expect to see that kind of run rate for the year. There was some nominal impact of shifts from the East Coast, but very small. The bigger factor frankly was the timing of the Chinese Lunar New Year this year versus last year, and there was some advanced shipping because of that, that was probably the larger impact. Plus we did see an impact -- inventories were pretty thin after the holiday season last year. And you did see an impact of inventory catch-up by -- in January.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, good. And then on the coal side, I know you kind of earmarked a number of different various items that drove RPU above expectations to the $2,300 level. Is this a good level to be thinking about then? I mean, you kind of -- you hit on mixed legacy, fuel surcharge and some liquidated[ph] damages as well driving that number. But is this $2,300 level a good level to think about for coal as it relates to RPU for the balance of the year?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","As we indicated in some previous discussions, I'd be careful using a run rate of ARC because mix can have such an impact on that, up or down. So again, we're going to aggressively go after providing the good service and repricing where we can, but the ARC number can move on you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Maybe more of a conceptual question on the Intermodal side. The UP's service levels have improved dramatically over the last 10 years or so and have generally caught up to the other big Western railroad. And I guess the question is, as you see the service levels right now, where do you think you have a competitive advantage versus the competitor, where do you think the competitor has an advantage? Is that how you think of marketing the service, in particular, power lanes where you might have better on-time performance or a better velocity? And based on some of the investments that you're putting into the ground now, will you see that competitive positioning change at all here over the next couple of years?","John J. Koraleski","Yes, Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, so good question. To start with, we -- as we look at our Intermodal network, we are actually proud of the fact, we go to many more places than our competitor in the West in terms of our franchise, in terms of origin destination points where we have service, too. And that's really the power of the diversity of our franchise. We just get to and from many more places than the customer base. A large portion of the customer base does see value in that. Having said that, for the places where we do compete head to head, we kind of assess where we are very regularly. And we are pleased that in most of the places where we compete head to head, we think our service is as good or materially better, and the majority of the places where we compete head to head. There are a couple of places where our competitor has a slight advantage, and we are continuing to put initiatives and strategies in place to ensure that we have the best service in the industry.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then maybe one question that you don't need to answer if you don't want to, but I'll ask it anyway. With respect to operating ratio as the key metric to focus on for the future, you've said again here today, that you believe you'll get to a 65% or lower for the full year 2017, that seems like a very achievable target as one of the other analysts mentioned. But what happens if in 2016, Eric, comes to Jack with a $400 million project that has a 68% operating ratio on it, does that put you in the position of, perhaps, saying no to that project, or do you feel as though you can still accommodate that and access that incremental traffic? Would return on invested capital be a better measure or some other measure that takes into account, the generation of free cash flow? Just conceptual thought in terms of whether operating ratio is the correct metric?","John J. Koraleski","John, when we look at business opportunities at a high level and at a specific level, we're really focused on the reinvestability of the business, our ability to provide good, efficient, safe and consistent service for that customer. And then we deal with it on that basis in terms of the acquisition or whether we take on the business or not. We don't really think about it in terms of the operating ratio. But I will turn that over to Rob in terms of broader discussion of the key measures.","Robert M. Knight","Yes. John, I mean I get your point. And I would say that we set operating ratio target out there just as a way of kind of speaking in our organization as setting our mind towards making financial improvement. But at the end of today, it's focused on returns. So we know we still got room to go in improving our operating ratio, which will improve our earnings, which improves our cash, which if we do all the investments correctly, improves our returns. So they all kind of go together. But at the end of the day, it's the improving our returns.","John J. Koraleski","It's a really portfolio of measures.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","It's been a long call and most of mine have been answered, so let me just throw a quick one out there. I see the carloads for the crude business, if I thought about that in terms of trains per day and how to allocate those carloads, roughly how many trains a day are you doing in the crude business relative to how many trains a day for the system total? And is it fair to assume, this would be the follow-up, that it's longer haul business, and therefore, a higher RPU than your average chemical RPU?","John J. Koraleski","Lance?","Lance M. Fritz","Sure. Trains per day were in the 5 plus\/minus ballpark. Length to haul...","John J. Koraleski","750 miles.","Lance M. Fritz","Yes.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","All right. And how many trains per day for the total network?","Lance M. Fritz","In the total network, boy, varies by day a week and moment in time. But for instance, right now, we probably have 820 trains on our network.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Per day?","Eric L. Butler","Excuse me, you're asking a question that I don't think I can answer because the question I just gave you was terminating or originating trains per day on crude, and the trains per day in the network I look at as inventory. So I really can't answer your question the way you've asked it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So Rob, I noted here you're talking about a new equipment rate study on the depreciation line. Did that lower the rate that you guys are depreciating the equipment at for -- on a-go forward basis? So if you could add some color to that?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. So I mean, the result of the study was elongated, if you will, the depreciation on those assets, combine that with the fact that we're running a fewer gross ton miles, resulted in a lower depreciation rate than what we've previously experienced.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I think it was 5 -- the depreciation was 5.6% in the last Q. Is it -- can -- do you know the number off the top of your head, or should we just wait for the Q?","Robert M. Knight","In the first quarter, depreciation rate was 3%.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","3%, okay. And the fuel surcharge revenue in the quarter?","Robert M. Knight","I'm sorry?","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Fuel surcharge revenue in the quarter?","Robert M. Knight","About 0.5 point on the revenue line.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","0.5 point on the revenue line, okay.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Long of Stephens.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","In the quarter, your volumes were down a little over 3% sequentially, but operating expenses were up nearly 4% if you look on a sequential basis. Just on a high level, can you talk about some of the puts and takes that drove that discrepancy, and would you say that's not a trend you would expect going forward?","Robert M. Knight","Mix is always a factor in that particular calculation when you look at car loading sequentially and the expense going forward. So I guess I would say that take the guidance that we've given you in terms of the components as best you can as best way of looking at it rather than trying to calculate that particular sequential relationship.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then as a follow-up, could you comment briefly on CapEx and remind me where you stand from a railcar equipment perspective, and any investments you might need to make there given your volume outlook for the remainder of the year?","John J. Koraleski","Sure. Our current CapEx is targeted at about $3.6 billion for the year, which is down just a bit from last year.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Koraleski. You may begin.","John J. Koraleski","Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me in Omaha today are Rob Knight, our CFO; Lance Fritz, our Executive Vice President of Operations; and I also want to introduce Eric Butler in his new role as our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales. ","Now before we get started, I want to quickly thank all of you for the support you've expressed for Jim and his family during this time. I know Jim and the entire company greatly appreciate your thoughts and well-wishes.","So turning to the quarter, you can see that Union Pacific delivered record financial results across the board this quarter, generating a first quarter earnings milestone of $1.79 per share, an increase of 39% compared to 2011. First quarter record operating revenue, operating income and operating ratio performance drove our improved bottom line results. We're clearly delivering on the benefits of our diverse franchise, even as we saw the current coal headwinds start to build in the quarter. We remain focused on delivering safe, efficient, high-quality service that creates value for our customers and increased financial returns for our shareholders. These efforts were recognized with record marks in customer satisfaction and employee safety. So let's get started this morning, and I'll turn it over to Eric Butler.","Eric L. Butler","Thanks, Jack, and good morning. Let's start up with a look at customer satisfaction. For the quarter, customer satisfaction came in at 93, a new best-ever mark and up 2 points from first quarter last year. Along the way, we also set a new monthly record as well when he hit 94, both in January and March. We appreciate this continuing recognition from our customers, and our focus in the future is to continue our passion for service and strengthen our value proposition.","This strong value proposition and strengthening in some markets produced volume growth of 1%, even as a weak coal market drove a large decline in Energy carloadings. If you excluded Energy, our other 5 businesses grew 5% -- grew 4% during the quarter, even with lower demand for grain exports. Note that with a Leap Day this year, buying comparisons got a boost from an extra day of loadings.","Core price improved 5%, with all 6 businesses posting gains. Those price gains, combined with an increased fuel coverage and some positive mix, resulted in a 12% increase in average revenue per car. Volume growth and the improved average revenue per car combined to drive freight revenue up 14% to a first quarter record of $4.8 billion.","Let's take a look at each of the groups in a little more detail and heading off with Energy. Although Energy volume declined 8%, a 14% improvement in average revenue per car produced revenue growth of 5%. We indicated, going into this year, that with a couple of contract losses, growth for the Southern Powder River Basin was expected to be slow to negative. Our expectation was that new business across our Energy portfolio would help offset those losses.","While business wins and losses play a role, volume decline in our Energy business during the quarter was largely the result of a dramatic weakening of demand for coal, driven by a near-perfect storm of a very mild winter weather and low natural gas prices that, together, lowered electrical use in the U.S. by 4% and electricity generated from coal by 16% during the quarter.","You could see from the chart on the upper left how softening demand has played out in our weekly coal car loadings, with the volume shortfall growing as the quarter progressed, coming down 19% in March. The most significant impact has been in the Southern Powder River Basin, where tonnage declined for the quarter 8%. The rapidly changing market conditions are reflected in rising coal stockpiles for which the Powder River Basin were an estimated 17 days above normal in February, quite a swing from the level several days below normal as recently as October.","Colorado\/Utah tonnage fared better, declining 3% as strong international demand and new business helped offset the impacts of utility outages, increased use of fuels other than coal by utilities in the Southeast and the mild weather.","Ag Products revenue grew 6% as an 8% improvement in average revenue per car more than offset a 2% decline in volumes. Ag faces a tough comp against strong export grain volumes through the first half of last year. As expected, with increased world production and higher U.S. corn and wheat prices, our grain exports declined 39% from last year's record first quarter levels.","Growth in other Ag markets helped to partially offset the weakened exports. Drought damaged crops in the south, and shipments to reopen forward ethanol plants contributed to the increased domestic shipments of grain, which were up 15%.","Biofuels volume increased 13% as the rising mandate in exports spurned ethanol shipments. Biodiesel growth continued with strong market demand despite last year's expiration of the tax credit.","Our Food & Refrigerated segment grew 7% with the new business in barley and flour, along with growth in import beer leading the way.","Automotive volume increased 15% with the combined 10% improvement in average revenue per car, drove up 26% -- drove revenue up 26%. With the nation's vehicles aging and numerous new models available, consumers are driving sales levels higher, with the SARs rate hitting $14.5 million for the quarter, the highest level since first quarter 2008. The industry gains came despite rising gas prices, which appear to be shifting the mix towards more fuel-efficient vehicles, but not deterring overall sales levels. The auto industry's continued momentum translated into 16% growth in our finished vehicle shipments, while parts volume to support the growing production and sales level was up 12%.","Chemicals volume grew 8%, which, combined with the 7% improvement in average revenue per car, produced a 16% revenue increase. Petroleum products loadings increased 63%, driven primarily by the rapid growth in crude oil shipments, mostly from the Bakken and Eagle Ford Shale plays to the UP-served terminals at St. James, Louisiana. A slowly strengthening economy was reflected in improved demand for industrial chemicals, which grew 8%; while plastic shipments increased 4%. Partially offsetting overall strength in Chemicals was the 22% decline in fertilizer, driven by soft potash demand that led to temporary shutdowns or reductions at several mines during the quarter.","In industrial products, a 10% increase in volume and the 13% improvement in average revenue per car drove revenue growth up 25%. Energy-related drilling continues to drive strength in Industrial Products, with new frac sand origin and destination facilities coming online to support shale development, resulting in 36% growth in nonmetallic minerals. Energy markets, along with the auto industry, were the key drivers of a 14% increase in steel. Favorable weather during the quarter allowed unseasonably high construction activity, boosting rock shipments 16%, and the ramp-up of our iron ore move for export to China drove metallic mineral volume up 48%.","Construction-related volumes are still well below what we would consider normalized. Once again, this quarter, some of the strength in other segments was offset by a 51% decline in hazardous waste shipments, which have softened as government funded ramped down -- government funding ramped down after the stimulus money ran out.","Intermodal revenue grew 15% as the 13% improvement in average revenue per car -- average revenue per unit combined with a 1% increase in volume. International Intermodal volume declined 3% with the soft import market and the continued impact of a contract loss, which we won't wrap until May 1. The international volume decline was more than offset by gains in domestic Intermodal, where continued growth in high-rate conversions drove volume up 6%.","Let me wrap up with a look ahead at 2012. External forecasts for the U.S. economy have improved slightly since the start of the year, but the overall outlook still points to a continued slow recovery. Clearly, the biggest challenge to our growth is the significant weakening of coal demand. With coal stockpiles well above normal, near-term prospects for improvement in the domestic market seem low without unseasonably hot weather or a higher price for natural gas. As a result, coal volumes are expected to be down throughout the year. With normal softening of demand in the mild spring months, our second quarter decline is expected to be in the low to mid-teens. The good news is that our diverse franchise provides a wide range of opportunities for growth that help offset the weakened demand for coal.","Here's a look at what we see across the other groups. The booming shale Energy market was reflected in the strong growth of our Industrial Products and Chemicals groups during the first quarter, and the opportunity should continue to grow. Shale development and the resulting low natural gas prices also makes U.S. chemical producers more competitive in the global market. This should be good news both in 2012 and in the future.","Low feedstock prices have been a significant factor in recently announced expansions by U.S. plastics producers. In addition, our fertilizer business and potash production are expected to ramp back up. A number of our construction-related markets also got off to a fast start in Industrial Products, but we'll have to see if that momentum carries over into the construction season.","Global Insight is up, near full year SARs estimates of 14.2 million vehicles compared to a 13.5 million outlook at the start of the year, which should be good news for our Automotive business. We expect domestic Intermodal growth from continued highway conversions, supported by expected market growth and the pricing and capacity benefits of our Mutual Commitment Program.","In International Intermodal, we're still cautious and, as a result, only expect slow growth. Ag faces a tough comp, driven by last year's strong export wheat market. But as in the first quarter, they'll look to offset at least most of that shortfall with opportunities in other markets.","Across all of our businesses, our strong value proposition positions us to win new business and grow with existing customers. Expected increases in volume should combine with price gains to drive revenue growth despite the headwinds in Energy.","With that, I'll turn it over to Lance.","Lance M. Fritz","Thank you, Eric. Starting with safety, our reportable personal injury rate set an all-time record low in the first quarter of 2012, improving 10% from last year. Training, process improvements and capital investments combined to reduce both environmental and behavioral risks. I'm particularly encouraged by a steep reduction in severe injuries, which have the greatest human and financial impact.","Moving to rail equipment incidents or derailments. Our first quarter reportable rate was a record, down 1% from 2011. An increase in derailments caused by grade-crossing accidents and weather was fully offset by a decrease in most other categories, notably those caused by track condition and human factors.","In public safety, the grade-crossing accident rate was 28% higher than the first quarter of 2011 despite continued focus on community and driver behavior related to grade-crossing safety. I remain confident our activities will result in improvement in this measure as the year progresses. While I'm very pleased to report 2 of 3 safety measures at record lows, our ultimate goal is to eliminate all safety incidents.","Before we move on to UP's network performance, I want to spend a moment talking about the market shifts we experienced this quarter. We continued to see a shift in traffic mix towards our manifest and premium business, up 5% and 3%, respectively, with most of the growth occurring in the southern region. Pulp volumes declined only 4% as an increase in crude oil unit trains partially offset the 8% decline in coal. We've realigned resources to accommodate these shifting traffic flows.","Car routings were adjusted to leverage available capacity at terminals, and we modified train starts to maintain fluid operations and increase local service frequency. During the quarter, we also realigned our employee base and our hiring patterns and repositioned about 200 locomotives from our coal network into other parts of the system. Our team leveraged the growing manifest business well, using the UP's excellent route density and terminal infrastructure to generate a 3% improvement in the number of cars switched per employee day. And because our network is a shared resource, the capital investments we're making in the south to support current growth patterns support other service products like grain shipped to the Gulf ports and premium Intermodal to and from Mexico. Our agility is reflected in our network performance measures.","Starting in the upper left on Slide 16, train size improved with record first quarter manifest and Intermodal train lengths. Intermodal train size grew 2% despite a modest 1% increase in Intermodal volumes compared to 2011. Gross ton-miles per employee declined 1% versus 2011, which includes the productivity headwind of 800 additional employees working on capital projects and PTC. Excluding those employees, GTMs per employee improved about 0.5%, with gains in terminals and train size partially offset by increased manifest in local train starts.","Moving to the lower left, slow order miles were down almost 30% from last year, which was a best-ever record for any quarter. Our network has significantly improved over the last few years and is in excellent shape. In the lower right, our fuel consumption rate improved by about 2% compared to last year, driven by targeted operating practices, reduced network variability and a rewards program we call, Fuel Masters.","Overall, our network is operating well. Mild weather contributed to more favorable operating conditions this quarter, but that is not the complete story behind our solid network performance. The operating team demonstrated agility by successfully adapting the T-plan locomotives and crews to a rapid shift in mix towards manifest and the south. In Texas and Louisiana, there has been a complete team effort to effectively utilize the existing infrastructure while we build new capacity.","In other areas of the network, we took advantage of the warmer climate to continue work on capital projects when we normally would have throttled back, creating a modest headwind to network velocity. Even so, velocity remains in that consistent range of 26-plus miles an hour, increasing 1% compared to last year. Compared to 2010, average speed was essentially flat despite a 5% growth in system 7-Day carload volumes.","Our service scorecard illustrates UP's customer value proposition. The local operating teams continued to build the fundamental elements of great service, as reflected by Industry Spot & Pull, which hit an all-time best first quarter at 95%. The first quarter Service Delivery Index, which is a measure of how well we are meeting overall customer commitments, improved from 2011. Even as we meet the challenge of handling a carload surge in the south, we continue to have capacity for growth. We have plenty of network capacity in other parts of the system, with about 600 employees per load and around 800 locomotives in storage.","To sum it up, we remain positive on our operating outlook for 2012 and our ability to achieve continued network improvements on various fronts. We are well positioned for another record year in safety as we continue to mature our Total Safety Culture, strengthen our relationships with local communities and harden the infrastructure. We continue to provide excellent service, providing customers with a value proposition that will enable growth as the economy recovers. We are well positioned to react to dynamic shifts in volume while generating productivity, and we are investing a record amount of capital to alleviate network constraints across the system on projects that generate attractive returns.","In summary, we will use the 6 critical operating initiatives, including the UP way, to achieve growth with service excellence.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert M. Knight","Thanks, Lance, and good morning. Before I get started, I'd like to make everyone aware that the 2011 Fact Book will be available tomorrow morning on the Union Pacific website, under the Investors tab.","So with that, let's start by summarizing our first quarter results. Operating revenue grew 14% to an all-time quarterly record of $5.1 billion, driven by core pricing gains, fuel surcharge recoveries, positive mix and volume growth. Operating expense totaled $3.6 billion, increasing 7% compared to last year. Higher fuel prices contributed to over 1\/3 of this increase.","Operating income totaled $1.5 billion, a 33% increase and a best-ever first quarter performance. Other income totaled $16 million, up $1 million compared to 2011. Interest expense of $135 million was down 4% versus last year. Income tax expense increased to $528 million. Higher pretax earnings and a higher income tax rate in 2012 drove the 42% increase.","Net income totaled $863 million, a first quarter best, up 35% versus 2011. Earnings grew 39% to a first quarter record of $1.79 per share. The outstanding share balance declined 3%, reflecting our share repurchase activity.","Turning to our top line. Revenue grew 14% to a first quarter record of $4.8 billion. Carloadings drove a 1% increase. And we saw an unusually large positive mix impact, driven by stronger growth in higher average revenue per car move, such as the shale-related shipments versus Intermodal traffic. Fuel surcharge revenue added nearly 5% to our top line growth, driven by higher fuel prices and improved fuel surcharge coverage. Our focus on improving fuel recovery in recently negotiated legacy contracts generated a meaningful step up in fuel recovery, contributing over 1% in freight revenue growth and roughly $0.05 in earnings per share compared to 2011. In addition, we achieved solid core pricing gains of 5%.","Slide 22 provides more detail on our core pricing and fuel coverage gains for the quarter. As I mentioned, fuel coverage improved this quarter, largely driven by recent legacy negotiations, adding over a full point to revenue growth. Overall, we feel very good about the progress that we've made moving these contracts more to market.","We also achieved strong core pricing of 5%. However, our pricing gains were somewhat mitigated by declines in coal in International Intermodal volumes this quarter. That said, the combination of solid core pricing and fuel coverage gains reflect the value of Union Pacific's service offerings and contributed to a record profitability this quarter.","Moving on to the expense side. Slide 23 provides a look at our compensation and benefits expense, which was up 4% compared to 2011. Consistent with our previous guidance, more moderate inflation drove a 2% increase in costs. Workforce levels increased 4% in the quarter compared to 2011. Increased capital activity, including positive train control, contributed about 1\/2 of this growth. Base business activity drove the remaining increase, which was also impacted by the mix shift and additional resources that we deployed to the south.","In 2012, we still anticipate attrition in the 8% to 10% range. We'll continue to hire new employees to backfill for attrition and to support volume growth. Excluding growth on the capital side, we expect workforce levels to increase but not at a one-for-one rate with volume growth.","Slide 24 shows fuel expense, which totaled $926 million, increasing $100 million versus last year. The average diesel price -- fuel price was $3.23 per gallon, which increased 12% year-over-year. Drivers included the average barrel price of $103, which increased 11%, and a $5-per-barrel increase in the conversion spread. Fuel expense was also up as a result of a 2% increase in gross ton-miles, but this was mostly offset by a 2% improvement in our fuel consumption rate.","Purchased services and materials expense increased 11% to $526 million, driven in part by higher subsidiary contract expenses. Of course, you need to match the higher subsidiary expense with a 20% growth in subsidiary revenue, which is reflected in the Other revenue line.","We also saw higher locomotive and freight car repair expense this quarter, driven by increased material usage and inflation costs. Other expenses came in at $216 million, up $28 million, resulting from higher property taxes and personal injury expense.","As we said in January, the Other expense line will be challenged to 2012 with higher property taxes and personal injury expense. As Lance just showed you, we continued to see improvement in our safety performance, which drove a lower current-year accrual. But remember, our comp was more difficult due to a large favorable prior year adjustment in 2011. Going forward, we expect Other expenses to be in this neighborhood for the remaining quarters of the year, barring any unusual items.","Slide 26 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Depreciation expense increased 8% to $427 million, driven by increased capital spending and volume growth. Looking at the full year 2012, we expect depreciation expense to be up around 9% compared to last year. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $296 million, down 2% from 2011. Lower locomotive lease expense was the primary driver due to the early buyout of equipment under long-term leases.","Bringing it all together, Slide 27 reflects our operating ratio performance, highlighting the improvements in profitability that we've achieved over the last several years. Despite higher fuel prices in the quarter, we achieved a record first quarter operating ratio of 70.5%, improving over 4 points compared to last year's first quarter record. Core pricing gains improved fuel surcharge coverage, and modest volume growth all contributed to this improvement. For 2012, we continue to target a record full year operating ratio performance.","Union Pacific's record earnings drove strong free cash flow in the first quarter. While cash from operations increased compared to last year, free cash flow was lower due to increased capital spending and a 55% increase in cash dividend payments. And as we discussed in January, we still expect bonus depreciation to be a net benefit to cash flow this year, but it will result in a headwind compared to 2011 due to the catch up of prior years' programs and a 50% bonus depreciation rate in 2012 compared to a 100% rate in 2011.","Our balance sheet remains strong, supporting our investment grade credit rating. At March 31, 2012, the adjusted debt-to-cap ratio was 40.1%.","Opportunistic share repurchases continue to play an important role in our balanced approach to cash allocation. Union Pacific's increasing returns over the last several years have enabled us to drive greater shareholder value.","In the first quarter, we bought back 3.9 million shares totaling $433 million, up $185 million compared to last year. Since 2007, we purchased nearly 83 million shares at an average price of around $74. Combining dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned over $720 million to our shareholders in the first quarter of 2012, up more than 65% versus last year. Looking forward, we have 23.9 million shares remaining under our current authorization, which expires March 31, 2014.","That's a recap of our first quarter results. Solid pricing gains, the improved fuel coverage and volume growth drove a 39% increase in earnings. In addition, favorable weather conditions this year and a large fuel headwind in the first quarter of 2011 also contributed to year-over-year earnings growth.","Looking ahead, we still expect record earnings in 2012, but our quarterly comps will get a little bit tougher, particularly in the second quarter. We expect second quarter earnings to improve sequentially and on a year-over-year basis, but not at the same rate that we saw in the first quarter. And as Eric just discussed, softer coal demand will pose an even greater challenge for us in the second quarter.","That being said, we still expect volumes to be on the positive side of the ledger for the full year. Continued growth in domestic Intermodal, energy-related shale moves of crude oil, frac sand and pipe in addition to strong Automotive and Chemical shipments should offset the coal decline. Again, this clearly highlights the benefits of our diverse franchise. And our prospects for 2012, supported by Union Pacific's strong value proposition, should allow us to reward our shareholders with even greater returns.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Jack.","John J. Koraleski","Thanks, Rob. With the strong first quarter behind us, we are totally focused on the prospects that lie ahead. Although coal volumes remain a challenge, we expect that continued opportunities in other areas of our business are going to allow us to drive financial -- record financial results for the year.","We're moving forward with our capital investment strategies. We're investing today to strengthen the network and build capacity that will drive improved customer service and shareholder returns for tomorrow. We believe very strongly in the opportunities for growing our financial returns for the future.","So with that, let's open up the phone and take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Capital.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Maybe if we can just come back to that comment on the second quarter, I'm sure a lot of people are wondering here. When you said that earnings growth isn't going to be as great as the first quarter, are we thinking on an EPS level? Is that what you're guiding to?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. What I'm saying there is -- yes, on an earnings basis, the rate of improvement won't be as great as the rate of improvement that we saw in the first quarter. However, as I pointed out, we do expect it to be sequentially stronger and still grow year-over-year, which is not quite at the same rate. Again, the main challenge is the coal that we talked about.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then obviously, there's going to be a lot of questions on coal today, and I think I'll open it up with this. But a lot of people are asking, in the West, transportation costs are a much larger piece of delivered cost to utilities. And with gas prices as low as they are, if they stay here for a while, some people are connecting the dots and saying, \"Well, the rails could actually cut the rates to keep coal moving.\" Is that a fair statement? And how would you address that?","John J. Koraleski","Brandon, I would tell you that, for the most part, transportation rates are not going to make or break the productivity and the efficiency of coal electric utility generation. If there is a utility that is so close to the edge that the transportation rates are making the difference, we'll probably not going to be in a position of being able to save that utility, nor would we go down that path with our pricing strategies.","Operator","Our next question is from Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wanted to ask another question on, I guess, the demand side. How much -- on the coal, how much visibility and conviction do you have in that kind of low- to mid-teens decline in second quarter? I think, through first quarter, as you talked about coal, it seemed to get worse at a couple of times when you talked about it. I think you had said down 5, down 7, and it ended up down a little bit more than that. So are you -- you feel like you have good visibility that it's not going to be down more than, say, 15%? And then I don't know if you have any thoughts on second half, how we might look at that as well?","John J. Koraleski","Well, at some point in time, Tom, we're predicting the weather here. So that makes it a little bit iffy on our part. When we look at our coal situation right now, here's how we think about it: The gas capabilities in our served territory have already played their cards. So there's not really a lot more opportunity in the utility that we serve to shift anymore production to gas. So that's really running full out at this point in time. We've seen the fall off now in volumes. We think that's going to stay. And so we think that low to mid-teens is probably a fairly solid number. If you have a normal summer, by the time we get to the end of the second quarter, we should start to see our volume kind of pick up and then it will grow in the third and fourth quarter, and you'll start to see overall coal volumes come back. And in the meantime, we think we've got enough upside on our other business, like the shale plays, the Automotive business, the domestic Intermodal side, that, by the time we get to the end of the year, we should still be in positive territory for total volumes.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Let's see. The second question, just in terms of the thinking about margins and incremental margins in second quarter. You had some coal headwind already in first quarter, and you had the 400, over 400 basis points margin improvement. I know you're saying be a little more cautious on a difficult comparison in second quarter. But given the mix of business, I would think your incrementals could still be quite strong in terms of where you're growing in the merchandise network, maybe running longer trains and getting good pricing on that shale-related business. Is that kind of a fair way to look at it to say, all right, be a little careful, but incrementals should still be pretty strong in second quarter?","John J. Koraleski","Rob, you want to take that?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. Tom, in the first quarter, let me just kind of set the stage there. You're right, incremental volume were -- margins were outstanding in the first quarter at over 60%, which was driven by all the positives that we spoke about. How it will play out, I would expect that incremental margins will continue to be very positive. Exactly how it will play out will be as dependent as anything on the mix effect. We expect, as Eric walked through, positive strength to continue and things like the new shale-related activities. We expect international -- or excuse me, domestic Intermodal to continue to strengthen. So the mix will play a fact in that. But I would expect that incremental margins will continue to be strong.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jack, I just wanted to follow up on the first question on coal. I mean, it sounded like you pretty much were saying that you guys wouldn't use price as a way to stimulate growth in volume on the thermal coal side. I mean, is that the way to read that? I mean, it doesn't sound like it makes economic sense for you guys to do that, and I just wanted to follow-up and get clarification there.","John J. Koraleski","Again, Justin, you've been with us a long time, and you know that our strategy has been to ensure that every piece of business that moves on our railroad is re-investable. So we're going to continue to go down that path. We don't think the transportation rates -- if you have a utility that is on the edge of economic viability, we don't believe transportation rates is going to save that utility, and it has further implications for us in all of our other customers. So we don't want people trading on the basis of transportation contracts. We want them trading on the basis of their own productivity, efficiency and manufacturing capabilities. So we would stay with my earlier answer.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that makes a lot of sense. When I look at the 4-week moving average and kind of economically sensitive carloads, if I strip out Ag and coal, it feels like you've seen maybe a little bit of deceleration in growth rates here in April. And I just wanted to see how that jives with what we've seen from some of the other economic data out there. We had extremely strong West Coast port imports in March, and I was wondering if you've seen follow-through in terms of that in your network here in April. Maybe if have any color on whether or not those strong imports were some of the customers getting ahead of steamship line GRIs. I was curious to see if you had any color on what's going on, on that end of things.","John J. Koraleski","Okay. Eric, you want to take a shot at that?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. As we look at the ramp up in April, clearly, April started off soft from a trend standpoint. Part of that is due to the holiday weekend that we saw. But we are seeing a good ramp up here in the latter part of April, and we feel pretty good about our outlook for the demand and the other businesses, as we've discussed earlier, both the domestic businesses and our opportunities on the import side. So we still are pretty confident looking at our outlook and looking at our current rate and run rate and ramp up.","John J. Koraleski","My finance team would tell me that April is historically our lowest month of the year.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Oh, interesting.","John J. Koraleski","And we're hoping that's the truth this year, too.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Group of Wolfe Trahan.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Why don't you ask on the legacy contracts first? What percent of the repricing in '12 is reflected in first quarter? I'm wondering if some of it gets layered in throughout the year or even over the next couple of years. And then can you talk about the timing? I know it's early, but talk about the timing for the contracts in '13. And does the situation in coal, in your mind, kind of limit the upside for future legacy repricings on the coal side?","John J. Koraleski","Sure, Scott. Eric, you want to take a first shot? And I can help you out if you...","Eric L. Butler","Yes. As has been said in the past, we expected to see a 1- to 2-point percent benefit from our legacy pricing, and that's what we're seeing this year. Certainly, the volume mix or the volume shortfall in coal and some of the volume shortfall in our International Intermodal business has had a negative impact on our legacy pricing mix. But we are seeing it still in that 1% to 2% range that we had expected. We do not have any layered pricing plans in our late -- in our legacy contracts throughout the year, but we are firmly committed and looking forward to meeting, exceeding the price expectations that we had out there.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","But it sounds like if the coal volumes come back next year, that the impact to the legacy will kind of fill a second leg to that. Is that fair?","Robert M. Knight","If I can just add, this is Rob, Scott. As Eric pointed out, yes, if the coal volumes came back. Because what we experienced in the first quarter, both on coal and also on International Intermodal, is some of the repriced business didn't move. So, yes, if that volume came back, that would be a positive for us if that repriced business came back. The other thing I wanted to respond to you, Scott, was your question on the legacy in 2013. The bulk of that is front-end loaded.","John J. Koraleski","So again, Scott, if you just think about it, we have one of probably the most conservative assessments of core price. Because if the car doesn't move, regardless of how high we raise the price, we don't get credit for it. And so the core price of 5% is a solid number for us. The mix did hurt us, as everybody pointed out, in terms of coal and International Intermodal, because that is where the bulk of our -- where all of our legacy renewals from last year were housed. So hopefully, we'll see those volumes improve as we get through the year and we'll start to see a greater contribution from. I think the best assessment of it though, the total impact, you just to go back to the operating ratio and see that 70.5 to 4 points of improvement.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Sure. And just second question, it's a newer market for us, so we don't have the history. How should we think about the yields in margins in the frac and the crude oil business relative to the overall book of business?","John J. Koraleski","Overall, when you look at the frac sand and the crude oil, it's re-investable. It's at market rates, and we're very, very happy to have as much of it as we can bring on the railroad.","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jack and Rob, when we -- when you first gave your long-term guidance on OR, I guess it was in 2010, I think a lot of us on the Street sort of viewed it as being conservative. And you cautioned us at the time and said, \"Listen, these are long-term numbers, and so a lot can change.\" And obviously, natural gas changed. So if natural gas stays at 2, and I know there's a lot of people that'll say, \"Well, that isn't going to be the case,\" but just as an assumption, do you still feel comfortable about that long-term guidance that the coal franchise is materially smaller?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Yes, Bill. We're staying with that 65% to 67% operating ratio target, full year operating ratio target by 2015. And you hit the nail in the head. When we gave that guidance, a lot of things have changed. But we have not changed in our conviction, in our commitment. We may get there a different way, and I think we're walking our talk in terms of making the kind of progress we did, even without the benefit of coal in the first quarter with that 4-point improvement. And as I've said all along, and I said this when we set the original 75% target, in the low 70s operating ratio target, we're going to get there as efficiently as we can, as quickly as we can. It's not an endpoint. It's just a next step along the game here. And so we're not changing our conviction. We're going to get there as soon as we can, but we still feel confident about that, even though it may come in a different way.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, good. Good. The other question that comes up a fair amount is just trying to understand the dynamics of take or pay contracts in the coal industry. I mean, that is, sorry, for you guys on the utility side for coal. So first of all, do you have any utilities sort of paying you for sort of take or pay, i.e., they're not taking the coal but they're paying anyway? Is that something that happens now? How did that manifest itself? And when we see these -- when we see these sort of announcements of cuts from coal mines like BTU today, do we have to take that into account when we think about your volumes? Is that sort of a leading indicator or a lagging indicator?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","We do have a small percent of our coal customers that are running at minimums, but it's a very small percent of our coal customers that are doing that. So we typically don't have a large portion of take or pay contracts.","John J. Koraleski","So we have customers that are operating at their minimum, but they're not falling below and then paying us the economic penalty.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So when we see a mine is announcing cuts because they expect lower shipments, does that -- how does that play out for you? Is that an indicator we need to keep in mind? Or are your volumes already ahead of what they're cutting?","John J. Koraleski","I think our volumes are already ahead of what they're cutting. And customers, many times, have multiple mine sources, so they can move between mines.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wonder if you could give a little bit more color on the negative mix impact within the legacy business, just looking at kind of the year-over-year core price build. Just want to get a rough sense if you can, kind of what that impact was, the softening on the growth there?","John J. Koraleski","Sure, Chris. Rob, you want to handle that?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. And again, just to make sure everybody's following what Chris is asking, the way we calculate price, and I would say, again, the financial organization, our conservative looks at it, it's all in yield, and we calculate it across our entire book of business. So as Jack pointed out, if something doesn't move, it doesn't get counted, obviously. And also, what doesn't get counted in our price is if there's new business that comes on board, which we've seen a lot of that. So you see that positive mix in our operating ratio, but you don't see that in the price. But specific to your question on the negative impact that we saw in the first quarter from price, I would say it was about 0.5 point. And what that is, is a result of the repriced, mostly coal and International Intermodal business that made up the bulk of that billion dollar legacy end of fourth -- or end of 2011, beginning in 2012 that we talked about. That did not move. So the volume wasn't there, we didn't get credit for it in the way we calculated the price. And that was about 0.5 point, if you will, from a core price impact.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And did the delta between that and the 3 percentage points of mix, favorable mix, is, to your point, the new business that's coming on, which is likely the crude-by-rail, frac sand, those kinds of things, which are coming in at a higher revenue per carload?","Robert M. Knight","Chris, that's exactly right. The other thing I would point out that was a real plus in -- shows up in our operating ratio improvement, but also shows up in our legacy renewal success is the improvement in our fuel recovery mechanism. We're still not where we want to be as a company. We're not going to be at 100% until we finish off all of the legacy renewals. But we did make a nice step forward with improving our lot and recovering fuel.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up on the headcount side. Just want to get a sense roughly, assuming we hit your target for coal in the low to mid-teens for the second quarter and we see how it plays out going forward. But how do you think about kind of headcount and where your staffed? I mean, should it be basically flat from where we are as average employee per quarter going forward? Or do you think you need to do anymore furloughing or anything like that going forward?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","I'll kind of address the overall, and there's a mix impact here, as Lance pointed out, in terms of the growth in the south versus less growth in the other parts of the region. So we're dealing with that, and Lance and his team are addressing that. But at a macro level, just reiterating, we would expect that headcount will grow with volume. So with volumes on the positive side of the ledger, which we expect it will be for the full year, we would expect headcount to actually be up net-net as a result of the hiring that we will do for both attrition and hiring for growth, but not at a one-for-one level. In addition to that, headcount likely will grow as we continue to increase our capital spending, which is again a $3.6 billion spend this year and the impact of positive train control. So net-net, I would expect that if volume plays out the way we expect it to on the positive side of the ledger, that headcount would be exactly up.","John J. Koraleski","Lance, you and your team have been working at those headcount levels and kind of making adjustments as we see volume changes. Do you have anything to add do that?","Lance M. Fritz","Yes, sure. So we're at a furlough number of about 600 right now, something like that. And we have been adjusting both our hiring and our existing headcount numbers. I expect those will continue to adjust. I think hiring is, of course, going to be pretty healthy for mostly attrition, and mix is going to be driving some of that headcount decision as well as we see manifest absorbing more of the business and requiring more headcount than some of the coal business, for instance.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. It's fair to assume that you're going to have a slightly higher headcount per carload because of that mix shift that we're seeing into manifest?","John J. Koraleski","That's fair.","Operator","Our next question is from Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research","The first question I wanted to ask was on International intermodal. You're still striking a fairly cautious tone there, so I wonder if you could just give us a bit more color on what you're hearing from customers? And comment on the potential for East Coast labor negotiations to influence flows to the West Coast?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Well, as you know, we have a tough comp in the first quarter, first half of this year. Intermodal volumes -- International Intermodal volumes last year were very strong, and they're off compared to last year. And then we also have a tough comp throughout the first half of the year with the contract loss that we discussed in the past. So we have those 2 factors that are putting some caution in our outlook for some early part of this year. In terms of your question about East Coast issues, there are a lot of factors that impact whether a steamship carrier decides to land on the West Coast and use a land bridge or go through the East Coast. We think that our value proposition and the strength of our franchise still allows the West Coast option land bridge to be a very strong option, and we still see a very competitive outlook in our business from that factor, vis-a-vis East Coast ports.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research","And in terms of your crude business, obviously it's still probably a small fraction of the business, but a lot of interest in just how big that might be. Just wondering if you could quantify that and talk about how that may grow over the short term and what the constraints are there. Is it terminal capacity? Is it tank cars? If you could just elaborate a bit.","John J. Koraleski","Yes, I'll give you just a couple of benchmark points for you. Last year, our shale crude oil was about 3,900 carloads. And in the first quarter this year, it was 20,400. So that's order of magnitude, just kind of where we saw the volume growth. We think it's going to continue to grow as we go through the year. We were something like 26 trains, as I recall, last September, 72 trains in March, moving forward to 100 and beyond that as we go through the year. So it's growing nicely for us.","Lance M. Fritz","And Jack, you can see the constraints, if any. It's basically being paced right now by facilities.","John J. Koraleski","Right.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research","Meaning the terminals?","John J. Koraleski","Yes, meaning the terminals. There was a press release yesterday or the day before, that our partner, US Development, down at St. James, just opened up, added capacity that will allow 2 trains a day. So as we talked earlier about some of the ramp up we're seeing here, April and beyond, that's kind of a good news piece of the factor for us.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Nesvold of Jefferies & Company.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So earlier, you talked about how you're still committed to getting to the 65% to 67% OR, even if PRB does go into secular decline, and there other things that you can do. Are there a few things that you point to? What actions, what changes would you make to the network in order to continue to improve the OR if that business does continue to shrink from here?","John J. Koraleski","Lance?","Lance M. Fritz","Sure, yes, let's get started. So let's say coal does shrink over the long run going forward. Well, some of the first things we do is we reallocate resources, we right size the business, which we have been doing in the first quarter. We'll continue to do. On the upside of productivity, as we've talked about before, we've got just a target-rich environment for improvement, whether it's train size improvement, process improvement in terminals, process improvement over the road and the benefits, the productivity benefits of our capital spend. So we've got ample opportunity in the operating side to continue to improve productivity and efficiency.","Robert M. Knight","If I can just add to that, in addition to all the operating ships and improvements that Lance just walked through at a macro level, what will continue to also drive our operating ratio improvement are: continue to focus on adding the capacity and the changes that Lance talked about; providing great service to our customers, which enables us to continue to get price in the marketplace; continue to improve our surcharge recovery mechanisms. All of that adds up into our operating ratio target.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","But is there capital that you typically would allocate to the coal business that you might reallocate to other businesses in order to get those productivity improvements or the benefits? Because I would suspect that you would be doing these productivity benefits regardless of whether coal is growing or not growing. And so is it redeploying the resources to other parts of the business so those businesses can grow faster than what they would do in a base case scenario?","John J. Koraleski","For sure, reallocation of fungible assets happens, and that will benefit, as Rob mentioned, both growth rates and service. And from the standpoint of capital, in the current outlook, there's just not a lot of capital that we've got planned for coal-specific operations. I mean, I just don't think there's a lot of adjustment there.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a quick follow-up. You talked about inflation moderating. If the contracts are all structured as inflation plus, does that mean that, that core pricing, at least nominally, will start to level off or maybe come down a little bit as the year progresses? Of course, maintaining a positive spread. But does the headline number start to come down a bit?","John J. Koraleski","I really don't see that happening, Peter. Rob, do you have any...","Robert M. Knight","Yes, I would just add that -- Peter, while we've talked about sort of our general view of inflation plus sort of philosophy, it's not like the contract spells out inflation plus in the terms of the contract. So the fact that inflation is high one year like it was last year, and as we pointed out in the Labor line alone, last year, inflation was in the 4% to 5% range. This quarter, we turned in 2%. We expect the full year to be somewhere in the 2.5% range. We are not -- that does not impact our pricing decisions that we're making currently.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Ceraso of Credit Suisse Group.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of follow-up items on coal and then one other, just your comment about low to mid-teens volume growth. Does that assume that weather gets better? Because currently, it's running down in kind of the high teens. So how do you get there? It looks like once we get into the second half of the quarter, the comps start to get quite a bit harder, too.","Eric L. Butler","As Jack said earlier, we're not capable of predicting the weather, but our assumption is that we're going to have a normal outlook for the second quarter. Again, second quarter is typically a shelf month where there is a normal downturn in the second quarter, just because of the mild weather. But we're expecting a -- our low to mid-teens outlook assumes normal weather patterns.","Robert M. Knight","If I can just make one comment on that. Remember, and Eric showed it on his slide earlier, that there was a little bit of uniqueness in terms of the comps last year. Remember, we had the flood last year that hit in the second quarter, then we came out of that strong, and it strengthened throughout the balance of the year. So just keep in mind, as you look year-over-year, that there was that unusual activity last year.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right. And second, you've commented on this a couple of times, about pricing in the market and staying the course. But to the extent that pricing is market-based, some of your -- or your main competitor in the West has made some public comments about trying to work with customers and lowering price. Does that not factor into your plans on pricing?","John J. Koraleski","Chris, our commitment is to make every carload on this railroad re-investible over time and get to that level. And if we can't achieve those kinds, where we can re-invest in the locomotives, the track capacity and things like that, we will probably pass on the business.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just one housekeeping one. The other revenue was up pretty strongly, and you did make a comment about some liquidated damages. Is that where that would show up?","Robert M. Knight","No, that's not what that is, Chris. The driver of the other revenue was relatively small, but our subsidiary rev, what we call subsidiary revenue, was up nicely this quarter for us. Not anything to do with any kind of liquidated damages discussion.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You talked a bit about your coal contracts. Rob, are you seeing any kind of minimum commitments decrease in the renewed contracts that can dramatically lower the kind of commitment of those utilities to obtaining coal?","John J. Koraleski","Ken, why don't we let Eric have a shot at that?","Eric L. Butler","No, no, no. We don't see that. As I mentioned earlier, a very small percent of our coal customers currently are operating at their minimum commitments, and we don't see any contract changes in the future that would address that or lower that.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So as you went through the negotiations at the end of last year, as they were seeing the low nat gas prices, you didn't see a kind of sizable push to get those minimums reduced?","Eric L. Butler","We did not have any significant contract changes that we implemented.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's encouraging. And a follow-up would be kind of, I guess, if you can maybe just walk through how much the weather aided your kind of costs when you think about operations that -- maybe that's a Lance question in terms of the quarter, just what kind of tougher comps do you anticipate if we were to have a normal weather come next year, just as we move forward through the year?","Lance M. Fritz","Sure, Ken. Now you know we're used to operating outside, so the weather did have some favorable impact, right, where we're typically going to spend on snow removal or, perhaps, face some tough operating conditions during very inclement weather. We didn't have much of that repeat across the system the first quarter this year. That's really kind of minor in the grand scheme of things. What I would have much preferred is a cold winter and good coal demand, and I would have traded that in a heartbeat.","John J. Koraleski","Amen.","Operator","Our next question is from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","First question here is a follow-up on the Intermodel question on the International Intermodal. Rather than discuss your demand, can you talk a little bit about the market share on your -- on the ports you serve? It seems that we could see some shifts into Canadian northern ports, especially -- even into Mexico. Are you seeing that occur? And could you also tie that into your view on Panama when that starts to fully open up and what that could mean to your International Intermodal franchise?","John J. Koraleski","Okay. Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, that's -- well, that's a good question. Certainly, from a Canadian standpoint, everyone's familiar with Prince Rupert. And Prince Rupert is certainly looking to position itself as an alternative port. And if you look at the U.S. West Coast ports, particularly the Port of L.A. Long Beach, that is, and we foresee for the foreseeable future, to be the predominant port for imports onto the West Coast from a value standpoint, from a cost standpoint, from a productivity standpoint, from a size standpoint. And we don't really see a lot of risk to that, the Port of L.A. Long Beach position or the other U.S. West Coast ports. Certainly, there are ports in Mexico that are also attempting to position themselves as options, but we really don't see that. ","In terms of the Panama Canal, lots of points of view out there. I think some of the experts would suggest that if you look at the expense of the Canal and what is already happening with the Canal fees, if you look at the fact that there are not many current U.S. East Coast ports that could handle the larger ships, and there would be an expense that would be required to do dredging and decks expansion to handle those ships, we think the Canal might have a minor impact. I think the market numbers today, roughly about 30% of the freight goes all water. That may increase a couple of percentage points as you look at the opening of the Panama Canal. But we're not expecting it to be, at this point in time, a significant impact on our going-forward strategic plans.","John J. Koraleski","The key thing for us, Walter, as Eric said, we haven't seen that shift taking place. And one of the reasons is because we are doing everything we possibly can to deliver great service to our customers. And as long as our service package is excellent and stays excellent, that's our best defense. It's our best defense against port shifting on the West Coast, it's also our best defense against a new port capacity in Mexico, although we may actually benefit from that, I guess, depending on which port it would come across in the border. But also, the shift to the Panama Canal. That's largely -- we can influence that greatly by the kind of service, and we are up to that challenge.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's great color. I appreciate that. And keeping on the port theme here, if I remember correctly, your last investor day, there was -- you were eluding a little bit to the potential for coal port expansion that you would be able to service but weren't in a position at that time to really elaborate on it. Can you give us any update on that if you can?","John J. Koraleski","Right now -- so the one that we were probably most excited about was the one up in Longview, Washington. That's kind of run afoul of some of the EPA concerns. We're actually kind of watching that whole decision for the EPA to be kind of taking a more broad or blanket look at potential environmental situations. But certainly, the one at Longview was important us. We've been moving quite a bit of export coal now down through Houston, and we think there's some additional capacity there. We've been working with mines and the Ferromex railroad and looking at the Port of Guaymas down in Mexico. All of those things are still in play. The newly added challenge or wrinkle for us is what happens with the EPA reviews.","Eric L. Butler","Yes. To add to what Jack said, I think the current list of proposed projects, some of which multi-year duration and all of which, certainly, will be subject to various environmental, permitting review processes, but -- the list of projects really would expand export coal capacity to over 100 million tons annually. That's a huge number.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, absolutely. I mean, I think you nailed it on the head there with the -- the permitting is being a big problem. But if that can go through, you could see a lot of opening capacity. Just a final, here, clarification. You mentioned if you get a good, nice, warm summer, you could see growth in the back half. Did you mean growth sequentially? Or growth year-over-year in your coal shipments?","John J. Koraleski","Sequentially.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Seidl of Dahlman Rose.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","First, Jim, if you're listening, hang in there. We're all pulling for you. Back to business. I promise, no coal questions from me. I think that's been beaten to death here, and I think you guys will be probably happy with that as well. I want to actually turn back to one of your responses to a question. You mentioned that some of the potential new ports in Mexico that you might be able to win some of that business, I'm assuming you're talking about APM's expansion down there in L\u00e1zaro. Are you guys in talks with them? Is there a big opportunity to start bringing some of that business into the U.S. through your Mexican ports? And then I have a follow-on in a different segment.","Eric L. Butler","Yes, I think most of those comments were referred to the ports on the west coast of Mexico. We are actually having in-depth conversations with a number of port officials and with our partner railroads in Mexico, to look at product and service offerings, both export and import and not just Intermodal, but also bulk products, export and import in a variety of ports down there. So we think there is some upside. There are some capacity things we're working through, but we believe there is an upside.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Does that bulk include coal?","Eric L. Butler","Yes, that includes coal. Coal and other exports, yes.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","My last question is also going to be in response. You said there were no capacity constraints for your crude-to-rail projects, which I found interesting. Everyone I seem to talk to right now can't seem to find any tank cars, and I'm even including some of the larger shippers out there as well. Is this just because there's enough tank cars on backorder that you expect to come through for the remainder of the year? And then maybe if you could just touch on sort of hopper car demand right now and where we sit with that compared for frac sand?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. I'm not sure we said there were no capacity constraints. Lance will talk a little bit about our principal capacity. There are significant -- perhaps a record number of tank cars coming online, as you may know. I don't have the exact number off the top of my head, but there is almost a record number of tank cars. So that it a significant investment that customers are making, third parties are making. And I think enough tank cars will be coming online to align with the demand that is out there. There's also significant investment in covered hoppers that are coming online that handle the drilling materials for -- like frac sand for the drilling market. So I think the car -- there's some headwinds there, but there are enough cars coming online to address the capacity issues, I think, over the midterm. In terms of the physical capacity issues, I'm going to let Lance address that.","Lance M. Fritz","Sure. Jason, you might be referring to -- I think what we said was the volume on crude was largely being throttled by destination facilities. But that's not to say that there aren't other capacity constraints or challenges. On the railroad side, we're largely overcoming those with incremental resources, and we're building capacity rapidly as we speak.","Robert M. Knight","If I can just add? Yes. Jason, you probably know this, but the investment in the tank car itself is not our investment. That's the investment of the producer, of course. Yes.","Jason H. Seidl - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","So in other words, I guess, the way I should read this is there might be some maybe near-term potential constraints, but you guys are helping improve throughput, which will help run existing equipment that's out there right now. And as we move throughout the year on the crude-to-rail, the stuff that's on backlog right now that's coming in the market should help alleviate some of the constraints that are out there?","John J. Koraleski","Absolutely. And we have very, very excellent cooperation with our customers. I mean, it's not just us. It takes the entire team, the customers, the destination facilities, the railroad, everybody working together to keep this thing moving on a fluid basis. And it's very, very heartwarming to see it happen.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Matt Troy with Susquehanna International Group.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I was wondering if you could just give an updated sense of the landscape on pending and existing EPA regulations. It certainly seems to be a problem, more localized for Appalachian production. But to the extent there might be potential risks as you it or as identified in your network, maybe you could shed some light on that? And then I think, more importantly, are you still getting inquiry from either southeast utilities, new utilities in the East or even increased inquiry from Asian-based coal buyers about thermal coal in the PRB and what those opportunities might be; have they picked up? Are they about the same? Are they less than they were a year ago?","John J. Koraleski","Sure, Matt. Overall, the EPA, we're just all over that. We're working with the utilities, with the mines and watching very carefully as to what might happen with the EPA reviews and those kinds of things. So I don't know that we could add any particular insight at this point in time, other than we're watching carefully, doing the things that we can to support our coal customers in the coal industry. And moving forward, it's a lot of jobs for this country. It's a lot of opportunity for us and for our shareholders, and we don't want to see that go astray. In terms of the contacts on export, Eric, do you want to talk about what's happening?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. So I mentioned earlier the port development projects that we referred to in the West Coast and also in Mexico, those are really being driven by the inquiries for coal for -- [ph] coal for Asia. So we are still seeing a significant amount of potential demand for export coal.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Right. But I mean, if I look at the list of proposed projects, be it the Millennium Bulk, Port of Morrow, Port of St. Helens, Grays Harbor, Port of Coos, Pacific Terminal, the list hasn't changed. Some of the permitting -- we've gone from 200 to 400 to 500 tons -- excuse me, 20, 40, 50 tons at some. So the permitting seems to be going in the right direction. I'm just wondering, has there been a cooling from the folks that actually will consume the coal, not actually have to build the terminal on the other side of the Pacific or in the Southeast. Or is the dialogue consistent, i.e., are people looking past this year in coal?","Eric L. Butler","We have not seen any cooling, and I would say, perhaps, the opposite. We've seen some real time higher level of interest for export coal out of Mexican ports that do not seem to have the same permitting process requirements, perhaps, that we have in the Pacific Northwest ports.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman, Sterne Agee.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just a quick -- a couple of detailed questions. On your coal franchise, can you give me an idea what the length of haul on the utility businesses is this year versus last year?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","I don't think there's a substantial significant difference in length of haul this year versus last year.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. How does your length of haul compare in your coal franchise out of PRB relative to the Bakken franchise? Because you mentioned that, that is offsetting some of the bulk business to some degree. I just want to get a sense of difference in distance.","John J. Koraleski","Lance?","Lance M. Fritz","I can probably answer that. It's in the ballpark, on average. In a normal demand scenario, coal might be marginally longer.","John J. Koraleski","Yes. I would say coal is probably longer. We're -- the interchanges for us on the crude oil out of the Bakken would be Kansas City, St. Louis, Chicago, St. Paul. So -- and then you would add beyond that the coal. So I would say, the oil transfer, a little shorter in terms of length of haul. Maybe 100, a couple of hundred miles max.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","All right. And just what is the domestic utility length of haul across your network right now?","Lance M. Fritz","I mean, we can get back with an answer on that. Historically, it's in the 900 to 1,000 miles.","John J. Koraleski","I would have told you 1,000 miles would be my best guess, but we could clarify that. We could have Michelle or someone.","Operator","Our next question is from David Vernon of Bernstein Research.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Within Industrial Products, can you talk a little bit about how the mix change within that might have affected the average revenue per car that was reported? It was a very strong number for the segment.","John J. Koraleski","Okay. Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. Industrial Products had very, very strong growth in terms of the drilling-related things as we [indiscernible] as we mentioned. So frac sand, steel. Very, very strong growth. Moderate growth in some of the other base of construction products like our rock business, our lumber business. And we actually saw a significant decline in volume, as I referred to in some of our hazardous waste business. We had a very short-haul contract that we've talked about in the past where the stimulus funding ran out, and so there was a significant reduction in that business.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then just one short follow-up. In terms of pulling forward CapEx, Rob, are you -- are we going to keep the same guidance for the full year?","Robert M. Knight","We are. $3.6 billion. No change.","Operator","Our next question is from Tyler Brown of Raymond James.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I had just a question on your crude-by-rail franchise. Have you guys really seen any noticeable change in the interest for rail transportation, given kind of the Seaway reversal and the potential of a WTI Brent spread narrowing? And do -- or do you think that those rail transportation decisions really are made just given a simple lack of pipe capacity in place such as the Bakken?","John J. Koraleski","Eric.","Eric L. Butler","We are still seeing a strong interest in crude-by-rail. And one of the things that we have seen is that we are providing a very strong value proposition, not only in terms of the value in terms of cost, but also the time. There's some assessment that suggests crude by rail is faster to market and certainly has the ability to change markets vis-a-vis crude by pipeline. We do not forever foresee taking over the haul market, but we do see, for a long-term play, the opportunity to have markets move crude by rail, as long as we continue our value proposition.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So you think there is a pretty good longevity to this business?","Robert M. Knight","That's our assessment.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Rob, I just have a quick cash flow modeling question, but can you help us bracket the magnitude of the bonus depreciation step down this year? And then would it also step down again in 2013 if it goes to 0?","Robert M. Knight","Let me take the second part of that first. Yes, it would continue to step down as it goes to 0 because you got to pay back a portion of the prior years and, of course, the current year fall off. I think the order of magnitude of the change is in the couple of hundred million range year-over-year.","Operator","Our final question today is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Impressive 60% incremental margins. Noting train length improved even with velocity and service both up, I wanted to ask, can you envision Intermodal trains longer than 170 units or manifest longer than about 90 cars? Can this be accomplished without compromising speed?","John J. Koraleski","Lance?","Lance M. Fritz","Yes, both can be. Again, we -- typically, when we respond to train size questions, we remind you that it's very specific by quarter. But there is equal opportunity on both and without any negative impact on service parameters.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And at the present business level, can you speak broadly, and I recognize this is going to be lane-by-lane, but -- about the relationship of train starts and incremental volume? That is, can crew starts move in line with volume additions? Or will be there -- or will there be an opportunity to improve or maintain the current incremental margin?","Lance M. Fritz","Yes, we can all -- I'm going to speak to the train starts as volume increases. We always have the opportunity to leverage volume through train starts via size and with key plan changes. Mix does have an impact, but in the global sense, as we grow, we would expect we should be able to generate some productivity out of train starts.","John J. Koraleski","Okay. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call this morning. Clearly, our 150th anniversary year is off to a great start. We do have some challenges ahead as we manage through a soft coal environment, but our franchise diversity has given us a lot of opportunities to help us do just that. So we're going to keep doing what we know how to do: We're going to stay agile in a changing environment, we're going to stay focused on providing great service for our customers, and we're going to continue to improve returns for our shareholders. And we look forward to being back with you again in July, at the end of another strong quarter for Union Pacific. Thanks very much.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow today\u2019s formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President, and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may begin.","Lance Fritz","Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's third quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, Chief Financial Officer.","This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2016. This equates to $1.36 per share, which compares to $1.50 in the third quarter of 2015. Total volume decreased 6% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in five of our six commodity groups, with coal and industrial products both down double-digits.","Agricultural product volumes were up a robust 11% this quarter versus 2015 as grain shipments finally started to show some strength. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 62.1%, which was up 1.8 percentage points from the record third quarter last year, but improved 3.1 percentage points from the second quarter of this year.","Continued momentum from our productivity initiatives, as well as positive core pricing helped partially offset the decline in total carload volumes. While many of the same volume challenges have continued throughout the year, we are keeping a laser focus on our six value tracks. This strategy ensures we provide our customers with an excellent value proposition and service experience, while efficiently and safely managing our resources.","Our team will give you more of the details, starting with Eric.","Eric Butler","Thanks, Lance, and good morning. In the third quarter, our volume was down 6% with near record agricultural product shipments more than offset by declines in each of the business groups. We generated core pricing gains of 1.5% in the quarter, reflecting the impacts of competitive markets and a weak economic environment, particularly in our energy related and international intermodal businesses.","Despite these challenges, we continue to achieve solid re-investable returns even in these difficult markets and we remain committed to achieving positive core pricing gains that reflect our value proposition over the long term. The decline in volume in the 2% lower average revenue per car drove a 7% reduction in freight revenue.","Let's take a closer look at the performance for each of our six business groups. Ag products revenue gained 6% on an 11% volume increase and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car. A robust U.S. grain supply and lower commodity prices generated export strength and let the grain volumes 27% in the quarter.","Wheat exports rebounded in the second half of the quarter as adverse weather in South America caused significant loses elevating demand for the higher protein U.S. wheat. Grained products carload advanced 5% in the quarter, primarily due to increased ethanol exports and biodiesel shipments.","Food in refrigerated carloads were flat in the quarter as strong demand for import beer offset softness in refrigerated food shipments and import sugar. Automotive revenue was down 8% in the quarter driven by 2% decrease in volume and a 6% reduction in average revenue per car. ","Finished vehicle's shipments decreased 7% by sales and production levels of passenger vehicles impacting key Union Pacific served plants and contract changes we referenced last quarter that will continue to impact that volume through the first part of 2017. In total, finished vehicle sales in the quarter were at a seasonally adjusted average rate of $17.5 million, up 2% from the second quarter, but down 2% from the 2015 third quarter. ","On the product side, a continued focused on over-the-road conversions drove a 5% increase in volume. Chemicals revenue was down 1% for the quarter on a 1% decrease in volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. We continue to see headwinds on crude oil shipments, which were down 48%, due to lower crude oil prices, regional pricing differences and available pipeline capacity. ","Chemicals volume, excluding crude oil shipments were up 2% in the quarter. Partially offsetting the declines in crude oil was strength in other areas, including industrial chemicals, which was up 3% in the quarter. Coal revenue declined 19% for the quarter on a 14% decrease in volume and 6% decline in average revenue per car. Sequentially, however overall coal tonnage increased 40% from the second quarter of this year. ","Powder River Basin and Colorado Utah tonnage declined 17% and 16% respectively in the quarter as increased demands from a warmer than average summer was unable to offset high coal stockpiles. PRB coal inventory levels in September were 90 days down 13 days from June, but still 27 days above the five-year average. Industrial products revenue was down 13% on an 11% decline in volume and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter. ","Minerals volume was down 22% in the quarter, driven by 26% decrease in frac sand carloadings impacted by lower crude oil prices and decreased drilling activity. Construction products volume was down 8%, due to weather impacted construction activity in the South. The strong U.S. dollar, weak commodity pricing, and an increased imports pushed metal shipments down 13% year-over-year. ","Intermodal revenue was down 9% on a 7% decline in volume and a 2% decrease in average revenue per car. Domestic intermodal volume declined 2% in the quarter. Excluding headwinds from the previously discussed discontinuation of Triple Crown service domestic was nearly flat. ","International volumes were down 11% in the quarter as the industry continues to face significant headwinds from weaker global trade activity, softer domestic sales, high retail inventory on the Hanjin bankruptcy. ","To wrap up, let's take a look at our outlook. In Ag products we expect a healthy U.S. harvest and strong world demand for U.S. grain to drive favorable export trends. Grain products will continue to be strong driven by ethanol exports. In food and refrigerated, we expect continued strength in beer imports. ","Turning to autos, light vehicle sales are forecasted to finish 2016 at $17.4 million, down less than 0.5% from the 2015 record rate of $17.5 million. Although we expect sales incentives, low gasoline prices and consumer preference will continue to drive demand. We remain cautious with respect to auto sales sustaining at these levels. A continued focus on over-the-road conversions will support auto parts growth. ","Our chemicals franchise is expected to remain stable with strength in LPG and industrial chemicals offset by declines in crude oil. Coal volumes will continue to be impacted by natural gas prices, high inventory levels, and export demand. As always, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand. In industrial products lower crude prices and reduced drilling activity are expected to continue to challenge minerals volumes. ","We anticipate a softer year end for metals as imports continue to impact domestic shipments and customers manage year-end inventories. We expect lumber to be stronger in the fourth quarter as housing starts continue to expand. ","Finally in intermodal, our international volumes will continue to be adversely impacted by a strained ocean carrier industry, offset partially by over-the-road highway conversions. In the face of a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy, our diverse franchise remains well positioned for growth as the economy slowly improves. We remain committed to strengthening our customer value proposition and driving new business opportunities. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance.","Cameron Scott","Thanks Eric and good morning. Starting with our safety performance, our year-to-date reportable personal injury rate improved 16% versus 2015 to a record low of 0.77. Included in this was a record low number of severe injuries, which have the greatest human and financial impact. ","Although we continue to make significant improvement, we won't be satisfied until we reach our goal of zero incidents getting every one of our employees home safely at the end of each day. With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our year-to-date reportable rate of 3.13 improved 4% versus last year. ","While we made only a slight improvement on the reportable rate, enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investment helped significantly reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those who did not meet the reportable threshold to a new record low. In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased 13% to 2.55. We continue to focus on driving improvement by reinforcing public awareness through various channels, including public safety campaigns and community partnerships. ","Moving to network performance. While the California wildfires and flooding along various parts of our network created some challenges during the quarter, our network proved resilient as we continue to achieve solid operating performance. Effective use of our surge locomotive fleet and TE&Y workforce were critical to minimize the impact of these network challenges. ","As reported to the AAR, velocity improved 2% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Terminal dwell also improved 2%, but the benefits of a food network were somewhat offset by productivity gains such as longer train lengths and other network management initiatives. ","Moving on to resources, as part of our ongoing business planning process, we continue to adjust resource levels to account for volume changes and productivity gains. As a result, our total TE&Y workforce was down 14% when compared to the same quarter last year, but up 2% sequentially from the second quarter to efficiently handle the 8% volume increase experienced since the end of June. ","We also continue to evaluate all other aspects of the business with a goal of driving productivity throughout the organization. This includes the rightsizing of our engineering and mechanical workforce, which was down a combined 1,900 employees or 9% versus the third quarter of last year. ","Our active locomotive fleet was down 9% from the third quarter of 2015, but up 2% sequentially to handle the increase in carloads. As you know, we\u2019ve been planning for the acquisition of 230 new locomotives this year. ","We now expect that number to be 200 locomotives this year with the delivery of 30 units delayed into 2017. This would add to the 70 units previously scheduled in 2017 for a total of 100 next year. We are adjusting our 2016 capital program down about $100 million to just under $3.6 billion, primarily driven by this change in locomotive deliveries. ","Turning to network productivity, while we remain focused on effectively balancing our resources, we also continue to realize efficiency gains through several productivity initiatives. Train length is a significant productivity driver and a primary focus area for us. During the quarter, our manifest and grain networks ran at all-time record train length levels, while our automotive network set a third quarter of record. ","Re-crew rate, a cost incurred when the first crew had insufficient time to complete the trip is an indicative measure of the fluidity and productivity of our network. Our third quarter re-crew rate was 2.3%, a near 2 point improvement from 2015 and a third quarter record. ","As we move forward, we expect our safety strategy will continue yielding positive results on our way to an incident free environment. And where growth opportunities arise we\u2019ll leverage that growth to the bottom-line to increase utilization of existing assets, while maintaining our intense focus on productivity and efficiency across the network.","With that I'll turn it over to Rob.","Rob Knight","Thanks, good morning. Let's start with a recap of our third quarter results. Operating revenue was about $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 7% versus last year. Lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core pricing achieved in the quarter. Operating expenses totaled just over $3.2 billion. ","Lower fuel costs, volume-related reductions, and strong productivity improvements drove the 4% improvement compared to last year. Operating income totaled almost $2 billion and a 11% decrease from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $29 million, roughly flat versus 2015. ","Interest expense of $184 million was up 17%, compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months, as well as about $8 million for the fees associated with our recent debt exchange transaction. This increase was partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. ","Income tax expense decreased about 14% to $674 million, driven primarily by lower pretax earnings. Net income totaled just over $1.1 billion, down 13% versus 2015; while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combine to produce quarterly earnings of $1.36 per share. ","Turning now to our topline, fright revenue of $4.8 billion was down 7% versus last year, primarily driven by a 6% decline in volumes. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $173 million, down $141 million when compared to 2015, but $86 million from the second quarter of this year. All in, we estimate a net impact of lower fuel prices was a $0.05 headwind to earnings in the third quarter versus last year. ","The business mix impact on freight revenue in the third quarter was about flat, similar to what we experienced in the second quarter. Year-over-year growth in agricultural product shipments and declines in international intermodal volumes were positive contributors to mix, which were offset by declines in industrial products and finished vehicles volumes. Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at about 1.5%. ","Slide 21 provides more detail on our pricing trends. As Eric just mentioned, pricing gains this quarter reflect a competitive marketplace and as soft economic environment. Going forward, we remain committed to our focus on positive return driven quarter pricing, which reflects the value proposition that we provide our customers. ","Moving onto the expense side, Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 6% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes, improved labor efficiencies, and fewer people in the training pipeline. ","General, wage, and benefit inflation partially offset these decreases. Labor inflation was about 3% in the third quarter, driven primarily by general wage increases and health and welfare expense, which were partially offset by some favorable pension costs. We still expect full-year labor inflation to be about 2% and overall inflation to be about 1.5% for the year. ","As a result of lower volumes, solid productivity gains and a smaller capital workforce, total workforce levels declined 10% in the quarter year-over-year or more than 4,700 employees. Looking sequentially, total workforce levels were down about 1% from the second quarter of this year. For the fourth quarter, we expect our force levels to be similar to the third quarter and also down somewhat from the prior year as comps get a little bit more difficult. ","Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $392 million, down 19% when compared to 2015. Lower diesel fuel prices along with a 6% decline in gross ton miles drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the third quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 2% to a record 1.075, while our average fuel price declined 13% to $1.57 per gallon. ","Moving on to our other expense categories, purchase, services, and materials expense decreased 4% to $566 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume related expense and reduced locomotive and freight car repair and maintenance costs. Depreciation expense was $512 million, up 1% compared to 2015, driven primarily by higher depreciable asset base. ","For the full-year, we still expect depreciation expense to increase slightly compared to last year. Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $282 million, which is down 7% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes which reduced car hire expense and reduced locomotive lease costs were the primary drivers of this decline. ","Other expenses came in at $271 million, up $66 million versus last year. We did have a couple of one-time items impacting the other expense category in the third quarter, as well as a few favorable items that we incurred last year. As we discussed back in September, we have written-off the $13 million of accounts receivables associated with the Hanjin bankruptcy. ","In addition, we also were encouraged $17 million of write-offs associated with in-progress capital projects, which we are no longer pursuing. Higher state and local taxes and increased environmental costs, partially offset by lower personal injury expense also contributed to the negative variance in this category for the quarter. For the full year 2016, we now expect the other expense line item to increase close to 10%, including the one-time items that I just mentioned. ","Turning to our operating ratio, the third quarter operating ratio came in at 62.1%, 1.8 points unfavorable when compared to the record third quarter of 2015. Fuel price negatively impacted the operating ratio by 0.4 points in the quarter. ","Looking at cash flow, cash from operations for the first three quarters totaled about $5.5 billion, down about $160 million when compared to the same period last year. The decrease in cash was driven by lower net income and was partially offset by the timing of tax payments, primarily related to the bonus depreciation on our capital spending. ","For the full-year 2016, we now expect the net impact of bonus depreciation to be a tailwind of about $350 million. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled about $1.3 billion year-to-date through the end of September. ","Taking a look now at the balance sheet, our all-in adjusted debt balance increased to about $18.5 billion at quarter end. We finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of over 1.9 times up from 1.7 at year end. This brings us close to our target ratio of less than two times. For the first nine months of the year, we bought back over 25 million shares totaling about $2.2 billion. ","Since initiating sales repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased about 28% of our outstanding shares. Between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned nearly $3.6 billion to our shareholders through the first three quarters of this year. So that\u2019s a recap of the third quarter results. ","Looking out to the remainder of the year, volume declines on a year-over-year basis should moderate as the volume comparisons get easier in the fourth quarter. We would expect total fourth quarter volumes to be down in the low single digits and we still expect total full-year volumes to be down in the 6% to 8% range. ","While we do not expect to improve the operating ratio this year, we will continue to leverage our G55 and Zero initiatives to generate positive core pricing and strong productivity to achieve the lowest operating ratio possible. And as Cam just mentioned, we now expect 2016 capital spending to be down about a hundred million dollar to just under $3.6 billion, primarily as a result of the delay in the locomotive deliveries. ","While we have not yet finalized our capital plans for 2017, we still expect our capital spending to be around 15% of revenue. From a productivity perspective, our G55 and Zero initiatives have generated significant efficiency savings for the company thus far this year and we are confident that we will continue to drive further improvements well into the future as we work toward our operating ratio target of 60% plus or minus on a full-year basis by 2019, and longer term we are keeping our eye on the goal of a 55% operating ratio as we gain momentum with our G55 and Zero initiatives. ","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Lance.","Lance Fritz","Thank you, Rob. As the team has articulated here this morning we continue to experience a difficult, but improving market environment in the third quarter. While we were pleased to see improving volumes in some of our business lines such as grain and coal, many of our markets still remained at volume levels below a year ago. ","The macroeconomic environment still has its challenges and unstable global economy, the relatively strong U.S. dollar and continued soft demand for consumer goods. However, certain segments of the economy are showing signs of life. A recent rally in energy prices has crude oil over $50 a barrel and natural gas over $3 per million btu, which are both encouraging for our coal and shale-related businesses. ","We are also pleased to see strength in the overall grain market. With the record harvest currently underway we are well-positioned with our network and resources to serve an increase in demand from our Ag customers. ","Closing out 2016 and heading into next year, we\u2019re optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. In the coming months, we will continue to do what Union Pacific does best, operate a safe, efficient, and productive network while providing an excellent customer experience and delivering solid shareholder returns.","With that, let\u2019s open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter","Great, good morning. Just can you, Rob talk a little bit about the projects you are writing-off, I just want to understand what kind of cost we have going forward and it looks like as the business comes back, you're starting to ramp up your locomotives and employees, but you notice that there are fewer people in the training pipeline, should we see some start-up costs as you start to bring people back in? Thanks.","Rob Knight","Yeah, Ken what I commented in the quarter was around 17 million of projects that were started that we have chosen to not pursue and so we\u2019re taking adjustments there. So, I think if you look longer term that\u2019s a number that is not going to repeat, I mean we occasionally will have situations like that, but I think it\u2019s safe to assume that that\u2019s a number similar to the Hanjin receivable write-off that I mentioned that are not going to repeat in that line item. In terms of the cost, we are confident that we are well situated both on locomotives and employees to leverage the volume that we hope does materialize. So we've got fewer people in training line because we've got so many people if you will in furlough status at this point. So, we feel very good about our ability to and we'd love nothing more than to see volume pickup and be able to put resources back to work.","Ken Hoexter","Great thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your questions.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thanks very much and good morning. With the international shipping lines under continues financial pressures you noted and the prospect of a record grain crop match back is something that I\u2019ve been hearing more about, just curious is that something that you\u2019re facilitating and potentially see as a means to increase market share in intermodal grain or both?","Lance Fritz","Eric?","Eric Butler","As you mentioned Cherilyn there is a significant volatility going on in the international container ship business. There have been three major mergers, one bankruptcy, there are a number of other entities that are in dire or questionable financial shape. One of the things that all of the container ship companies are looking at doing is finding ways to have match backs or exports from the U.S. to Asia. One of the large historical exports has been grain and in particular the DDGs to China. We are continuing to that look at that as an opportunity to grow our business in terms of the westbound business to Asia. ","We\u2019re also really excited longer term or mid-term in terms of the opportunity to ship plastics to Asia from the expanding franchise we have in the Gulf and we think that that\u2019s going to be an excellent opportunity for match backs also. So, we think both of those things are great opportunities. Of course, China occasionally as they have right now have tariffs or other governmental policy things that hinder imports like DDGs, but we think long-term that should be opportunity for us.","Lance Fritz ","Cherilyn this is Lance. What Eric just outlined is indicative of the franchise strength that the Union Pacific brings to the industry. We've got breadth and coverage in a number of markets that allow us visibility into potential match backs.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Great and just by ways of very quick follow-up, when you say medium-to-long term on the plastics match backs is that sort of 2018 and beyond?","Eric Butler ","Yes, I mean as we've been saying for the last several quarters, we think most of the growth will happen in 2018 and beyond. There might be a tale of a small ramp-up towards the end of 2017, but basically 2018 and beyond.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thank you. That's all from me.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ravi Shanker","Hi, thanks good morning everyone. A couple of questions on pricing, you've committed to a positive core pricing, can you also commit to pricing over inflation? And second, can you just help us understand what the driver of the pricing, I would say the deterioration in the gains have been, is it mostly into real competition, is it truck competition, or is it you guys kind of just supporting some of your customers who may be going through a hard time and hoping to get it back little later on?","Lance Fritz","Eric?","Eric Butler","Hi Ravi. So, one of the things that we're real excited about is the great franchise we have and we have a very diverse franchise. And some components of our franchise obviously as we mentioned, the energy related and the International related are facing both economic weakness conditions and also some competitive conditions. So, we've been talking about the challenges in coal, coal as you know has been greatly challenged not only a demand because of weather and other usage demands, but natural gas has been a great strong competitor to coal. ","The below $2 natural gas prices has created a headwind for coal in the past. We\u2019re excited or we think that with natural gas being above $3 now and even some of the futures market showing it in the mid-3s that that certainly will improve the competitive condition for coal, but that has clearly had an impact likewise. The three mergers, the one large bankruptcy in the international intermodal, the volatility that we talked about in previous earnings releases has created economic conditions and competitive conditions in international intermodal. ","Even despite those challenges in those markets, we still have been able to put our market price at re-investable returns and we think that looking at the broadness of our portfolio we are pretty positive in the future about our ability to price for the excellent value we provide and we're going to price above re-investable returns and we have a broad portfolio of opportunities to drive that message.","Ravi Shanker","Thanks so much for that color. Can you also, do you have the confidence that you can stay above inflation in pricing?","Rob Knight","Ravi this is Rob, let me answer that. I mean clearly long-term that is still our goal. The one thing with these challenges and opportunities that Eric just outlined, you know one things that we haven't finalized yet, but as we look into 2017, at this stage it looks like global insights inflationary numbers are like 2.5% and our number may well be above that from an inflationary standpoint, largely driven by the health and welfare costs on our labor lines. So, still some work to play out there, but longer term absolutely we are as committed as ever to driving that price.","Ravi Shanker","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","Tom Wadewitz","Yeah, good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit more on the pricing side, you commented how the higher natural gas price is helpful for coal, so that\u2019s obviously a constructive thing, but I'm wondering if you are optimistic if that will - that should help the cold tonnage and obviously if you have a normal winter and so forth, but what about the pricing in coal, if we stay at this gas price will go a little higher, do you think that the, you know you will be able to go transition to better competitive environment where you could raise price for coal transport or is that something that some of that pricing pressure would likely present?","Rob Knight","Yeah, so Tom you are asking a couple of different things here, as you know there are always a variety of market conditions that impact price transportation capacity availability and availability on transportation networks for other commodities, as you know competition, weather there are a lot of things, natural gas prices that will effect coal. We are positive that the use of coal should be increasing in the mid-term, if you just look at, again the competition against natural gas, if you look at the economic pick up and the use of energy we are confident that the use of coal should be picking up in the near mid-term and we saw that in the second to third quarter in terms of the sequential use of coal. We will continue to price for re-investible returns based on the value of service that we provide and we are confident in that strategy, we are confident in the value that we are providing and we are going forward.","Lance Fritz","Hi Tom, this is Lance. Clearly an environment where natural gas price is increasing, put it north of $3.50 or so and where weather is favorable and where the stock piles have been worked down that is a better pricing and competitive environment that not. So it helps.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay I appreciate that and for the follow-up, I don't know if this is kind of Rob or Cameron, but you\u2019ve shown nice improvement in the train length good momentum there, so that\u2019s very favorable, I\u2019m wondering if you look at 2017 and if you do see a volume growth, is there a couple of things play out, let's say you see a couple of points in volume growth, how does that translate to incremental margins? Could you see something that well above the normal 50% incremental margin we\u2019re talking about, could you see something 60% 70% as you expand train length more and see some of the benefit of the cost take-out and so forth, is that a reasonable equation or would you be more cautious about the incremental in 2017 if the volumes come back? Thank you.","Cameron Scott ","Rob, why don\u2019t you take that.","Rob Knight","Yes Tom. This won't surprise you, but we won't give guidance on the actual incremental margins, but everything you said are certainly opportunities. I mean as you know our G55 and Zero initiatives which are some 15 different areas and our view is we\u2019re looking at every single cost bucket in the entire company and attacking it aggressively with an eye on safety and efficiency and customer values. So, I would just answer that question by saying the scenario you outlined where there is positive volume and a reasonably positive economic environment would give us an outstanding opportunity to continue to drive productivity and staying away from an actual incremental margin calculation we would expect it to be a positive contributor. And by the way for us to go from where we are today to our 60 plus or minus by 2019 and with an eye on getting to 55 or so we're going to have a very healthy incremental margins from here to there. So we're going to certain certainly go after it.","Cameron Scott ","Tom as we've opened up the door now to the productivity in your question, I just want to give recognition to the entire UP team who have done a tremendous job in a reduced volume environment of finding ways to grow, for instance manifest train size 5% year-over-year that\u2019s a phenomenal effort, and that\u2019s just one of many in terms of finding productivity on the network. I think the team has done a tremendous job in creating productivity in a pretty difficult environment.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, clearly you guys are doing a great job in that area. That's an impressive performance. Thank you for the time.","Rob Knight","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your questions.","Jason Seidl","Thank you operator. Good morning, gentlemen. I\u2019m going to stick on the price force here for now. As we look at that 1.5% you mentioned, tough volume environment, competitive environment, is this something that you would expect UNP to hover around for a while or what could break it out of that 1.5%? I\u2019m trying to figure out, is this near term are we going to see that throughout 2017 unless things recover from here?","Lance Fritz","You know Jason we don't give any guidance on price. Clearly, as we've outlined a little bit here this morning, there are certain markers that make the competitive environment better for pricing. Any time, for instance capacity and alternative modes tightens up that's good. Demand for the core underlying commodities as it increases that\u2019s good. So you just got to keep your eye on what's happening with for instance natural gas prices and stockpiles and weather in the cold world. What's happening on import demand and the financial help of our international intermodal ocean carriers that helps? What happens for industrial production in the United States that helps? What's happening to truck capacity, alternative modes that helps? So all of those are helpful environment for our pricing.","Jason Seidl","I appreciate that. I mean I just, even checking my records, I can't remember the last time you guys were below we would call your real cost inflation. Looking at 2017, how does - and I know you guys don't provide guidance specifically, but are you pretty confident that you are going to be able to grow your volumes and 2017 forget what percentage, but just grow the volumes?","Lance Fritz","Eric do you want to handle that?","Eric Butler","As you say we don't give volume guidance, but if you look at the markets that we have out there and you look at the pickup and different markets that we have. We feel pretty positive that as the economy continues to grow and is slowly strengthening. In many of our markets we feel very positive about the run rate opportunity. The one cautionary area that we have talked about before is in automotive sales, we continue to think those are cautionary, but if you look at even our Mexico franchise we had great growth in our Mexico franchise in the quarter. We still think that there are good opportunities to grow volume.","Cameron Scott","If I could just add to Eric's comments Jason, just kind of remind you and everyone else, you know our thesis from this point over the longer period is a positive volume environment and you look out the - as Eric just pointed out, you look at the unique diverse opportunities of our franchise while we are giving precise volume guidance for next year, but we do feel there is great opportunity for us to continue to leverage and over the longer period of time for us to have volume on the positive side of the ledger certainly.","Jason Seidl","Well, let me ask you quickly in another way, so if you saw negative volume next year that would mean that something would have to decelerate from here with the trends, is that an accurate statement?","Cameron Scott","Yes that's an accurate statement. Generally speaking, we got to be playing in multiple markets, but that\u2019s a fairly accurate statement.","Jason Seidl","Okay. Gentlemen I appreciate the time as always.","Lance Fritz","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Brandon Oglenski","Hi, good morning everyone and thanks for getting me on the call here. A couple, I think a few months into this year we have been talking about OR improvement even when volumes are down pretty significantly in the first quarter, and I know you guys backed off a bit in 2Q, but I guess as I listen to the call here, it sounds like pricing might be in-line with cost inflation maybe even a little bit below next year and let\u2019s say volumes don't come back tremendously, what can you guys do on the operating ratio that maybe we could instill some confidence again that you guys would break into [indiscernible] territory?","Lance Fritz","Let me start Brandon, this is Lance and I\u2019ll remind you that we have confidence, extreme confidence in our ability to continually find opportunities to be more efficient, reduce waste, and increase the value that we are adding. I\u2019ll ask Cameron just to give us a handful of examples of things we're working on when we are going into next year, but our bucket is full of opportunity to be better.","Cameron Scott","On train size, the only commodity group that is truly optimized or nearly optimized is coal. Every single commodity that we have out there from manifest to automotive to intermodal to grain or rock all has tremendous opportunities for us to continue with the results that you have seen, so we feel confident that that is going to happen in 2017. The record all-time re-crew rate from a process perspective we feel like we have well in hand and we should continue to see that into 2017 and 2018. And we work on other initiatives like rationalizing our little horsepower for you. We've done a great job of moving to single unit local operations versus two units. There\u2019s a number of initiatives that we have. We\u2019re truly, we're just getting started in framing up the opportunity and getting ready to realize it as we step into the New Year.","Lance Fritz","Exactly. And even little things like see [ph] rates that improved 2% year-over-year here, there is plenty of opportunities we look forward to become world-class if you will and in consumption rate for diesel, so there is just a host of issues there Brandon that we can continue to work on.","Brandon Oglenski","No, and I appreciate all that you guys probably have gone on that we can see from here, but I guess in retrospect Lance was it just that volume got a lot worse than we thought in the second quarter or was it competitive factors, was it market pricing, what was it that led to the lack of ability to drive OR improvement this year. ","Lance Fritz","Let me let Rob handle.","Rob Knight","Yes Brandon. I mean your comment is right that we have always said and we do believe that we can make improvements in the operating ratio in spite of the lack of volume growth. And in fact if you look at over the last decade, you know we have taken almost 25 points of our operating ratio without the benefit of positive volume over that time frame. I would say that you are exactly right though, here in the short term this year I would say that the major driver of not likely improving the operating ratio this year is the pace of which we've been chasing volume down. I mean it\u2019s, we never have perfect visibility as to where that volume is going to trough and that makes it difficult so we are always kind of chasing if you will and I think that\u2019s really the answer to what you've seen this year. So as we look forward I think it\u2019s still a fair assumption and it is certainly our drive that we expect to make improvements in our operating ratio in spite of what the economy deals us in terms of what happens with volume now. Having said that as we look out over the next several years we do have volume in our thesis on the positive side of the ledger, but we\u2019re going to not use that as an excuse not to make continued productivity improvements.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Scott Group","Hi guys good morning. So, wanted to follow up on pricing, Rob your point about inflation picking up to 2.5% next year is that to caution us that pricing could be below inflation or is that you telling us that we have line of sight to inflation getting higher, so we have line of sight to our pricing accelerating to next year, I\u2019m not sure what you are trying to tell us.","Rob Knight","Yes Scott, my point on the inflationary comment is, we do expect inflation to go back up if you will to more normal levels versus the below inflation, below normal levels that we enjoyed this year and again 2.5 global insight are numbers because of health and welfare costs might be higher than that, so my point on that is simply to say not unusual against historical numbers, but we do expect inflationary pressures to be back to sort of normal conditions if you will.","Scott Group","But because you have line of sight to inflation picking up do you have line of sight to your pricing re-accelerating too?","Rob Knight","I would say no. I mean it\u2019s not mechanical as you know the way we price and we play in so many different markets that they are not - it's not a cookie-cutter, it is not a one size fits all, and as Eric outlined. There are opportunities for us to achieve stronger prize than other areas in the short-term, but we will continue to drive service, drive value and price at minimum of re-investable levels as Eric outlined in spite of what that inflationary number turns out to be. So, I would say they are disconnected if you will in terms of the day-to-day pricing initiatives that we take.","Scott Group","So maybe just bigger picture, it feels like for the long term you guys have said hey, we're going to get pricing no matter what if you get volume okay, if we don't get volume we don't care and truthfully you haven't had much volume, but you\u2019ve gotten great pricing, is the philosophy changing where you care more about volume now as part of G55 and so there is, it\u2019s less clear you necessarily always get the pricing?","Lance Fritz","Scott our philosophy is not changing and as a matter of fact, our top line this quarter reflects that it\u2019s not changing. We are pursuing business in the marketplace that we can price for the value that we represent and that\u2019s re-investable. And if we can't find that we walk away from it. So nothing has changed about that philosophy.","Scott Group","Okay and if I can just ask one more just on grain pricing specifically, so as the grain volumes are finally picking up are there opportunities to start raising grain tariff, I was little surprised by the sequential drop in ag revenue per car this quarter, I don't know if that\u2019s mix or lack of pricing there, does anything specifically on grain pricing?","Rob Knight","Yes Scott, I think if you sum up pricing as you know is in public tariff, which is publicly available and I think you would see some of that sequential increase in pricing in the public available tariffs that mirror kind of the demand that\u2019s picking up in grain. I think you will also see in some of the secondary markets huge increases in kind of the value in the secondary markets for equipment for grain, so some of that is yet public visibility too and I think if you look at those public things you would see pricing going with the demand increases.","Scott Group","Okay, thank you guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.","Danny Schuster","Hi good morning this Danny Schuster on for Allison. Thanks for taking my question here. So just coming back to pricing a little bit, I think investors are looking at the downward trend and wondering whether we could eventually see flat pricing at some point, and I think after today we are a little bit potentially closer to that so what can you tell investors to alleviate the concern that flat pricing is not a possibility?","Lance Fritz","Just exactly what we\u2019ve said this morning, which is our pricing philosophy is that we\u2019re looking for markets and opportunities where we can price for the value that we represent and if we can't find that and have it re-investable we\u2019ll keep searching. As markets improve, as the competitive environment improves that should translate into an environment where we have more opportunities than not, but our philosophy, our way of conducting business is not going to change.","Danny Schuster","Okay great thank you. And just switching gears on the field side, the discount to spot diesel prices seems to have climbed a little bit this quarter back up to around 66%, another 300 basis points up, so should we expect this trend to continue upwards or in other words expect the discount that you received to spot diesel to diminish as field prices go up? Thank you.","Lance Fritz","Rob?","Rob Knight","Yes, I guess I would answer that by saying it\u2019s hard to say, I mean I can't give guidance as to what that gap may be, but certainly the way I look at is overall as diesel fuel prices increase we will work hard and have good mechanisms in place to continue to - there may be a timing difference, but our surcharge is in place. So from a net impact we work hard to minimize that, but I can't predict exactly what the delta to the spot will be.","Danny Schuster","Okay great, thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead with your questions.","Justin Long","Thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask about the OR, I know you said you are not expecting improvement this year, but do you think we will see year-over-year improvement in the OR in the fourth quarter given what you are expecting for volumes?","Lance Fritz","Rob, do you want to \u2026?","Rob Knight","Yes, Justin you know as you probably are on top of your - comps get a little bit easier if you will in the fourth quarter number one and number two we can continue to drive the productivity initiatives that we've been successful with this year and volumes get easier and if volumes stay kind of flattish as I outlined in my comments, say even flattish with where they are now, we would see the fourth quarter gap over previous year narrowing. So, having said all that, again without giving specific precise guidance on the OR for the quarter we certainly have an opportunity to do that.","Justin Long","Okay, that's really helpful and I don't want to beat the dead horse on core price, but we did see the moderation there and it sounded like in your prepared comments you said it was mainly due to energy and international intermodal, I was wondering if there was any way to frame up how much of a headwind you saw from those two areas of the business like maybe to say that was all 50 basis points of the sequential deceleration that we saw or something like that?","Rob Knight","Justin this is Rob, we don't break it out that way, but I would just tell you, I mean again as you've heard me say many times, we don't have just a simple cookie-cutter one price fits all, so all of our markets that we enjoy and again we have more markets because of the diversity of our franchise then many, it gives us opportunities and it\u2019s - the pricing opportunities for us are very diverse, but having said that we don't break out the way you are asking it.","Justin Long","Okay fair enough. I\u2019ll leave it at that. I appreciate the time.","Lance Fritz","Thank you, Justin.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","Chris Wetherbee","Thanks, good morning. I do just need to come back to price and I apologies I know it\u2019s been sort of - talked about this morning, but just one thought on renewals, you guys report core pricing be little bit different than some of your peers and I guess I just wanted to get a rough sense of the relationship between inflation and the renewal dynamic and I know it\u2019s not mechanical Rob and you kind of highlighted that, but just generally speaking, higher inflationary environment would you expect that renewals would accelerate as well and how much may be of a lag do you think that there is, I guess I'm just trying to get a rough sense. Regardless of the magnitude, just sort of directionally, I\u2019m guessing they work together, just want to get some color on that would be great?","Rob Knight","Yes Chris, I mean just a couple of comments I would make. Number one as I think you and others know we have about 25% of our business if you will that is affected by a list. So over a longer period of time that mechanism sort of may be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, but over a longer period of time it tends to reflect what\u2019s happening with rail inflation number one, but I guess I would more broadly say and remind folks the way we calculate price and as you all have heard me say for many years, I\u2019m very proud of the fact that we are very conservative in terms of how we calculate price, it is not a same store sales kind of number, it is a mathematical calculation of how many dollars we yielded in that particular quarter from our pricing actions and the denominator is our an entire book of business. So, it includes contracts that perhaps we didn\u2019t touch certainly in the quarter for pricing. So, having said that there tends to be a little bit of a lead lag if you will in terms of the yield dollars that come from our pricing actions, but again our focus is unchanged from what it\u2019s been at this point in time, you\u2019ve got a couple of markets out there that are particularly challenging, but our commitment to driving value, driving quality service and driving positive price and positive volumes - positive margins has not changed.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay that's helpful, I appreciate that. And then maybe switching gears want to follow-up on the coal side, Eric you had mentioned I think 27 days - inventory is your 27 days above average I believe is what you highlighted there, what you think the right number is in terms of sort of the go forward period, what are the natural gas curve is sort of weather has been over the factor over the summer, we don't know what it'll be like over the winter, but what do you think that right number is, how close are you guys to kind of getting towards normalized inventories do you think?","Eric Butler","If you think about Powder River Basin inventories, the five-year average as I said was the low 60, 63, 65, and right now we are still at 90. So that\u2019s how you get to the 27 days. I do think that 60-ish number is probably right. If we have normal weather patterns and normal cold winter, if you look at the natural gas futures curve, I think right now it\u2019s like projecting 340 in the early part of next year. That will drive the inventories down. That will drive usage of coal, coal market share in the quarter was 32%, compared to like 28% I think in the second quarter, so coal market share is grown I think, it will be in the good - placed a good position, you will see coal volumes grow, you will see the opportunity for coal pricing to grow you will see inventories go down and I think we will be in a better place.","Lance Fritz","One thing to note, you can get to that days inventory reduction adjustment a number of ways. If you think about what's happening in the coal world in a different perspective, on a stock level of qualitative million tons of SPRB coal we are about 3 million tons higher year-over-year and that represents as Eric says about 25 days of burn. So, it really doesn't take much in both how much you have in stock and how much you\u2019re burning to affect that day\u2019s ratio. You can get there in a number of ways.","Chris Wetherbee","That's really helpful and real quick, can you say what the coal outlook was for volume within the low-single digit decline in the fourth quarter?","Eric Butler","We didn't Chris, but it\u2019s in the, call it in the low teens, it\u2019s probably a reasonable assumption, down low teens.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay great. Thanks for the time, I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hi, good morning. Thanks for getting me on the call here. Lance just wanted to get your views on regulatory backdrop, obviously there\u2019s been a lot of things coming over the is STB and their review of the standalone cost that\u2019s an external consultant come out recently, we\u2019ve got some news as the GAO about ECP bricks [ph], but just looking into next year it seems like it will still be fairly busy on the dock, I just wanted to get your thoughts on, if there will be any potential impact changes in regulations in 2017 that you would be particularly focused on?","Lance Fritz","Brian thanks for that question. We are focused on the activity at the STB. That\u2019s largely driven by the reauthorization from Congress about a year ago in that reauthorization Congress has essentially encouraged the STB to work through their doc if they had a backlog of a fair number of action items. Our concern is that that\u2019s interpreted as a desire to regulate the industry further. We don't believe that is the desire of Congress, we think Congress' desire was to have the S&P work through the workload. So we've got our eyeballs and are working on different activities, things like the reciprocal switching roles or the reduction of exemptions of different commodity groups. ","We are touching all the right points and making sure our perspective is known and incorporated into the thought process. There is a lot of moving parts there, so it\u2019s taking a fair amount of work on my part on our legal team and our Washington team. I would say our largest concern would be the overwriting overall impact of each individual regulation. If the STB takes those in isolation, we could end up in an impact that is unintended and unconsidered and so we\u2019re also working hard to make sure that the STB takes into account the full perspective of everything they are working and the knock-on impacts of each as a group. Does that make sense?","Brian Ossenbeck","Yes it does. And helpful I think you feel the activity you think potentially activist, but it just seemed like a dock that just needed to move forward a bit. Just one real quick question for Eric on the Hanjin impact, you had mentioned the $13 million write-off, I was just curious if there is any operational issues you have been seeing as there's containers come on onshore and people don't necessarily want to move them, anything from the chassis shortage that we have been hearing a little bit about, if that's a concern, clearly it\u2019s a lot of other puts and takes in the international intermodal side right now? Thank you.","Eric Butler","Yes Brian, so you knew specific I think has weathered a lot of what I call the operational fallout from the Hanjin bankruptcy fairly well. At a high level on the day they went bankrupt there roughly had about 100 ships on the inflows around the world, 40 owned, about 60 leased and they had lots of issues in terms of what to do with all of the end traffic flows, it was roughly $14 billion worth of goods and in traffic flows lots of issues about what to do with that. ","We had a fairly nominal number of boxes in route on our railroad and we've been able to process all of those through - we probably have a couple of dozen left to process through from roughly probably a little over thousand on a day of bankruptcy. So, we navigated that fairly well, there are issues out there in navigating the rest of that and it is an issue for the industry and supply chain in terms of what to do with those boxes both loaded and empty in boxes on chassis what to do with those and that\u2019s something that the industry is going to be struggling with to resolve, but for the Union Pacific side we\u2019ve navigated that fairly well.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay, thanks for the detail Eric.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please go ahead with your questions.","John Larkin","Yes thank you very much for taking my question gentlemen. I had a question on coal, Q2 you have said a couple of times that the stockpiles are still well above kind of targeted levels yet sequentially there was a huge step up in coal volume too in theory replenish stockpiles rundown during the harder than normal summer, was that very specific to a few different utilities or what really drove that? It seems a little contradictory to make that comment that coal would be up sequentially even though stockpiles are still on average way above normal?","Lance Fritz","Eric can you handle that?","Eric Butler","Yeah, the stockpiles have come down, you know if you look at over the second to the third quarter the stockpiles have come down 13 days and it came down to cause the burn increase and so our volumes improved roughly 40% and the stockpiles came down because the burn increased even at a higher percent than that.","John Larkin","Okay. So it doesn't sound like the utilities are all that dedicated to driving those stockpiles down that aggressively if they are replenishing still fairly aggressively there in the third quarter, just one more question, the U.S. dollar has been sitting at elevated levels relative to foreign currencies now for a year or longer what\u2019s your outlook on that for the rest of this year and throughout 2017 and the impact it might have on exports, which are so critical and sort of the bulk side of your business?","Lance Fritz","Yes John, this is Lance. You are right, the dollar has been strong. We don't make prediction about what the dollar is going to be going forward, but you got to believe all reasonable expectations are it\u2019s going to remain strong. In order to change that you need real acceleration in the global market, which would enhance the strength of other currencies and there is just not a lot of catalyst that you see for that. To your point, a strong dollar does make exports difficult however. Even in today's world you see for instance grain exporting of Pacific North-west and the Gulf Coast and into Mexico despite a strong dollar, so market conditions can still prompt commodity movement in global trade. And the other thing to note is that the U.S. is unique in its ability for its manufacturing base to figure out how to be globally competitive over time. I think the shale energy revolution is indicative of that. Where a couple of years ago people would say $70 a barrel shale oil was competitive and in today's world they say no that\u2019s maybe more like $50 a barrel. So, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts there, clearly we would prefer an acceleration in the global economy which would prompt more global trade, which would mean more U.S. exports that all would be really helpful to us.","John Larkin","Got it. Thanks for the explanation.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions.","David Vernon","Hi good morning guys and thanks for taking the question. Rob I know you guys don't want to get too much into predicting price, but maybe could you let us or clarify for us kind of what percentage of the volume right now is under contract or would have a normal inflationary escalator versus those that are going to be subject to more of the competitor over market conditions that are out there?","Rob Knight","Yes David, I mean we don't necessarily break it out exactly where you are asking other than I would just remind that overall about 25% of our book of business is touched by the a list index, but to your question of how much do we have sort of under contract or if you will kind of sized from a pricing standpoint, it\u2019s a same answer I would have given you last quarter and that\u2019s about 70%. I mean every day of every week we are negotiating and with the customers and negotiating our deals, so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s done each quarter on day one, so it\u2019s an ongoing continuous process and roughly speaking any day of any week we have about 70% of the next 12 months business under contract or sized up.","David Vernon","And I guess as you think about kind of your outlooks in your sort of near term to 60 and then the longer term to G55+ does the recent trend in that same store sales price metric make you the CFO sort of rethink the timing of some of those targets or do you think that you see enough opportunity in the cost side here to keep the full momentum on the margin side?","Rob Knight","Yes we haven't changed our guidance in terms of a 60 plus or minus by 2019 and then our eyeballs on getting to a 55 and I would just say, don't read that we are like changing longer-term view in terms of our commitment to pricing, we\u2019re not. I mean we\u2019ve got a little bit of the bump off the road because of some of the market conditions that Eric outlined, but as we look longer-term the levers that got us to where we are today that are going to take us to that next rung on the ladder of 60 then eventually 55 or certainly we hope positive volume, but are going to be solid value to our customers, solid core pricing at re-investable levels plus and solid productivity gains.","David Vernon","Alright, well I appreciate the color on that it's been a long call. Thanks for your time and we look forward to hearing more about those G55+ initiatives over the coming years.","Lance Fritz","Thanks David.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Baird. Please go ahead with your questions.","Ben Hartford","Thanks. Rob quick question for you, you had provided the 15% revenue target that you had talked about in the past for next year, as it relates to Capex, can you envision as you march toward the 55% OR target longer term, can you envision the situation in which Capex does approach D&A on an absolute basis, is that realistic for a relevant period of time or a relevant time horizon?","Rob Knight","Ben, probably not, I wouldn't use that as a marker again because of the timing and these are long live assets generally speaking, but to your broader point, I\u2019m very proud of what the team has done to continue to make progress on tightening our capital discipline and I think it\u2019s a significant step of getting to that 15%-ish range if you will from where we have historically been. I mean there\u2019s a lot of great productivity and a lot of great work that goes into getting to that level. So, we will get to that rung next and then we\u2019ll see where we are at that point.","Ben Hartford","Okay, that's helpful thanks.","Operator","Our next question if from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your questions.","Walter Spracklin","Thanks very much. Good morning everyone. So, just on the OR long term your targets as you mentioned, when we started the year we heard the entire, all the railroads each indicate that they would be able to reduce OR despite a challenging environment, you noted the same, most of done so and your OR unfortunately has not followed that trend and I am just looking on a relative basis, when you see the improvement across the group, is it - can you point to something that is specific to your company that be it a business mix, be it some structural challenges that lead you to have that challenge that the others did not and I frame it in a relative question, I know you don\u2019t like looking at peers, but I know your investor do, so I want to be able to understand is there something company specific here or how do you I answer that question when I get that OR question?","Lance Fritz","Yeah Walter, this is Lance. So, again I won\u2019t compare ourselves to our peers. We are a unique railroad. When we began the year, we were hopeful we were going to make OR improvement. The topline went away from us as Rob said a little more aggressively than we had anticipated. If you think about our ability to improve OR over the long run we are still confident that we can do it that\u2019s shown in our - maintaining the guidance for a plus minus 60 in 2019. We did start the year with very low operating ratio, it\u2019s still an attractive operating ratio, we\u2019re not pleased that we didn't have the opportunity to improve it this year and again we are just laser focused on all the activity necessary to continue to improve our margins for our shareholders.","Walter Spracklin","So coming back to your long-term then, I mean from where you sit today, I mean that\u2019s a 900 basis point improvement, it\u2019s a significant improvement many - several of your peers are there already and many investors are banking on you to achieve that, given the trends that we are exhibiting the reversals on those trends, I'm just trying to understand what confidence that we can be put in a reasonable timeframe, a long-term is a fairly vague definition, a reasonable time frame for evolution toward a 55 OR.","Lance Fritz","Rob why don't you take that?","Rob Knight","Yes Walter, I guess I would remind you and everyone that we are confident in sticking with our 60 plus or minus target OR by full-year 2019 and as you have heard us talk with eyes on where do we go beyond that to the 55, so while we have put a date on the 55, but I would just say that getting to a 60 is a very enviable spot in my opinion, I mean we\u2019ve made great progress on that. So, I would not read that this one year of perhaps not making OR improvement is a new trend or a new objective or new signal here, it\u2019s not, I mean to get from where we are today to that 60 is going to take all the initiatives we just talked about and it is the same levers that got us 25 point improvement over the last decade. So, we're going to continue to make that progress and we haven't backed off our 60 OR guidance.","Walter Spracklin","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Brian Konigsberg","Yes, hi good morning, thanks for taking my question. A lot of ground has already been covered, maybe just on the bonus depreciation and moving some of the purchases on locomotives from 2016 to 2017, so should we just think of the those two are connected and the carry over into 2017 will show up?","Rob Knight","I think I would stick with the guidance I gave on bonus depreciation impact this year of about $350 million. I don't think that\u2019s not going to move much. We haven't finalized what the number is going to look like all in for 2017, but I think I would still just kind of use that assumption of 350-ish for this year.","Brian Konigsberg","But conceptually a lot of that bonus depreciation is associated with the purchases of locomotives and is that just the way to think about it generally?","Rob Knight","Yes, I mean it certainly impacts that, but I would say it\u2019s still in that 350 range for this year and again we\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll get some - got carryover benefit next year, but we of course have to start paying back previous year, so we haven't finalized we are giving guidance as to what the impact all in net will be next year, but you are right, I mean the locomotive moment will have some impact on what those numbers are?","Brian Konigsberg","Understood, thanks. And maybe just touch a little bit on balance sheet, so you are approaching the self imposed leverage limits you talked about, just thought process from here you look to maybe deliver or actively deliver or will you naturally do a three EBITDA growth, how do you see that playing out?","Rob Knight","Yeah, I mean actually we've made great progress on that measure over the last several years and at this point in time the biggest opportunity we still have in front of us, which we are laser focused on is driving EBITDA, driving cash flow, and that will give us additional capacity and that\u2019s how we are approaching it. So, we've either do have room as we grow our earnings and grow our cash flow.","Brian Konigsberg","I will leave it there, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks very much. With regard, just focusing on the automotive sector, you mentioned the contract changes being a headwind in the 2017, could you just kind of compare and contrast what you think the impact will be as it looks like over the row conversions are good and then obviously there\u2019s a lot of near shoring and lot of development in Mexico and with manufacturing so just if you could compare and contrast within that sector, how you think it, you enter next year, is it going to be a net up or down in that category thanks?","Rob Knight","You know Scott, we love our autos franchise, we think we have the premier autos franchise. We think all of the trends in terms of Mexico production is positive for us. In terms of our franchise we think we are in a great spot for over the road auto parts conversions, we have great success this year and we think they will continue in the future. There will always be contract changes and it\u2019s a competitive marketplace and we saw that\u2019s a share and that\u2019s something that will happen across time. The big driver as we\u2019ve been saying my view on the automotive side is the cautionary impact in terms of sales. ","Sales have been at record or near record levels and there are some indicators out there that should give cautionary lights, it\u2019s the amount of debt inherence in auto loans and leases. Actual sales incentives per car were at an all time record level in the quarter. The highest since 2008 was the previous record, so there is some cautionary signs out there, if auto sales stay strong we have a great franchise and we are in a great spot, I do think there are some cautionary signs out there?","Scott Schneeberger","Okay thanks, and just a quick follow on, on Panama Canal, any update there, what are you hearing from customers just [indiscernible]. Thanks so much guys.","Rob Knight","No, I think the Panama Canal story is what we\u2019ve been saying for the last several years and certainly I think the last couple of quarters we\u2019ve been mentioning that the amount of traffics hitting the West Coast versus the East Coast did - there was traffic that moved to the East Coast because of the strike and BCO\u2019s trying to diversify their risk and not be dependent upon the West Coast. We did see that phenomena. We have seen some of that business start to come back, but it hasn\u2019t all come back from before the strike. That has probably been a larger factor than any Canal opening factor. The fact that the BCOs are diversifying their flows and a lot of ways just to not have that risk.","Having said all of that we do believe, I do believe that the West Coast ports are the most economical, the best supply chain in terms of transit time to get goods from Asia to the interior of the country and even into the East Coast. And if you look at some of the technologies at some of the West Coast ports are employee to make themselves more efficient or timing this vehicles and things like that, I think West Coast ports are still going to be positioned to be the best supply chain factor going into the future though you will see people running to do risk mitigation strategies.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments.","Lance Fritz","Thank you Rob, and thank you all for your questions and interest in Union Pacific. We\u2019re looking forward to another conversation with you in January.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President, and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may begin.","Lance Fritz","Thank you. And good morning everybody and welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Beth Whited, Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, Union Pacific is reporting net income of nearly $1.2 billion for the second quarter of 2017. This equates to a second quarter record $1.45 per share, which is up 24% over last year.","Total volume increased 5% in the quarter compared to 2016. Carload volume increased in four of our six commodity groups, led by a 17% increase in Coal and a 15% increase in Industrial Products.","The quarterly operating ratio came in at 61.8%, which was a record for the second quarter and is a 3.4 percentage point improvement over the second quarter of 2016. In addition to the increase in volume, positive core pricing, and solid productivity were key drivers of the margin improvement.","Guided by our strategic value tracks, our entire team is focused on providing an excellent customer experience while safely and efficiently delivering on our innovative productivity initiatives.","I'm pleased with our results through the first six months and look forward to continuing our momentum through the remainder of the year. Our team is going to give you more of the details on the second quarter, starting with Beth.","Beth Whited","Thank you, Lance and good morning. In the second quarter, our volume was up 5%, driven primarily by Coal and Industrial Products with offsets in Automotive and Chemicals.","We generated positive net core pricing of 1.5% in the quarter with continued energy related and intermodal pricing pressure. Despite these challenges, we remain committed to achieving core pricing gains that offset inflation and align with our value proposition. The increase in volume and a 6% improvement in average revenue per car drove an 11% increase in freight revenue.","Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our six business groups. Ag Products revenue gained 7% on both the 3% volume and average revenue per car increase.","Grain carloads increased 11% with continued strength in wheat exports, driven primarily by shipments to the Gulf and Mexico. Domestic corn volumes were up 5% from increased Midwest processor business and strength in the Mid-South poultry market.","Grain products carloads were down 3%, primarily due to a reduction of soybean oil shipments resulting from soft biodiesel production. Partially offsetting lower volumes were higher ethanol shipments, driven by strong export demand to Brazil and China.","Food and Refrigerated volumes were up 3%, driven by continued strength in sugar shipments as well as support from a healthy summer demand associated with the brewers and beverage market.","Looking at the rest of the year, high global production of both seed grains and wheat, coupled with a lower quality domestic wheat harvest will create headwinds in our export markets.","As always, we're keeping a close eye on the weather to see what the domestic corn and soybean crop will yield. We expect Food and Refrigerated shipments to grow from our cold connect service, sustained strength in sugar, and import beer trending with consumer demand.","Automotive revenue was up 5% in the quarter on a 1% increase in volume and a 6% increase in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 4%, primarily as a result of softer vehicle sales leading to reduced production and shifting product mix.","These changes were partially offset by new West Coast import traffic and Mexico production growth. The seasonally adjusted average rate of sales was 16.6 million vehicles in the second quarter, down 3% from second quarter 2016.","On the parts side, over-the-road conversions and growth in light truck demand drove a 2% increase in volume. The U.S. light vehicle sales forecast for full year 2017 is 17.1 million units, down 2% from the 2016 record rate of 17.5 million.","We remain cautious with respect to auto sales due to current sales trend, higher inventory, and rising interest rates. The reduced SAR will impact both the finished vehicles and parts with a potential upset in over-the-road conversion opportunities.","Chemicals revenue was up 4% for the quarter on a 2% decrease on volume and 6% increase in average revenue per car. Petroleum and LPG shipments declined 20% as we continue to see headwinds on crude oil shipments which were down 84% to about 2,200 carloads in the quarter due to the lower crude oil prices and available pipeline capacity. Chemical volumes, excluding crude oil was up 2% in the quarter.","Plastics carloads were up 6% due to low commodity prices, which drove increased polyethylene and PVC shipments. Fertilizer was up 13%, driven by increased potash exports. For the second half of 2017, our Chemicals franchise is expected to remain stable. Strength is anticipated in plastics with new facilities and expansions coming online.","Coal revenue increased 25% for the quarter on a 17% increase in volume and 7% improvement in average revenue per car. On a tonnage basis, Powder River Basin and other regions were both up 17% from higher natural gas prices and stronger West Coast exports, which benefited from favorable global economics for Western U.S. coal. Overall, coal stockpiles were down in the quarter and are now below the five-year average.","Looking forward to the second half of the year, Coal volumes will face tougher year-over-year comps, but we expect absolute volumes to be sustained sequentially if natural gas prices and export demand are maintained. As always, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand.","Industrial Products revenue was up 24% on a 15% increase in volume and an 8% increase in average revenue per car during the quarter. Minerals volume increased 73% in the quarter, driven by a 128% increase in sand shipments due to improving well completion and increased proppant intensity per well. Specialized markets volume increased 20% in the quarter, driven by a 29% increase in waste shipments due to West Coast remediation projects.","Looking forward, we anticipate frac sands volumes to stay strong, although new in-basin brown sand mines might temper the upside. We see growth in military and wind shipments with an offset in roofing and cement volumes due to year-over-year comps associated with weather-related reconstruction and changing market dynamics.","Intermodal revenue was up 3% on a 2% increase in volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. Domestic volume grew 2% in the quarter, driven by parcel growth as well as improved truckload market demand in the last half of the quarter. International volume was up 2% in the quarter from stronger west bound shipments and inventory restocking.","Looking forward, we expect international Intermodal volumes will continue to be impacted by an ever-changing global supply chain. For the domestic market, implementation of electronic logbook will provide opportunities for additional over-the-road conversions.","To wrap-up, this slide recaps our outlook for the remainder of 2017 mentioned in the previous slide. Over-the-road conversions will continue to present opportunities for growth. We also anticipate continued progress in our plastics and Food and Refrigerated markets.","Our diverse franchise remains well-positioned for growth this year as the U.S. economy continues to build momentum in the face of a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy. Our team remains fully committed to developing new business opportunities and strengthening our overall customer value proposition.","With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance.","Cameron Scott","Thanks Beth and good morning. Starting with safety performance, our reportable personnel injury rate increased to 0.76 versus the first half record of 0.70 achieved in 2016. The team remains fully committed to finding and addressing risks in the workplace and I am confident in our efforts as we push towards our goal of zero incidents.","With regards to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate improved 4% to 3.01. While TE&Y training and infrastructure investments continue to be key pieces of our derailment prevention strategy, advanced data analytics will help us make even greater strides towards identifying and mitigating risks.","In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 5% versus 2016 to 2.27 as our grade crossing assessment process in collaboration with the public continues yielding positive results.","Moving on to network performance. Our network performance fell short during the second quarter, which is reflected in the metrics we report each week to the AAR. Second quarter velocity was down 5% and freight car well was up 4% when compared to 2016. Severe spring weather across our served territory along with several service interruptions and outages were the primary drivers of a decline in service metrics.","Looking at our resources, although our TE&Y workforce was up in about 500 employees in the second quarter while compared to the same period in 2016, we were able to effectively leverage the robust 5% increase in volume with numerous productivity initiatives we have underway. Partially offsetting some of this productivity, however, was an increase in workforce to help manage the network disruptions and outages I mentioned earlier.","In addition, our engineering and mechanical workforce was down more than 1,000 employees, driven primarily by fewer employees required on capital projects as a result of the productivity initiatives we have implemented.","All-in, our total operating workforce was down almost 600 employees in the quarter or 2% when compared to last year. As always, we continue to adjust our resources as volume and network performance dictate.","In addition to being agile with our resource base, the team's persistent focus on productivity continues yielding positive results in other areas such as train size. An example of our relentless focus on productivity is how we have achieved best-ever train size in our manifest trains category for eight straight quarters.","Our team uses data analytics to dynamically adjust our service schedules to maximize train length while balancing our customer commitments. We were also able to generate productivity gains within our terminals as cars switch per employee day increased 5% during the second quarter.","Overall, I'm pleased with the productivity we've been able to realize thus far and I'm looking forward to further improvement as we move forward.","To wrap-up, as we move into the back half of the year, we expect our safety strategy will continue to generate positive results on our way to incident-free environment and we will continue leveraging the strength of our franchise to improve operational performance with a focus on productivity and providing an excellent customer experience.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Rob Knight Jr.","Thanks and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue was about $5.3 billion in the quarter, up 10% versus last year. Higher volumes, an increase in fuel surcharges and positive core price all contributed to the increase in revenue for the quarter.","Operating expenses totaled $3.2 billion, up 4% from 2016. The increase in fuel cost represented a majority of the increase to the operating expense in the quarter. Operating income totaled $2 billion, a 21% increase from last year.","Below the line, other income totaled $43 million, down from about $77 million in 2016, which included a $50 million real estate gain that we reported last year. Interest expense of $179 million was up 3% compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months.","Income tax expense increased 20% to $701 million, driven primarily by higher pretax earnings. Net income totaled almost $1.2 billion, up 19% versus last year; while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce a record second quarter earnings per share of $1.45.","The operating ratio was 61.8%, a 3.4 percentage point improvement from the second quarter last year. The combined impact of fuel price and the surcharge lag benefit drove a 0.5 point improvement to the operating ratio and a $0.06 tailwind to earnings per share in the second quarter versus last year.","Turning now to the topline, freight revenue of $4.9 billion was up 11% versus last year, driven by a 5% increase in volume, along with positive core pricing. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $234 million, up $147 million when compared to 2016, and up about $22 million from the first quarter of this year.","The business mix impact on freight revenue in the second quarter was a positive 1%. The primary drivers of this positive mix were year-over-year growth in frac sand shipments and grain carloadings, partially offset by the increase in Intermodal volumes.","Core price improved to 1.5%. While we have experienced an uptick in pricing as expected, we do caution that we are continuing to see competitive pressures in our Coal and Intermodal businesses.","Excluding Coal and Intermodal, pricing in our other business lines was in the 2% to 3% range for the quarter. For the full year, we continue to be on track with our pricing initiatives to generate a revenue benefit that exceeds our rail inflation cost.","Turning now to the operating expense, slide 21 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense increased 3% versus 2016. The increase was primarily driven by a combination of higher wage and benefit inflation along with higher volume.","We still expect full year labor inflation to be about 5%; partially offsetting higher volumes were solid productivity gains and a smaller capital workforce, resulting in total workforce level declining 2% in the quarter versus last year or about 800 employees.","Fuel expense totaled $434 million, up 25% when compared to last year. Higher diesel fuel prices and a 10% increase in gross ton-miles drove the increase in fuel expense in the quarter.","Compared to the second quarter last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 3% while our average fuel price increased 17% to $1.69 per gallon. Purchase services and materials expense increased 5% to $597 million. The increase was primarily driven by volume-related costs, partially offset by lower joint facility expenses.","Turning now to slide 22, depreciation expense was $525 million, up 4% compared to 2016. For the full year 2017, we estimate that depreciation expense will increase around 4% to 5%. The increase is primarily driven by higher depreciation asset base, including our positive train control assets put in place to-date.","We estimate that depreciation on PTC assets will be approximately $130 million in 2017, increasing to around $150 million in the out years, post implementation. And with respect to PTC, in addition to depreciation expense, as we've previously mentioned, we expect the remaining expense line items to increase about $150 million to $200 million annually once PTC is fully implemented.","Moving to equipment and other rents, this expense totaled $273 million in the quarter, which is down 5% when compared to 2016. Lower locomotive and freight car lease expense and mix of traffic were the primary drivers for the reduction.","Other expenses came in at $219 million, down 10% versus last year. Lower environmental, personal injury and other costs were partially offset by higher state and local taxes. For 2017, we would expect other expense to increase slightly excluding any unusual items.","Looking at our cash flow, cash them operations for the first half of the year totaled about $3.5 billion, down 2% when compared to last year. The decrease in cash was primarily related to a lower bonus depreciation benefit, which more than offset the increase in net income.","Taking a look at adjusted debt levels, the all-in adjusted debt balance totaled about $18.4 billion at quarter end. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of around 1.9 times, which is close to our target ratio of just under two times.","Dividend payments for the first half totaled $980 million, up from $925 million last year. In addition to dividends, we also bought back around 15.3 million shares, totaling over $1.6 million in the first half, an increase of around 26% over last year in terms of dollars spent.","And since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased over 30% of our outstanding shares. In between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned about $2.6 billion to our shareholders through the first half, which represented about 118% of our first half net income.","On the productivity side, our G55 + 0 initiatives yielded around $110 million of productivity in the quarter. This is an improvement over the $90 million that we achieved in the first quarter and brings our first half total to around $200 million. This benefit was realized across three major categories. The first is network and train operations. This includes things like increase in train length and reducing recrews and other TE&Y expenses.","The second category is equipment. This includes efforts such as using fewer locomotives and freight cars resulting reduced equipment maintenance cost. And the third category consist of support, supply, and safety where there are multiple opportunities ranging from improving fuel efficiency to reducing purchasing and other administrative expenses. With these results, we continue to progress, as expected and we are on track to meet our $350 million to $450 million productivity goal for the full year.","Looking forward, we still expect full year carloading growth to be up in the low single-digit range. Third quarter carloads should strengthen somewhat from the second quarter, although they will likely be closer to flat year-over-year given the more difficult 2016 comparisons and this is particularly true for Coal.","I also want to mention a couple of one-time items that will impact the third quarter. First, we will see a one-time increase in tax expense totaling about $0.04 of earnings per share to reflect a recent increase in the Illinois state income tax rate.","And on the plus side, we will receive a settlement totaling approximately $0.05 earnings per share as a resolution of an ongoing litigation matter. This amount will be recognized as other income below the line.","With positive full year volume, positive core price and significant productivity benefits, we are on track to improve our full year operating ratio. In longer term, we are intently focused on achieving our targeted 60% plus or minus operating ratio on a full year basis by 2019. And we remain committed to reaching our goal of a 55 operating ratio beyond 2019 as we continue the momentum of our volume, pricing, and productivity initiatives.","So, with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.","Lance Fritz","Thank you, Rob. Looking at the second half of the year, we expect uncertainty in some economic sectors and continued strength in others. Overall, as Rob mentioned, absolute basis volume should be stronger in the second half than in the first half, although year-over-year comparisons are going to be more challenging.","In this environment, we will focus on our growth opportunities. In addition, we'll continue to make progress on our G55 + 0 initiatives as we work to make Union Pacific a stronger, more efficient company. We are confident these efforts will generate topline growth, margin improvement, and greater returns for our shareholders.","With that, let's open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group","Hey, thanks. Good morning guys.","Lance Fritz","Good morning.","Scott Group","So, wanted to just clarify some of the comments on Coal being flat sequentially. Are you saying that the third quarter average is going to be the same as second quarter? Because we've never seen that, so I just -- I'm not sure I follow what you're trying to say.","Beth Whited","No, we weren't saying that. Sorry if that was misinterpreted. Now, we would expect third quarter to follow a traditional pattern and be up sequentially, but relatively flat for last year.","Scott Group","Okay, flat on a year-over-year, okay that makes a lot more sense. Okay. And then Rob, just for you on the pricing side, I know it's not an area where you typically like to forecast specific numbers. But maybe just some insights -- we saw a tick up a little bit this quarter. Do you think that -- is it reasonable to expect that trend of kind of rebound continues into the back half of the year just given the better volume environment or tough to have visibility to that at this point?","Rob Knight Jr.","Scott, we're going to continue to price-to-market and drive as positive price as we possibly can. And as you know, we're going to stay away from giving a specific pricing number other than to reiterate that we expect to yield above inflation dollars. But we also pointed out -- Beth and I both did, that we continue to face pressures in the Coal and Intermodal groups. So, we'll see how all that plays out.","Scott Group","And just given the better volume environment, does the market -- I understand the competitive comments, does the broader markets feel like it's a better from a pricing standpoint just given you've had a few quarters now volume growth or you're not ready to say that.","Beth Whited","I would say that there are a lot of competitive factors going on out there on the plus side. We are seeing truck prices just beginning to firm and that gives us some hope that that will continue throughout the rest of the year, especially with ELDs coming online. But the other competitive factors that we see in Coal and Intermodal aren't easy. So, you just kind of have to make your own production about what you think might happen.","Scott Group","May I ask just a quick follow-up, how about in just grain with grain prices going up, how does that impact you grain tariffs going forward?","Beth Whited","Well, let me see how to answer that. I would say that we certainly want to price and get value in the market at every opportunity. Grain prices going up will, hopefully, bring more volume to us and provide us with a revenue opportunity and we'll just have to see how the pricing opportunities play out from that.","Scott Group","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Good morning. Just following-up on the pricing side, on the increased Coal pricing you're talking about. Are there major contracts up for bid that you're seeing this get more intense? Is this more a commentary on a shift of export coal? Just want to see as given that you easy comps that you had now started a little tougher, I want to see where that's heading towards.","Beth Whited","Are you asking a volume or a price question?","Ken Hoexter","Its price but I want to understand what's leading into that price competition. Is it that you're seeing more new -- or more of bids going on right now, major bids that what you're seeing competitor step up. Is it because of the export side? I just want to understand where you're seeing the pricing competition?","Beth Whited","I think that we continue to see competition kind of across the book of business. But we aren't at any sort of unusual level of contract negotiation during this period. It's just kind of -- when you think about our whole base and the contracts that we negotiate overtime as we are renegotiating contracts that market -- it's still very competitive.","Ken Hoexter","Yes. And nothing on the export? Is that--?","Beth Whited","No, the export business, as you know for us, is relatively smaller.","Ken Hoexter","Still smaller.","Beth Whited","We have had some nice opportunities, but that's not as -- I mean, it's certainly still competitive, but that's not where we're seeing the most pressure.","Ken Hoexter","Great. And then for a follow-up. Great detail Rob on the productivity initiatives that you provided here. Is this -- when you look at the equipment side and the like, is that -- do you see the locomotives -- are you increasing them out that you're parking is part of the productivity and the cars can you talk a little bit about kind of where that stands. You've given those numbers in the past.","Lance Fritz","Yes, let's let Cameron address that.","Cameron Scott","Several years ago, we started initiative in our low horsepower fleet and that initiative net to about 500 locomotives we'd put in storage. Some of those have been sold. Some of those releases that we returned. We've turned that same group of employees towards our high horsepower fleet. And I don't think we'll achieve quite 500, but there's plenty of opportunity for us to rationalize what we're doing with our high horsepower fleet.","Lance Fritz","I want to say Cameron is referencing there from this point forward. He's already got what is in the neighborhood of 1,000 high horsepower locomotive in storage as we speak.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Thank you very much for the thoughts.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So, just a follow-up on the positive train control comments. Rob, that's very helpful to give us more details. I was wondering if you could just clarify one thing, are those costs included in your long-term OR guidance, I assume they are, but I just want to confirm. And then we hear a lot about the cost, what are some of the benefits maybe, Cam, you think could come out of the system when it's fully operational?","Rob Knight Jr.","Yes, let me quickly address the cost question, Brian. Yes, all of those costs are embedded in our targeted 60 OR by 2019 and 55 beyond. So, those are challenges that we have to overcome, but they're embedded in the thought process. And in terms of the benefits?","Lance Fritz","Cam?","Cameron Scott","We're implementing about 40% of our network at this point. And the technology is working very well. There will always be glitches and bugs that we need to upgrade. But so far, it's a very solid technology.","As we get fully implemented, we'll be looking for every productivity and efficiency that we can squeeze out of that system. I don't have anything right now to report to you on that.","Lance Fritz","Giving you a little bit more techni-color [ph] -- this is Lance. The PTC foundation gives you an umbrella of communication capability because of what's required for PTC in and of itself. And it puts a lot of technology and computing power on to our locomotives that at some point could be used for other purposes in the future.","It's important to note that it's not -- when we think about productivity from positive train control foundation, we're not talking about taking what already exist and somehow redeploying it in a way that's highly productive.","Whatever we do is likely going to require an incremental either capital or operating expense investment. And we'll make those decision based on the returns that would be generated from whatever those projects are.","So, it forms a foundation in your mind to think about that foundation as a robust umbrella of communication capability and computing power. And from that point forward, maybe that's a foundation we can use for the productivity.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay, great. Thanks. That's very helpful. I'm just -- the timing I now we've got one year extensions possibly across the Board for the industry if you could just remind us when you -- what's the current prospect for going fully online, is that a 2020 event?","Lance Fritz","We're going to be fully implemented -- or installed and able to implement, that is turn on, on every mile that's required late in 2018. And in the way the law is written, if we're in that position, then we can basically request the Department of Transportation an extension to 2020, which we will do because we'll want to use that time to debug the system.","While Cameron has mentioned that the system is operating and is functional and doing what it's intended to do, it still has bugs that rob us of precious capacity. And so we'll want to take those two years to continue to debug the system.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. And just one quick follow-up on the hiring front. [Indiscernible] almost the same percent as volume realize there is some perhaps one-time items in there. But just in general, Lance, can you tell us what you're seeing trends in hiring? There's some pretty great chunks of growth coming in the areas that might be a little bit more regionalized like perhaps like Coal, and flat to down in slightly other areas.","So, how hard will you be finding it to get ahead of those recoveries and meet demand in kind of just-in-time with the training programs you have? And should we expect small furlough for the freight recession to really kind of rob you from some productivity as you probably might not get all the same people you have back, but maybe a little bit lower level of experience when you do start to hire again.","Lance Fritz","Brian, let's unpack that in three pieces. The first piece is, your right. With TE&Y headcount up 4% in the second quarter versus volume up 5%, that's not quite the kind of productivity we would expect. I think that's accountable to the weather and service related interruptions and a little bit more sluggish network as Cameron pointed out. And he and his team is working diligently to get that back.","The second point that you were asking about was overall hiring and what's going on in that world. Recall, we came into the year with a fair number of TE&Y employees on furlough. So, the first thing we do is we call them back from furlough or from their alternative work and training board service. We've been doing that and we've also in certain pockets, had to go out and start up a hiring class. That's a relatively small amount in comparison to the amount of employees that we're bringing back on furlough.","And in terms of are we able to find employees when we do need to hire, the answer is yes. And the TE&Y craft, we have very attractive jobs and in the areas where we want to hire with maybe one or two very specific exceptions, we can find employees that we need.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay, great. Thanks a lot for all the detail. Appreciate it.","Lance Fritz","Yes.","Operator","Next question is from the line of David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","David Vernon","Hey, good morning. Cameron question for you on the productivity side. You mentioned there were some network disruptions that added to the incremental headcount. And I'm just wondering if you kind the mentioned that for us? And then also speak to the ability to kind of keep pushing forward with some of these train length initiatives and your productivity initiatives as volume growth moderates in the back half of the year?","Cameron Scott","I'll start with train size. Our team, as we mentioned, during eight straight quarters, has demonstrated a capability to find additional opportunities on train size while meeting customer commitments.","And there is, as I mentioned before, still plenty of headroom in almost every train category in our business, with the exception of Coal. So, there is still a lot of opportunity ahead of us on productivity with train size.","In relation to some of the outages, probably the best example I can give you was an unfortunate barge strike to one of our key network lanes in Louisiana. We've been out for seven weeks now rebuilding that bridge. That has caused us to wheel our transportation plan around that outage, adding costs, adding locomotives, adding employees that were not intended as we started the year.","We should get that key route back in service here in the next week and that will normalize not only our cost structure, but our customers will see a more solid service that they expect from us.","David Vernon","And in terms of sort of dimensioning that in terms of numbers around the extra heads or impact on earnings, is there any way for us to think about what it could have been here in the second quarter versus what it was because some of these one-time things? Or is it too small to try to adjust out?","Rob Knight Jr.","David, let me -- this is Rob, let me try to answer. I mean we're not going to break that out. I mean it's kind of in the mix and we admit it, as Lance indicated that ratio of the 4% versus the 5% volume, is not what we strive for. But exactly, what could have been is hard to put a fine point on.","David Vernon","Okay. And maybe this is a follow-up, Beth, with regards to ELDs, what are you hearing from your Intermodal partners on what kind of impact are expecting from this not only just in the U.S. implementation, but I also understand there's some speculation that the Mexican government may follow with an ELD set of guidelines in the 2018 as well.","Beth Whited","I don't have a comment on the Mexico piece. I haven't talked to anybody about that at this point. So, that will be a good follow-up for me. But I think everything you read says that they expect full ELD implementation to be kind of 3% to 5% sort of capacity impact.","I think some people are skeptical about how well it will be enforced. And so you've got a range in there in terms of how much impact it will have. But certainly we're very optimistic that it's going to help drive some tightening in the truck market and consequential price increases with rate increases in trucks, which will give us an opportunity to convert more volume and hopefully, get some price of our own.","David Vernon","And we should start to see that in the back half of this year and in the next year or is there going to be a bigger lag?","Beth Whited","It feels like it's a pretty late in the fourth quarter event and more of a next year item.","David Vernon","Great. Thanks a lot for your time guys.","Lance Fritz","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison Landry","Good morning. Thanks. So, frac sand has obviously seen strength in the last couple of quarters. So, I was hoping you could give us an indication of the mix of white and brown. And I guess more importantly, given some of the expectations for the Permian to be self-sufficient with local brown sand, how do we think about that with respect to your volumes and mix going forward?","Beth Whited","So, currently, we would say and you can read different people say different things that the Permian is roughly 15% brown and 85% white sand. And the demand this year, call it 28 million or 29 million tons. We see estimates going into next year where there are proposed mines that would bring on anywhere from 20 million to 40 million or 50 million tons and perhaps demand in the Permian being in that 40 million to 50 million tons.","I'm not sure how quickly that will happen. We certainly feel good about Permian white sand this year. We're working on solution to try to be a well provider in the brown sand market as well and we do a fair amount of that today from other Texas location.","I -- certainly it will swing away from white sand as a percentage over -- I think kind of quarter-by-quarter as we move into next year. We don't really have a prediction for what that looks like for us in 2018. But like I said, our focus will be on working to support the white sand guys that are continuing to shift and developing alternatives for the brown sand.","Allison Landry","Okay, got it. Thanks. And then if I could ask about the volume guidance, you obviously gave the expectations for flat year-over-year in Q3 and sort of implied a pretty wide range for the fourth quarter. So, I'm wondering if you can help us think through that and maybe handicap whether or not you think volumes could be up in the fourth quarter?","Rob Knight Jr.","Allison, this is Rob and we haven't given specific volume guidance in the fourth quarter. But so you're right, it could be a range. I mean we're hopeful that the economy would continue to move in the right direction and our third quarter, as I pointed out in my comments, while we envision that being kind of flattish year-over-year, we do see it sequentially growing from where we are today, where we finish in the second quarter. So, stay tuned in terms of how the world plays out in the fourth quarter.","Allison Landry","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Colin & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Seidl","Thank you, operator. Hey, good morning everyone. Two quick questions. Rob, I wanted to talk a little bit about your comments that we are aware the proper level for adjusted debt to EBITDA that you look at. How should we think about your cadence of share repurchases going forward? Is that going to slow a little bit or are you expecting to keep about the same pace?","Rob Knight Jr.","Well, Jason, as you know, we don't have a set number. We don't give specific guidance. We'll continue to be opportunistic in terms of the pace at which we buy, so I couldn't begin to give you exactly what that cadence will look like. Markets will dry.","But I would just tell you that in terms of the focus that we have in the organization is driving more cash. I mean so as we look at the metric, while we're close to that targeted number, as I pointed out, we still have room to go in terms of generating positive cash in the business and that gives us the greatest opportunity to continue to move forward.","Jason Seidl","Okay. And I wanted to jump back on your Ag outlook a little bit. Talk about how exports in the quarter impact the arc. So, obviously, you don't talk about pricing, but let's just talk about the overall arc from the mix and what should we expect sequentially going forward about exports and how that would look against your arc in the third and fourth quarter?","Beth Whited","So, in the quarter, we did have strong grain exports shipments, especially with wheat. And obviously that's a longer length of haul almost all the time. We do see -- we did see some pretty low barge prices, so we did move a fair amount in the river. So, it impacts our arc positively, but maybe not as much historically has just because of the river move.","As you move into the third and fourth quarter, you're going to see quite a bit less export grain, particularly in the third quarter because we had a really strong third quarter last year. And we're now going to be challenged by pretty strong global availability of grain in markets where they have a significant currency advantage. So, it'll -- I would say a negative arc impact versus last year in the third quarter. I don't have a [Indiscernible] for you.","Jason Seidl","Okay. So, Beth all things being equal, as you look to 3Q and 4Q and comp that versus 2Q likely going to be down compared to 2Q based on the mix?","Beth Whited","The arc, I don't know.","Jason Seidl","The arc.","Beth Whited","I'm sorry. I don't have a prediction of that for you. The volume -- yes, on the export side.","Jason Seidl","Okay. Thank you. Appreciate the time as always guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee","Hey thanks. Good morning.","Lance Fritz","Good morning.","Chris Wetherbee","I wanted to talk about productivity a little bit and understand maybe the cadence for the back half of the year. So, you have $150 million to $200 million left to go. And in the first half, you sort of had a stronger performance and a better volume environment.","I guess my question is, as you see sort of volume comps get a bit tougher there, what is that variability in cadence for the back half of the year do you think if 4Q doesn't turn out to be positive from a volume standpoint or you're more likely to be in the lower end of the guidance. I'm just trying to get some sensitivity around that for the second half.","Lance Fritz","Hi, Chris, this is Lance. I'll let Rob speak specifically to the guidance, which is $350 million to $400 million for the year. But in terms of the mechanics of the productivity, it's Cam and the team and the rest of the organization are constantly working the projects that we have in front of us right now.","So, that Rob pointed out three big segments. In the transportation side, it's about train lengths and be more productive in switching and locals. It can be more productive in our engineering and mechanical workforces where we've got projects underway and candidly we've been very straightforward and saying I think we've got more opportunity to be more productive in our general administrative and support functions. So, you'll see us take action on all of those in the second half of the year.","Rob Knight Jr.","Yes. If I can, I would just add, Chris, that as you've heard us comment many times before we're not going to stop at the $350 million range. And we try not to use volume as an excuse.","Certainly, volume is our friend and it gives us more optionality in terms of the productivity initiatives. But as we have done for many, many years and that is that we have a mindset that we're still going to aggressively go after the productivity initiatives that Lance outlined that are in front of us that we're aggressively pursuing and in spite of what the year-over-year volume is.","And again, we still predict, by the way. Our guidance is that volume for the full year is going to be up in the low single-digits. So, the fact that it's, say, flattish in the third quarter year-over-year, I don't think that's going to impact or slowdown any of our productivity initiatives.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. All right. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then Beth maybe a question on the Coal side. So, you've given some helpful color around the third quarter. I guess I just wanted to make sure I understood how you think about sort of finishing out the year relative to what we've been hearing a little bit from the producer side within PRB coal. And if there is the ability to sort of make commitments to the extent that there's demand there in the fourth quarter depending on what weather does and stockpile do. I guess our sense is that production levels on the mine level might end up falling short of flattish in the fourth quarter. I just wanted to get your thoughts around that if you have any.","Beth Whited","Well, at this point, we haven't considered that we would have significant production shortages in the fourth quarter. And we were definitely still thinking looks flattish. I suppose it all depends on what plays out with third quarter demand and hot weather and the producers are in the place where it makes economical sense to them I would guess that they will keep producing in for that.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.","Lance Fritz","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Wadewitz","Good morning. Wanted to ask you a little more on the Coal and Intermodal competitive pressures that you highlighted. I think -- I want to say it's maybe the third quarter last year that you first started talking about these pressures. And we have seen better Coal volumes certainly over the last couple of quarters in Coal. What you think it's a dynamic you might see for those competitive pressures ease? Is that really a function where the natural gas price is? Is it just a market price is lower for coal transport than what your book is priced at? So, it's really a multi-year headwind and repricing to market? Or how would be think about kind of the drivers that competitive pressure and how long the duration might be?","Beth Whited","It's pretty hard to make any sort of prediction about things that are happening in the competitive market when the person you're talking about isn\u2019t yourself. So, I don't probably have any guidance to give you there. Our focus is just going to be on making sure that we're getting a reinvestable price that makes sense to us as we renew deals and go out to bid for new books of business.","Lance Fritz","Tom, this is Lance. Of course, anytime the environment improves from a standpoint of more economic opportunity for all the competition in the marketplace, more volume opportunities, anytime that's the case, that's a better environment to compete in. So, we're looking forward to that being the case at some point in the future.","Thomas Wadewitz","What about the Intermodal side? I know you had referred in the past about the turmoil with the steamships and the consolidation and obviously with content and so forth. Do you think I guess there's more activity going on, do you have any visibility of that stabilizing and maybe pricing in the international Intermodal stabilizing or is that something that's probably continues for a while?","Beth Whited","I think that the steamship lines are still shaking things out. And while I think their economics are better, I don't think they're in a situation where they're making a lot of money and maybe not even making money.","So, in that environment, I think that the pressure remains for them to try to be very economically competitive in what they do. So, we'll see. I think that may take a little bit longer to shake out.","Lance Fritz","Recall, Tom that those are -- that's a moving part from the standpoint of sometimes those consolidations and partnerships benefit us and sometimes they don't. Regardless, we take that competitive landscape and compete for the business that makes sense to us from an economic return and compete aggressively for it.","Thomas Wadewitz","Great, great. Okay. And then just a quick follow-on. On the Chemicals side, what's the timing when you really see the impact from the new plants? Are you already seeing that? Or is there kind of a timeframe when that would be a bigger volume impact from the new production coming on in the Gulf?","Beth Whited","Yes, so it's going to be kind of a slow start I think. You start to see I think one or two plants really making meaningful production in 2017 and that's really pretty late in the year and with 2018 being a more significant impact.","Thomas Wadewitz","Okay, great. Thank you for the time.","Lance Fritz","All right.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Mehrotra","Hey, thanks everybody. Thanks for getting me in here. I wanted to ask you on the outlook for the back half. You do typically see a nice step down in OR sequentially. But obviously, there's some difficult comparisons as you mentioned possible mix challenges as well. Can you just talk about the puts and takes there and maybe your confidence or the company's ability to actually lower OR sequentially against that backdrop?","Rob Knight Jr.","Yes, this is Rob. I mean we don't really get specific quarterly OR guidance. You're right. Traditionally, that's the way it plays out. There's a lot of moving parts. We'll see what mix does. It's been favorable thus far this year. We're going to continue to drive pricing as Beth has talked about. We're going to continue to be aggressive on our productivity initiatives as we've all talked about and those are the levers.","And volume, we think is going to be our friend certainly in the third quarter improving from the second quarter. And we'll just have to see how the numbers play out. But again, we're confident and pleased with the progress we've made thus far this year and confident in our ability to improve the operating ratio year-over-year.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. Maybe just if I could have a follow-up and just be a little bit more specific as it relates to maybe the Automotive business and also the Chemical business as it relates to the auto production.","I mean, North American light vehicle productions expect to be down about 6% in the third quarter. I think some of that, obviously, has to do with the big three changeovers that maybe you're not as exposed to versus the eastern rails.","And then if I'm not mistaken, there are significant amount of chemical carloads that are also tied to auto production. So, if you could just help us think about both the Auto and Chemical franchise in light of maybe the sharp drop off in production and maybe the impact it makes there? Thanks.","Beth Whited","So, we have seen strength in plastics this year on the PVC and PE side, which -- and PP is really the stuff that goes into auto. So, I would agree with you that there's been a little bit of an impact there. It hasn't been very significant fall off in PC, but the strength is really coming on the PVC and the PE side.","And I don't think that would be something that we would probably be in a situation where we're calling out later in the year on the straight Auto side. It does feel like there's weakness there and that, that will continue throughout the rest of the year and we'll just have to see if the consumer goes back and start buying cars or not.","Lance Fritz","Bear in mind we have an opportunity still and it's a significant opportunity to penetrate further inbound truck for auto parts to auto manufacturing. There's still plenty of opportunity to convert that into Intermodal or box car product. And as the second quarter demonstrated, I think our finished vehicles were down 4%, but auto parts were up 2%. We expect to keep going after that in the second half of the year.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. Thanks. Appreciate the questions. Congrats on a good quarter.","Lance Fritz","Thank you.","Cameron Scott","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey, good morning everyone. And thanks for getting us on the call here. Lance, I wonder if you could just give your investors a little bit of confidence here because we've been hearing a lot about precision railroading and how that can drive significant improvement at one of your peers. But you guys have had some pretty significant OR targets out there for some time now. So, can you tell us -- just what are the drivers to achieve the 60 OR and then even beyond the 55. And how confident are you today versus maybe a couple of years ago?","Lance Fritz","Let's start with my confidence level, which is, it's never been higher. That's -- it's really wonderful to be speaking to your question coming off the quarter that we just had where we've demonstrated on what I would consider relatively modest volumes and ability to generate significant operating ratio improvement and productivity.","So, let's talk about how we're generating that productivity. Getting just a little bit deeper on those three areas that Rob and Cam talked about. When you're thinking about the train network, what we've been doing to this point is we're taking our -- the way our plan is organized and deconstructing it by lane, looking for opportunities to grow train size while maintaining the fundamental aspects of the plan with an eye towards making sure that our customer service product is as good as it possibly can be the best in the marketplace.","As we look forward, there's an opportunity to co-mingle some of those service products and we're investigating that as we speak, thinking through what does that mean from a service product perspective and from a productivity perspective.","We think there's pretty good juice there. And so while we've done a great job of growing train size to this point, we think there's some incremental opportunities we look forward in our train network.","When we think about how we conduct ourselves with our mechanical, our carman employees, our craft professionals in the engineering world and some of the contracting work that we do in both, there's plenty of opportunities and we've got projects in all of those areas looking for ways to take out, for instance, leased and rented equipment, contracting work that's just not high value add or can be done more efficiently and more efficiently finding ways to invest in equipment that allows us to be way more productive on labor components and have a really attractive return on that investment.","And then when you think about our ability to generate more productivity on the general and administrative and support cost side of our world and inclusive of purchasing material and supplies, we've been making great progress in those areas and there's lots of opportunities to come.","And we've got plans and clear-eyed opportunities there that we are developing and ultimately will be taken advantage of. So, as we sit here, the team could not be more confident in being able to achieve a 60 plus\/minus operating ratio by 2019. And of course, we're going to do that as quickly as we can. And then we\u2019re -- immediately thereafter, we're just going to keep it up on our way to a 55 operating ratio, again, as soon as we can.","Another thing that gives us confidence is looking backwards at our track record. We had some fits and starts here recently, mostly driven by significant volume drops. But even in that context, we've had good solid operating ratio improvement over a very long period of time and we've demonstrated we know how to do it. We're going to keep doing it.","Brandon Oglenski","Lance, I appreciate that. How should investors think about the sustainable rates of improvement on the margin? And you did talk about growth in those comments as well. I mean how contingent is this on growth? Are there still absolute cost buckets that you think you can attack over the next couple of years that would help drive margins higher and the OR lower?","Lance Fritz","Yes. So, we talked, Brandon, about three buckets that drive OR improvement. Pure productivity whatever the volume is and we'll continue to get that price, which is related to what the value is that we're bringing to our customers and how we're competing in our markets and we'll continue to generate that and growth.","Growth certainly helps and we're looking for ways in markets either new ones to penetrate, more business with existing customers, greater geographic reach, however we can maximize franchise and we have. We will be pulling the levers on all three of those areas all the time as we move forward. And it just depends on what the economy brings to us, what we're able to do as to exactly the role with each lever plays going forward.","Brandon Oglenski","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Walter Spracklin","Thanks very much. So, just following up on your -- on those three lines and going into pure productivity. You've got a long-term target there. You're kind of the mid-50s and up at around 62 now. What is the timeframe? I mean, just ballpark. Is this a two-year, three-year, five-year kind of productivity attack? Is this something that you can front end load? Are there projects that you're looking on that you're going to pull the trigger on that can really lead to a revamping of the infrastructure that you have right now that applies to the business you run?","Is there anything that you can give us tangibly that we can kind of look into our models and maybe not into 2019 when you hit 60, but out within a reasonable timeframe after that to be at that mid-50s? Is there anything you can point us to?","Lance Fritz","Yes, I'm not sure I'm going to be very helpful in building up the model for you. I'll tell you we're going to get there just as quickly as we can. And as we sit here and look at the different opportunities we have in front of us, the projects that we've already got launched are the ones that we're defining prior to launch.","There's plenty of opportunities and some of those might surprise us and deliver outsized productivity rapidly. And some might be a lot more pick and shovel work that takes a bit more time.","I can tell you we're scanning the environment regardless of industry, whether it's other railroad peers or any other competitors or customers of ours to find ideas that we can implement in our own environment to both accelerate our productivity and to generate productivity.","Walter Spracklin","And is there anything in that scanning that might lead to a step function move? Like a complete overhaul of hump yards and slashing them -- or your hump yards in your opinion, fully utilized. Is there anything that you think that through scanning might lead to not a gradual but a step function move in your infrastructure?","Lance Fritz","Yes, we're going to learn from everything we see and observe and deconstruct it and see if it makes sense for our network and our franchise. I'll just remind you that on our network and franchise, we have a very robust manifest product that requires a fair amount of car switching and our lowest cost car switching for us happens to be in our highly utilized hump yards.","So, at this point, as we look forward, I'm not so sure you're going to see a lot of change in that area. Plus you might see change in other areas like how we define our networks and products and perhaps the co-mingling of some of our service products so that we can both generate a better service product for our customers and more productivity for our shareholders.","Bear in mind that we've got four stakeholders and we're serving them all at the same time; our customers, employees, the communities that we serve in; and you, our shareholder.","Walter Spracklin","Moving on to this other bucket, which is pricing. Now you've noted that you kind of excluding some of the problem areas in coal and others, you are booking 2% to 3% price, which is great.","In the problem areas, do you tend to be -- you're going to be affected by contracts that have been signed that would probably have some long length to them. Two questions on that. When do those start coming off, the ones that are keeping your pricing down in those problem areas? And at this point, are you booking new contracts in those problem areas above that depressed level in prior periods?","Beth Whited","So, I don't think we're going to give any real guidance on past or future pricing in specific contracts. But I would tell you is the competition is as fierce today in Coal and Intermodal as it has been over the last, I guess, we've been talking about this for about a year. So, that's kind of where we are.","Walter Spracklin","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks very much.","Lance Fritz","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes in the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long","Thanks and good morning.","Lance Fritz","Good morning.","Justin Long","So, you said earlier that Coal volumes should be about flat year-over-year in the third quarter. And that translates into a sequential improvement of about 20% in Coal volumes. And that's really all the sequential improvement you need to get for consolidated volumes to be flat on a year-over-year basis in 3Q.","So, I guess saying it another way, it basically implies that non-Coal volumes stay flat sequentially. With that in mind, could you just give some more color on non-Coal volumes sequentially? And what's you're expecting to get better and what you're expecting to get worse in 3Q?","Lance Fritz","Rob, you want to take the guidance part of that, please?","Rob Knight Jr.","Yes. Justin I would just say you may be taking two fine slide role to the -- what we talked about. Coal, we're giving some of a directional comment on our overall volumes and on Coal. I wouldn't take that as literally as you have because the factors that will drive coal demand will continue to be gas prices, weather, economy, I mean, all those factors that could change exactly with the cadence is in the third quarter.","So, I mean our other -- so our guidance, again, to Lance's point, our guidance all-in is kind of flattish. It could be either side of that. We'll see. We want to be as high as possible, but flattish year-over-year with sequential improvement from here.","Lance Fritz","And Beth you want to just maybe talk a little bit about other markets and what's going on?","Beth Whited","Yes. So, there will be ins and outs in all other markets. There always are. I just remind you Ag was pretty strong last year and -- so the third quarter is a tough comp for that and all the other markets are going to continue to evolve as we move through the quarter. But as Rob said, we expect to be flattish.","Justin Long","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe secondly, Kansas City has talked a lot about the refined product opportunity in Mexico and it sounds like those shipments have ticked up in the second quarter for their business. Do you see this as an opportunity for your network at all or just from a geographic standpoint, is this not really a needle mover?","Beth Whited","It's a small and emerging market for us right now. We are doing a reasonable amount of traffic. I wouldn't call it substantial amount of traffic and finish fuels into Mexico both in partnership with KCSM and with the Ferromex. And we were probably a big mover early into the LPG space. And we are still seeing a lot of propane moving into Mexico.","The finished fuels have been a little slower to take off because there's not a lot of terminal infrastructure in Mexico to handle them. But we see it as a reasonable opportunity over the period until more infrastructure is built in Mexico.","Lance Fritz","Justin, I would remind you and all of our listeners at this point, we enjoy robust franchise to and from Mexico because we serve all six major rail gateways. We enjoy about 70% of all rail cross-border traffic to and from Mexico. So we will get our fair share.","Justin Long","Okay, great. I'll leave it at that. Appreciate the time.","Lance Fritz","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Schoonmaker","Hi. I'd like to ask a question on your model. In your presentation, you mentioned parcel growth. I don't know that was a unit called out a lot in the past but as a driver for the quarter. Could I ask just in the elaboration on this, the broadly how material are parcels to your franchise? It's trending upward rapidly in line with B2C and downline fulfillment. And can you elaborate maybe challenges or investments you've had to make to serve this?","Beth Whited","Yes, so we think about our business in domestic and international, and then within the domestic space, it's kind of truckload and premium and parcel would fall into that premium segment and we have seen some nice growth in it. I think a fair amount of that is being driven by e-commerce. And so that's enabled us to participate in that, and it's been pretty exciting for us.","In terms of investments that we've had to make to support it, we've been able to utilize to a pretty significant extent the facilities that we already had in place for Intermodal shipments and we also do support it from time-to-time with additional train starts if that investment makes sense for us. So, that's where we are at this point. It's been a fun market for us to watch emerge.","Keith Schoonmaker","Good. Thank you, Beth. As a follow-up, my second question, I guess, maybe this is for Cameron. A lot of times when you see a big volume influx like we've seen last couple of quarters in coal or this quarter in international -- in industrial products it's -- can compromise margins, yet you've handled it pretty deftly and actually set records in margins. Is this simply more train starts you had available locomotives and personnel furloughed? Or maybe you could elaborate on some of the challenges in bringing that volume on so rapidly?","Cameron Scott","It is always our stated objective to take Beth's volume and layer it on top of our current train start network. And as I mentioned before, there is lots of headroom in almost every train category that we have to continue to do that.","The coal marketplace for us in train size is fairly optimized. There are still opportunities but it is fairly optimized. So, really in stepping up to the plate with beautiful volume growth from Beth in Coal is making sure we're matching appropriate manpower planning and locomotive planning to handle the volumes as they come online. And I think we've accomplished that very nicely here in the second quarter.","Keith Schoonmaker","Probably industry is a lot more complex than coal, many more destinations and origins than somewhat repeatable business in the coal franchise though. Would just simply having ample capacity to add lengths to trains, Cam?","Cameron Scott","Yes, it is. And you are correct. That does become very complex very quickly. And our service design team and our network planning team has done a very nice job, whether it's a regional opportunity or a big system network opportunity to take that growth and layer it right on top of our current program.","Keith Schoonmaker","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Aegis Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Kauffman","Thank you very much. A lot of my questions have been answered. So, let me just ask one on utilization. I think we understand a lot of the factors that impacted the West Coast flow through in terms of terminal dwell and average train speed. You briefly mentioned it in your comments today. Can you talk about where you're in getting that to the levels you want to? And at what point do you think we start to see more positive year-over-year comps in those two areas?","Lance Fritz","Cameron?","Cameron Scott","You're absolutely right. In the first quarter, with the Western region impact, we took a pretty substantial hit on both velocity and car dwell. Largely, that velocity in the Western region has returned to us. It's been a little -- taken a little bit longer for us to recover in the Western region than we anticipated, but we feel confident in the second half that Western region will start delivering the extra velocity and improved internal performance that we expect out of them.","The Southern region, as I mentioned, has a bridge outage that will be resolved here in a week. They also have very heavy renewal capital programming. So, it makes it a complicated network down south. As soon as we get that bridge back in service, we anticipate the southern region will come right back to anticipated velocity as well.","Jeffrey Kauffman","One follow-up to that. I could be wrong on my statistics here. But I seem to remember when the weather gets below a certain temperature, you got to slow trains down because rails get brittle. When the weather gets above a certain temperature, you got to slow trains down because the track gets soft. We've had some pretty extreme weather this quarter, particularly in the South and Southwest. Is any of that impacting the system? And can you discuss whether I'm off target on that?","Cameron Scott","No, you are correct. Heat orders are applied when we reach certain temperature thresholds and it has been a nice warm summer. About the only area of our business where that becomes impactful is when you're looking at high-premium intermodal product. That does tend to retard the maximum train speed that you'd like to run when it comes to that high-premium Intermodal product. The rest of the network is largely unaffected by those heat-slow orders.","Lance Fritz","Hey Jeff, the other aspect of heat is, we're in the outdoor business. So, we really got to help our craft professionals kind of watch their health when it gets to temperatures like we're in right now. And that can slowdown work to some degree because they've got to make sure they take breaks. They got to get out of the heat, be able to keep their body temperature reasonable. And you can just imagine working eight or 10 or 12 hours in the kind of environment we have now. That can have an impact on an individual's productivity.","Jeffrey Kauffman","Okay. Well, thank you for your answers and good luck.","Lance Fritz","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna International. Please proceed with your question.","Bascome Majors","Yes, thanks for fitting me in here this morning. The operating cash flow was down about 2% year-to-date on mid-teens growth in net income. Could you just walk us through if anything there is timing related? And kind of how you expect that to shake out in net income for the full year? And then maybe a similar comment longer term. Do we expect to grow cash flow in line? Maybe a little better than or a little worse than net income over time? Thanks.","Rob Knight Jr.","Yes, Bascom, there was a timing issue with when you look at year-over-year. You're right; the reported numbers show it down. There was, call it, $400 million year-over-year delta on the bonus depreciation. And that is kind of front-end loaded for this year. So, we'll see how it kind of plays out for the balance of the year.","But longer term, our goal is to continue to drive that number positively, clearly. And we have every expectation that given all of the productivity initiatives we have underway that, that will be a very strong base.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lance Fritz for closing comments.","Lance Fritz","Thank you very much. And thank you all for your questions and interest in Union Pacific. We look forward to talking with you again in October.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."],"20697":["Union Pacific Corp.

(Broker)","Brian Adam Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Operator","Greetings and welcome to the Union Pacific first quarter 2017 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. You may begin.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's first quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Beth Whited, our Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of nearly $1.1 billion for the first quarter of 2017. This equates to a first quarter record $1.32 per share which is up 14% over last year. Total volume increased 2% in the quarter compared to 2016, carload volume increased in three of our six commodity groups, led by a 16% increase in coal. The quarterly operating ratio came in at 65.1% which is flat with the first quarter of 2016.","This is a very solid start to the year, especially given the weather challenges we encountered on the Western part of our network earlier in the quarter. In keeping with our strategic value tracks, our engaged employees worked safely and productively under very difficult circumstances during the quarter. As a result, operations were restored quickly as we continued to focus on providing an excellent customer experience. Our team will give you more of the details on the quarter, starting with Beth...","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Thank you, Lance, and good morning. In the first quarter, our volume was up 2% driven primarily by Coal, Agricultural Products and Industrial Products, offset by declines in Automotive and Chemicals. We generated positive net core pricing of 1% in the quarter, with continued energy related and Intermodal pricing pressure. The increase in volume and a 4% improvement in average revenue per car drove a 6% increase in freight revenue.","Let's take a closer look at the performance of each our six business groups. Ag Products revenue increased 7% on 6% volume growth and a 1% improvement in average revenue per car. Grain carloads increased 19% year-over-year driven by ample U.S. grain supply and global market competitiveness increasing demand for grain exports, primarily wheat and corn. Grain product carloads were flat, with strengths from DDG exports to Mexico and soybean meal shipments in the U.S. offset by a drop in canola meal and oils volume.","Food and refrigerated carloads were down 3% driven by declines in canned goods. Refrigerated markets were also down due to Western region weather challenges and ample truck availability. Looking at the remainder of the year, the strong South American crop and continued abundance of grain stocks will create uncertainty in the grain markets. Weather and crop health will also continue to be factors. We expect food and refrigerated shipments will see strength as the year progresses.","Automotive revenue was down 1% in the quarter on a 2% decrease in volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 8% as a result of previously referenced contract changes which we have now largely lapped and lower production levels. These changes were partially offset by increased West Coast imports and new production in Mexico. The seasonally adjusted average rate of sales was 17.2 million vehicles in the first quarter, down 1% from first quarter 2016. On the parts side, over the road conversions and growth in light truck demand drove a 5% increase in volume. The U.S. light vehicle forecast for full year 2017 is 17.4 million units, down 1% from the 2016 record rate of 17.6 million. We remain cautious with respect to auto sales due to high inventory, dealer incentives and rising interest rates. On the parts side, however, over the road conversions will continue to present opportunities for growth.","Chemicals revenue was up 1% for the quarter on a 4% decrease in volume and 5% increase in average revenue per car. Petroleum and LPG shipments declined 23% as we continued to see headwinds on crude oil shipments which were down 87% to about 2,000 carloads in the quarter due to the lower crude oil prices and available pipeline capacity. Chemicals volume excluding crude oil was up 1% in the quarter.","Partially offsetting the declines in crude oil was strength in plastics which was up 3% in the quarter due to increased polypropylene shipments. For the rest of 2017 our Chemicals franchise is expected to remain stable, strength is anticipated in plastics with new facilities and expansions beginning to come online as well as in industrial chemicals driven by improvement in industrial production. Both of these will continue to help offset the expected continued decline in crude oil shipments.","Coal revenue increased 25% for the quarter on a 16% increase in volume and 8% improvement in average revenue per car. On a tonnage basis, Powder River Basin and other regions were up 21% and 5% respectively from higher natural gas prices and stronger West Coast exports which benefited from favorable global economics for Western U.S. coal. Overall, coal stockpiles were down in the quarter and they are nearing the five-year average. Looking forward, we expect Coal volumes will continue to benefit from favorable 2016 comps in the second quarter. For the second half the year we expect sustained volume, assuming natural gas prices remain in the $3 range. As always, weather conditions will be a key factor of demand.","Industrial Products revenue was up 9% on a 1% increase in volume and a 7% increase in average revenue per car during the car. Minerals volume increased 32% in the quarter, driven by a 59% increase in frac sand shipments, through increased shale related drilling activity, and profit intensity per drilling well. Construction products volume was down 9% due to projects completed in 2016 that did not continue into 2017, largely in South Texas. This market was also impacted by Western region weather challenges. Specialized markets were impacted by reduced project-based waste shipments partially offset by strength in our wind and government markets. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued strength in frac sand shipments as rig counts in our served territory continue to increase. The strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacts a number of Industrial Products markets, especially metals, and creates some uncertainty in our outlook.","Intermodal revenue was up 3% with flat volume and a 3% increase in average revenue per car. Domestic volume declined 1% in the quarter driven by a challenging competitive environment and abundant truck capacity. International volume was up 1% in the quarter from stronger westbound shipments, inventory restocking and volume pushes prior to the ocean carrier alliance changes effective April 1. Looking forward we expect international Intermodal volumes will continue to be impacted by ongoing ocean carrier financial stress, industry consolidation and potential trade policy changes. While trucking capacity is abundant currently making modal conversions challenging we expect a tightening of capacity late in the year with the implementation of electronic log books providing an opportunity to drive higher levels of over the road conversions.","To wrap up, this slide recaps our outlook for the remainder of 2017 mentioned in the previous slides. Favorable coal comps will continue into the second quarter. We also anticipate strength in other key markets including continued growth in frac sand. Our diverse franchise remains well positioned for growth this year as the U.S. economy continues to build momentum in the face of a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy. Our team remains fully committed to developing new business opportunities and strengthening our overall customer value proposition. With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance.","Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.","Thanks, Beth. And good morning. Starting with safety performance our reportable personal injury rate increased to 0.89 versus the first quarter record of 0.75 achieved in 2016. While disappointed with the results, the team remains fully committed to successfully addressing risk in the workplace and I am confident in our efforts as we push towards our goal of zero incidents. With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate of 3.18 increased 11% versus the first quarter of last year.","To make improvement going forward, we'll continue to focus on enhanced TE&Y training to eliminate human factor incidents and making investments that harden our infrastructure to reduce incidents. In addition, we're collecting millions of data points on the health of our track condition and are actively developing advanced analytical models to better identify and mitigate this risk.","In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 7% versus 2016 to 2.21. As I mentioned on the fourth quarter call, our crossing assessment process or CAP couples our comprehensive safety culture with data analysis to help focus increased attention on the crossings where we can most substantially impact public safety.","Moving on to network performance. Severe weather throughout much of our Western region caused multiple track outages and service interruptions during the first quarter. As a result, velocity declined 6% while terminal dwell increased 7% when compared to 2016. Despite the weather challenges, we were still able to generate efficiency gains within our terminals as cars switched per employee day increased 4% during the first quarter. I would like to take a moment to thank the team for their hard work and dedication as they did an excellent job of restoring the network quickly and safely in an effort to minimize delays so we could continue delivering an excellent customer experience.","Moving on to resources. Throughout the quarter as part of our ongoing business planning process, we fine-tuned our resource levels to account for volume changes, weather disruptions and productivity gains. As a result, our total TE&Y work force was down 1% in the first quarter when compared to the same period in 2016. And our engineering and mechanical work force was down a combined 1100 employees or 5%. At the end of the quarter we had approximately 1650 TE&Y furloughs. We do expect those numbers to decline throughout the year as we look to the furlough pool first to backfill attrition. The active locomotive fleet was up 3% for the first quarter of 2017, primarily to help minimize the impact of weather related challenges and we had approximately 1400 locomotives in storage at the end of the first quarter.","As always, we will continue to adjust our work force levels and equipment fleet as volume and network performance dictate. In addition to efficiently right-sizing our resource base, we continued realizing gains in other key productivity initiatives such as train size. Our persistent focus on productivity once again resulted in train size performance improvement as we achieved best ever quarterly results in our Automotive and manifest networks and first quarter records in our Intermodal and grain networks.","To wrap up, despite some first quarter challenges, we expect to build positive momentum as we focus on critical initiatives that will drive improvement. First and foremost is safety where we expect our safety strategy will yield record results on our way to incident-free environment. And our balanced resource base puts us in tremendous position to leverage volume growth to the bottom line as we maintain our intense focus on productivity and efficiency across the network. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","Good morning. Let's start with a recap of our first quarter results. Operating revenue was $5.1 billion in the quarter, up 6% versus last year. Higher volumes, an increase in fuel surcharges and positive core price all contributed to the increase in revenue for the quarter. Operating expenses totaled $3.3 billion, up 6% from 2016. The increase in fuel cost represented a majority of the increased operating expense in the quarter.","Operating income totaled almost $1.8 billion, a 6% increase from last year. Below the line, other income totaled $67 million, up from $46 million in 2016. This increase was primarily driven by a real estate pre-tax gain totaling $26 million or approximately $0.02 per share. Interest expense of $172 million was up 3% compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. Income tax expense increased about 5% to $616 million, driven primarily by higher pre-tax earnings. Net income totaled nearly $1.1 billion, up 9% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activities.","These results combined to produce a record first quarter earnings per share of $1.32 per share. And as we discussed back in March, we encountered severe weather on the Western part of our network which negatively impacted earnings per share by about $0.03 in the quarter. A good portion of this was lost revenue. The operating ratio was flat with the first quarter last year even with the fuel headwind we faced during the quarter. Higher fuel prices negatively impacted the operating ratio by about 1.3 points.","Now turning to the top line. Freight revenue of $4.8 billion was up over 6% versus last year, driven by a 2% increase in volume along with positive core pricing. Fuel surcharge revenue totaled $212 million, up $99 million when compared to 2016 and up about $25 million from the fourth quarter of last year. All in, we estimate the net impact of higher fuel prices was a $0.02 headwind to earnings in the first quarter versus last year. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the first quarter was a positive 1%. The primary drivers of this positive mix were year-over-year growth in frac sand shipments and grain carloadings along with a reduction in shorter haul rock volumes.","Core price was about 1%. Pricing in our energy and Intermodal business continues to be under pressure given the competitiveness in those respective markets. We expect these challenges to continue throughout the first part of 2017 before beginning to strengthen later in the year, assuming market conditions improve. Excluding Coal and Intermodal, pricing in our other business lines was in the 2% to 3% range for the quarter. And for the full year, we are on track with our pricing initiatives to generate a revenue benefit that exceeds our inflation costs. Our strategy of pricing our service product based on the value proposition it represents in the competitive marketplace at levels that generate a reinvestable return remains intact.","Turning now to the operating expense. Slide 20 provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter. Compensation and benefits expense increased 4% versus 2016. The increase was primarily driven by a combination of higher wage and benefit inflation, higher volume, and weather-related costs. Labor inflation was about 5% in the quarter. Partially offsetting higher volumes were solid productivity gains and a smaller capital work force resulting in total work force levels declining 4% in the quarter versus last year or about 1,600 employees less. For the remainder of 2017, we do expect force levels to adjust with volume but will also reflect ongoing productivity initiatives.","Fuel expense totaled $460 million, up 44% when compared to last year. Higher diesel fuel prices and a 7% increase in gross ton miles drove the increase in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 4% while our average fuel price increased 40% to $1.75 per gallon. Purchased services and materials expense decreased 1% to $566 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower joint facility expenses and locomotive material costs.","Turning to slide 21. Depreciation expense was $520 million, up 4% compared to 2016, primarily driven by a higher depreciable base. For the full year 2017, we estimate that depreciation expense will increase around 4% to 5%. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $276 million which is down 4% when compared to 2016. Lower locomotive lease expense and a mix of traffic were the primary drivers for the reduction. Other expenses came in at $260 million, up 4% versus last year. For 2017, we would expect other expense to increase slightly excluding any unusual items.","Looking at our cash flow. Cash from operations for the first quarter totaled about $1.9 billion, down $290 million when compared to last year. The decrease in cash was primarily related to a lower bonus depreciation benefit. Taking a look at adjusted debt levels, the all-in adjusted debt balance totaled $17.8 billion at quarter end. This does not include the $1 billion of new debt which closed just after the quarter end. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of around 1.9 times, and this keeps us close to our target ratio of just under two times. Dividend payments for the quarter totaled nearly $500 million, compared to $465 million last year. This includes a 10% dividend increase per share which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016.","In addition to dividends, we also bought back over 7.5 million shares totaling $800 million, an increase of around 12% over last year. And since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased nearly 30% of our outstanding shares. And between our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned about $1.3 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter, which represented just over 120% of first quarter net income.","On the productivity side, our G55+0 initiatives yielded around $90 million of productivity in the quarter. A couple of examples of our productivity include effectively leveraging volume growth that we achieved in the quarter, reducing locomotive servicing and repair costs, turning back leased equipment no longer required, and furthering our efforts to be more efficient on our support functions. With these results, we continue to progress as expected and we are on track to meet our $350 million to $400 million productivity goal for the full year. Looking forward, we still expect full year volume growth to be up in the low single digit range. Second quarter volumes could be a little stronger driven primarily by the benefit of an easier comparison year-over-year.","With positive volume, positive core price, and significant productivity benefits, we are still on track to have an improved full year operating ratio. Longer term, we are still focused on achieving our targeted 60% operating ratio, plus or minus, on a full year basis by 2019 and we remain committed to reaching our goal of a 55% operating ratio beyond 2019 as we continued the momentum of our volume, pricing and productivity initiatives.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thank you, Rob. With a solid first quarter performance behind us, we'll continue to press ahead with our volume, pricing, and productivity initiatives through the remainder of year. As Beth mentioned, we're seeing particular strength in a few markets such as frac sand. Coal seems to have stabilized and we're seeing some signs of gradual improvement in other areas of the economy. Our six-track value strategy will keep us intensely focused on effectively leveraging volume growth while providing our customers an excellent experience and our shareholders a solid return on their investment.","With that, let's open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Due to the number of analysts joining us on the call today, we will be limiting everyone to one primary question and one follow-up question to accommodate as many participants as possible.","Our first question today comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.","Diane Huang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, this is Diane Huang on for Ravi. Thank you for taking my question. So, a question here is the average number of employees was down about 4% year-over-year despite volumes growing 2%. So, with your full-year volume outlook of up low-single digits for the year, do you expect to hold the first quarter head count level flat sequentially for the rest of the year? And then a second part to that question is in the past you guys talked about 50% incremental margins. So, with your G55 initiative and also positive volume growth, we can see higher levels of incremental margins for the rest of the year. Thank you.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thank you, Diane. We'll let Rob answer those questions.","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, on the head count question, yeah, you're exactly right in what you pointed out in terms of the great productivity that we saw in the first quarter in the face of some of the challenges that we talked about. Full year, I mean, I'll just call you back to our guidance we've given, and that is head count will move with volume, but we obviously will achieve productivity along the way, so it won't be one-for-one, So, we stay away from giving a precise number, but rest assured, to achieve our objectives we're going to continue to drive productivity and it will be reflected in those numbers.","In terms of the incremental margin, as we look out to achieve both our 60% OR guidance by 2019 and then, beyond that, our 55%, it's going to require incremental margins in the 50% to 60% range, and that's kind of how we think about it and that's what we're focused on.","Diane Huang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, that's very helpful. And then a quick one here. Can you quantify how much of the $0.03 to $0.04 EPS headwind from weather was related to revenues versus expense?","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","We didn't break that out, but I would just say a large portion of the $0.03 showed up on the revenue line.","Diane Huang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Eric Morgan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning. This is Eric Morgan on for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the pricing pressure you mentioned and the competitive environment in Intermodal. Just wondering if you could elaborate on that a bit and talk about how the current level of competition compares to what you've seen historically and maybe how that's progressed throughout the quarter and into April and your expectations on that front?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","We are seeing ample truck capacity in the market as well as pretty significant pricing pressure in the Intermodal space. It has not abated as we've gone into April. As we think about the rest of the year, we certainly are expecting to see capacity tighten as electronic logbooks come into play, and so our expectation would be that you would start to see some rationalization of capacity and an opportunity for better pricing.","Eric Morgan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right, appreciate that. And then maybe just on frac sand, can you just talk a little bit more about the fundamentals there? It looks like you're seeing some acceleration in 2Q. I guess where are you relative to the prior peak in that business and has there been any significant change in the mix of business? And I guess if you're able to quantify the positive mix impact that you mentioned earlier?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Okay. So, we are seeing substantial increases in demand in Texas, specifically in the Permian Basin. We'd mentioned that we were up 59% in the quarter. We were up almost 100% in the Permian Basin and we're up around 40% in Eagle Ford. We're seeing some spiking demand as well in the Niobrara, but not as substantial. I would say that that is sustaining and maybe even growing a little bit as we enter into the second quarter. And I don't see anything right now that changes that, so that's been a bright spot for us.","You asked a question about mix. We are starting to see some local brown sand come into play, especially in the Permian. So, we're looking at something like 85% white sand, 15% brown sand. We expect the pie to continue to grow and it's possible over time brown sand will take up a larger piece of the pie, but still opportunity for us and we're participating in that market as much as we can.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Hey, Eric, just stepping back a couple of kind of high-level things that are going on in that shale energy market. One is many of these shale energy exploration plays are competitive at $50 oil and so it looks like it's potentially a sustained marketplace. And the second thing is the sand intensity per well has been increasing and that also looks like it's a favorable trend.","Eric Morgan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks for the time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning. So, I wanted to \u2013 I guess first I'll just ask about Coal. I think, Lance, you mentioned stabilization in Coal. I know there are a lot of factors that affect the business, and probably natural gas price is one of the most important. But how do you see the lay of the land maybe over the next year in terms of impact from facility closures, impact potentially from renewables capacity coming on. Do you think that from that perspective that you would have some stability and you're really kind of weather dependent? Or are there some other faculties like that, new capacity or shutdowns, that we should consider over the next year?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","We do view that as being pretty stable over the next year. You called out exactly the right factors that will impact it. Weather clearly will remain a factor and natural gas prices are really very key to keeping coal-generated electricity on the dispatch curve. So, with those couple of things in mind, we view it as being pretty stable over the horizon here.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. And one on the operating side. How would you characterize -- I mean, seems like your growth is coming in, aside from the Coal growth, you're getting a lot of growth in what might be in the manifest network, not so much in Intermodal, so I think you get good operating leverage and seems like you're doing a good job of expanding train length. How much capacity do you have to run longer trains in the manifest network? I know it's train by train, segment by segment, but overall, have you got another 10% you could add to train length in manifest or what's the right ballpark for that?","Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.","Tom, I won't give you an exact figure, but there is plenty of headroom inside our network, almost across the board between our three regions for more train size opportunities and we will, on a case by case, lane by lane basis, take advantage of that.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So that leverage should continue in the near term?","Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.","Yes, sir, it should.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great, thank you.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thank you, Tom.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, thanks, everybody. Congrats on a good quarter. Just following up on the incremental question, the first question. I wanted to just ask the underlying \u2013 trying to understand what the underlying incrementals were in the quarter after adjusting for the weather impact. I don't have perfect information from the data you provided but it looks like it was in the mid 50% level and then if you can just confirm that or correct me if I'm wrong? And then if you look at the OR targets over the long-term, obviously this is an enormously capital intensive business. What I'm trying to understand as you look at bridging where you are today to where you want to be, how much of that trajectory is I guess fully kind of in your control via net cost savings and how much of it is volume growth that's kind of out of your control? I would imagine the vast majority of it would be volume growth, but please correct me if I'm wrong.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Rob, you want to handle that.","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah. In the first quarter, our incremental margins as reported were about 35%. And if you adjust for the fuel, they were closer to like 65%. I didn't break out the impact of weather, but obviously that had a slight impact on that calculus. But those are the numbers as reported. And as I said earlier, to drive to our stated goals we need to be in the 50% to 60% range on an annualized basis to get from here to there and that's how we're focused.","In terms of what will drive the incremental margins, what will drive the leverage, I would just say \u2013 you said volume's out of our control, somewhat that's true because we have to play the hand the economy deals us. But we also, as part of our G55+0 initiatives, are focused on developing business development opportunities where we can have some control over volume and obviously providing quality safe service to our customers is one of the key drivers to in fact encouraging volume growth on our railroad.","So we view a lot of that as in our control and we're focused on driving quality volume, continuing to focus on providing quality service so we can price it right above inflation and continue our focus on productivity initiatives which we have been successfully delivering. You add all that up, that's what's going to get us from where we are to the 60% and ultimately to the 55%.","Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.","Amit, I thought I heard you ask a question on CapEx and as we look forward on CapEx that's driven, you mentioned growth that's driven part by about a $2 billion spend to maintain a robust network and then the rest is about finding investments that have a reasonable and attractive return. Positive train control of course is in its last couple of years of significant investment. So that will start trailing off and we'll see what the future brings.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks and if I could just follow up one question on pricing. Rob, you've kind of talked over the last couple quarters ad nauseam about core pricing dynamics and how you guys calculate it. If you can just update us, some of the energy volumes are coming back online now and just if you could provide some color if the pricing pressure or the decelerating pricing environment has abated at all as some of those volumes have come back online and also the positive spread between price increases and cost inflation that you've talked about. Has that spread changed at all since the start of the year in a more positive direction in some of the export volumes of Coal and the energy volumes are a little bit better than expected? Thanks.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, I would just say you're right. We have attempted to explain how we calculate price and again I'm proud to announce, as you all have heard me say for many years, that we are very conservative in terms of how we accurately capture what we report on price. But nothing's changed from the guidance we gave. And that is that we're focused on driving dollars that we yield from our pricing initiatives higher than for the full year, higher than the dollars we expend on inflation and coming into this year we called out that that gap this year was clearly going to be tighter than last year, largely driven by some of the pressures that you're asking about in our energy and Intermodal businesses on the one hand and on the other hand a higher inflation rate, which for the full year we still see overall inflation in that 3% range which is obviously is higher than what we ended up with last year.","So nothing has changed but I would just point out that, as Beth commented in her remarks, we are continuing to face competitive pressures in the energy and Intermodal businesses, so that has not abated. That continues.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Got it. That's very clear. All right, thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question's coming from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thanks. Morning, guys. Just wanted to follow up there. So, if I look at the segments, Coal had the best yield growth of any of the segments, and I'm wondering is that a mix benefit or change or maybe do some of the contracts have something tied to higher natural gas prices? And if not, does the rising natural gas environment \u2013 we understand how it helps volumes but how do you think that impacts Coal pricing?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Rob, let's start with you and then we can have Beth...","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, Beth can talk about the pricing, but I would just say from a yield and depending on how you're calculating the yield, Scott, I would just say that a large part of what we saw in terms of the overall yields and we don't break it out by commodity group as you may like us to as finitely. But I would just say that the mix impact of the significant volume growth year-over-year in Coal really did impact the reported mix numbers on the yield that you're I think referring to. In terms of the pricing dynamics, Beth.","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, the pricing dynamics remain, as Rob just said, it's really quite competitive but the length of haul helped us both coming out of the PRB and going into Texas as well as the export volumes which did grow a bit for us in the first quarter.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay and then just maybe a bigger picture question, Lance. Relative to a quarter ago the big change in the industry is that you've got Hunter now at CSX and given what he does and the way he talks, I'm wondering does that in any way change the way that you guys think about the longer term margin opportunity? Does it have any impact on the way you think about the business or manage the business or the pace in which you want to improve margins? Any kind of change in your thinking relative to a quarter ago?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","So, Scott, let's start by saying we have great respect for CSX, the management team there, their business. They run a good business. They've got a great business model, and I'm sure Hunter is bringing significant change to that business model and he's got a great track record in our industry. Setting that aside, we run our business with an eye towards being as efficient as we possibly can be and driving our six value tracks.","Now we keep our eyes open, and we learn from anybody we can outside of our business, and we've done that historically, and we'll continue to do that. A great case in point is the 600-some-odd low horsepower locomotives we've taken out of our network over the past couple of years. That was a lesson we learned from a couple of other entities, and we figured out how to apply it to ourselves, and we've done that effectively.","So our focus is get to that 60%, plus minus, by 2019 and then get to 55%. And we'll get there as quickly as we can, keeping in mind we've got a number of levers that we're moving in terms of growth on the top line, productivity and trying to drive core price. And again if somebody's got a great idea that looks like it can apply to our business model, we're going to use it, but it's not going to fundamentally change how we run our business or approach our strategy.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you for the thoughts, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ari Rosa with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.","Ariel Luis Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, guys. So just wanted to start on the balance sheet. Obviously, you're getting closer to your level that you've set in terms of the target rate of two times debt to EBITDA but it seems like you're still able to access some very low cost debt. Has there been any internal discussion in terms of raising that cap and maybe increasing returns to shareholders?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Rob, you want to take a stab at that.","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","We're comfortable with the guidance we've given of that two times, but rest assured we're very focused on driving cash flow and that with higher cash flow we'll support higher levels of debt and that then supports higher levels of continued share repurchases. That's our focus.","Ariel Luis Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So it sounds like, no, that two times cap is a pretty hard cap at the moment?","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","We feel good with that as we look forward.","Ariel Luis Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. And then just turning quickly to crude by rail. The volumes are obviously down pretty dramatically this quarter. Is that an area that's just not a viable area going forward for Union Pacific? You go back a couple of years ago, and everybody thought this was going to be a growth area for the rails. It seems like pipeline has pretty much displaced that. Is there an opportunity that that growth could ever return? Just would love to hear your thoughts on that.","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah. So Union Pacific really doesn't have a crude oil franchise like some of the other railroads. So we will continue, I think, to be spot players as opportunities open up for arbitrage. So you might see a little move to California out of Canada. You might see a little bit move to the Gulf. But in terms of our core franchise lanes, I don't think that it's a big market for Union Pacific going forward.","Ariel Luis Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, fair enough. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Aegis Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Aegis Capital Corp.","Thank you very much. Lot of focus on revenues and end markets. I wanted to come back to capital investment and just get an idea on an updated basis where the CapEx guidance is, I'm assuming unchanged. And talk a little bit about what opportunities there may be going forward to take some of that capital investment down where need be.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","I'll take a stab at that and then we'll let either Rob or Cam add some technicolor. So our $3.1 billion for the year remains $3.1 billion. Of course, there are moving parts in there, but that's what we're expecting for our full year. As we look forward, the moving parts again are about $2 billion of replacement capital annually. We don't see much that changes that dramatically over time in order to maintain a really robust network. Positive train control is coming towards the end of its significant capital spend as we finally implement in its entirety of the project by 2018 and then work through 2020 to get the bugs kicked out and get it operating properly.","After that, it's all about growth and safety and productivity targeted investments. Rob's also talked about a ballpark of 15% of revenue, and I don't think there's much that we see that takes us off those numbers.","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, I would just reiterate that, Jeff, that that 15% is probably the best. Again, that's not how we build our capital plan. That's the best way to kind of think about how we're thinking about it. But I would also just to Lance's comments that we are pleased with the disciplined approach we've brought to the capital planning process. And, in fact, our $3.1 billion is down about $1.2 billion on an annualized basis from the last couple of years.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Aegis Capital Corp.","Looking at the 1,400 parked locomotives or locomotives in storage, I guess, I should think about, they're not all brand new locomotives. Some of them are older locomotives. How much can you grow volume without having to make any kind of incremental investment in locomotive fleet?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","So, I'll let Cam add some, but bottom line is when you think about those 1400 parked locomotives, those are all the tail end of the fleet from the standpoint of we want to operate the most efficient, most reliable units, so those are generally going to be our newer units. You know, with that in mind, they're all serviceable and we did bring a fair number of them back, call it 400, at some point during the first quarter to overcome the impacts of those weather issues that we had on the West Coast. So, we've got plenty of headroom for growth prior to really needing to acquire new locomotives. Cameron?","Cameron A. Scott - Union Pacific Corp.","And, Lance, we've had a lot of practice over the past several years in bringing that locomotive fleet back to life. It's reliable. Doesn't require a lot of further investment and we've got a lot of headroom to bring on additional business without even thinking about new purchases.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, I'll remind you we do have an obligation that's part of a long-term contract that includes purchases this year but absent the fact that we had a long-term contract, we would not be in the market.","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","If I can, Lance, just to remind everybody what those numbers are that we've said. There's approximately 60 new ones this year and then 40 in 2018 and that completes that long-term commitment.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Aegis Capital Corp.","All right. Well, congratulations on a strong quarter and thanks, guys.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your questions.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great, thanks. Good morning, guys. Wanted to touch on mix a little bit and, Rob, I think I ask this question a lot and I'm not sure if you're ever able to answer it, but wanted to get a sense when you think about sort of the mix of the business in the outlook that looks solid, things like frac sand, I think Coal's got a decent outlook for the rest of the year. When we think about that, just sort of directionally speaking, we should be expecting some of the positive mix tailwinds that you've had over the last couple quarters to persist. Is that fair way to look at it or is it a little bit too difficult to get into the weeds there?","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, Chris, you could probably write down my answer. That well could play out that way. I mean, you're right, we had a positive mix this quarter of 1%, as you're pointing out, largely driven by growth in Coal and sand. But we stay away from giving guidance on the mix because there's a lot of moving parts. And because we have such a diverse book of business, there's mix within mix in our varied business. But you're not thinking about it wrong. I mean, if those are the commodities that continue to strengthen relative to the rest of the base throughout the year, then that's not crazy thinking.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then just wanted to come back to sort of the competitive dynamic in the Western U.S. between rail carriers. We've heard some anecdotal stuff about your competitor in terms of service degradation, mostly on the Intermodal side, but just a little bit around the margin there. I know you guys compete very aggressively everyday against BN, but just wanted to get a sense of maybe how that dynamic, even if it has changed at all as we go forward here.","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","I don't feel like anything about the competitive dynamic has significantly altered. We're competing every day with our direct competitor as well as all the other modes of transportation that are capable of handling the same sort of freight that we have. It feels a little more intense on the Intermodal side in the first quarter, perhaps, than what we had seen, but it's an ongoing competitive situation that we are engaged in playing.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for the time this morning, guys, appreciate it.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah, thank you. You just talked a little bit more about the competitive Intermodal environment with respect to pricing on the International side. I'm curious, are you looking for up-pricing on the domestic side with your partners there this year? And how does that compare to the 2% to 3% range, ex Coal, ex International that you threw out earlier?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Like we said before, if other things are up 2% to 3% then you're obviously having some pressure in other places to get to the 1% overall. So, we are very focused on what's going to happen with capacity as you move towards the end of the year and the electronic log books come into place, because we do think you'll see some rationalization at that time, providing an opportunity for pricing to improve in that truckload space. But that's not the only thing that we're focused on. We want to make sure that we have a great product that's very competitive, so that as more freight wants to move away from the highway and onto rail, we're standing there ready to deliver it to our customers in the manner that they expect.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And to follow up on that latter comment, specifically with your domestic partners, how do you balance your desire to improve your pricing and returns while still leaving them enough margin to continue to invest in growing in their business and grow their volumes on your lines?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","I would say certainly there's no percentage in it for us if we don't all win together. So, our goal is certainly to have a viable competitive product that enables all the people who are part of that supply chain to participate in a manner that makes sense to them from a business perspective.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","All right. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your questions.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you, operator, and good morning, all. Wanted to stick on the Intermodal pricing a bit. How should we expect it to start improving if, in fact, ELDs do, like most of us think, tighten up truck capacity? Is that pricing going to be a little bit of a lag? So, should we expect like a 2018 improvement and not an improvement in 2017 in price?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","No, the ELDs come into play in late 2017. The requirement gets hardened. I think you just have to see, depending on bid cycles and other things, where you start to see the impact of that. Hard to predict.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And I wanted to jump back to something on the cost side. Rob, you mentioned labor inflation, I think, was about 5% in the quarter. Is that something that we should think about going forward about that number 5% for labor inflation?","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, I think it's a reasonable number to assume, Jason, both the 5% on labor and overall enterprise right around 3% for the full year.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","Right. And so, head count, obviously will depend upon what's happening with the volume side.","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","That's right. That's right.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, fantastic. I appreciate the time, as always, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Lance, I wanted to ask you a question about some of the incentives that you guys maybe have put in place or are talking about putting in place through the board around the drive towards a 55% OR. One of the pushbacks we get in sort of recommending your stock is that there's a perception out there maybe management is a little bit taking their time on the margin side. There isn't as much of a sense of urgency. I'm just wondering if you guys have had any discussions about trying to address that through some specific initiatives tied towards margin goals or margin achievement.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Sure. I assure you management is not taking its time on trying to improve our margins. If you look at our long-term incentive plan, our proxy lines out the fact that it's built around an improved ROIC, or encouraging us to improve our return on invested capital. And in that there's a kicker that's designed around improving our operating margin. But all of our incentives essentially line us up, whether it's our long-term incentive plan or the fact that we're all significant shareholders or our short-term incentive plan, they're essentially all lined up for us to improve our operating margin and our return on invested capital as quickly as we can. The payouts get better and grow the faster and better we make those improvements.","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","And, David, I have to just jump in here. This is Rob. We're actually \u2013 while we have every incentive, as Lance just commented on, and proud of the fact that everybody in our organization has 55% sort of on their mind, we're driving towards that. We are also proud, as the largest U.S. railroad to have the lowest operating ratio of the U.S. rails. That is something that we've worked hard at and are very proud of and we're going to continue that line of thinking to drive us to the 55%.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah, and I just wanted to be clear that this is just a perception that I think some investors have in terms of maybe the radical change that's happening in the East and some of the targets that have been put out there, even for like Norfolk management around margin attainment. I was just wondering if you guys were going to be thinking about making that more front and center as far as trying to give the market a little bit of confidence that you guys are really pushing this target toward 55% and it's not just a target that's out there that you're going to drift towards, which is...","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","A couple of other reminders, right? We generated over $400 million in productivity last year. We talked about generating over $350 million in productivity this year. We are not just wandering around in the woods.","J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I appreciate that and thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning, thanks for fitting me in here. Could you remind us what percentage of your book of business is under multiyear contract? And with pricing flat versus Q4, first, do you think we're at a bottom here? And then second, could full-year core price be up versus 2016 on the increase in these inflation escalators alone?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Beth, can you handle those questions on multiyear and what expect out of pricing?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, so we have about 40% of the business that's in longer term deals with escalators of one sort or another on them. We also do expect to see, based on market conditions that we've been talking about this morning, some improvement as we get towards the end of the year. Obviously, volume helps us, improvements in our customers' ability to get price in their markets, an improving economy helps us and volume can be our friend as well.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And just a quick one on frac sand. We've obviously seen some announcements from some of your customers for new facilities or expansions, so, with the significant increase that you've seen in the first quarter and thinking over the next few quarters, do you think that at some point during 2017, from a volume standpoint, that you could get back to a peak run rate that you saw back in 2014?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","I don't see us coming back to that sort of a peak in 2017. No. We do see good investments happening and we feel positive about what's happening in those markets, but I don't think we'll get back to peak levels soon.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","James Allen - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys, it's James Allen on for Brian. A question, my first question is on protectionism. We noticed the softwood lumber penalties that the U.S. is imposing on Canada and the Canadians have responded proposing a ban on U.S. thermal coal going into Canada, so, I guess we wondered if you had, first off, any direct exposure to the thermal coal? And then just what your view was on protectionism more broadly, if you thought there were any major risks or opportunities for your book of business as freight flows might change?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","I'll take the freight, the trade question and it's broader and you can talk about coal, Beth. So, in terms of trade overall, our perspective is the following: that the U.S. economy is tightly connected to our trading partners. We understand that open global trade and more markets available to U.S. manufacturers and producers is critical both for jobs in the United States as well as for the economic vibrancy of the United States.","We believe that that's well understood also in our current administration and we believe that while there are opportunities to both enforce existing trade agreements, enhance them and negotiate new ones, that the long-term answer is more markets available to U.S. manufacturers and producers is better than fewer markets available. That's essentially the pathway towards economic prosperity and job creation. So, with that, I'll let Beth answer the thermal coal question.","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","So, we do not access the export facility in Vancouver that's being referenced in the most recent discussions about access. The coal that we export off the West Coast is hitting locations in California.","James Allen - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then a quick follow-up question would be on the STB. There's a slightly changing composition with a new chairperson and new board seats, so just wondering in your interactions with the STB, has there been any new flavor to your discussions? Or any changes that you'd expect as they progress with existing regulatory initiatives?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Following the reauthorization in I think it was late 2015, the STB got very active at clearing a docket of a number of different items that were in front of them. We've seen that activity slow down a touch, which makes sense given that the current administration has the opportunity to appoint board members of that organization. What we're encouraging the STB as they're thinking about their docket of work is to not simply just look at each individual item as a stand-alone item, but also bear in mind that they all work together as a quilt of overriding regulation on the industry, and to think about the kind of interactivity of all the regulation they are contemplating.","We look at the STB historically and think the balance they've struck has been good for the industry, and mostly important is good for the customers, letting the market work where the market will work and in those unique circumstances that require it imposing regulations. So, we keep encouraging them to be a deft hand when they're looking at their docket.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your questions.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning, this is [indiscernible (59:38) on for Walter Spracklin. Just want to come back to the competitiveness there in the market. Your growth in grain volumes has remained strong. Is this a factor of the bumper grain crop moving and the export grain you mentioned? Or are there other share factors that might be helping to maintain that growth rate?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, I wouldn't call that a share play. We saw really strong demand for wheat, stronger than we've seen in a while, for export largely to Mexico, as well as good corn movements in the world markets. So, not a share issue, I wouldn't say.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just switching to your OR here. How should we be thinking about the cadence towards an OR improvement over the year? Are there going to be more impactful initiatives that could land in one quarter? Or do you expect it to be a more even pace over the year? Thank you.","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, this is Rob. We don't give guidance by quarter on operating ratio but, as a reminder, we are giving guidance that we expect to improve our operating ratio for the full year. But it never is a straight line. Volumes will dictate largely exactly what that cadence ends up being, but we're very focused on continuing to drive productivity. We talked about the pricing, a component of this being challenged in the first part of the year and hopefully improving later in the year. So, I wouldn't give you any indication that it would be a straight line. It could be lumpy, but the focus is the full year number.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","This quarter is a great example, Rob, where, what'd we have, 1.3 percentage points impact by fuel lag.","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, good point. Fuel can always be a factor in that.","Unknown Speaker","All right. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks and good morning. So, just to follow up on Intermodal, I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but from a directional standpoint do you think domestic Intermodal pricing will still be up this year? And you mentioned competitive pricing pressure in Intermodal, and really what I just want to get a sense for here is I want to understand how much of that is related to domestic Intermodal versus international Intermodal?","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","The domestic and international Intermodal are both under pricing pressure. I would say we saw perhaps an acceleration of the pricing pressure in the domestic Intermodal space in the first quarter. Again, depending on what happens in those markets and what happens as we see the tightening capacity that we expect with electronic log books will really be the things that will determine what ends up happening overall with your pricing for the year.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful, but do you still think there's a possibility for your domestic Intermodal pricing to be up in 2017?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Justin, we don't guide on price specific to commodities.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And then, secondly, I was wondering if you could give some additional color on the assumption you're making for Coal volumes within the full year guidance. What are you assuming for growth in Coal volumes in the second quarter? And just to clarify some of the earlier commentary, were you suggesting that Coal volumes in the back half of the year are likely to be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis?","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","Justin, this is Rob. Let me take a stab at that. And, as you know, we don't give specific precise guidance by commodity for the year, but I would just \u2013 as it relates to Coal. I would just remind you of some of the comments that Beth made earlier, and that is it feels stable to us. The things to watch in Coal, as always, will largely be what's happening with gas prices and what's happening with weather. That will dictate from quarter to quarter what's actually happening with volume.","The other thing we did point out is that we do have an easier comp as we head into the second quarter as it relates to our overall volumes, including Coal, and if you look at our last year numbers, that kind of flips later in the year, the third quarter gets a little more challenging. So, I think I would expect, all things being constant, that you'll see some changes from quarter-to-quarter as it relates to year-over-year volume growth in the Coal line. Again, comps are easier in the second quarter and get challenged in the third quarter, and it feels like a stable environment for us.","Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, great, I'll leave it at that. I appreciate the time.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Thank you, Justin.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your questions.","Zax Rosenberg - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi, this is actually Zax Rosenberg on for Ben. Thanks for taking the question so late here. Just wanted to \u2013 a couple for me. Just wanted to follow up first on the trade questions from before and see if you have any specific thoughts on the proposed lumber tariff from earlier this week and how that potentially impacts your guys business specifically. And then secondly, flipping back over to Intermodal, there was a comment earlier about a volume push ahead of the some of the ocean freight, the carrier lines changes, and just wondering the expected impact of those alliance shifts and maybe possible diversion of ships to Canadian ports or what your thoughts are generally there? Thank you.","Elizabeth F. Whited - Union Pacific Corp.","Okay on the softwood lumber, we really feel like those tariffs were priced in, where you saw a very significant run-up in the lumber prices in the first quarter. So, that doesn't feel like that's going to be impactful in terms of volume to us. And then, on the Intermodal side in terms of the alliances, that is still shaking itself out in terms of port usage and who's calling where and what size of ship and those sorts of things. Right now, it seems to be going pretty well. We're not seeing any significant disruptions. Feels like the process is playing out well.","As you know, there is more capacity coming online in Canada later in the year. I would expect that a large amount of that could be utilized for Canadian shipping needs. So, we're not really expecting to see significant shifts at this point, but we'll have to see how it plays out and it will be wedded with the alliances.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Hey, Zax, going back to your softwood lumber question, what's really critical to us is getting housing starts and construction up. We have a wonderful franchise that kind of regardless of where the wood's coming from, we just need it to be consumed.","Zax Rosenberg - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Brian Adam Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A lot of ground has been covered already. Just curious on the performance on RTMs versus carloads. Obviously, very good performance in RTMs, and also the relative difference in the carloads, presumably like the haul. Just curious should we expect that there's going to be that type of divergence for the remainder of the year or might those kind of come together as we progress through the year?","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah, Brian, this is Rob. That measure, and I kind of made this reference earlier in the Q&A, that RTM impact that you're referring to was largely driven in the first quarter by the upswing in the Coal volumes, and we're not going to give guidance in terms of how that's going to play out for the year because what will drive that is what's the mix of the volume that we, in fact, see come across the book.","Brian Adam Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Right, okay. And actually, this is more of a kind of theoretical-type question. I'm not sure how many specifics you can provide, but just given the discussion around tax and proposals on rates and previously there was discussion on the treatment of deduction on debt interest in the P&L. So, I don't know if you ran these scenarios through and have some thoughts around if they do not allow or they disallow interest tax deductions, might that change the capital allocation policies that you currently have in place?","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Rob, you want to take that?","Robert M. Knight, Jr. - Union Pacific Corp.","Yeah. There's a lot of devil in the details on the tax proposals. We, like everyone, are staying in tuned and watching what happens on that. But, so, yeah, there could be some impact. I wouldn't envision that, depending on how the interest plays out, I wouldn't envision that would change our capital spending or our debt guidance that we've given. I wouldn't envision that that will be the result of any changes as it relates to the interest.","Brian Adam Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got it. All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing comments.","Lance M. Fritz - Union Pacific Corp.","Okay, thank you, Rob, and thank you for your questions and interest in Union Pacific. We look forward to talking with all of you again in July.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you. Mr. Koraleski, you may begin.","John J. Koraleski","Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today here in Omaha are Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer; Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Lance Fritz, our Executive Vice President of Operations.","Well, as you can see, we wrapped up 2013 with another all-time record quarter. Union Pacific achieved our best-ever quarterly earnings of $2.55 per share, an increase of 16% compared to 2012. For the first time in 6 quarters, we reported overall volume growth despite significantly weaker coal shipments. It highlights the strength of our diverse franchise, the extensive network reach we have to various markets and a strong grain harvest. When combined with solid core pricing gains and our continued focus on safety, service and efficiency, we achieved a record fourth quarter operating ratio of 65%, improving more than 2 points compared to 2012.","During the quarter, we battled some extreme winter weather that challenged us on many fronts, but as we said before, running a railroad is an outdoor sport, and we successfully worked through the challenges, managing and realigning our network resources to deliver on our customer commitments.","All in, 2013 was another terrific year for Union Pacific, with our financial performance exceeding all previous milestones. It demonstrates our commitment to delivering safe, efficient, high-quality service that creates value for our customers and increased financial returns for our shareholders.","So to kick us off this morning, I'm going to turn it over to Eric Butler. Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Thanks, Jack, and good morning. In the fourth quarter, volume was up 2% compared to 2012 as the diversity of our franchise provided enough growth opportunities to offset volume declines in 2 of the groups. We had strong gains in Ag, Automotive and Industrial Products, and Intermodal also saw modest volume growth.","This good news offset continued weakness in Coal and a slight decline in Chemicals. Coal price improved 3.5%, which, combined with the benefit from positive mix, produced a 5.5% improvement in average revenue per car. Volume growth and the improved average revenue per car combined to drive freight revenue up nearly 7.5% to an all-time quarterly record of $5.3 billion.","Let's take a closer look at each of the 6 business groups. Ag Products volume grew 13%, which, combined with 5% improvement in average revenue per car, drove revenue growth up 19%. A 41% increase in grain carloadings was driven by a strong harvest as improved yields increased crop production following last year's lower drought-impacted volumes.","With more competitive crop prices and strong global demand, grain export volumes saw significant growth, up more than 90%. The strongest gains were in feed grain shipments to the PNW and Mexico and wheat exports to the Gulf. Also contributing to this growth was increased demand for domestic feed grains.","Grain products volume was up 6%, driven by a 21% increase in ethanol shipments as lower corn prices and increased gasoline consumption led refineries to replenish low ethanol inventories. Shipments of DDGs also grew 19%, driven by stronger export demand, primarily by China.","Food and refrigerated shipments were down 4%. Gains in import beer were offset by declines in sugar volumes, following an unusually strong fourth quarter last year and a continued sugar surplus that reduced imports from Mexico.","Automotive volume grew 10%, which, combined with a 7% improvement in average revenue per car, produced a 17% increase in revenue. The same trends that supported growth throughout the year, replacement demand, low interest rates and favorable financing, continued through the fourth quarter. Aided by moderating fuel prices, demand for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles gained momentum, and the growth rate of the automotive industry outpaced that of the overall economy.","UP finished vehicle shipments grew 7% as sales continued to grow, with the seasonably adjusted annual sales rate reaching $15.9 million in the fourth quarter, the highest quarterly level in 6 years.","Parts volume increased 13%, while pricing gains and the previously announced Pacer network logistics management arrangement increased average revenue per car. We now lapped that arrangement on a year-over-year basis, so we won't see its positive ARC contribution going forward.","Chemicals revenue grew by 3% as a 3% increase in average revenue per car more than offset a 1% decline in volume. Industrial chemicals volume was up 6%, driven by strength in end user markets such as housing and automotive. Increased demand in new business led to a 7% increase in petroleum products and LPG shipments.","Dampening the good news was a 22% decline in crude oil volume compared to the fourth quarter of last year. And increased supply of crude at the Gulf Coast reduced Gulf prices, which led to a decline in shipments from West Texas and Oklahoma. In addition, the discount of Louisiana Light Sweet to Brent displaced some of the Bakken crude shipments away from Texas and Louisiana.","Coal revenue declined 1%. Fourth quarter volume was down 10%, which was mostly offset by a 10% improvement in average revenue per car. You can see from the chart of weekly carloadings that unseasonably early snow impacted shipments from the Southern Powder River Basin in October, with the tonnage down 12% for the fourth quarter. River infrastructure projects and low water levels on the Ohio River curtailed barge traffic at St. Louis, which also reduced shipments. Also contributing to the decline were inventory management initiatives by select utilities and the continued impact of a contract lost from the beginning of the year. Despite growth in West Coast exports, Colorado\/Utah tonnage declined 10% based on soft domestic demand and mine production issues.","Providing some good news, tonnage from other coal-producing regions increased 10% from a relatively small base, driven by gains from Southern Wyoming and other regions.","In Industrial Products, a 9% increase in volume and a 5% increase in average revenue per car produced revenue growth of 14%. Nonmetallic minerals volume was up 28% as continued growth in shale-related drilling, mainly in the Eagle Ford and Permian Basins, increased frac sand shipments by 36%.","Metals volume was up 11%, driven by China-bound iron ore shipments through ports in California and Mexico. We also saw growth in pipe shipments with increased pipeline and drilling activity related to shale energy. Growth in housing and home improvements continued to increase the demand for lumber, with shipments up 6%.","Intermodal revenue was flat in the fourth quarter. Lower fuel surcharge revenue and unfavorable mix led to a 2% decline in average revenue per unit, which offset volume growth of 2%. Our International Intermodal volumes declined 1%, driven by continued market share shifts within the ocean carrier industry and increased port transloading activity. We also saw a greater flow of revenue empty move for international container repositioning, which impacted the overall traffic mix for the quarter. Volume fared better for Domestic Intermodal, where continued success converting highway business to rail drove volume up 5%.","I'll close with a look at how we see our business shaping up for 2014. Our current outlook is for the economy to continue its slow improvement. A diverse franchise provides access to a number of markets with potential growth opportunities. The new crops should provide opportunity for Ag in the first half of the year, with anticipated growth in both domestic and export grain markets. Food and refrigerated is expected to see modest growth.","Automotive manufacturers expect sales growth to continue, and Global Insight has raised its full year light vehicle sales estimate to 16 million vehicles. This should be good news for our finished vehicles and auto parts business.","Crude oil spreads, a growing Gulf crude supply and increased pipeline activity are expected to have a continued impact on our crude-by-rail volumes. Most other chemicals markets should remain solid.","Turning to Coal. The previously mentioned legacy contract loss will impact volumes, but low inventory levels and increased exports should help offset this. Volume growth for the year will depend on weather conditions, economic activity and natural gas prices.","Industrial Products should continue to benefit from shale-related activity, with increased drilling supporting growth in frac sand and pipe shipments. Housing starts are projected to exceed 1 million units for the first time since 2007, which is expected to demand -- drive demand for lumber shipments. Increases in commercial construction are expected to support growth in rock, metals and other highway-related markets.","Highway conversion should continue to drive growth in Domestic Intermodal. International Intermodal may be challenged in the first quarter by a difficult comparison to 2013, but an improving economy and strengthening housing market should keep International Intermodal ahead of last year.","For the full year, our strong value proposition and diverse franchise will, again, support business development efforts across our broad portfolio of business. Across the groups, we'll continue to develop opportunities in Mexico, where our unparalleled ability to link Mexico's economic growth with U.S. origins and destinations is the strength of our franchise. Assuming the economy cooperates, we expect to deliver profitable revenue growth yet again in 2014, driven by modest volume and core pricing gains.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Lance.","Lance M. Fritz","Thanks, Eric, and good morning. I'll start with our safety results. The 2013 reportable personal injury rate was up slightly from our all-time record performance in 2012. Not shown is the number of severe injuries, which declined to a new record low. We focus our attention on risk and severity because these injuries have the greatest human and financial impact. Our goal is for every employee to return home safely after every shift, and we will get there using a robust safety strategy that includes the Courage to Care, Total Safety Culture and risk identification and mitigation.","Moving to rail equipment incidents or derailments. Our full year reportable rate finished up 1% versus 2012. We continue to make progress on human factor incidents through enhanced skills training and root cause resolutions. In addition, we continue to invest in capital to harden our infrastructure and leveraging advanced technologies to find and fix track and equipment defects.","In public safety, our grade-crossing incident rate improved 7% versus 2012, a result of our efforts to improve or close high-risk crossings and to reinforce public awareness. Most encouraging was the 17% improvement on our southern region, which has a higher grade-crossing density than our overall network.","While our reportable rate in both employee and rail equipment safety increased slightly during 2013, the absolute number of incidents, which includes incidents that do not meet the regulatory reportable threshold, declined in both categories.","Our safety strategy helps keep our network strong and resilient, particularly in the face of recent winter weather challenges. Recall that in October, a winter blizzard in Wyoming severely impacted shipments out of the Powder River Basin. In early December, we were hit with the most severe winter weather interruption in the past 7 years. The storm covered 2\/3 of our network and generated a 33% increase in the number of days with major service interruptions during the quarter. As a result, average train speed declined 3% in the fourth quarter compared to 2012 but remained within a solid service range. These weather interruptions also drove a decline in our Service Delivery Index. The metric, which gauges how well we are meeting overall customer commitments, also reflects the tighter service commitments we introduced last year. We continued to provide outstanding local service to our customers with a fourth quarter record 95.5% Industry Spot & Pull, which measures the delivery or pulling of a car to or from a customer. Overall, our network remains well positioned to handle volume growth.","Moving on to network productivity. We continue to leverage existing resources as grain train lengths set a new best-ever quarterly record, while automotive and manifest train lengths set new best-ever fourth quarter records. Intermodal train size dropped, reflecting an increase in new service offerings. We expect these new trains to grow as we convert business from the highway. Other efficiencies included a 2% improvement in locomotive productivity, as measured by gross ton miles per horsepower day, in spite of a 2 to 2.5 point headwind due to the mix shift from lower coal shipments to higher manifest shipments. The improvement reflects a long-term trend of increasing locomotive reliability, as well as effective utilization plans.","We efficiently handled the volume growth across each region of our network, effectively utilizing our workforce. We leveraged growing manifest volumes within UP's existing terminal infrastructure, as reflected by an improvement in car switch per employee day. The improvement was particularly evident in our southern region, where car switch per employee day increased 5%. These productivity gains were generated by our men and women in the field as they leveraged their expertise to improve safety, service and efficiency using the UP Way.","Moving on to our capital investments. We invested nearly $3.6 billion in our network during 2013, with more than $2.1 billion in replacement capital to harden our infrastructure and improve the safety and resiliency of the network. At the end of the year, over 99% of our network was free of slow orders. Spending for service growth and productivity totaled around $1 billion, driven by investments in capacity, commercial facilities and equipment. Major projects included are $400 million investment in our Santa Teresa, New Mexico facility and more than $200 million of capacity work in the South to support our diverse and growing book of business in that region. In addition, we invested another $420 million in Positive Train Control during the year, bringing our cumulative PTC investment to $1.2 billion of our estimated $2 billion projected spend. Although it's unlikely the industry will meet the 2015 deadline, we're making a good-faith effort to do so and are working closely with regulators as we implement this new technology.","For 2014, our plan will likely exceed last year's spending. We'll continue to make capacity investments in our southern region while also advancing capacity projects across other parts of our network. Although some buckets will fluctuate year-over-year, our core investment thesis will not, which is to maintain a safe, strong and resilient network and invest in service growth and productivity projects that meet our aggressive return thresholds.","So in summary, we finished 2013 on a solid note despite the winter weather challenges. As we move through 2014, our focus, above all, will be the safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate. We'll take advantage of growth opportunities by leveraging our network resources. We'll look to make productivity improvements in all areas, utilizing resources more efficiently and investing capital productively. As a result, we'll provide customers with a value proposition that supports growth with high levels of service. We call that moving our business up into the right. All combined, it translates into increased returns for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert M. Knight","Thanks, Lance, and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue grew 7% to an all-time quarterly record of more than $5.6 billion, driven mainly by solid core pricing gains and volume growth.","Operating expense totaled nearly $3.7 billion, increasing 4%. Operating income grew 14% to nearly $2 billion, also hitting a best-ever quarterly mark. Below the line, other income totaled $37 million, down $6 million compared to 2012. Interest expense of $127 million was down slightly compared to the previous year. Income tax expense increased to $709 million, driven by higher pretax earnings and a higher effective tax rate. Net income grew 13% versus 2012, while the outstanding share balance declined 2% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce best-ever quarterly earnings of $2.55 per share, up 16% versus 2012.","Turning to our top line. Freight revenue grew 7.5% to a quarterly record of $5.3 billion, driven by solid core pricing gains of about 3.5%, which included a little over 1 point of legacy repricing. Volume growth of 2% and favorable mix of a couple of points also contributed to the improvement. Growth in longer-haul grain moves and a 5% increase in higher average revenue per car manifest shipments drove the positive mix. These items were partially offset by growth in lower average revenue per unit Intermodal shipments.","Slide 21 provides more detail on our core pricing trends in 2013. For the year, our core pricing gains ranged between 3.5% and 4%. Lost opportunity due to lower coal volumes totaled about 0.5 point for the full year. This slide also shows the quarterly rail inflation escalator, excluding fuel, on a year-over-year basis. As you can see, it drifted into negative territory in the second half of 2013, creating a slight pricing headwind on a portion of our business, which is tied to the escalator. Over the past 5 years, the cost escalator has averaged about 3%, but as we've discussed, we expect 2014 inflation to moderate, negatively impacting our pricing gains but also tempering operating expense increases.","As we've said previously, the more significant impact on our 2014 pricing will be the lack of about 1.5 points of legacy pricing benefit that we saw last year. That said, we remain committed to our strategy of pricing for reinvestability. It's supported by the value we create for our customers and is required to generate the returns needed for continued investment in our franchise.","Moving on to the expense side. Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which increased 7% compared to 2012. Inflationary pressures, volume-related expenses and a mix shift to more manifest traffic drove the increase. In addition, higher overtime and re-crew expenses, driven by severe winter weather, masked overall productivity gains. You also need to take into account the $20 million payroll tax refund included in our 2012 fourth quarter results. Excluding this onetime item, our comp and benefit expense was up about 4.5%.","Workforce levels were flat for the quarter as we leveraged a 2% volume increase with a 1% increase in TE&Y employees. Fewer capital employees offset the TE&Y workforce increase.","As we look at 2014, we expect our comp and benefits expense to grow. However, the extent will be driven by volume levels and business mix. The good news story is our continued productivity initiatives that will help mitigate these increases. In addition, we'll continue to see labor inflation this year, but it will likely moderate to below the 2% mark.","Turning to the next slide. Fuel expense totaled $905 million, decreasing 2% versus 2012, driven by a lower average diesel fuel price. On the flip side, gross ton miles increased 2% in the wake of strong grain shipments, while our fuel consumption rate increased 1% compared to 2012.","Moving on to our other expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense increased 10% to $585 million due to higher locomotive and freight car repair expenses and an increase in joint facility maintenance expense. And we continued to incur management fees associated with the 2012 Pacer agreement, which are recouped in our Automotive freight revenue line. And as Eric mentioned, we've now lapped that contract on a year-over-year basis, so we won't see that variance going forward.","Depreciation expense was $458 million, up 1% compared to 2012. The impact of increased capital spending in recent years was mostly offset by an equipment rate study that went into effect in 2013. For 2014, we expect depreciation expense to increase at a more normalized rate, likely in the 6% to 7% range. This range includes about $80 million of depreciation expense associated with Positive Train Control capital investments. I'll talk more about PTC in a minute.","Slide 25 summarizes the remaining 2 expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $311 million, up 3% compared to 2012. Increased container expenses associated with the Pacer contract and growth in Agricultural and Automotive shipments mainly drove higher freight car rental expense. Other expenses came in at $188 million, up $6 million versus last year. Higher property taxes and freight and equipment damage costs drove expenses up compared to 2012. A reduction in personnel injury expense and effective cost control measures partially offset these increases. For 2014, we expect the Other expense line to increase between 5% and 10% for the full year, excluding any unusual items.","Turning to our operating ratio performance. Our focus on pricing the business right and moving it efficiently continues to pay off. We achieved a record fourth quarter operating ratio of 65%, improving 2.1 points compared to 2012.","On a full year basis, we also made tremendous strides by generating a best-ever operating ratio of 66.1%. It clearly illustrates the strength and value proposition of the Union Pacific franchise. We've talked about our focus on continued core pricing and productivity gains and leveraging what we see as modest volume growth over our planning horizon.","On the cost side, it's a matter of effectively managing inflationary pressures in addition to other cost hurdles that we have every year. For example, operating taxes that we pay will continue to increase as our profitability grows. Depreciation expense is another item that will continue to increase, assuming a growing capital spend. And as we've discussed, depreciation and other operating expenses will be driven higher by shorter-life Positive Train Control assets and maintenance costs as we move further into that project.","Despite these obstacles, we feel very good about our prospects of now achieving our sub-65% operating ratio before 2017. Exactly how much sooner before 2017 will depend on the usual drivers: economic growth, fuel prices, inflationary hurdles, just to name a few. That said, we're equally focused on cash generation and improving our overall financial returns.","Slide 27 provides a summary of our 2013 earnings with a full year income statement. I'll walk through a few of the highlights from our record-setting year. Operating revenue grew more than $1 billion to an all-time record of nearly $22 billion. Operating income also set a new best-ever mark of $7.4 billion, topping 2012 's record by 10%. And net income of $4.4 billion and earnings of $9.42 per share also set new full year records.","Overall, one of the key measures for our performance is the cash that we generate. In 2013, cash from operations increased to $6.8 billion, up 11% compared to 2012. After $3.5 billion in cash capital investments and $1.3 billion of dividend payments, our free cash flow totaled nearly $2.1 billion, being the first rail to surpass the $2 billion mark in our industry's history.","Taking a closer look at 2014, we will not see the benefit of bonus depreciation. In fact, we'll see a headwind to free cash flow of about $400 million due to tax payments associated with prior year programs. However, we don't expect this to impact our cash allocation strategy or our ability to grow shareholder returns.","Slide 29 shows our 2013 all-in capital investment of $3.6 billion. It's a bit higher than our cash capital due to capital leasing activity and other noncash capital items. In 2014, we expect to increase our capital spending from 2013's levels, pending final approval from our Board of Directors in February. The chart on the right reflects our achievements in generating returns on these investments. Return on invested capital was a record 14.7% in 2013, up 0.7 point from 2012. If you calculate it on a replacement basis, our return shrinks to about half that number. Returns must continue to improve to support asset replacement costs and investments required to achieve our safety, service and growth initiatives.","Beyond funding our capital commitments, our record profitability and strong cash generation have enabled us to grow shareholder returns. After increasing our quarterly dividend per share 15% in 2012, we raised it an additional 14.5% last year. For 2013, we achieved a payout ratio of 31.5%, up from 30% in 2012. We're making good progress in moving up within our targeted payout range of 30% to 35%.","In addition, we continue to make opportunistic share repurchases, which play an important role in our balanced approach in cash allocation. In the fourth quarter, we bought back more than 4.9 million shares totaling $786 million. Full year purchases topped more than 14.5 million shares totaling over $2.2 billion, up 50% from 2012. Our new repurchase authorization of up to 60 million shares over a 4-year time period went into effect January 1 of this year. Combining dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned over $3.5 billion to our shareholders in 2013. It represents a 36% increase over 2012, clearly demonstrating our commitment to increasing shareholder value.","Our balance sheet remains strong, supporting our ongoing commitment to a solid investment-grade credit rating. Continued growth in earnings and cash flow has improved our 2013 year-end debt-to-cap ratio to roughly 38% and our debt-to-EBITDA to just under 1.4x, even with the addition of nearly $600 million of balance sheet debt since last year. As we've said, these metrics are a little lower than where we believe they need to be. We are targeting about 1.5x and around a 40% for year-end 2014, which is closer to the low 40s target range that we've previously discussed. Our $1 billion debt issuance earlier this month was a good step in that direction.","So that's a recap of our fourth quarter and full year results. As we focus on 2014, we're projecting another record financial year if the economy cooperates. In addition to our pricing initiatives and ongoing productivity gains, volume leverage opportunities should also help drive continued margin improvement. And as Eric just highlighted, we have growth opportunities across a variety of market sectors that should drive modest volume growth for the full year. First quarter volumes also are expected to be on the positive side of the ledger, driven by continued strong growth in grain shipments, cross-border traffic with Mexico and various other industrial-related moves.","Our Coal business is a little more difficult to predict. The lost legacy business creates about a 2% headwind on our Coal volumes in 2014. But as always, weather and the economy will be the driving factors for our Coal business this year.","We feel very good about our outlook as we move forward. Our fundamentals are strong, supported by a diverse franchise that allows us to pursue new, attractive market opportunities. We'll continue to move the ball forward, focusing on improved returns to support capital investments that will strengthen and enhance our network, create value for our customers and drive increased returns for our shareholders.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Jack.","John J. Koraleski","Thanks, Rob. So as we look at 2014, we see the economy is slowly strengthening. We're well positioned for economic growth and are confident in our ability to deliver on our customers' growing transportation needs. Excellent service is key to our future success. It supports our pricing initiatives and improves network and asset utilization. It also demonstrates the power of our value proposition to new customers that are looking for viable transportation alternatives.","Our capital investment strategy will be another key part of UP's success going forward. We are making investments today, building the capacity that we need for tomorrow. Longer term, we remain bullish on our future prospects. We'll continue our unrelenting focus on both safety and service to our customers. We strongly believe in the power and the potential of the Union Pacific franchise to drive even greater financial performance and shareholder returns in the years to come.","So with that, let's open it up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to see if you could give a little more flavor on the Coal outlook. I know you've got this 2 percentage point headwind from the lost contract, but it just seems like we're having pretty favorable weather impact in terms of the cold winter. You said some of your customers had already taken actions to reduce inventories. So maybe if you can give us a comment on where inventories are and whether you've seen some signs that maybe customers are looking to take more coal, given what appears to be a little better weather pattern.","John J. Koraleski","Sure. Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Tom, as you know, our Coal volumes are really driven by economic activity, both on the industrial side and the consumer side. Certainly, weather patterns, particularly Coal, particularly hot weather, will drive that. Natural gas prices will drive that. If you look at the last 30 days, certainly, those items seem to suggest a stronger coal outlook. But as you know, all of those items could move around month to month, quarter to quarter. And overall, coal market share still is hanging in there, around 39%. It's been pretty, pretty static. So the outlook drivers will be exactly what we said: economic activity, weather patterns, natural gas prices. And we -- I'm not sure we have any special ability to predict that better than anybody else.","John J. Koraleski","And the latest numbers, the 10 days is from, what, November? Down 10 days, Southern Powder River Basin. So it'll be interesting to see how the December numbers play out.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So where do you -- Jack, where do you think stockpiles are right now? Are they below...","John J. Koraleski","Tom, the last report we saw was November data that said Southern Powder River Basin stockpiles were down about 10 days. So it's somewhere around -- so that would put it somewhere around 60 days.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And that's pretty close to target?","John J. Koraleski","It's actually a little bit below target for this time of the year.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A little bit below target, okay. And then the follow-up question, it seems like you've had some recent favorable data points from a couple of truckload carriers. It feels like that market is improving and maybe tightening a little bit. If you look at the velocity numbers for your primary rail competitor for Burlington Northern, it seems like they've had some challenges maybe with capacity, that their velocity has been down. And it feels like you're maybe shaping up to have a cyclical or capacity-driven improvement in pricing as you look into 2014. I guess that assumes the economy improves. I was wondering if you could offer a thought if that's a reasonable way to look at it, that pricing might improve if you see the economy develops a momentum.","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","Tom, as you said, it feels like the economy is slowly strengthening. And our competitor that you made reference to, they're a good company. Certainly, we all have had challenges in the past, and we assume they'll work through those. Our focus is really on driving our business development opportunities. We have a great service value proposition. We're growing our business development, as we said. Our Domestic Intermodal, I think this is the fifth record year for Domestic Intermodal. So we feel -- we continue to feel pretty good about our outlook and our opportunities in that space.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I'm just thinking about the long-term guidance and the sub-65% OR by 2017. And we had a pretty good year this year with the economy. You guys had a record year in terms of your earnings and results. And we improved our operating ratio by 170 basis points or so. I mean, just extrapolating, you had Coal down 9% this year. If Coal is slightly better than that, besides the fact that you've got this headwind from the legacy side, what else makes you hesitant to say, yes, we can probably, at least, hit that 65% target next year? I mean, from my standpoint, that guidance feels wildly conservative, and I'm trying to figure out what the X factor is. I mean, to me, it's Coal because you've got that double-levered impact from a pricing standpoint. But if I have to think about the bias, it feels like it's still a positive there. So when you're sitting down and putting pen to paper on that, how are you guys thinking about that?","John J. Koraleski","Okay. Rob, why don't you take a shot at that?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. So as you've heard me say many, many times, we're not going to slow down to get to the target at a later date and time. And I hope you're right with everything you've said, that we're going to get there as efficiently and aggressively as we can, as we have over the last milestones that we've set. And as I cautioned, things that we are mindful of are mix impacts driven by the economy, weather, fuel. Those are all factors that go into it, so we'll see how it all plays out. And I hope you're right, and we're certainly going to take advantage and leverage every opportunity we have to get there as efficiently and as soon as we can.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Fair enough. When it comes to the share buybacks and the pace, I mean, obviously, 60 million shares, nice amount of capital to potentially deploy there. I think you guys laid out some slightly more aggressive balance sheet goals for this year.","How confident do you feel around getting to those balance sheet targets? And when I think about the potential for going past those, are those hard stops? Or is that kind of fungible based on what you're seeing from the environment, and obviously those ratios move with what your capital looks like? So I'm trying to get a sense of that.","John J. Koraleski","Go ahead, Rob.","Robert M. Knight","Yes. Justin, I mean, also as you've heard us say many times, I mean, we are going to continue to be opportunistic in our share buybacks. I think you saw that in the fourth quarter, where the pace was quite strong. I think our 60 million over a 4-year period new program shows our confidence over the long term. It all starts with generating the cash on the front end. And that's -- our primary focus is to do that to enable us to continue to have the opportunities to invest in the business where it makes sense, where the returns are there, continue to raise the dividend and continue to have an aggressive buyback program. In terms of the targets, I've said many times, it's not how we initially build it, but we're kind of looking at that low 40s debt-to-cap range. And there's no hard number there, but that low 40s feels good to us and we plan on moving in that direction.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Group.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","With respect to Crude-by-Rail, obviously, we've seen Bakken and West Texas move falling off here. But as we think about 2014 and volume growth in crude, are you expecting some year-over-year growth, given that you do have exposure to areas like the Niobrara and the Uinta, and that in addition to some origination and destination facilities coming online to use -- support some of the heavy Canadian crude moving down to the Gulf. So I was wondering if you could opine on that.","John J. Koraleski","Sure. Eric?","Eric L. Butler","So Allison, as we've said before, the core part of our strategy is, as you suggest, strengthening destination facilities, identifying places where crude can land, identifying places where we could strengthen originations, whether with rail partners or on our own accord. So that's a core part of our strategy. We're going to continue to do that. In some parts of the country, there are clearly lots of environmental and other processes that you have to go through to get new facilities up and running. And so there probably are not a significant number of new facilities that will physically be coming online in 2014, but that is a core part of our strategy to basically strengthen facilities. Having said that, we acknowledge and recognize that, really, where and when and how crude flows between the various shale plays and the various destination regions really are fundamentally going to be driven by the market and spreads. And we have probably no greater ability to predict that than anyone else.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So it's a little bit unclear at this point whether or not you'll see volume growth this year? Is that fair?","John J. Koraleski","We're going to have to just wait and see as we look at what happens to the spreads in the market. We're excited. There's a couple of California destinations that are supposed to come online. We have to wait and see how that is going to play out in terms of the permitting process, as Eric said. There's a lot of moving parts to this one so...","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. On the Intermodal side, can you give us a sense of how much of a volume uplift that you might see on the domestic side from the opening of the Santa Teresa facility and some of the new services that you recently announced with Ferromex going to Chicago and then the service from Laredo to Memphis? How much do you think that this could add to volume growth?","John J. Koraleski","Well, Allison, we're probably not going to give you the number you're looking for. We're not going to give guidance specifically on it, but we're pretty excited about opening the facility. The Intermodal piece will open around April 1. So we'll transfer our current El Paso book of business over. And we've already started the marketing and the development efforts, the business development efforts in Northern Mexico, the maquiladoras regions of Mexico and those places to start bringing product online. We're seeing nice growth in our Eagle Premium Service and our service from Laredo into the Southeast. And we think that's going to continue to help us develop and fill out our Intermodal franchise in 2014. Eric, do have anything else to add to that?","Eric L. Butler","No, that's it. As you said, we're excited about it. We think we got a great franchise and we're excited about the opportunities.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","So for you, Rob, I just want to make sure, did I hear you right that, excluding legacy, the core price got a little bit better in fourth quarter? I just wasn't sure I heard that right. And then when I think about mix, so a real nice mix helped in the fourth quarter, how much of that do you think is grain? And if a lot of it is grain, should we think about that mix health continuing for the first, I'd say, 2 or 3 quarters of '14?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. Scott, just I think the way to look at the legacy, I wouldn't read too much into that. I think there was about 1.5 point impact throughout the year of 2013. So that's probably a safe number to continue to think about. In terms of mix, Scott, as you know, it's difficult, and we don't give guidance on mix. But if strong long-haul grain shipments are stronger this year, which -- certainly, that'd be a plus. That in and of itself will have a positive impact on mix. There are other moving parts, as you know. But it's why we shy away from giving mix guidance because there are so many moving parts, but that would be a net positive.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then I want to take Justin's question and focus it maybe a little bit more on 2014 and, Rob, your margin view. So I think we all get less legacy this year but to Justin's point, kind of Coal should be certainly not down 9% and hopefully positive. You talked about less cost inflation. Just directionally, are there other things we should be thinking about why margins improvement in '14 can't be similar to what we saw in '13? Or do you think the lack of legacy is just so powerful that, that affects an unreasonable expectation?","Robert M. Knight","No. Scott, actually, we're not -- what I'm just saying is that there's a lot -- the same moving parts that we've had for the last 10 years, we're going to have those same moving parts as we look forward. And that's going to be the economy, the impact of fuel, the impact of mix on our business, so the higher depreciation rates that I guided you. Those are all factors. But don't read that to think that we kind of lost our enthusiasm to continue to move the ball forward on being aggressive in improving our margins, and we hope stars are aligned and we hope to be able to leverage each of those opportunities as we continue to make progress.","John J. Koraleski","I would also just call to everybody's attention that we've just proven in the last 2 years the impact weather can have on the grain harvest. And it can be pretty dramatic from year to year. So again, all of those things kind of enter the picture.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe just picking up on thoughts around the buyback. When you think about 2014 or I guess the next couple of quarters, is there any sort of major puts or takes we should be thinking about that would potentially lead to an acceleration or a deceleration on the pace of purchases versus where you were in the fourth quarter, I guess, with some of your targets about '14? I just want to get a rough sense if that's where the right run rate to be thinking about over the course of the next year or so.","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Chris, no. I mean, as you've heard me say many times, we've been reluctant to give any kind of a run rate or guidance on that. We'll -- the common theme will be we will continue to generate a strong cash position as we can and we will continue to be opportunistic in our share buybacks.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. But no real sort of thinking dynamic, it's just going to be an opportunistic type of decision on that?","Robert M. Knight","Yes.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then Eric, a quick question for you. Just when you think about the International Intermodal, I know there's been some sort of -- there's been port changes among some of your customers. And so when I think about that in '14, do you have a point in sort of the second quarter or so when you begin to lap some of those differences, where you start to see some of that international volume pick back up just on the back of easier comps?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. As we said we're going to have some difficult comps in the first quarter, just because first quarter '13 was so strong for us. As you know, steamship carriers are constantly looking at ports, and the ports that we have access to are still a strong part of their portfolio. There will be economic drivers, but we don't think that there's any particular specific port-driven drivers that you'll see that will change the volume outlook in the latter half of the year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Lance, I want to ask you a question. With expectations for volume growth here for the first time in about 2.5 years, does that make the efficiency opportunity that more easy to capture? Or does it drive some complications with adding capacity and adding workforce to handle the new volume?","Lance M. Fritz","Well, thanks for the question. We love volume growth. It does present opportunities for generating productivity, both in network yards and on line road and train size, many other areas. We are well prepared for it. I wouldn't categorize capital investment as a challenge. I'd categorize that as another opportunity and one that we love to embrace. Because right now, we're generating pretty attractive returns on those investments. So we're in pretty good shape for the growth that we see coming forward.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So is it possible that with the expansion this year, the efficiencies are even more visible?","Lance M. Fritz","I wouldn't say that. I don't think we can commit to that. I think we can commit to what Rob has said, which is we pursue productivity regardless of the environment. And our track record is such that we generate productivity.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And Rob, I want to follow up on that, too. With compensation and benefits, you did say you're going to have lower inflation hurdles this year. Can we talk about some of the drivers from a headcount perspective and then inflation perspective for that line?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. Let me start with the expected employment numbers. I mean, that, as we've always said, will depend on what volume is. We would expect that if volume increases, our overall headcount will increase but not 1:1 because, obviously, there is productivity that we're able to achieve. And that excludes any capital headcount as sort of our -- to run our railroad. On the inflation side, yes, as I pointed out in my comments, we do expect 2014 inflationary pressures to moderate. We see that on the labor line at around 2% or so, all in, driven by some health and welfare positive news in our overall inflation expectations. And pension is part of that.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jack, maybe just your thoughts on returns and the Surface Transportation Board, particularly with 2 relatively new commissioners, your thoughts on being the top rail returns, generating the highest returns relative to their cost formula. Your needs on replacement rate returns now given Moby's [ph] retirement. Maybe you can just kind of give some thoughts on that.","John J. Koraleski","Sure, Ken. You know what, we're looking at this as an opportunity. We'll certainly do everything we can to help educate the new members and make sure that they understand the dynamics. It has taken us a long time for not only Union Pacific but other railroads to get to a revenue adequacy point of view. And when you get there, that's not the end of the game, that's not the goal, because the whole issue of replacement cost still has to be dealt with. It still has to be brought into the picture. And so, therefore, as we look at it, we're not afraid of it. We're ready to engage and we don't see at this point in time any negative consequences of changing out the STB members.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just similarly, maybe it's more for Eric, but on all the comments on the -- noting the economy is accelerating, I guess, where do you see it hitting in terms of volumes and relative, I guess, specifically, or maybe it's a Lance question, on how much capacity you see in the network right now?","John J. Koraleski","I think we're going to just leave it, Ken, with Rob's comment, which was we expect volumes to be positive this year. And how positive is really going to depend -- we're sitting here on January 23. There's a lot of year to play out. So we'll see. We are optimistic at this point in time that the economy does appear to be strengthening as we go forward. We like the prospects of having a strong grain harvest to kick the year off for us and hope that the second half is just as good. We're watching the coal burn just like you guys all are in terms of what's happening on the weather conditions and the economy activity to drive further consumption and the natural gas prices. So there's a lot of things right now. And if we can go through the year without a lot of government interference from debt ceilings and budget bills and those kinds of things, we could have a fairly decent year. But we're certainly not afraid of the volume in any shape or form.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a technical question, if I can. When does the Coal contract comp against itself, the lost contract? Is that the end of 1Q?","Robert M. Knight","Start of the year, Ken.","Operator","The next question is from the line of William Greene of Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm curious on pricing, if we can come back to that. And if we look at your outlook for the economy, how long in your experience in the past has it been before strong volume, strong economy, tighter markets start to allow the rail market to price up? We've obviously had all that legacy business. But just more from an underlying organic pricing standpoint, how long does that take typically?","John J. Koraleski","Overall, Bill, we're not going to get much into a discussion on pricing here. I will just tell you that as we look across our markets, at all times, every market is different. So the pricing opportunities ebb and flow with each individual markets. And I don't know. Eric, do you have any other insight?","Eric L. Butler","No. I would just say what Rob is continually said in the past. As we reported price, the majority of our price has been on legacy pricing. So I don't think it's an assumption that [indiscernible]","John J. Koraleski","We'll watch each market carefully. And our goal is always to price to market.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you remind us the percent of business that's tied to RCAF?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Bill, for competitive reasons, we don't share that number. It's a fraction of our business. It's certainly not the majority, but that's a piece of information that we have not publicly shared.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then just one last detail question on weather in the first quarter. I know we don't typically sort of break it out. You operate outdoors, obviously. But given what you've seen so far, is it going to be a material impact in the first quarter based on what you know today?","John J. Koraleski","Not the first 23 days. It depends on what happens tomorrow.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So 24 days and we got it. That's it.","John J. Koraleski","24 days, and we'll see what happens on day 25.","Operator","Our next question is from David Vernon, Bernstein Research.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Eric, a question for you on safety regulations with respect to crude. Obviously, if you get more stringent tank car standards, you might see a volume impact. But I was wondering how you might think that would impact your ability to price. Because presumably, oil spreads have widened a little bit and some capacity was taken out of the system, and maybe you could get a little opportunity to price that business a little more. Is that the right way to think about it? Or how have you guys been thinking about it?","Eric L. Butler","David, I'm going to let Lance talk about kind of the safety-related issues. But as we say, we really don't talk publicly about pricing strategies. We would assume that if there's a safety mandate that has a higher cost or price car associated with it that would be reflected in the supply chain, associated with moving crude by rail.","Lance M. Fritz","And I'm not sure that there was a question in there on safety and crude-by-rail.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Well, I mean, I guess, would you think that some of the regulations would pull some capacity out of the crude-by-rail marketplace?","Lance M. Fritz","I don't think we can comment on that. The things that are being discussed are the tank car standards that's really driven by the DOT and PHMSA. We already treat crude oil trains in a fashion that's over and above what's required by regs in terms of keeping our communities safe. So I don't think I'd comment on that.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then, Eric, maybe just a quick follow-up on Automotive. Given the sourcing shift towards Mexico and your greater share of that market, is it right to think that the volume could be a little bit better than light vehicle sales on an ongoing basis? Or how long do you think you might be able to keep that better than light vehicle sale growth in volumes for Automotive going?","Eric L. Butler","So in terms of the Mexican automotive -- the Mexico manufacturing automotive market, there are a lot of new facilities coming online in the next several years, which will grow the production in Mexico from roughly 3 million vehicles a year today to 4 million vehicles a year, if you go out several years from now. We, with our franchise, continue to expect to get our fair share of that in terms of shipping those vehicles to market. But those -- whatever vehicles are manufactured in Mexico will, of necessity, have to displace vehicles manufactured elsewhere, unless the total sales number is going up.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","All right. And do you think you guys might get a little bit better share of that if it was like an Eastern facility moving down South or Canadian facility moving south?","Eric L. Butler","I'm not quite sure of the question. But clearly, as sales increase for the industry, given our strong Mexico franchise, we expect to get our fair share of that growth.","Operator","Our next question is from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'm just going to follow up here on price. I just wanted to check if my math is right here. If I just average out your core pricing or the -- over the year, you're about 3.75%. You said about 1.5 of that is due to legacy. So if we strip that out, you're down to about 2.25. You indicated that lower inflation would pressure the average price down. So if I exclude fuel surcharge and exclude mix, are we looking at below 2% core price for next year? Is my math correct there in interpreting what you said? Is there something I'm missing there?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. Walter, as you know, we don't give pricing guidance. So we're not getting -- other than that we're focused on it. We price per value. We're confident in our ability to get reinvestable pricing and above inflation. We also commented that we don't -- won't get the turbocharge, if you will, over 1.5 on legacy and that we will feel a little bit of pressure on the moderating inflationary pressures for those contracts that are -- have that index. Beyond that, we haven't given commentary on our pricing, other than to say that we're going to continue to provide a good safe service to our customers and continue to look for opportunities to price to value and then continue to achieve core pricing in our business.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Just sticking on pricing here on the yields side with Ag. Obviously, as the volume is coming back, it is affecting your average yield. Is the fourth quarter rate, whether we use it on a per carload basis or -- should it continue to move? Or is that fourth quarter rate a fairly decent rate to use for -- as we look at 2014?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","No. Certainly, as we are continuing out the crop year, which kind of goes through the mid part of the second quarter, you would probably see similar trends as what we've seen in the fourth quarter. The further out that should look, it certainly depends on the crop year for next year. The weather and the size of the crop that should get beyond that.","Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, got it. Okay. And just a technical question perhaps for Lance. Headcount, how do you see that evolving? Is that something that changes directly with volume? Or do you see some synergy opportunities here that you can maybe move headcount a little less than volume this year?","Lance M. Fritz","Yes. Our intent is to always move headcount less than the growth rates and volume, and that's what we'd anticipate doing.","Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Is flat a good number to put in for now? Or...","Lance M. Fritz","We won't make any...","John J. Koraleski","I hope not. I hope we grow more than that.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Justin Long of Stephens.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","When you gave your long-term OR guidance, you talked about averaging about 50% incremental margins along the way. The last 2 years, we've been well above that level. Clearly, a big piece of this is due to the top line growth being more driven -- or driven more by RPU, as volumes have been slightly down. But headed into the next couple of years, if we see volumes start to drive a larger percentage of your top line growth, is it fair to say we see incremental margins trend closer to that 50% or maybe even a little bit below?","Robert M. Knight","Justin, all those are factors -- this is Rob. All of those are factors that go into what it ultimately would be. But I haven't changed our view in terms of needing to achieve as this kind of a rough target, that 50% incremental margin on our growth as we look forward. So how we get there will depend on mix, will depend on fuel prices, will depend on a lot of things. But that's still our focus.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about Intermodal pricing and your expectations to -- in 2014. Do you think we could see an acceleration versus the trends we've seen in the last year? Or is your expectation that it continues to be a pretty competitive pricing environment?","Robert M. Knight","No. So from an industry standpoint, I'm not making any reference to UP, but from an industry standpoint, it's still a competitive industry. The international intermodal industry has surplus capacity with all the steamship carriers coming on. The domestic intermodal industry, it's a huge opportunity but you've got a lot of effective competitors. It is a competitive environment.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And do you think that XPO's acquisition of Pacer will have any impact on your business? And overall, as you look at your IMC partners, is there a possibility we'll see any changes or shifts in the next year or 2?","Robert M. Knight","XPO's acquisition of Pacer, from our perspective, we think is a good deal for XPO and Pacer and our business relationships with them. And we expect that to be positive for us. In terms of the other IMCs in the industry, there's always a lot of moving parts. Our approach is to have business relationships with the wide swath of the IMCs, and we'll continue to do that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Matt Troy with Susquehanna Financial.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","A question for Rob, just one, specifically as it relates to Mexico. I know the focus historically has been on Intermodal and Automotive, when we go to the talking points on growth. But you obviously have a movement afoot down there legislatively to open up natural resource extraction opportunities to foreign investment. You're on the board of the venture down there. I was wondering, Rob, if you could just give us an update on the legislative pathway down there, perhaps the commercial opportunity in energy transporter with Mexico. And realistically, what kind of time frame we might start to think about as that develops into a real viable commercial opportunity for UP?","Robert M. Knight","Matt, Jack and I are both on the FXE board in it for those of you who may not be as close to it, we have -- we own 26% of interest. I think everybody's excited about what's happening down in Mexico on multiple fronts but specifically to the energy reform. I think there probably are a lot of bases yet to be tagged and a lot of progress yet to be made. So I don't think it's necessarily a this-year kind of activity. But it's probably several years out yet before you actually see it start to take hold. But nonetheless, it's a great opportunity for us and our partner.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim, Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","How much did your cross-border traffic grow last year?","John J. Koraleski","Eric?","Eric L. Butler","I don't have the exact number off the top of my head, but I believe it was about 10%.","John J. Koraleski","10% first year, over $2 billion of revenue.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then as that traffic grows, what impact is it going to have on length of haul and to average intermodal ARPUs?","Eric L. Butler","We measure length of haul from the border. So I don't think it will have a material impact in terms of on length of haul metrics.","Robert M. Knight","Matt, that 10% growth, by the way, was in the fourth quarter, just to be clear.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just the last follow-up on that. Can you give us a sense of the incremental margin from cross-border versus the overall franchise?","Robert M. Knight","Matt, this is Rob. Yes, we don't break that out that way. I mean, it's good business for us, and I wouldn't look at it as materially different from our base business, but that's something we don't break it out that way.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research","I wanted to ask one on the International Intermodal business. It looks like we'll get some carrier consolidation this year with the new alliance, potentially a big merger. What, if anything, do you think that means for the business in general and your franchise specifically?","Eric L. Butler","As I was saying, our assessment is that there's a significant overcapacity in the steamship industry today and short of worldwide improvement in industrial production that consumes that capacity they'll need to have something done to absorb that capacity. So there are a lot of conversations going on, as you mentioned. I'm not sure we have any particular insight or perspective beyond what's out there in the marketplace.","Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities Equity Research","Okay. And then one question on operations. For most of 2013, your growth was very biased towards your Southern region and to manifest traffic in particular. So that was a challenge that you were dealing with. Does that trend persist in 2014? Or is that dynamic starting to level out a little bit?","John J. Koraleski","I don't think we comment on where exactly volume's going. But I will say that the South has done a stellar job stepping up to that volume increase. And actually, I would welcome continuing to see that trend. It would leverage the capital investment we've been putting down there and leverage the process improvements that our team has put in place. I'm really pretty excited about that.","Operator","The next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Question for Rob. We were wondering if you had a message embedded in your use of the phrase \"pricing for reinvestability\" instead of the phrase that perhaps has been used more historically, \"inflation plus pricing.\" Is there a nuanced meaning to that?","Robert M. Knight","No, John. In fact, I've used that terminology actually for several years. Basically, what we're saying is at a minimum, something has to be able to be priced at a reinvestable level. We price to market, and we're confident we add it all up if that's above inflation.","John J. Koraleski","Yes. Our long-term goal, John, we started this a long time ago, is to say that every carload of freight that moves on the Union Pacific meets our reinvestability threshold. So that's kind of like an entry-level as we look at pricing opportunities. And that's why in some cases, our volume growth hasn't been quite as strong because we're being relatively selective in terms of what business does move on our franchise.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then just as a follow-on perhaps for Lance. As you've gotten deeper into the PTC project, I know initially there were thoughts that there weren't a lot of economic benefits associated with it. But as you've gotten deeper into it, do you think there are some operational improvements that could be driven out of the data and capabilities that will be embedded in the PTC system once it's fully operational?","Lance M. Fritz","So John, this is how we think about PTC: The first is I'm very proud of our team and our industry for driving that project to a point where now I can see, I believe, it's going to be successful and we're going to have put in place a significant -- maybe the industry's most significant technological advancement in a very short -- relatively short period of time. All PTC does is overlay on your existing system and stop trains for 4 reasons. So PTC on its own and the technology that we're investing right now on its own does not enhance operations. It is a safety enhancement, and I applaud that. Having said that also, the technology that's embedded in PTC might form a foundation for future investments that could be helpful, but that's over and above the investments that we're making right now, and they'll have to be justified by that return.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Rob mentioned fuel as a potential speed bump on the path to the OR target. But are there still any major fuel efficiency levers and reserve, like broader distributed power or more full implementation of throttle technology?","John J. Koraleski","Lance?","Lance M. Fritz","Sure. Could you repeat that question please for me?","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Sure, Lance. I guess, I'm asking, given the importance of fuel, are there still major levers to pull, like broader implementation of throttle technology or more use of distributed power?","Lance M. Fritz","Yes, absolutely, there are. We're pretty deeply penetrated on DPU. But every unit that we buy is DPU-equipped. And so we'll continue to be able to penetrate parts of our network and train service that aren't currently DPU-ed. So that's always a benefit and a plus. And in terms of other technologies, we are actually deploying 2 different types of technology that will benefit in fuel consumption rate across the network. We're doing that in a measured fashion, testing it and highlighting it in certain areas first, but I see that we've got a lot of leverage we can continue to pull on fuel -- fuel consumption rate.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And following up on that. If you do improve fuel economy, do you have to in effect give some of this back via, say, reduced fuel surcharges?","John J. Koraleski","If you look at what we're going to do, Keith, we're going to invest in the economics. And we need to have a return on that in order to justify and pay for the investment that we're making in that. So at this point in time, we're not looking at changing any of our fuel. Basically, our fuel surcharge situation is designed to recover changes in fuel cost, and it will continue to be that way.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","My questions have been answered, but let me just ask one quick one. Pension expense, if you hit this, I know it will be lower, but can you just discuss what's changed and how much lower?","John J. Koraleski","Rob?","Robert M. Knight","Yes. Higher returns and higher interest rates are driving a lower expected expense is what -- are the big drivers this year.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Right, but did you identify how much lower?","Robert M. Knight","I did not.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Are you willing to?","Robert M. Knight","Maybe in the neighborhood of $30-plus million delta.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. So helpful, not material.","Operator","Our final question is from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wondered, could you provide some context to what the volume growth looked like for the UPDS and streamline products in the fourth quarter and possibly provide some perspective as to what that volume comprises in the Intermodal segment in 2013?","Eric L. Butler","Yes. I don't think we historically break that out, but those are good vehicles for us to grow our business. We have a great business development focus, and both of those are and continue to grow nicely for our business.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then maybe as we a look into 2014 and think about container growth of your controlled fleet, can you provide a number for where we are in -- or we ended 2013 from a controlled container fleet perspective and what the growth expectation for 2014 will be?","Eric L. Butler","Are you talking about the size of the fleet?","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, the [indiscernible] and new [ph] mix.","Eric L. Butler","We historically have not discussed publicly the total size of our fleet. We do think that those strategies of an owned fleet are the right strategy.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President, and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you, Mr. Fritz. You may begin.","Lance Fritz","Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Chief Marketing Officer; Cameron Scott, Chief Operating Officer; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of nearly $1 billion for the second quarter of 2016. This equates to $1.17 per share, which compares to $1.38 in the second quarter of 2015.","Total volume decreased 11% in the quarter compared to 2015. Carload volume declined in five of our six commodity groups, with coal, Intermodal and industrial products all down double-digits. Agricultural products was the only group to show positive year-over-year growth, with volumes up 2% this quarter, reflecting stronger grain shipments versus 2015.","The quarterly operating ratio came in at 65.2%, up 1.1 percentage points from the second quarter last year. As positive core price and continued productivity improvements helped to somewhat offset the double-digit increase -- decrease in total volumes.","While the second quarter was again challenging from a volume perspective, we continued focusing on initiatives that are squarely in our control, such as being productive with our resources, providing our customers with excellent service, and improving our safety performance.","Our team will give you more of the details, starting with Eric.","Eric Butler","Thanks, Lance, and good morning. In the second quarter, our volume was down 11% with gains in Ag products more than offset by declines in each of the other business groups. Our volume sequentially improved through the quarter, with volumes down 15% in April and 6% in June.","While we generated core pricing gains of 2%, it was not enough to offset decreased fuel surcharges, average revenue per car declined 2% in the quarter. Overall, the decline in volume and lower average revenue per car drove a 13% reduction in freight revenue.","Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups. Ag products revenue was down 3% on a 2% volume increase and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car. Grain volume increased 10%, primarily due to stronger than expected export volumes, driven by South American harvest delays and strong corn demand to Mexico.","Wheat shipments also increased, driven by global and U.S. demand for higher quality Canadian wheat. Grain product shipments were down 6% in the quarter, primarily due to soft DDG exports and increased inclusion of DDGs in domestic markets. Soybean meal carloads were down 6%, driven by declining export demand following 2015 record levels.","Ethanol volumes were flat year-over-year. Food in refrigerated carloads grew 2%, as strong demand for import beer was partially offset by volume declines in refrigerated markets, resulting from abundant truck supply.","Automotive revenue was down 13% in the quarter, driven by 2% decrease in volume and 11% reduction in average revenue per car. Revenue in all were negatively impacted by mix of stronger parts growth, which has a lower average revenue per car then finished vehicles. Finished vehicle shipments decreased 10% driven by mix, production levels of passenger vehicles impacting key Union Pacific plants and contract changes.","The seasonally adjusted annual rate for the second quarter automotive sales were 17.1 million vehicles; however, June finished at 16.6 million, perhaps indicating softening consumer demand. Auto parts volume increased 9%, driven primarily by new over the road conversions.","Chemicals revenue was down 5% for the quarter on a 3% decrease in volume and a 2% decline in average revenue per car. Plastics volume was down 5%, driven by lower polyethylene shipments and softening exports as the U.S. dollar remained strong. Fertilizer was down 6% as a result of weak exports on potash shipments, resulting from depressed global demand and softness in domestic Ag markets.","Strength in other areas including growth in industrial chemicals partially offset these declines. We continue to see significant headwinds on crude oil shipments, which were down 46% during the quarter due to lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads. Excluding crude oil shipments, chemicals volume was up 1% in the quarter.","Coal revenue declined 27% for the quarter on a 21% decrease in volume and an 8% decline in average revenue per car. Powder River Basin and Colorado Utah rail shipments were down both 23% in the quarter, again driven by low natural gas prices and high inventory levels. Export coal shipments were lower due to depressed international coal prices combined with a strong U.S. dollar.","PRB coal inventory levels in June were 105 days, down six days from May, but still 35 days above the five year average. 32 million tons of PRB coal were burned in June, which was 47% higher than what was burned in May. Industrial products revenue was down 14% on an 11% decline in volume and a 4% decrease in average revenue per car during the quarter.","Minerals volume was down 32% for the -- in the quarter. Frac sand shipments declined 43%, driven by weakened demand from low oil prices and market shifts to short-haul brown sand alternatives. Metal shipments declined 11% year-over-year as a result of reductions in shale drilling activity and strong import levels associated with the strength of the U.S. dollar.","Construction products volume was down 4% as severe wetting and flooding in Texas delayed construction activity. Intermodal revenue was down 16% on a 14% decline in volume and a 3% increase in average revenue per car.","Domestic volume declined 6% in the quarter, driven by sluggish demand for consumer goods and a tough prior year comp resulting from the discontinuation of the Triple Crown business late last year.","Market dynamics due to excess ship capacity resulted in ocean carrier financial challenges and shipping industry consolidation. As a result, international shipments were down 22%, driven by slow trans-Pacific trade and a volume loss by UPMI containership carriers.","To wrap-up, let's take a look at our outlook for the second half of the year. For the third quarter, we expect continued sequential volume improvement as we soar towards the end of the second quarter.","In Ag products, we expect high grain inventory levels, strong domestic crop expectations, and weakness in South American crops to drive strength in second half grain shipments.","Grain products will continue to face year-over-year comp headwinds and the global soybean meal market, as exports will not match the record levels set in 2015. Strength in import beer is expected throughout 2016.","Moving to autos, recent economic forecasts suggest annual light vehicle sales for the full year 2016 will be 17.5 million vehicles, driving both finished autos and parts, including over the road conversions.","We expect low gasoline prices will help sustain demand. However, we are carefully watching second half production and sales levels. We expect coal volumes will continue to be impacted by natural gas prices, high inventory levels, export demand, and weather.","We remain optimistic about most of our chemicals markets despite the persistence of headwinds created by low crude oil prices. We expect continued growth in LPG and industrial chemicals volumes will be partially offset by softness in the fertilizer market.","In industrial products, reduced drilling activity will continue to negatively impact our minerals and metals rock volumes for the remainder of the year. The improving construction and housing market should drive growth in our lumber and rock volumes.","Finally in Intermodal, we expect international lines will continue to be negatively impacted by excess ship capacity, ocean carrier financial challenges, and the resulting ocean carrier industry consolidation.","On the domestic side, we continue to be optimistic about growth opportunities from highway conversions. While there are a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy, our diverse franchise provides opportunities for growth in the slowly strengthening economy. We will continue to intently focus on strengthening our customer value proposition and developing new business opportunities.","With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron for an update on our operating performance.","Cameron Scott","Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Starting with our safety performance, our year-to-date reportable personal injury rate improved 15% versus 2015 to a record low of 0.70. Included in this was a record low number of severe injuries which have the greatest human and financial impact. The team's commitment to successfully finding and addressing risk in the workplace continues to generate positive results as we improve toward our goal of zero incidents.","With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our first half reportable rate of 3.43 decreased 1% versus last year. While we made only a slight improvement on the reportable rate, enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investments helped significantly reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those who did not meet the reportable threshold to a new record low.","In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased to 2.40. While this was a step back from last year's solid performance, we're confident with our efforts and initiatives to successfully identify those crossings where incidents were more likely to occur.","Combined with our focus on reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships, and public safety campaigns, we fully expect to drive improvements in the future.","Moving to network performance, after experiencing relatively mild winter weather conditions to start off the year, flooding events in the southern region of our network did present some challenges during the second quarter. Weather events always generate variability in the network, but it's something that we are accustomed to dealing with.","Utilizing the diverse strengths of our franchise, we rerouted traffic where possible; temporary utilized a portion of our surge locomotive fleet and recalled TE&Y crews as our employees worked diligently to restore operations.","These efforts kept the impact to a minimum including the delays of disruptions experienced by our customers. Overall velocity and terminal dwell improved 8% and 5%, respectively, when compared to the second quarter of 2015.","Moving on to resources. Coming into the quarter, our resource position was efficiently balanced for the volume levels we were experiencing at the time. Throughout the quarter, as part of our ongoing business planning process, we fine-tuned our resource levels to continually account for volume changes and productivity gains.","As a result, our total TE&Y workforce was down 22% in the second quarter when compared to the same period in 2015. Almost half of this decrease was driven by fewer employees in the training pipeline.","In lieu of hiring new employees, we have recalled furloughed employees to backfill attrition where needed to mitigate the impact from weather incidents and to handle the sequential volume uptick we experienced toward the tail end of the second quarter.","We also continue to evaluate all other aspects of the business to lower demand. This includes our engineering and mechanical workforce, which was down a combined 1,500 employees, or 7%, versus the second quarter of last year. In addition, our active locomotive fleet was down 14% from the second quarter of 2015.","While adjusting our resource to demand will always be a key focus area, overall productivity for us goes well beyond this effort. One primary area we continue to make progress is train length. While we're unable to overcome the volume decline within the scheduled Intermodal network, we did run record train lengths in all other major categories.","The fluidity and productivity our network has also reflected in the second quarter lower re-crew rate. A failure cost incurred when the first crew has inefficient time to complete the trip and the second crew is needed.","In summary, we made solid progress on several fronts in the second quarter. As we move into the back half of the year, we expect our safety strategy to continue yielding record results while we make further operational improvements by leveraging the strengths of our diverse franchise to enhance the customer experience.","And we will continue to intensify our focus on productivity and efficiency across the network to reduce costs. As a result of these efforts, our network is in a solid position to leverage volume growth to the bottom-line to increase utilization of existing assets.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Robert Knight","Good morning. Let's start with a recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue was $4.8 billion in the quarter, down 12% versus last year, significantly lower volumes and lower fuel surcharges more than offset positive core pricing achieved in the quarter.","Operating expenses totaled about $3.1 billion. Lower fuel costs, volume-related reductions and strong productivity improvements drove the 11% improvement compared to last year. Partially offsetting some of the productivity was the impact of weather on our southern region operations as well as the unfortunate Oregon derailment in June.","The total operating expense impact from these two events was approximately $16 million or about $0.01 per share. In addition to the impact on earnings, we also incurred about $15 million in capital expenditures as a result of these disruptions. Operating income totaled $1.7 billion, a 15% decrease from last year.","Below the line, other income totaled $77 million, down $65 million versus 2015. The $113 million California real estate sale gain recorded last year was partially offset by a $50 million real estate sale gain in the second quarter of this year.","Interest expense of $173 million was up 13% compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last 12 months, partially offset by lower effective interest rates. Income tax expense decreased 20% to $585 million, driven primarily by lower pretax earnings.","Net income totaled nearly $1 billion; down 19% versus 2015 while the outstanding share balance declined 4% as a result of our continued share repurchase activities. These results combined to produce a quarterly earnings of $1.17 per share.","Now turning to our topline, freight revenue of $4.4 billion was down 13% versus last year. Volume declined 11% and fuel surcharge revenue totaled $87 million, down $240 million when compared to 2015. All in, we estimate the net impact of lower fuel prices was a $0.06 headwind earnings in the second quarter versus last year.","Remember, we have about 60 different fuel surcharge recovery programs in place with our customers and coming into the second quarter, diesel fuel prices were below entry thresholds for many of these programs. By the end of the quarter, this situation was starting to reverse as fuel prices have edged up.","Assuming fuel prices remain where they are today, we will collect fuel surcharge revenue at some level on most of our programs going forward once we get past the two-month lag. The business mix impact on freight revenue in the second quarter was about flat, moderating from the last couple of quarters as we expected.","The primary drivers of mix this quarter were significant declines in frac sand and finished vehicles, offset by a decline in Intermodal volumes. Core price was a positive contributor to freight revenue in the quarter at about 2%.","Slide 21 provides more detail on our pricing trends. Although a smaller increase than the first quarter, pricing continued to be a positive and above inflation. For the full year, we estimate inflation to be about 1.5%.","Moving on to the expense side, slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which decreased 11% versus 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of lower volumes, improved labor efficiencies, and fewer people in the training pipeline.","Labor inflation was about 1.5% in the second quarter, driven primarily by health and welfare, which is partially offset by some favorable pension expense. We expect full year labor inflation to be around 2%.","Looking at our total workforce levels for the quarter, our employee counts declined 12%, or almost 6,000, as a result of lower volumes and our G55 + 0 productivity initiatives. Sequentially, total work force levels were down a little more than 1% from the first quarter of 2016.","And excluding employees associated with our capital projects, workforce levels were down almost 3% from the first quarter and down about 6% from the fourth quarter of last year.","For the remainder of the year, we expect our force levels will continue to trend with volumes, as we have experienced thus far, but we also expect to continue generating G55-related labor productivity as well.","Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $346 million, down 36% when compared to 2015. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with an 11% decline in gross ton miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 2% while our average fuel price declined 27% to $1.45 per gallon.","Moving on to our other expense categories, purchased services and materials expense decreased 5% to $570 million. The reduction was primarily driven by lower volume related expense and reduced repair costs associated with our locomotive and freight car fleets.","Depreciation expense was $504 million, up 1% compared to 2015, driven primarily by higher depreciable asset base. For the full year, we still expect depreciation expense to increase slightly compared to last year.","Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $286 million, which is down 8% when compared to 2015. Lower volumes and reduced locomotive lease expense were the primary drivers of this decline.","Other expenses came in at $244 million, up 8% versus last year. Higher personal injury expense was the primary driver for the increase due to unfavorable results in a few prior year claims. For 2016, we expect the other expense line to increase about 5% or so, excluding any large unusual items.","Turning to our operating ratio, the second quarter operating ratio came in at 65.2%, 1.1 points unfavorable when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Fuel price negatively impacted the operating ratio by two points in the quarter.","Looking at our cash flow, cash from operations for the first half totaled more than $3.5 billion, down about $250 million when compared to the first half of 2015. The decrease in cash was driven by lower net income and was partially offset by the timing of tax payments primarily related to bonus depreciation on capital spending. After dividends, our free cash flow totaled about $760 million for the first half.","Taking a look at the balance sheet, our all-in adjusted debt balance increased to about $18.2 billion at quarter end. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.9, up from 1.7 at year end, as we continue to target a ratio of less than two times. For the first six months of the year, we have brought back about 16.3 million shares, totaling over $1.3 billion.","Since initiating share repurchases in 2007, we have repurchased more than 27% of our outstanding shares. Adding our dividend payments and our share repurchases, we returned more than $2.2 billion to our shareholders in the first half of this year.","So, that's a recap of the second quarter results. Looking out to the rest of the year, we expect volume will continue to be a challenge, even though year-over-year volume comparisons do get easier in the second half. We would expect total third quarter volumes to be down around 6% or so. And coal could still be down about 20% or so when compared to the third quarter of last year.","We now expect total full year volumes to be down in the 6% to 8% range, depending primarily on how the demand for consumer goods plays out in the second half. While it is unlikely we would be able to improve the operating ratio this year with volume reduction in this range, we will of course continue to focus on achieving positive core pricing and strong productivity to drive the best margins possible. Longer-term, however, we still expect to achieve our 60% operating ratio guidance, plus or minus, on a full year basis by 2019.","On the capital front, we're still targeting $3.675 billion for this year, which is down over $600 million from 2015. As for next year and beyond, we are taking a hard look at our future capital spending requirements and it is likely that we will need less than the 16% to 17% of revenue that we have been targeting. In fact, it could be closer to 15% or so, but we are still working through the details.","We are diligently continuing to drive productivity improvement throughout the company. Our entire organization is energized and intensely focused on finding more efficient ways to run our operations and safely serve our customers. Many of our productivity initiatives are well underway and several others are scheduled to ramp up in the coming months.","We're confident that our new G55 mindset will provide our customers with an excellent service experience and will drive financial performance for our shareholders well into the future.","With that, I'll turn it back to Lance.","Lance Fritz","Thank you, Rob. As you've heard from everyone here this morning, we continued to experience a challenging business environment in the second quarter, resulting in weak demand across many of our commodity groups.","A soft global economy, the negative impact of the strong U.S. dollar on exports, and relatively weak demand for consumer goods will continue to pressure volumes through the second half of the year.","That said, we see potential bright spots in certain segments of our business if key economic drivers continue to strengthen, as they have in recent weeks. For example, energy prices, especially natural gas, have been recovering somewhat from previous lows, which is positive for our coal and shale-related business.","We're also cautiously optimistic that the overall grain market will strengthen in the second half, of course, depending on the outcome of this year's crop harvest and global agricultural economic conditions.","Beyond the impact of the current macro environment, we are implementing a strategy that will make us a stronger company for the future. This strategy comprises six primary value tracks and you've heard these themes woven throughout our comments today.","These tracks include our unrelenting focus on achieving world-class safety while delivering an excellent customer experience. They include striving for innovation and resource productivity, both designed to improve our work processes so we can make the most out of what we have.","Finally, the tracks are about maximizing the franchise with an engaged team, empowering our employees to effectively utilize our assets, our service products, our market reach, and our proprietary technology. And, of course, our G55 and Zero initiatives cut across all six of these tracks.","In the months and years ahead, we will continue our intense focus on these value tracks to create competitive advantages for our customers, enhanced safety and satisfaction for our employees, strength in the communities that we serve, and solid returns for our shareholders.","With that, let's open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hey good morning, and thanks for taking my call.","Lance Fritz","Good morning Brian.","Brian Ossenbeck","I just had a couple of quick questions, one on coal and Chris the weather and natural gas inventories are affecting demand there. Can you see anything from -- pressure from renewable energy specifically from wind, is that continuing to take a little bit of share here and we've seen the production tax credits -- investment tax credits were extended at the end of last year. So, I'll be curious to see if you're seeing the impact your utility customers?","Eric Butler","Yeah, Brian, this is Eric. So, you're correct, there is continued expansion of wind capability kind of in the energy space throughout the country. Most of wind has to be backed up by some other source of power because you can't depend on it completely as you know. It is not a material year-over-year impact for us in terms of our coal burned or coal space.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. And then just one quick one on Intermodal and clearly you've outlined some of the challenges on the international side. Just wondering if the safety [Indiscernible] mandate hit constant volatility maybe on the volume side as we heard some shippers were moving volumes ahead of the July 1st mandate. So curious to see if you have seen any of that which would perhaps be weighing on volumes now and if you had to make any adjustments for the on duck rail to satisfy that weight certification requirements when that rolled out earlier this month?","Eric Butler","Yeah, Brian the sole-less [ph] thing as you said was effective July 1. As you know the shippers are responsible for certifying all of those weights. As far as we can tell that has not been impact on the supply chain, so it is not been an impact on us and we can't tell yet any significant impact on the full supply chain.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. Thanks Eric. Thanks for your time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions\/","Scott Group","Hey, thanks. Good morning guys.","Lance Fritz","Morning Scott.","Scott Group","So, Rob, why don't you just follow-up on your comments about the operating ratio that you don't necessarily expect improvement this year. I get that as a full year comment maybe can you talk about the second half of the year as the volume declines or moderating, do you think that margin improvement in the second half of the year is possible? And then just with that I don't think I heard a guidance for headcount sequentially in 3Q if you have any color there.","Robert Knight","Yeah, Scott, a couple of comments. One, yes my commentary on the operating ratio was a full year comment because as you know we have previously said our expectation earlier in the year was call it mid-single-digit volume decline for the full year and with that assumption improvement year-over-year on the operating ratio and with the revised volume guidance for the full year what we're saying there or signaling there is that we are very focused on continuing to improve our margins, but the year-over-year improvement looks less likely at this stage of the game.","But having said that, that does imply -- our guidance on volume does imply and our guidance on our commitment to improving our margins does imply that we expect to making continued improvement from here on our operating ratio and not only this year but as we strive to continue to meet that full year 2019 60 plus or minus.","On the headcount question, yeah, we had very good performance as it relates to headcount in the second quarter. Volumes, obviously, play a role in that, but as you know, Scott, depending on what volumes actually are combined with of our focus on G55 productivity initiatives, our headcount will move up or down with volume and our expectations from this going forward backed up by our volume guidance is that sequentially we do expect our volumes to improve from where we are today that would suggest that headcounts will move up, but not one for one.","And by the time we finish the full year, I would expect that you'll see us clearly down year-over-year, but it will all depend upon exactly how the volumes play out.","Scott Group","Okay. And Rob, so you\u2019re not making comments about third or fourth quarter operating ratio year-over-year?","Robert Knight","I am not. Other than we're very focused and expect particularly with improving volume that we'll continue to improve where we are today.","Scott Group","Okay. And then just quickly on the CapEx side, I think maybe if you could get to 15% of revenue or so next year is that something that we can expect for not just 2017, but for kind of a few years just given the excess locomotives and the lack of the need to buy locomotives for probably two, three, four years or something?","Lance Fritz","Yes, Scott, this is Lance. The basis for that guidance is as we look out into out years, call it the planning horizon, we think demand on our part for new locomotives is going to be pretty muted and we think PTC drops off to a very low level if any.","And you just account for those two line items in this year's capital plan and it\u2019s a significant chunk of capital. So, that's the underlying thought process behind moving more towards 15% as opposed to 16% to 17%.","Scott Group","It sounds like it should be more than 17, it should be more ongoing.","Lance Fritz","Yeah. It's our planning horizon. So, I would say you're right, it's beyond 17.","Scott Group","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.","Allison Landry","Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the sequential downtick in the core pricing number and whether that was driven at all by contract renewals or changes in the inflation indices. And then do you think we're at a cyclical low point there?","Eric Butler","Yeah. So, Allison, this is Eric. There was some minus sequential softening in [Indiscernible]. We think the 2% price that we turned in is positive and it continues to be above inflation, but it also is reflective in of market that we have there is surplus capacity in the market on all modes of traffic.","We continue with our strategy. We continue to price to the value that we bring and we think we're bringing a substantial value and we're improving our value and we continue to take as you said in the past a targeted market-based approach on pricing. If you look in the future, you do see capacity tightening across all modes of traffic and we continue to be positive about our ability to price our value the future.","Allison Landry","Okay. Rob I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that your expectations for full year inflation was about one and a half. Is that the right way to think about inflation in the second quarter, in other words spreads about 50 bps which is similar to Q1?","Robert Knight","Allison, that's directionally correct, but I would just kind of remind everyone while inflation is low against historical levels, we aren\u2019t really -- it's not mechanically terms of how we price, but, yes, I think directionally those are probably not bad numbers.","Allison Landry","Okay. And then just maybe a question on coal, you mentioned the higher burn rates in June with obviously pretty hot summer. When we think about that versus the elevated inventory levels, do you think sort of the normal sequential increase in the 2H versus 1H for coal carloads similar to historical levels which I think is somewhere in the high single-digit range?","Lance Fritz","Allison, I don't think we can give an outlook on kind of what sequential changes we'll see going forward. We do expect the inventory levels to go down the burn rate is increased as you have hot weather. You are seeing volumes grow and I think we'll see those trends continuing. I don't think we could be any more precise than that.","Allison Landry","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay, thanks. I wanted to ask a question about mix. So, I think mix was flat in the quarter and has been improving the last couple of quarters. I guess just wanted to get a sense, I think the outlook for the full year a quarter or so ago was -- I think continue to state relatively negative, but maybe eases as the year goes on.","Can you give us any thoughts Rob maybe how to think about that as we go into the third and fourth quarter coal getting all better, maybe grain getting a little bit better? Is it possible to see a positive?","Robert Knight","Chris, I mean as you know we don't give guidance on mix because of the moving parts and I would just say as you've heard me say many times, I think that's basically true for our franchise because we have such a diverse set of business mixes that we in fact are playing in not only at a macro level, but mix within mix at the commodity level. So, as a result we can't and don't give specific guidance.","But we did say we knew certainly the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year were unusually high given some of the mix and we thought it would start to moderate throughout the year and it has.","So, I would expect that I wouldn't give guidance that will be plus or minus, but I think it was reasonable to assume that look sort of more normal if you will could be plus, could be minus as the year plays out depending on actually what volumes move.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. But generally speaking some of those heavier bulk commodities generally are positive to the mix dynamic?","Robert Knight","Generally, but again, Chris, as I think you know and others perhaps as well, you can have mix within mix. So, using our example of coal you can have a mix of positive or negative even just within the coal line.","Chris Wetherbee","Of course, that's helpful, that definitely makes sense. I wanted to ask you about the competitive dynamic particularly on the Intermodal side but generally competitive pricing in the West. I know you guys compete every day for the business that you win, but over the course of the last couple of quarters, just wanted to get a sense of sort of where that -- how that competition has been sort of shaking out, particularly on the domestic Intermodal side which I think was down again this quarter. I just want to see how that's kind of playing out?","Has it gotten any more difficult to win business from a rail perspective as opposed to trucks, we obviously know what's going on with the truck pricing, but just want to get a sense of how that's playing out?","Robert Knight","Yeah, Chris I think you said it right, we compete vigorously every day for business we have strong real competitor, strong truck competitors. We have strong water barge shipping competitors and you're exactly right we compete vigorously.","We do think we have a strong value proposition and we think that with that strong value proposition we can compete effectively on that value proposition and price for the value that we're providing to the marketplace.","As I said earlier you're seeing capacity tighten and many of those modes and we think that's positive for the competitive environment, but, yes, we compete vigorously every day.","Chris Wetherbee","And that tightening is that a current event or something you would expect maybe in 2017, just want to make sure I'm clear about that?","Robert Knight","So, as you go forward you certainly know what's happening in terms of the trucking regulations that are out there like electronic logs and the impact that, that's going to have. I think you have seen in the last couple of months a number of large trucking companies as part of their public pronouncements discuss what they see with capacity trends and their predictions about tightening.","You see kind of in the ship space some of the consolidations that are going on. So, I think it is kind of across all volumes. Of course you see rail volumes picking up. So, I think across all modes, you see that tightening.","Chris Wetherbee","That's helpful. Thanks for the color guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please go ahead with your questions.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Thanks very much and good morning. The first question I wanted to ask was on your optimism for the second half in grain. Up to now you've been a little bit cautious about being optimistic in that segment. Just given your view on storage in the U.S., I just wondered if you could update is there in your thoughts.","Eric Butler","Hopefully -- this is Eric, hopefully, I was sounding more balanced than optimistic, but if you look at storage right now, there is -- storage is about 30% higher, storage of all types, grain, beans et cetera than what the five year average has been.","And then if you look at the crop there was something like 6 million more acres of corn planted this year and it's still dependent upon kind of the weather and the harvest, but right now it looks like it's going to be pretty decent yields from the current crop.","And so if you look at the pretty decent yields from the current crop if you look at the high storage levels on a historical basis, if you look at some of the challenges -- in particular South American crops that have had, it suggests that there's going to be opportunity to move grain in the second half of the year at a higher run rate than what we saw in the first half.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Right. And in terms of thinking about how much of your Ag products segment is really sensitive to the size of the crop. Should we be thinking about that grain sub-segment or are grain products movements also very sensitive to their size of the crop?","Eric Butler","Grains clearly -- our grain products are from the standpoint. The driver in grain products is ethanol is a large portion of that and then next kind of the soybean meals. And so those are also very sensitive to the crops and basically the crop pricing and whether or not ethanol will be in the money.","Cherilyn Radbourne","Great. That's all for me. Thank you.","Lance Fritz","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your questions.","Ravi Shanker","Thanks, morning everyone. You said earlier that you don't necessarily price -- set your price to be 50 basis points above inflation. Can you just talk about what might be any structure drivers that kind of keeps that margin and prevents pricing from closing the gap further to inflation?","Lance Fritz","Ravi, this is Lance. When you think about pricing for us you start at the highest level which is we try to provide excellent customer service and excellent experience which generates value for our customers when we price for that.","In that context, we're constantly looking to make a reasonable return, so that it's a re-investable piece of business. And then we have the reality of the dynamics of other competitive modes or competition.","You put that altogether and that's what informs our ability to price. So, when you think about it going forward, you know markets that have less modal capacity, markets that are robust and growing strongly those are better markets to price in than not. But that generally informs our pricing scheme.","Ravi Shanker","Okay. And I had a follow-up on coal as well. You touched upon this in response to pervious question. But the 3Q coal outlook looked somewhat soft given the step up in the burn; I'm wondering if you think that that's not sustainable or why that would not -- why inventories will not be drawn down further.","And also when you look out into 2017, there's some folks talking about a potential coal book where you see a V-shape recovery in 2017, just given drawdowns, how would you dimension that or what kind of probability would you assigned to case like that?","Lance Fritz","Ravi, I think you're right if you look at kind of the burn, the burn has stepped up, but the inventory still are high on a relative basis. They are still 35 days higher than a five year average. So, you have to burn off those inventories even as the burn has stepped up. And so that is a headwind to growing coal volumes in the third quarter.","As you look at the outlook for next year as we say always it depends on weather, it depends on natural gas pricing, it depends on energy consumption. So, that's what's going to drive in the future.","Ravi Shanker","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","Thomas Wadewitz","Yeah. Good morning. Quick one first on inventories, I don't think you've commented on inventories in the effect on Intermodal, does that situation seem to be getting any better or is that still an issue that makes it hard to see a lot of improvement in Intermodal volumes?","Eric Butler","Tom, inventories have gotten better -- have retreated from the seven year highs that we saw last month. They are still high in a relative basis, but they are coming down.","Lance Fritz","Tom, to add a little technicolor to that in that domestic Intermodal space something that Eric continually reminds us is that there's a lot of opportunity out there from a truck competitive perspective. And that really informs a pretty good portion of our ability to grow. That overall consumer demand and demand for goods is what is informed that retail to sales inventory ratio and inventory in general.","Thomas Wadewitz","Okay. Thank you. And then the second question how would you -- I was just wondering if you kind of frame the way we would think about operating leverage as volumes get less worse and then hopefully in 2017 they actually grow.","Given current train length and ability to expand that given the initiatives Lance that you mentioned, how would we think about the operating leverage and kind of how long you can go with handling volume without adding a whole lot of incremental cost?","Lance Fritz","Cameron?","Cameron Scott","With the amount of locomotives we have in storage, the locomotive productivity leverage is fantastic. On the employee side, depending on where growth shows up, we will continue to bring furloughed employees back and potentially transfer employees to the part of the network where growth is residing.","So, we continue to see our employee pipeline staying very, very lean and there is great opportunity in every category with train size. Our coal network is truly the only network that is optimized to a very large extent every other network we have has plenty of headroom to train size.","Thomas Wadewitz","Okay. Can you size that, is that 10% room or 20% or is there a way to kind of frame that train size opportunity?","Cameron Scott","I think you see as quarter-to-quarter making continued improvement and we feel very confident you'll continue to see that.","Lance Fritz","Hey Tom, this is Lance, again. We've done a nice job staying ahead of demand in terms of overall capacity whether it's fungible capacity or track capacity. Clearly at this point, given how we've built out the network and we're supporting hundred and 180,000 or 190,000 seven-day carloads a couple of years ago, we've ample capacity for growth at this point.","Robert Knight","We won't do this, I promise on to many questions, Tom. This is Rob and I have to pile on. All of that leverage that we're confident in that Cam and Lance just talked through are all embedded in that drive to that 60 plus or minus operating ratio and of course, as you know we're striving to even set our sights beyond that at 55. So, it's that confidence that we are well-positioned with positive volume growth to be in a great position of leveraging that.","Thomas Wadewitz","Great. Okay. Thanks for all the perspective. Appreciate it.","Lance Fritz","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions","Kenneth Hoexter","Hey, Great. Good morning. Just want to follow-up on the international side of Intermodal. Eric you talked a bit about carrier consolidation, I wouldn't think that has much to do with the demand side that's been filling their slots or the oversupply in the market.","Would -- what you're thoughts on the state of global trade? Seems like we're starting to see some of the port volumes pick up a bit, just wanted to see if that's something you're seeing as well as any or is that a shift from the Panama Canal change or Suez Canal any thoughts on the state of global trade?","Eric Butler","Yeah, so I think if you look at the absolute volumes in the TT [ph] trait, they are not strong. There are some period-to-period kind of shifts going on and you do see some of the business that shifted to the canal because of the strike just gradually coming back there. So, that's kind of coloring some of the trend, but the TT trade volumes are relatively weak from a historical standpoint.","If you look at the carrier consolidation issues, there's huge volatility going on in there. As I mentioned at the last earnings release significant volatility in terms of mergers, acquisitions and that volatility does have impact to the supply chain depending on which carriers have what book of business that you're aligned with. So, that volatility is impacting what we see in the supply chain.","Kenneth Hoexter","Great. Rob any thoughts on the balance sheet, obviously, pretty strong situation here. Thoughts on increasing the buyback accelerating given the volatility in the stock just kind of your thoughts on cash flow?","Robert Knight","I mean Ken, as you know, it all starts with driving a stronger cash flow as we can and we're obviously committed on returning cash to shareholders and we'll continue to be opportunistic in terms of at what price and when and how much we actually buyback. So, same philosophy, focus on generating as much cash as we can, so that we're in a high class challenge of deciding what to do with that cash and I would expect it will continue to be opportunistic as we move forward on the share buybacks.","Kenneth Hoexter","Great. Thanks for the thoughts.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Eric Morgan","Good morning. This is Eric Morgan on for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow-up on some of your grain comments. Sounds like the set-up from harvest perspective is pretty constructive, I was just wondering if you could provide a bit more color specifically with corn prices coming down so much recently and the dollar still strong. If there is enough storage capacity could we be in a similar environment as last year where farmers just don't want to move the crops?","Eric Butler","Eric, I think you have piped all of the dynamics exactly correct quarter prices are coming down. They are projected to come down even more because of the strong harvest that is projected to come, but there is an issue where it will have to move, so that is exactly the dynamic that's going on.","There is probably some headwinds to farmers wanting to move it, but there's probably some physical logistics where they have to move it and that's some of I think what we're seeing in the outlook.","Eric Morgan","Okay, I appreciate it. And just a quick one is there kind of good way to think about land sales going forward?","Lance Fritz","I'm sorry, Brandon, could you repeat that?","Eric Morgan","Just on the other income line is there a good run rate to think about with respect to land sales.","Lance Fritz","I'm sorry.","Eric Butler","Eric, no, I mean other income plus or minus 150 is kind of a number, but no, those tend to be as you've seen lumpy and there's no straight-line way of thinking about that.","Eric Morgan","Okay. Thanks for your time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hoffman with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Hoffman","Thank you. Hey Eric, I just wanted to ask you a question about in the money which I think something came up a few questions ago. If we look at Powder River Basin coal, say relative to Western markets, relative to some of the Midwest markets, just where prices are now, where prices may or may not be and if I look at ethanol with corn prices down and diesel fuel prices up how close are we to be in the money on these products in terms of the forward outlook?","Eric Butler","So, I assume you're asking a coal question and ethanol question separately? So, on the coal question I would say it depends on what energy region you're in, what ISO, what RT you're in; it depends on the utility that's within that region. So, it depends on a lot of different things.","I think it's instructive to look at the fact of the reference increase in burn month-over-month to indicate that clearly there are a lot more utilities and -- that are in the money just if you look at that increase burn. So, that would be my coal comment.","In terms of ethanol, I think ethanol from a use standpoint is \"always in the money\" because it is needed as a necessary oxygen and a replacement for the MBTEs for gasoline and so as gasoline volumes go, ethanol blending with that will go the question is how much margin the ethanol manufacturers are making. But ethanol is more driven by gasoline sales and then need to get the oxygenate and the replacement for the MBTEs.","LanceFritz","Hey, Jeff just one piece on that PRB answer and that is while natural gas where it is right now 270-ish plus or minus has put some additional units \"in the money\" I think in the context you're asking are weather in the central part of the country and in the Southeast is helping tremendously with increased electricity demand and that's putting more units online just from a raw demand perspective.","Jeffrey Hoffman","That's where I was going with this is to the extent you have incremental burn demand, are you more in the money and more likely to be moving coal. Just one last follow-up Eric on the brown sand comment that you made on the frac sand, are we getting to the point where we're seeing increased demand for the white frac sand or not yet?","Eric Butler","Yeah, so if you look at the number of drilling rigs they're up modestly -- I think the number is -- you're going from like 400 rigs to 430 rigs or something like that, that's close to probably what the number is compared to 1,000 rigs last year.","So, it's increased modestly because the price of fuel has increased and there is slightly more drilling activity. I think the amount of white sand we'll see will be a direct correlation to as drilling activity comes on you'll see white sand demand go up.","Jeffrey Hoffman","All right. Hey congratulations in a tough quarter and thank you.","Eric Butler","Thank you.","LanceFritz","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions.","Justin Long","Thanks, and good morning.","LanceFritz","Good morning.","Justin Long","So, I wanted to ask about the volume guidance for a 6% to 8% decline for the full year. So, that's worse than your guidance last quarter for a mid-single-digit decline, but if we look at 2Q volumes, they finished fairly close to your initial expectation for a 10% decline. And it sounds like you're a little more incrementally positive on coal and grain. So, can you just help us understand what drove this guidance reduction in terms of the volumes seems like in the back half of the year?","Robert Knight","Yeah, Justin this is Rob, I would say the biggest piece and I totally understand your question because you're exactly right in the terms of the way you map through that is centers around the consumer. I mean it centers around the Intermodal product as much as anything else in the cautiousness that we're expressing today.","You're right, we did come in a little bit stronger in the second quarter, largely driven that pick up in coal. If you look at the difference in the second quarter where we finish what we had guided to, but the full year number simply said is largely driven by that consumer cautiousness that we're seeing in the Intermodal space.","Justin Long","Okay, great. That's helpful. And secondly I wanted to get your thoughts around how your core price increases in general merchandise are trending relative to your core price increases in Intermodal. I know you don't break that out specifically, but are you seeing general merchandise in Intermodal pricing trending up at similar levels or is the Intermodal increase something like 100 basis points less because of the excess capacity in truckload?","Robert Knight","Justin, you nailed it when you said you know we don't give that break out because we endeavor to price to market and drive value in every one of our commodity groups, but we don't break out by commodity as you're striving for.","Justin Long","But just from a high level can you say that general merchandise prices decreases are above what you're seeing in Intermodal?","Robert Knight","No, and I would say number one, it varies each sort of negotiation is separate, but I wouldn't even go so far as to say that.","Justin Long","Okay. Fair enough I appreciate the time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions.","David Vernon","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Cameron maybe a question for you. It looks like the volatility of ocean carrier alliances and some of the changing of vessel causes is bringing down that international Intermodal, and you still have like 5% reduction in train length. How long do you think it will be before you can get that back up or should we be expecting you to kind of have to deal with that lower train length because of the headwind?","Cameron Scott","We adjust our Intermodal program on a weekly basis looking at inbound volumes that Eric does his best to forecast. And so balancing customer requirements and productivity is always a tight rope. Our first priority is to take care of our customers. And so we will continue to make those adjustments on week-by-week basis.","David Vernon","Would you expect that train length to back up?","Cameron Scott","As we step into the second half of the year depending as Rob outlined on what the consumer does driving Intermodal, we absolutely can bring that train size metric right back in line.","David Vernon","Okay. And then maybe Rob as a quick follow-up. Could you comment a little bit about the cadence of the operating results through the quarter, it would seem like you have been aggressively kind of pushing down on the headcount and then saw that sequential improvement into the volume growth I guess did results, was there any kind of a certain infection forward in result and the trajectory result as we move through the quarter?","Robert Knight","I'm following your question David, I would say no, I mean it was a continuation of our focus on being as efficient and as productive as we can which I think our results reflect lined up well given the unfortunate downturn in 11% volume. So, I would say there's nothing unique about that other than it was a good hard work across the entire organization to make the right decisions.","David Vernon","So, the run rate profitability was kind of the same at the beginning of the month as at the end of the month or end of quarter?","Robert Knight","Yeah, yet fuel was a big -- I would say there's nothing to call it there other than the fuel which rose late in the quarter.","David Vernon","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rob Solomon with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.","Rob Solomon","Hey, thanks. Cameron, actually just to dig in a little bit more of with regard to the Intermodal train sizes, can you describe kind of what was going on with the domestic Intermodal train size versus the international and kind of the factors that was driving relative weakness that we saw with regard to train lengths?","Cameron Scott","On the domestic front, we will pay attention to what is being indicated on a weekly basis. We have extreme sensitivity to UPS and some of our LTL customers that we will always preference for any of those trains as long as the volumes are adequate.","And as I said on the international side, we really depend on Eric's forecast on what is hitting our ports and we'll make the appropriate decisions on a week-to-week basis.","The good news on the Intermodal front, despite the decline, is that there is plenty of opportunity to increase train size as we see volumes coming back into that space.","Eric Butler","Yeah. Rob, this is Eric. I wouldn\u2019t had a lot of focus on kind of the train size in Intermodal. We're always adding different products and services as part of our growth and value proposition as part of our conversion strategy. And so you could be adding a product or service in the line and it will start small because it adds the potential to grow and that's part of the mix in train size that you'll always see.","Rob Solomon","Right. That makes sense. I guess Eric to kind of follow-up with regard to just kind of market dynamics, can you give us a sense if we take about automotive kind of on a very holistic basis including kind of inbound parts to the manufacturers of the automotive as well as the automotive part producers how big that represents and then maybe which networks that's running on between unit train and manifest?","Eric Butler","Okay. So, trying to make sure I understand your question so auto parts network is a growing network, it grew about 9%, 10% in the quarter. It's smaller than our multilevel network, but it is growing. Probably two-thirds, three quarters of it does run as part of our premium Intermodal network running container shipments and that's a necessity because it is a premium product.","Rob Solomon","Yeah. And if I think about just how big it is as a percentage of total volumes just look at the automotive line segments, it's little over 10%. But if I could kind of the metals that are going to the factories as well as parts in Intermodal that would be going to the automotive parts producers, how much additional volume would that represent for your network? Good rule of thumb, not really.","Eric Butler","I don't know if there's a good rule of thumb there.","Robert Knight","Rob, this is Rob, I would say you're using the auto's examples which is a good one and there are other examples where we enjoy to your point. We enjoy the sort of multiple move and in fact, I would just -- using your example I would say we also supply coal to the utilities providing the electricity to make the car. So, there's a lot of moving parts there, specifically what percent autos, we don't have that.","Rob Solomon","Okay. Thanks for the time guys.","Lance Fritz","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Co. Please go ahead with your question.","Jason Seidl","Thanks operator. Hey guys, apologize if this was covered, but our phone dropped you for a little bit here. Eric you mentioned that there was a sequential increase in the burn from June to May, I think you said from May to June, I think you said 47%, what's the historical increase in burn?","Eric Butler","I don't have the historical number right at my fingertips. That is larger than it typically historical norm. As you know you do have the shelf month there and the second quarter because you are not heating or cooling and then you have the pickup cyclically, but that is higher than what you typically see.","Jason Seidl","Okay. That's good color. Also, I'm looking at your stock obviously under a little bit of pressure today, I think based on some of the incoming calls, I received there is a little bit of worry of your core pricing falling down a little bit. If you had the bucket the pressure on core pricing between loose truck capacity and increased competition from other rail carriers, how would you do it on a percentage basis?","Eric Butler","As a said before you know they are all low competitive factors that are going on. I mentioned earlier there might've been while you dropped off the call that there was surplus capacity in all loads truck capacity, shipping capacity, rail capacity, and you do see that capacity tightening across all modes as you look into the future.","Jason Seidl","But there wasn't one that was more prominent than the other as you look at 2Q?","Eric Butler","All of those factors are factors that go into our pricing and we price to our value and those are all factor.","Jason Seidl","Okay. Guys, thanks for the time as always I appreciate it.","Eric Butler","Thank you.","Lance Fritz","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.","John Barnes","Hey good morning. I wanted to go back to your comment around maybe some of the logistics on the grain business. So, we had a couple of decent harvest over the last couple years and for whatever reason we keep hearing about storage is tight and yet the crop never seems to get moved.","Have we finally get that inflection point where you know the storage is tight enough there is too much you know the prior harvest still in storage, this one just absolutely you it has to get moved this year.","Eric Butler","I don't know if I'm an expert on kind of the inflection point of total storage, I do think if you look at the trends and you're seeing some of the trends materialize even now storage is tight, farm income is under stress given the lower pricing. And so there is a cash flow dynamic for farmers in terms of holding versus selling that comes into play here.","There is a demand that is picking up because of the weakness in some international markets like South American markets and then there is a big crop coming in. So, if you look at all of those things they do indicate that there is a high probability you are going to see strong moves.","John Barnes","Okay. And then you mentioned the difficulties in South America, strong U.S. dollar continues to plague the export activity. Is the domestic demand this year in domestic moves of grain going to be more important than they have been in years past? We see there may be less of this moving for export purposes?","Eric Butler","We do have a strong domestic franchise. As you know exports are picking up and they are all interrelated because to the extent you have strong export markets that takes the demand and we also participate in the export markets whether it's moving into the Gulf, moving into the River, moving into the West Coast particularly the P&W. So we have a strong domestic franchise, but the export markets also benefited us.","Lance Fritz","And Eric, recall John that Mexico is also an export market for us.","John Barnes","Okay, but you are saying that the export you actually are seeing some movement in the export side of the business.","Eric Butler","Export markets are picking up.","John Barnes","Okay. Very good. Thanks for your time.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your questions.","Ben Hartford","Good morning guys. Curious how you feel about service today relative to let's say the high water marks pre-2014 some of the metrics trends being one of them are back to those measures. Obviously, there is some mix and other elements of play but how do you feel about the \"service across the network today\" relative to prior to the issues that you in the industry experienced in early 2014?","Lance Fritz","Ben, this is Lance, when you think about our overall network in the service we are providing, absent the impacts of things like the flooding that we've experienced in Texas there's some just epic weather events, we're performing essentially at a 2013 or 2012 type level.","So, our service performance level on average in aggregate is about as good as it's been for this kind of volume level. Our intent and what Cameron and team are constantly working on is ways to improve that, right. So 2012 and 2013 are a benchmark, they are not the only benchmark. We think we can do better than that over time and his team is constantly working with the commercial team and other functions of the railroad to try to find ways to improve that service product.","Ben Hartford","That's helpful. Are there any specific elements or areas of service where you don't believe that you are back to those 2012, 2013 benchmarks for still have some room to go?","Lance Fritz","Yeah, I would tell you we have room for improvement virtually everywhere and that's not a statement of not as good as 2012 or 2013 that's the statement of -- we are never perfect. There is always an opportunity to run the network more on time from original terminal to making sure we don't leave any cars behind to running the premium domestic Intermodal product at greater speeds or at more significant -- significantly reduced span. All of those things are within our visuals and we're working on all of them.","Ben Hartford","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mark Levin with BB&T Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Levin","Hey guys, thanks for the time. Most of my questions have been asking and answered. I just wanted to see if there was any potential impact from the Mexican Excise Tax Credit benefit the one that KSU alluded to yesterday?","Robert night","No.","Mark Levin","No benefit whatsoever.","Robert night","Right. ","Mark Levin","Okay, great. And then with regard to auto yield and the mix headwind that you mentioned this quarter, when you look forward is that something as we model RPU in the auto segment we should be mindful of what type of expectations should we have as that looking forward there?","Eric Butler","Our auto part businesses growing faster than our finished vehicle's business because that is the growth area as you saw that in the second quarter auto-parts business as a lower RPUs than the finished vehicle's business.","Mark Levin","And will the decrease moderate or is that sort of a way to think about that going forward this quarter?","Eric Butler","There aren't decreases, the auto-parts business is growing.","Mark Levin","Great. Okay. Thank you very much.","Lance Fritz","All right Mark.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners. Please go ahead with your question.","Donald Broughton","Good morning gentlemen.","Lance Fritz","Good morning Don.","Donald Broughton","Help me understand better core pricing, obviously it's a very challenging environment as you reported your core pricing essentially cut in half over the last four or five quarters. Does your reported 2% core pricing represent the pricing achieved on all new contracts settled in that quarter -- for instance the 2% being just those settled in the second quarter or does that represent the amount of year-over-year gains made in your overall book of business?","Robert Knight","Yeah, Don, this is Rob. The way we calculate that core price number is what do we actually yield in the quarter from our pricing actions and as you think note when we calculations that I'm proud to say is ultraconservative and that is we take it across our entire book of revenue even as a work contracts that are being repriced in that particular timeframe it is what do we yield overall.","And would also just want to of course as you know given that calculation when we don't have the benefit of positive growth in commodities like coal, we obviously no longer have any of the legacy renewals, I mean that's part of the change if you look at where we are today versus where we were a year plus ago.","Donald Broughton","What a second Rob, I'm a little confused. So, it's the contracts reset in the quarter and their effect in the overall book is that what you mean?","Robert Knight","No, it's not necessarily what was reset in the quarter but what dollars. The calculus is simply what dollars to be a from price increases during the quarter. So, if perhaps was something that was reset prior to the quarter, but that's -- and again what did we yield against our entire book of revenue.","Donald Broughton","So, the denominator in the equation is the overall book of business?","Robert Knight","That's right","Donald Broughton","So, that means the core pricing to deteriorate from 4% to 3.5% to 3% to 2.5% to 2%, it means the pricing you are cheating on all new contracts is actually less than 2%.","Eric Butler","Don, there's a number of moving parts and Rob just walked you through them. One thing that's happening is we might've achieved incremental price on a piece of business that isn\u2019t moving or isn\u2019t moving at the same volume. So, we don't get the benefit of that price. It doesn't affect the topline. It could be that ALF is changing period-to-period there is a number of moving parts there you can't just presume the calculus is lower yields period-to-period.","Donald Broughton","Right. But if the -- for the overall -- if the denominator is the overall book of business in the rate increase has to be less than what the core is that you are stating no matter how perverse the mix gets?","Robert Knight","We're agreeing that the yield from the pricing this quarter for lots of different reasons was lower","Donald Broughton","Okay. So, then let me ask another question is there a floor -- is there a rate of core pricing at which you're going to simply draw the line and say no, we will not accept less pricing than that, we'll lose the volume if we have to, but we're not going to accept a lower level of pricing than say 1% or 1.5% or 2%.","Eric Butler","Don, we've stated even earlier in this call there is a floor and a floor is it re-investable and does it reflect the value that we are delivering to that particular customer market. So, we don't think of floors in terms of percent yield or percent price, with think of floors in terms of if that piece of business or book of business does not re-investable, it becomes much less attractive to us and we have demonstrated over a long period of time that we will choose not to pursue business that does not generate an attractive financial return over a long period of time.","Donald Broughton","That's absolute to. Fair enough. Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Our next question is from the lien of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please proceed with your questions.","Keith Schoonmaker","Thank you. I'd like to ask a bit more about the automotive franchise, but with a long-term focus. First, what portion of the automotive portfolio consist of moves to or from Mexico? And could you describe the positive and negative impact to your franchise from production shift in New Mexico compared to prior production locations?","Eric Butler","Yeah. So, about half of our franchises to or from Mexico that's all unfinished vehicles and parts. We -- the Mexico volume is growing as you know. Historically, it was like 2 million vehicles, I think they are probably up to about 3.7 million vehicles produced in Mexico. The forecasts is they are going to get close to about 5 million vehicles produced in Mexico.","We think we have a great Mexico franchise. We're the only railroad that has real connectivity to all six rail border crossings. We have great interline business relationships with every railroad in Mexico. We also have multimodal relationships that we are working with and Mexico. So, we think we have eight great franchise and will partake in that uptake over time.","Keith Schoonmaker","And so the shift in general [Indiscernible] production in Mexico as opposed to in U.S. or Canada is a positive from revenue gains or is it negative due to other factors like length of hall?","Eric Butler","So, there's a lot of factors that go I would say generally we think the net shift is a positive for our franchise.","Keith Schoonmaker","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions\/","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks very much. Any industrial production in the industrial product segment, you called out the severe weather in Texas in the quarter but otherwise, very strong construction activity. Could you just speak to kind of the 2Q to 3Q dynamic there and the trend in the back half assuming that we don't have bad weather events coming forward. Thanks.","Eric Butler","We see a normal cyclical pick up as you go through the 2Q to the 3Q just because the summer construction season that we see across most of our serving territory. Don't have as much construction in the winter as you do in the summer as we do expect to see sequential pick up.","You also are seeing some strengthening in housing starts not as much as you would expect waste on the demographic trends. We think that's a positive for the long-term for our business because the demographic trends are suggesting there has to be a stronger pick up than what we've seen. So you are still seeing that along with the cyclical trends so we think sequentially that will be positive for us.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. And then just on this the new potential minimum crew size rule as being considered, could you just discussed the company perspective and perceived timing on if shop should happen if you would approach that?","Lance Fritz","Thank you, Scott. Regarding the FRA's proposed rule on minimum crew size, historically that has been a topic for collective bargaining over the past number of decades and we believe that's where it belongs.","There is no evidence that criticize is related to safety. The FRA stated that in the preamble to their own rule. The NTSB, the National Transportation Safety Board has also stated that they see no empirical evidence between crew size and safety.","Having said that, we do not have any plan right now to reduce crew size in our locomotives. What we think should happen is we should allow technology to take its course and determine when it's appropriate for some of the work to be removed from the cab and to be placed somewhere else.","There is an amount of work that gets done for every train and that work needs to be done. It's just a matter of where it will be done. So, that's our perspective on that.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back to Mr. Lance Fritz for closing remarks.","Lance Fritz","Thank you, Rob, and thank you all for your questions and interest in Union Pacific this morning. We look forward to talking with you again in October.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference.

[Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you. Mr. Fritz, you may begin.","Lance Fritz","Good morning, everybody and welcome to Union Pacific's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me here today in Omaha are Eric Butler, our Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Cameron Scott, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.2 billion, or $1.30 per share for the first quarter of 2015. This is a 9% increase in earnings per share compared to the first quarter of 2014. Solid core pricing gains in the quarter were partially offset by a sharp drop in volume. While we took actions during the quarter to adjust for the volume decline, we did not run an efficient operation.","Total first quarter volumes were down 2%, with particular softness in coal, industrial products and intermodal. Throughout last year, we worked to add the people, locomotives and capacity needed to meet a dramatic increase in demand. By the end of 2014, we had seen full-year volume growth of 7% and we were fully resourced to meet this demand. Over the last few months, however, volume has shifted negative. As a result, our operation is in catch-up mode and not as efficient as it should be.","Managing a network is a constant balancing act to ensure you have the right resources in the right place at the right time. This balancing act becomes more difficult during significant volume swings. We're taking the steps to align our resources with current demand, while remaining agile in an ever-changing environment. We remain committed to safely providing excellent service for our customers while improving that service and our financial performance. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric.","Eric Butler","Thanks, Lance and good morning. In the first quarter our volume was down 2%, driven by challenges in some key markets. Automotive and ag products volume grew with declines in coal, industrial products, intermodal and chemicals. Milder winter weather and natural gas prices drove softer coal demand, lower crude oil prices reduced demand for shale-related shipments and we also experienced the effects from the drawn-out west coast labor port dispute. I'll talk about more specifics as we walk through each group.","Fuel surcharge revenue reduction negatively impacted average revenue per car and was a 4% head wind on freight revenue. However, solid pricing gains across our business led to a core price improvement of 4%, which combined with a 1% mix and drove average revenue per car up 1%. Overall freight revenue was down 1% as the strong pricing gains and mix were offset by lower volume and fuel surcharge revenue.","Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups. Ag products revenue increased by 3%, on a 3% volume increase and a 1% improvement in average revenue per car. Grain volume was down 2% this quarter. We continue to see strong demand for overseas export feed grain shipments, particularly through the Gulf and Mississippi River. Those gains were offset primarily by declines in wheat exports and to a lesser degree, softer demand for domestic feed grain.","Grain products volume was up 4% for the quarter. Ethanol volume grew 7%, driven by increased gasoline consumption and export demand. We also saw increased export demand for soybean meal and a strong canola crop drove increases in canola meal shipments. Food and refrigerated shipments were up 3%, driven primarily by continued strength in import beer, partially offset by slightly lower refrigerated food shipments.","Automotive revenue was up 6% in the first quarter on a 7% increase in volume, partially offset by a 1% reduction in average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments were up 11% this quarter, driven by continued strength in consumer demand and reduced impact from winter weather. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for North American automotive sales was 16.6 million vehicles in the first quarter, up 6.4% from the same quarter in 2014. Auto parts volume grew 3% this quarter, driven primarily by increased vehicle production.","Chemicals revenue was flat for the quarter, with a 2% improvement in average revenue per car offsetting a 1% volume decline. Plastics shipments were up 8% in the first quarter, as stability in resin prices resulted in improved buyer confidence in the market. Strength in fertilizer demand this quarter drove volume up 10%. The slight delay in last fall's harvest pushed some application into the first quarter of this year. We also saw strength in export markets, particularly to China. Finally, lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads continue to impact our crude oil shipments, which were down 38% for the first quarter.","Coal revenue declined 5% in the first quarter. Volumes were down 7%, partially offset by a 3% improvement in average revenue per car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 1% for the quarter. We experienced a very mild winter this year, which combined with low natural gas prices to reduce demand for coal. Colorado Utah tonnage was down 32% for the quarter, as a mild winter and low natural gas prices drove receiving utilities to switch to other fuel sources. Colorado Utah tonnage was also impacted by soft demand for coal exports.","Industrial products revenue was up 1%, as a 3% decline in volume was offset by a 3% improvement in average revenue per car. We continue to see strength in construction products, where volume was up 4% for the first quarter. Demand for rock was strong in the quarter, particularly in the southern part of our franchise. Metals volume was down 17%, as lower crude oil prices significantly reduced new drilling activity. In addition, the strong U.S. dollar drove increased imports, which reduced demand from domestic steel producers. Our government and waste shipments declined 8% in the quarter, primarily driven by a temporary reduction in short-haul waste shipments.","As a side note, our minerals business was not a key driver in industrial products this quarter; but I wanted to mention the fact that our frack sand volume was up 3%. Demand remains strong in January, but tailed off significantly in March. I will talk more about our outlook in a moment.","Turning to intermodal, revenue was down 5%, driven by a 3% decrease in both volume and average revenue per unit. Due to the structure of intermodal fuel surcharge programs, there was a greater average revenue per unit impact to intermodal this quarter than seen in other commodities. Domestic shipments grew 9% in the first quarter, setting an all-time first-quarter record for volume. We continued to see strong demand from highway conversions and for our new premium services.","International intermodal volume was down 12%, driven by the west coast port labor dispute, which stretched late into the quarter. We're encouraged that the parties have come to a tentative agreement and we're working with our customers to reduce the backlog and return to normal.","Let's take a look at our outlook for the rest of the year. In ag products, we expect grain volume to return to normal seasonal patterns through the third quarter and we anticipate exports will favor shorter-haul shipment to the Gulf and river in the near-term. As always, we're keeping a close eye on planning reports and the weather to determine what the next crop will look like. In grain products, we think the ethanol market will remain strong and DDGs will remain steady throughout the year. Finally, we anticipate continued strength in our import beer business and we see potential upside in refrigerated shipments.","In automotive, finished vehicles and auto shipments should continue to benefit from strength in sales, driven by a healthy U.S. economy, replacement demand and lower gasoline prices. Coal volume will largely be dependent on the weather this summer and natural gas prices. If natural gas prices remain in the current range, it will be a head wind throughout the year. Also, the latest inventory figures show that stockpiles are significantly up from last year and are now above the five-year historical average, which will likely lead to continued softness.","We think most of our chemicals markets will remain solid this year, though we expect that crude oil prices will remain a significant head wind for crude by rail shipments for the rest of the year. Lower crude oil prices will also impact some of our industrial products markets. We expect metals to continue to experience head winds, as capital investments for new drilling activities are reduced. As I mentioned earlier, frack sand shipments were up modestly in the first quarter, but we expect to be meaningfully lower year over year, starting in the second quarter, as demand softens and we come up against tougher comps.","On the positive side, we think continued strength in the construction and housing market should drive growth in aggregates and lumber. Finally, we anticipate strong demand for domestic intermodal to continue throughout the year, primarily from highway conversions. For international intermodal, we expect a backlog recovery to continue for the next few weeks, then return to normal seasonal patterns for the remainder of the year. Both domestic and international intermodal should benefit from the strength in consumer demand in the U.S..","To wrap up, we're experiencing some volume head winds created by uncertainty in the coal market and crude oil prices, but we see opportunities in other markets. While top-line revenue will be impacted by lower fuel surcharge revenue, we expect solid core pricing gains for the year. As always, our strong value proposition and diverse franchise will support new business development efforts throughout the year. With that, I will turn it over to Cameron.","Cameron Scott","Thanks, Eric and good morning. I'll start with our safety performance, which is the foundation of our operations. The first quarter 2015 reportable personal injury rate improved 23% versus 2014 to a record low of 0.85%. These results are a validation that our comprehensive safety strategy is working and we're focused on the right things. I am very proud of the team's commitment to find and address risk in the work place.","In rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate increased 6% to 3.16. To make improvement going forward, we continue to focus on enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investment to help reduce the absolute number of incidents, including those that do not meet regulatory reportable thresholds.","In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 27% versus 2014 to a first-quarter record mark of 1.88. Our strategy of reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns is generating results and we will continue our focus in these areas to drive further improvement. In summary, the team has made a nice step function improvement in several areas that is generating results on our way towards an incident-free environment.","Moving to network performance, as we discussed, we worked hard in 2014 to match network resources with the robust volume levels of 2014. During the latter part of the fourth quarter, our available resources were largely aligned with demand, helping generate the sequential velocity improvement in the network. While we have largely held those velocity levels made in December, we still have more work to do as we exit the first quarter that provided more favorable weather conditions, but one that also saw more extensive track renewal programs on key corridors.","While our velocity in the first quarter was almost one mile an hour faster than the first quarter of 2014, our service performance still fell short. As reported to the AAR, first-quarter velocity and freight car dwell were about flat when compared to the first quarter of 2014. However, the team continues a relentless push to improve service and reduce costs. While productivity was not where we wanted it to be, we did generate some efficiencies, even with the decline in volumes during the first quarter. We achieved record train lengths in nearly all major categories, including in automotive, where we leveraged an 11% increase in finished vehicle shipments, with a 5% increase in average auto train length.","Our terminal productivity initiatives also continue to generate positive results, as car switch per employee day increased 3%. But our sub-optimal services performance and timing issues with readjusting resources lead to inefficiencies during the quarter. One example of this is locomotive productivity, as measured by gross ton miles per horsepower day, which was down 6% versus 2014.","As for our efforts to readjust resources, while we chase volume up -- while we chased volume on the way up last year, it's been a different story in the first part of 2015, with some softer volumes we have seen thus far. To balance our resources to current demand, we have placed around 500 TE&Y employees into furlough or alternative work status. We have also reduced our original TE&Y hiring plan downward by 400 and are now planning to hire around 2,400 TE&Y employees for the year. Of course, we will continue to monitor and adjust our work force levels and hiring plans throughout the year as volume dictates.","The same process is under way with our locomotives. By the end of the quarter, we had already moved 475 units back into storage and continue to look at every opportunity to further reduce our active fleet. Also, our planned acquisition of 218 units this year will further improve our overall reliability and efficiency. We have experienced a timing lag in getting our resources aligned with demand, but we're intently focused on balancing our resources and reducing our costs as the year progresses.","We're also adjusting our 2015 capital program down $100 million to approximately $4.2 billion. We will continue to invest to improve the safety and resiliency of the network, including more than $1.8 billion in infrastructure replacement programs. Our capital program also includes continued investment for service, growth and productivity, which are primarily concentrated on the southern region of our network; but which also include corridor strategies that reduce bottlenecks across the system.","This reduction does not impact our core investment strategy, which is to maintain a safe, strong and resilient network and to invest in service growth and productivity projects where returns can justify the investment.","I would also like to give a quick update on positive train control. As most of you know, the rail industry has been required to install PTC by the end of 2015. The required development and testing of this new technology has been challenging. Nonetheless, we have been moving forward, investing approximately $1.7 billion thus far to complete the mandate. Now that the scope of the project has been better defined, we've updated our total project investment in PTC to approximately $2.5 billion.","Although UP will not meet the current 2015 deadline, we have been making good faith effort to do so, including field testing since October 2013. The industry has been working to extend the deadline and I think there is general understanding on Capitol Hill that this has to happen. While we remain hopeful that an extension will be passed, our overall investment in the program will not be contingent on the deadline.","To wrap up, as we continue on in 2015, we expect to continue generating record safety results on our way to an incident-free environment. We expect to leverage the strengths of our franchise to improved network performance. We will invest in the resources and network capacity needed to overcome congestion and generate productivity gains; and we will remain agile, balancing and adjusting resources depending upon demand to drive improved cost performance. Ultimately, running a safe, reliable and efficient railroad creates value for our customers and increased returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.","Rob Knight","Thanks and good morning. Let's start with a recap of first-quarter results. Operating revenue was flat with last year at just over $5.6 billion. Strong core pricing was offset by declines in fuel surcharge revenue and total volumes. Operating expenses totaled just over $3.6 billion, decreasing 4% when compared to last year. The net result was operating income growing 7% to about $2 billion.","Below the line, other income totaled $26 million, down from $38 million in 2014. Interest expense of $148 million was up 11% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during 2014 and at the beginning of 2015. Income tax expense increased to $704 million, driven primarily by higher pre-tax earnings. Net income grew 6% versus last year, while the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce quarterly earnings of $1.30 per share, up 9% versus last year.","Now turning to our top line, freight revenue of about $5.3 billion was down 1% versus last year. In addition to a 2% volume decline, fuel surcharge revenue was down about $200 million when compared to 2014. The decline in fuel price was partially offset by the positive lag in the fuel surcharge programs.","All in, we estimate the net impact of reduced fuel prices added about $0.08 to earnings in the first quarter versus last year. This includes both the fuel surcharge lag and lower diesel costs. In the second quarter, we expect the net earnings impact of reduced fuel prices to be closer to neutral.","Business mix was slightly positive for the quarter, driven by a decline in lower average revenue per car international intermodal shipments. Looking ahead, given the volume shifts between our commodity groups, business mix is likely to have a negative impact on freight revenue's beginning in the second quarter.","Slide 23 provides more detail on our core pricing trends. First quarter core pricing came in at 4%, reflecting a more favorable pricing environment in 2015. This represents a full point to sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of last year. Of this, about 0.5% reflects the benefit of legacy business that we renewed earlier this year. This includes both the 2015 and 2016 legacy contract renewals.","Moving on to the expense side, Slide 24 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which increased 9% versus 2014. Lower volumes were more than offset by labor inflation, increased training expense and lower productivity. Looking at our total work force levels, our employee count was up 6% when compared to 2014. About a quarter of this increase was in our capital-related work force.","As Cam just discussed, we're adjusting our total hiring downward to better balance our resources. The largest hiring area will continue to be in the TE&Y ranks. In total, when you factor in attrition, training, furloughs and volume levels, we expect our net overall work force levels to be around 48,000 by year end, about flat with year-end 2014.","Labor inflation was about 6% for the first quarter, driven primarily by agreement wage inflation and will likely continue to be in the 6% range for the second quarter, as well. Keep in mind that the first and second quarters include the 3% agreement wage increase effective the first of this year, on top of 3.5% wage increase from last July. For the full year, we still expect labor inflation to be about 5%, including pension.","Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $564 million, down 39% when compared to 2014. Lower diesel fuel prices, along with a 1% decline in gross ton miles, drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 1%, while our average fuel price declined 38% to $1.95 per gallon.","Moving on to our other expense categories, purchased services and materials expense increased 6% to $643 million. Increased locomotive and freight car material costs were the primary drivers. Depreciation expense was $490 million, up 6% compared to 2014. We expect depreciation expense to increase about 6% for the full year.","Slide 27 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $311 million, which is flat when compared to 2014. Other expenses came in at $259 million, up $33 million versus last year. Higher state and local taxes and casualty costs contributed to the year-over-year increase. For 2015, we still expect the other expense line to increase between 5% and 10% on a full-year basis, excluding any unusual items.","Turning to our operating ratio performance, we achieved a quarterly operating ratio of 64.8%, improving 2.3 points when compared to 2014. Our operating ratio benefited about three points from lower fuel prices, including the fuel surcharge lag. Keep in mind, however, we also lost the revenue benefit from our energy-related volumes as energy prices declined.","Turning now to our cash flow, in the first quarter, cash from operations increased to just under $2.1 billion. This is up 17% compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher earnings and the timing of cash tax payments. We also invested about $1.1 billion this quarter in cash capital investments. As Cameron just noted, we now intend to spend about $4.2 billion in capital for the full year, down about $100 million from our previous estimate.","Given the sharp decline in fuel surcharge revenue, capital spending well likely be greater than the 17% of revenue this year. Longer term, however, we still expect capital spending to be about 16% to 17% of revenue, assuming of course that fuel returns to somewhat higher levels.","One housekeeping item to note on the cash flow statement. As you know, in the first quarter we changed the timing of our quarterly dividend payments so that the cash outlay occurs in the quarter for which the dividend is declared. As a result, we had two dividend payments during the quarter -- one for the fourth quarter of 2014 and one for the first quarter of this year. This is the only time we will see this, this year.","Together, these payments totaled about $922 million. We also increased our first-quarter dividend by 10%. This is in line with our commitment to grow the dividend payout target to 35%. Taking a look at the balance sheet, our adjusted debt balance grew to $15.6 billion at quarter end, up from $14.9 billion at year end. This takes our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio to 42.6%, up from 41.3% at year-end 2014. We remain committed to an adjusted debt-to-cap ratio in the low to mid- 40% range and an adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.5 plus. We feel our current cash outlook positions us well to execute on our cash allocation strategy.","Our profitability and strong cash generation enable us to continue to fund our strong capital program and to grow shareholder returns. In the first quarter, we bought back about 6.9 million shares, totaling $807 million. Between the first-quarter dividend and our share repurchases, we returned about $1.3 billion to our shareholders in the quarter. This represents roughly a 23% increase over 2014, demonstrating our commitment to increasing shareholder value.","That's a recap of the first-quarter results. As we look towards the second quarter and the remainder of the year, there are a number of factors that we'll be watching very closely. On the revenue side, we expect a favorable pricing environment to continue, supported by improving service and our strong value proposition. We remain committed to solid core pricing above inflation.","As for volume, the outlook is a little more uncertain. The recent challenges that we've seen in coal and in the shale-related markets are likely to continue. At this point, we think coal volumes in the second quarter could be down in the mid-single-digit range versus 2014, with ongoing softness throughout most of the year, as Eric discussed earlier.","For the year, strength in other areas could offset these headwinds, depending on what happens to the drivers, ranging from consumer spending to the size of the 2015 grain harvest. Of course, as I previously noted, the volume mix shifts could also have a negative revenue impact. We will just have to see how it all plays out this year.","From the cost perspective, the second quarter will likely still reflect some impacts of operating inefficiencies, although as Cameron noted, we will see gradual improvement in productivity over time. As I mentioned earlier, if fuel prices stay close to where they are today, the net impact on earnings should be neutral for the remaining quarters of the year. Taken together, we have our work cut out for us again in 2015, but we will continue our unrelenting focus on safety, service and shareholder returns. With that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.","Lance Fritz","Thanks, Rob. As you've heard from the team, we've had some challenges to start off the year; but we're taking the steps needed to work through those challenges and realize the opportunities we see ahead. As Eric mentioned, weakness in our coal and shale-related markets could persist for some time; but we continue to see gradual improvement in the underlying economy, which should be a positive for other parts of our business.","When you consider other wild cards, from the next grain harvest to the strength of the U.S. dollar, it all adds up to a dynamic environment. That's the nature of our business. Our goal is to provide our customers with excellent service wherever the need arises. We expect to see solid improvement in network performance and cost efficiency over the coming months. As we leverage the strengths of our diverse franchise, we continue to be intently focused on safety, service and shareholder returns.","Now let's open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. ","Tom Wadewitz","First I wanted to ask you on coal, it seems like the macro backdrop's pretty challenging. You acknowledge that -- particularly, low natural gas prices. But I'm wondering, your mid-single-digit decline seems somewhat optimistic versus the trend we have seen recently. There's been more like, I don't know, down 10%, 15%. What is it that leads you to say mid-single-digit instead of worse and how much visibility do you have to that?","Lance Fritz","Eric, do you want to take care of that?","Eric Butler","Yes. As you know, Tom, a lot of factors go into play, as there was a relatively mild winter, a narrow serving territory of our utilities. The heating days were down 5% to 10% versus last year. We're assuming more normal weather patterns for the balance of the year. That clearly is a factor. The other factor, as you know, is this is typically the shelf months. We see this every year where you don't really have heating or cooling during the spring. Again, we're assuming we're going to get back to normal, seasonal weather patterns. As we mentioned, natural gas prices -- what happens with that will have an impact. A lot of factors, but that's our best assessment at this time.","Tom Wadewitz","The second or the follow-up question on the resource levels, you indicated a number of times that inefficiency, or let's say a time lag in resource production versus volume. How do we think about how that will play through in second quarter? Do you catch up pretty quickly and see reduction in resources? Do you expect train speed to improve? How do you think that plays out in terms of the margin performance? Does that really kick in and support margin improvement, or is that something where the revenue head wind is more the dominant factor in terms of, again, looking how that affects the OR or the margin performance?","Lance Fritz","Sure, Tom. Thinking about the time lag. We talked to you all last year about trying to catch up with the volume. Then in the fourth quarter, we indicated we had finally caught up and were fully resourced. Then coming into the first quarter of this year, volume shifted what I would consider fairly dramatically to be negative, ending up 2% down. It's really all about being caught in a rip tide, being behind the curve in terms of getting our resources right-sized.","When we look forward into the second quarter, we have indicated that we're anticipating better service and better efficiency. We haven't put a stake in the ground and said exactly how that happens, but we anticipate -- and I see it happening right now on the network -- we anticipate continuous improvement as Cameron and his team get the business right-sized. Rob or Cam, any additional comments?","Eric Butler","I would add to that list them. We're always focused on improving the margins. As Lance pointed out, we're focused on continually spruce bit on the cause the balancing the network. We will have challenges as I pointed out of the mix yet we anticipate taking hold in second quarter and beyond. Even with all of that activity, we're always going to be focused on improving are margins of where we're today.","Operator","Next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question. ","David Vernon","First question on the top-line. If you think about the range of potential downside on the frac business, have you guys try to look into that at all as far as how much demand maybe down as we get into second quarter?","Lance Fritz","Yes so a lot of things can change that or drive that, as you know, particularly, coal prices. We look at the outlook right now. We see a mid- teens kind of a range. We see our business to look more like '13 volumes than '14 volumes.","David Vernon","Okay and then maybe a quick follow-up, the core pricing gains of 4%, I think, Rob call you mentioned inflation is going to be on the labor side, unusually high this year because of the new labor agreement. How do we think about that in terms of your expectation about pricing above inflation? Are you expecting more productivity for back half of this year? How do we think about the pricing inflation relationship? Or do we think that pricing that he gets better in the 2nd and 3rd quarter as reported?","Lance Fritz","David, just to [indiscernible] question, we have been consistent and clear that when we're pricing in the marketplace we're pricing for our value proposition. Whatever either Eric or Rob want to comment on, it's in that context, our pricing in the marketplace is our volume.","Lance Fritz","I want to say, David, long-term view is pricing above in place in. Not necessarily core pricing [indiscernible] to inflation and we expect higher labor inflation. Overall, for the year, expect overall company inflation to be in the 3%, 4% range. That gives you a guiding light in spite of the challenges we know we're going to face on the labor line. Overall, companywide we think about 3% copper% rate for the year.","David Vernon","The 4% includes the legacy reprice, right?","Lance Fritz","To make the first quarter does include legacy for pricing, yes.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Rob Salmon","As a clarification to David's last question in you're prepared remarks, Rob. You had indicated that the core pricing accelerated to 4% in the first quarter. I think you had mentioned that roughly half of that was attributable to legacy. Was that half of the step up from three to four or just half of the four in aggregate?","Rob Knight","Let me clarify that. Of the 4% core pricing reported in first quarter one-half of a point of that. 3.5% to 4%. .5% was attributable to the legacy renewals.","Rob Salmon","I appreciate the clarification. Kind of taking a step back to going back to investor day, toward the end of 2014, you had indicated that your longer-term full-year volume outlook is positive. I guess given the drop-off that we have seen in terms of shale-related business and coal challenges you indicated, as well as uncertainty in terms of [indiscernible] you still have confidence that the volume growth in aggregate will be positive or do you see that a little bit more challenging as we look out from here?","Lance Fritz","I will let Rob answer that in a little more in detail but, the thing that we think about is the beauty of our franchise, the strength of our franchise and all of the opportunity that it represents. We've have got a diverse book of business and over time we have seen that there are always areas where we can develop more business and grow. And so we feel still quite bullish about in the long term being able to grow based on this great franchise.","Rob Knight","Lance, I would add your comment caught we know we have some challenges right now but if you look at the UP franchise, it's a fabulous franchise that has great optimism long-term. . inventories are high right now, gas prices are low, energy prices are low which is impacting our frac business.","All of those are going to balance out over the long-term. You add-on top of that what's happening in the chemical franchise, the opportunities still in front of us longer-term with the investments being laid in the Gulf. You look at Mexico franchise and we're the only rebel that interchanges at the six border crossing and look at all of the opportunities taking place there. You look at our strong auto franchise. You add it all up. The diversity of our business mix and strength of our franchise caught long-term supervised a stronger optimism which is why we make think longer-term expectation still is volume will be on positive side of the ledger.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Greene","Rob can I ask you to put, maybe if you can little bit finer point on some of the challenges on the cost side in the first quarter? I think, last year, the sort of estimated we had about a $35 million headwind from the weather.","Can you estimate what the headwind is from some of the inefficiencies that occurred in the network this quarter?","Rob Knight","Bill, you are right. Last year we pulled in about $35 million of a deficiency tied too significant weather events, primarily in Chicago area. This year clearly our cost performance in the first quarter is not we would like it to be. If you take fuel off of the table, our costs were about to enter billion dollars up year-over-year. It's a combination of things that we all had talked about this morning. We had some timing issues. We've resourced for unexpected coming into the quarter higher level of volume.","We had some mechanical activities that we took on that I would categorize as timing. And then as we pointed out with had inefficiencies in the network. Without putting a splitting hairs in terms of where those dollars are, we think they are all there for us to right-size the network. If you look at what you would have expected if you are running optimally and had you had things timed up a little bit better, you probably had a negative in the quarter of about 122-point in operating ratio. That's how I would look at it.","Bill Greene","Okay and then your point about second quarter is it will still take some time for the network to get to the operating efficiencies that you want. Maybe it will be less than the first quarter impact but still meaningful. Is that what you were trying to communicate?","Lance Fritz","Yes and, Cameron, why don't you walk us through a little bit about the activities that are underway to get these things right-size and get your--","Cameron Scott","We still have work to do that we think we can eventually right-size the network in the second quarter. As Rob mentioned, we do think there was some inefficiencies throughout the quarter but the rightsizing of our locomotive fleet, weekly we review opportunities to store additional locomotives and several times a month we're also rightsizing our hiring plans as we look out for the remainder of the year.","Bill Greene","Okay. Rob, let me ask you one last wish into that here. Just on share buybacks, how opportunistic can you be or is the first quarter run rate kind of what we should expect? I mean, if the shares are down a fair amount can you wrap this up? Do you feel you would rather have a BA consistent buyback each quarter?","Rob Knight","As you know, our approach has always then and we'll continue to be opportunistic in the marketplace. We don't have a set number of dollars or shares we will buyback inning in any quarter but I will assure you will continue to be opportunistic as we move forward. The current price is frankly an opportunity for us.","Operator","Our next questions is coming from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Oglenski","Lance, in context, your 1st quarter wasn't that bad. Earnings were up 9% even with all of the challenges you had and yet it sounded like the tone from everyone on the call here is that we're not too happy with that. Obviously, we could have done better. It did miss Wall Street expectations here and I think over the long run, you guys have them better at staying at expectations relative to some of the other stocks in the space. I think investors have reported your company for that. As I hear it from some of the questions and the answers here, it sounds like we still have crossed challenges. ","We're catching up for new volume reality. We don't know energy and coal markets are going to shake out. As your content more difficult on earnings growth this year, consistent reps a plop in 2015. Is a getting more challenging to see double-digit growth this year? I know you don't want to explicitly guy but can you help folks on this call understand where these year could shakeout?","Lance Fritz","Sure, Brandon and you're exactly right. We're not going to speak specifically about what to expect from the year from percentage perspective. I think you've got the tone pretty well right.","When I look at the first quarter, I am proud of the hard work that the team did in terms of trying to get the cost suggested to the volume reality. I'm disappointed that we couldn't have done better because we, here at the table, see the opportunity of what the franchise really has the ability to deliver. Having said that, I am confident as I look forward that are operating team and all of the teams are focused on doing the right thing.","As we look forward, we're adjusting to current volumes at the same time as we're trying to determine what this peak season and looked like and what the growth rate look like from here. I will tell you, there is no change in my confidence both this year and over the long run of being able to generate out of this wonderful business, this beautiful franchise, the kind of financial performance and return generation that you have seen historically. As we have said before, it gets more difficult from 65% or 64%, 63% operating ratio, but we remain absolutely confident it's there, we will realize it and continue to realize it.","Brandon Oglenski","Could you maybe talk a little bit more explicitly about some of the drivers of margin improvement this year outside of the benefit from the fuel surcharge? It seems like you do have a bit of compensation benefit headwind given the wage increases. Obviously, if volume could come in flat or maybe even negative for the year given some of the uncertainty, what's the ability to drive leverage in the business then?","Lance Fritz","So Brandon, I think Rob and the team have outlined a core portion of that this morning which is, as we look forward as Eric said, we're in an environment where pricing, core pricing gains looks good. Cameron and team are working on rightsizing the business and generating efficiencies through the UP way and taking variable out of the network and looking for all other opportunities to generate margin improvement. Rob, anything else you want too at?","Rob Knight","I would just remind you that it's the same levers that have got us from where we were many years ago to where we're today. While volume is our friend how we don't use it as an excuse. You saw us perform well in years when volume did not play to our benefit. We know we have some challenges here with volumes. We've got challenges with mix as I called out but we're going to continue to be relentlessly focused on cost control and cost management, as Lance and Cameron have outlined. As Eric talked about, pricing's note key driver. We improved by the proposition and marketplace and pricing will continue to be a strong driver of that. To get to are longer-term widens of a 60 plus or minus operating ratio by full-year 2019, it's going to take those same efforts and same focus from the organization that we're going to continue to focus on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee","I just want to try to understand a little bit better about sort of what the outlook was internally as you guys thought about 2015 and in particular the volume opportunity. I know you were looking for any positive volumes for the full-year and that was rolled in question, we have had tough comps sort of understood coming up in that next quarters. As you're trying to adjust to volume environment, I'm trying to understand where your heads were at coming into this year versus where we're now. It seems maybe a little bit bigger of a change than anticipated. And what to make sure I understand that.","Lance Fritz","Chris, we don't specifically address what our budgets are forecast coming into the year. What I will say is the big change is actual growth and then actual decline. The biggest change there was coal which was somewhat surprising in terms of how weak it turned out quickly. Of course we had difficulty with the West coast ports and labor dispute. We have pretty good visibility to that. Looking forward, Eric, why don't you talk to us about what your markets look like as you look into the future.","Rob Knight","Yes, I think what Lance said is accurate. The big swing, especially first quarter, we talked about the international intermodal West coast port labor dispute and we think will kind of normalized throughout the year but the big swing factor is coal. As you know, Chris, as you go back really probably four months, oil price outlook for the year was still up in the 90s and is now in the 50s. Of course, that had a swing factor that is impacting broad swaps of the market also.","Chris Wetherbee","I guess that certainly makes sense. Maybe sticking on that coal question and maybe one for you, Eric, in terms of mid- single digit outlook in the second quarter that you are thinking about Colorado Utah underperformed pretty meaningfully relative to PRB in the first quarter. Is that inherit in the second quarter outlook would you expect PRB to soften a bit on comps and then you still have weakness in Colorado Utah? I'm just trying to get a rough sense of how you think about coal?","Lance Fritz","The mid- single-digit assumes a continued profile with Colorado Utah Copper to get her to come because we're not expecting export markets to pick up significantly this year.","Chris Wetherbee","So will be roughly more performance we have seen?","Lance Fritz","Thereabouts caught driven, again, by weather and natural gas prices.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group","Rob, I wanted to ask you about some of the yield drivers in terms of how much of a negative to you think makes could be in the second quarter? And then on the pricing, the 50 basis points from the legacy pricing, maybe is a little lower than would have expected. Wondering if that's a timing issue and that Rams or is this the volumes are down which limits the impact of the legacy repricing and it's going to stay about 50 basis points the rest of the year?","Rob Knight","Yes let me address the mix comment. As you know, we don't give specific guidance around mix because there's come again , beauty of our franchise is we have a lot of diverse business opportunities. As a result, not common to have a fair amount of mix. We're highlighting that given the change anticipated in both the coal and fracking environment. And continued strength in our intermodal that's likely versus the first quarter, likely to be a bit of a mix headwind as the rest of the year plays out.","How precise that will be, we will have to see. I'm not going to give precise guidance around that. In terms of your pricing question on the legacy contributor, as I have always said, you can't straight-line. Don't take what we repriced in past years on legacy and assume that each contract is the same. They are all different. That was what those contracts on a GAAP to market and that's what we took them up too. To your point, broadly, not just on legacy but I would say broadly, the way we look conservative Lee at calculating our prices, you know, the fact that volume was down in some key markets did have a negative impact on the way we continued brute price. I view that as positive as volumes recover we expect to enjoy the improved returns on those business volumes we have been able to reprice.","Scott Group","Okay and the contract you repriced 416, is that showed up in this number already? Were they just right at the actual impact does not show up until mixture?","Rob Knight","It's also in that number.","Scott Group","Okay. And last thing, just to go back to the question about the buybacks. Was your point about the extra dividend payment in the quarter, in your mind, does that have an impact on how much you bought back the first quarter? And as you go to a more normalized dividend just once a quarter, there's more or less for the buyback or they are independent? ","Lance Fritz","They are independent. I was just calling out folks understood there were two differ payments in the quarter. I would not make any correlation to that on my share buyback pace.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter","Just kind of a follow up on some of the volume commentary. Maybe Eric, just talk a little bit, a little bit on chemicals given that usually a precursor for a comedy and we see trend week lately. Longer-term your looking at plant opening up a Gulf region but more in near-term this year, is that a precursor for industrial side of the comment? Given set their.","Eric Butler","As you know chemicals business improved by rail was actually pretty good on the first quarter. We were up one percentage, two percentage points in the first quarter net accrued by rail. We think that is a precursor to the economy. Plastics business really ties pretty closely to construction and automotive and all of those and even on consumer side and retail side of house call plastics business was up in first quarter as we mentioned. We think that all of those trends indicate the strengthening North American economy. As Rob said earlier, we had some headwinds and coal, some headwinds we shale stuff that if you net that out, we feel pretty good about some of the underlying strength of the economy.","Ken Hoexter","Just a follow-up, Lance, maybe there is a lot of discussion at out east and in Canada about industry consolidation. Can you address union does we did this a couple of quarters ago but perhaps revisit your thoughts on how the market has changed over time and your thoughts given some of the activities or discussion on the eastern and Canadian half of the country?","Lance Fritz","Current discussions have not changed our position on industry consolidation. We're not in favor of it. We don't think it is the right thing to do at this time.","Operator","Our next question is from John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Larkin","You had mentioned that grain exports in some cases were still pretty strong but export haul was getting it. That was due to be very strong dollar. At you give us more complete picture of the impact of the strong dollar on the exports across more than just grain and coal?","Lance Fritz","The grain exports really were driven by milo and soybeans. We had a great soybean crop in and China is really pulling those into China and spreads between Gulf Coast, West Coast have narrowed in terms of ship spread. That really is driving milo and beans from central part of U.S. into China which was a positive for us. We're still seeing headwinds from the strong dollar in exports across, probably, a pretty good chunk of the economy.","When you think about steel, steals being impacted, both with imports come particularly, from Asia coming into the country and domestic steel producers are struggling is also being impacted in terms of machinery exports, construction and farm machinery exports, headwinds because of strong dollar. On the weak side, we're seeing some difficulty in the U.S. wheat crop competing in export markets partially being to the strong dollar. The strong dollar is, as you would expect, impact the exports are pretty wide swath of the economy beyond just coal and it is helping imports. You should see our intermodal import business and other import business strengthen as you go throughout the year but the strong dollar is having an impact.","John Larkin","And maybe a question on the ever-changing energy markets. Do you have a sense for where oil prices would have to go in order to recharge the activity levels in the shales and then related to that, how high would natural gas prices have to go in order for the utilities to switch from natural gas back to coal?","Lance Fritz","If I could predict energy markets, I would probably be sitting in a different spot than today. There is a lot of conventional wisdom out there and I think the conventional wisdom was that you needed to be in the 70s for the U.S. shale markets to be strong. I think even if you look today with oil in the 50s, there is some shale but it's still going pretty strong. Permian shale is still doing relatively well. The Eagle Ford shale is not. I think there is a spread there, again, conventional wisdom on natural gas is somewhere in the three, 3.5, 350 is probably in the crossover range but, again, depends on a pot of different things like utility by region of the country.","Eric Butler","John, just a little more detail. Clearly, we like to see oil prices back in the 75 cross-trained. Clearly, that would be better for us.","John Larkin","But all of the guidance has been wrapped around no change and energy prices going for 2015, is that a fair assessment?","Lance Fritz","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse Group. Please proceed with your question.","Allison Landry","Following up on your earlier comments on the underlying strength in base chemicals and prospects, can you remind us how much for business is tied to the housing and residential construction markets? Yesterday, we saw existing home sales numbers that surprised to the upside and new forms Tom starts are expected to be pretty solid for the year. I wanted to get a view of sort of an all-inclusive perspective of the commodities that you move that are tied to these markets and what that represents as a percentage of volume or revenues.","Lance Fritz","I think, historically, we have set between 5% and 2%. We still think that's a good estimate. Housing starts were down in February and March. I think the housing start number comes out today or tomorrow. I think there is some expectation that weather has impacted the number being down the last couple of months and the existing home sales number was very strong, as you say. Again, we tend to factor that into our optimism about the underlying strength of the economy.","Allison Landry","As a follow-up question, given that your main competitor has seen modest improvement in velocity, albeit some easy comp's, do you think that the risk of losing some of the traffic that you gained last year as a result of their issues is now somewhat heighted? It seems like there's plenty of traffic as you go around at the West Coast ports but BNSF yesterday actually made comments it has regained some lost Ag business. So I just wanted to get your perspective there.","Lance Fritz","The BNSF stuff has been showing improvement in their service product. We would anticipate that would happen. They are very good, vibrant competitor. Eric had said, historically, some of the business we had shipped last year, certainly, in Ag maybe to a lesser extent some other commodities was naturally a better fit for their franchise, there network and would likely go back. I think you see that in the Ag line in terms of reported volumes. Eric, do you want to add anything to that?","Eric Butler","No.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Kim","I have a couple of questions. First on intermodal. Can you give us a sense how much your intermodal volumes might have been impacted by the west coast port congestion and how you think it will take that congestion to unwind to sort of filter into this Q2 numbers?","Eric Butler","So international intermodal volume was down to the low teens in the first quarter. Again, we expect that as you catch-up throughout the year that that will normalize and most of that will catch-up. We do not expect to see any permanent deterioration of our West Coast international intermodal business.","Tom Kim","Okay. Would it be possible to give us a sense of how much your filter fuel surcharge might have impacted ARPUs for that commodity group? Rob you had mentioned that impacted in the first quarter little bit more than the rest of the book of business.","Rob Knight","We don't break out by commodity in specific surcharge contributed to each individual commodity but there are timing differences by different contracts and we have some 60 plus different mechanisms. There can be and there are timing differences on the intermodal line versus some of the other lines.","Tom Kim","Okay. And then just with one, Rob, as a follow-up, you had commented that you anticipate some potential makeshifts ahead which could impact your revenues. Can you talk about how the mix shift is going to affect your RTMs versus carloads? Because I noticed that your RTMs were down about 4% in the first quarter and carloads were down about 2%. I would think this going to impact your real productivity unit cost and ultimately margins. So I'm just wondering if you could help us frame how we should think about the impact of efficiencies that might be affected by RTMs potentially being weaker than carloads?","Lance Fritz","I'm not going to break it out at this point as you are asking, Tom, but I would say mix is something we deal with. From a cost standpoint that just presents challenges and opportunities depending what the volume actually is for the operating team and Cameron's all over it improving the cost structure. In terms of the top-line, the pricing line or the impact on revenue, again, it will depend out which markets are stronger than others.","We do anticipate as I called out there will be a headwind for the balance of the year. A simple explanation for why there is ahead hit headwind of it in our revenue line is we think there will be stronger growth and a lot of his recovery with intermodal we just talked about and soft as a goal and frac markets those are the negative drivers on that, if you will cap next headwind we anticipate. We're calling that out directionally as a challenge but we're not using that as an excuse not to continue to run as efficient operational the cost side as we possibly can.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Jason Seidl","When you look at your core pricing of 3.50%, kind of in line with what I expected but is it occurring in certain areas in terms of, are you getting more pricing now out of that truck competitive business then you were 1 year ago? Is that what is driving the improvement? Eric?","Eric Butler","We're getting a good market waste pricing across our business. As we said before, a certain percentage of our business has been fixed on multi-year, longer-term contracts and you can't touch them. We talked about that before but for the things that we're able to reprice, the demand is strong. The impacts in terms of the challenges of the trucking industry is having are in our favor and we see strong opportunities to price out value across our book of business.","Jason Seidl","Doesn't it get any easier to price intermodal products once the port clears up or did that not really have much of an impact on your pricing?","Eric Butler","Pricing is always difficult no matter when you do it. I would guess most of the international intermodal business would not be in spot pricing type of agreements.","Jason Seidl","Okay. And to piggy back on Allison's question as a follow-up, you obviously benefited from BN last year in several different categories and you locked up some of that business in some longer-term contracts. One of those does when you those contracts start expiring?","Eric Butler","We don't talk about individual contracts. I don't think we mentioned that last year. We don't talk about individual contracts.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Ben Hartford","Eric, I did wanted to follow up on domestic intermodal pricing in particular given the decline in crude, I know there are certain lanes now where you can find intermodal pricing all-in that is competitive to trucks you guys are more insulated to that with the longer length of haul. Let's assume that crude does stabilize here around $50, $55 a barrel. As you look into '16, do you see a situation where intermodal rate growth does have to lag, truckload rate growth going forward at current levels of crude because of the lower energy price? And some of that disparity, historical disparity between truck and intermodal might have narrowed over the past several years? Can you provide some perspective there?","Lance Fritz","Yes, I guess I'm not white understanding the foundation of your question. I think actually truck pricing is increasing. If you look at most of the truck pricing indexes, because of the challenges that the truck industry is having, they are getting high single-digit type price increases. So I think would suggest instead of the gap narrowing it might even be expanding rather than staying the same.","Ben Hartford","Yes got truck pricing has increased. I was asking as we go into '16, should we expect domestic intermodal pricing growth to mimic truck load or does it need to lag what the truck load rate growth is to make sure there is enough of an all-in price delta between truck and intermodal?","Lance Fritz","We have a value proposition and we're going to continue to price tag as strongly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Kauffman","I want to go a different direction. We're hearing a lot about the drought in California, the lower water tables, the reduction water use and also during the quarter, we heard those I think we focused with port issues on inbound movement of products. We also heard there was a fair amount of Ag and produce related products that could not get off the West Coast. Could you discuss how that affected you in the quarter and how you're thinking about this drought in California in terms of the growth of your Western business?","Eric Butler","The drought in California, as you know, the authorities right now in California are trying to insulate the Ag industry and really are putting the onus for water conservation on residential customers. Politically, how long that can sustain with the Ag industry being insulated is anybody's guess. I do think that if you look at the Ag industry in California, you kind of profile who uses the most water to the least water, I think our customer base will probably be in the using the least water category.","So we feel pretty good that the drought will not have near-term material impacts on our food and refrigerated business. We feel pretty good about that. Short of some Armageddon type of scenario. In terms of the export question, yes. So Ag products, particularly refrigerated products do go export off West Coast ports and they were similarly impacted just like the imports were impacted so just like things couldn\u2019t get on, things couldn't get off and they similarly had impacts fourth quarter of last year and first quarter of this year.","Jeff Kauffman","As a follow-up thought last year we heard about truckers moving water into California on an as needed basis. Maybe I'm going off the deep end here but is that a potential revenue source for you over the long run?","Lance Fritz","I do not think that's material.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Troy with Nomura Asset Management. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Troy","I had a question, as you talk to your utility customers you mention natural gas switching impacting some of the Colorado Utah basin business. Just curious what the echoes of 2012 still lingering, how should we think about the potential for additional or incremental vulnerability in your coal business. What's your sense in speaking with coal customers that as natural gas approaches to 250 now and potentially lower, how much has switched to how much remaining could switch? What is the vulnerability there?","Lance Fritz","I think the things that can switch probably have switched. As natural gas goes lower, there might be some incremental impact you would expect there would be. But I think we have seen mostly--","Eric Butler","Comments on that, Matt, if you recall last time natural gas prices got to historically low levels. We really in our territory didn\u2019t see materials switching until it got sub $2. That doesn't necessarily predict the future but what we're seeing though and I think the bigger impact to date rather than our utility based switching from one source to another, they are able to buy electricity off the grid that is being produced by somebody else, perhaps, from gas. So we\u2019re seeing that impact as opposed to a pure switch, turning off the coal plant and turning on the gas plant in our territory.","Matt Troy","And my follow-up would be, you mentioned PTC, I'm just curious there, I think when it was initially enacted, no one believed that it would be completed by 2015 in many of the various stakeholder groups but here we're knocking on the deadline. Curious in terms of your conversation with Washington, what it is it industry is proposing as the path forward in terms of either time frame or incremental expansion to the window? And coming off the wall question here, what if Washington in all it's rational thought and reason decides to hold you to letter of law? What will be the implication if the industry does not make the deadline and they are not flexible? Thanks.","Lance Fritz","I will start with a path forward. Cameron had mentioned, we believe that, virtually, everyone involved understand there has to be an extension because the industry is not going to make the date. That extension is going to have to come through Congress. There are a number of different vehicles that could make that happen and we're monitoring all of those potentials. And giving feedback and input into our thoughts to help navigate that process. From the perspective of having an extension occur, I remain confident that that will happen. It just reflects the reality of the situation. From the perspective of what if we don't get an extension? There are penalties outlined in the current regulation, current law and we've been discussing what our actions would be should an extension not occur. That would be a horrible outcome for the industry. And I don't believe that's the way it's going to go but we will be prepared for that very, very, remote possibility, as the year comes to a close.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital. Please proceed with your question.","John Barnes","First on the port situation, can you talk a little bit about -- you have been through this a couple of times before. Can you talk a little bit about your view of a return of market share to the western coast ports or do you think some of what's swung to the east coast and other ports is more permanent in nature?","Lance Fritz","We've said for quite some time that there may be as a low single digit number of share transfer from West Coast to East Coast when the Panama Canal opens up. The reality from our perspective is the most efficient vessels and the ones that are being commissioned, as we speak, A, they won't go through modified Panama Canal and B, there needs to be some significant work to occur on the East Coast ports in some circumstances to handle those. Having said that, there is also a natural cost\/value proposition that makes those imports want to come into the West Coast. Eric, you want to add anything to that?","Eric Butler","No. I think that about covers it.","John Barnes","So you still view it as a couple of percentage points in market share?","Eric Butler","Yes currently East Coast has about 31. Historically, we\u2019ve said that could go to 33 with the Panama Canal opening but as Lance said, the larger ships that are being built today really won't even be able to go through the expanded Panama Canal. There is a value proposition for the West Coast. If you look at ship spread in terms of the West Coast versus East Coast and if you look at the cost of over land, bridge, rail, transportation, there is a natural economic driver to the West Coast.","John Barnes","Okay. My other one is, I know you've got an uncertain volume environment right now at play. I get where the pressure points are but if 2014 taught us anything is you can get caught on the other side in a more robust growth environment just as easily. How do you go about balancing where to pull in right now? Where to pull the rings in, especially given what you experienced in '14 where you really ran out of certain resources? Can you make sure you don't pull back so much trying to balance in this environment that should growth reaccelerate that you're not back in that same similar situation as you were in 14?","Cameron Scott","In 2014, our locomotive surge fleet strategy served us very, very well. When business came on, we are able to match that business. So as we look into this year, redeveloping that search fleet and being agile, as we mentioned, is a very critical asset and very critical initiative for us. We take Eric's forecast and where he predicts business will be and then we make our moves appropriately.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Cherilyn Radbourne","With respect to West Coast ports, I was just wondering if you could comment on the challenges associated with big ships and new shipping alliances which may remain once the backlog is cleared and what you are doing internally and with your supply chain partners to cope?","Lance Fritz","You are right, there is going to be a challenge and basically the challenges because the new alliances, as they bring their business together, they bring it all to one terminal and then overwhelms the capacity of that individual terminal on the port vis-a-vis being spread out between multiple terminals. So that is a challenge. The alliances are working through that the challenge of terminals are working through. There was a challenge was starting to be seen before even the ports slow down. We from outside are working with our customers developing planning practices and protocols in capacity management protocols that we're sharing with them to basically say, here is the capacity within this window that we can do into the extent that there is a larger than that flood because of alliance activity through the terminal, what do you need to do to correct that? So we did see it in the past. We will see it in the future. We're working with them to spread that out.","Cameron Scott","Are most important asset in LA basin to stay up against the intermodal businesses is locomotives. And we have spent over the last year developing a model that stays up against Eric forecast of business week-to-week to week. It has been very successful, are originating on-time departures out of the LA basin are in the mid-90s and we feel very confident we can keep it there.","Operator","Are next question comes from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Cleo Zagrean ","My first question relates to the impact of mixed operating ratio. Can you please clarify for us whether you expect mix to be a headwind or tailwind, if a headwind is it mostly because of declines in coal and frac rather than international intermodal coming back? Thank you.","Rob Knight","Cleo, the headwind that we would anticipate from the mix going forward is a result of, we expect strong intermodal and softer coal and fracking related activities, as you are calling out. But as always we're going to continue to focus on being as efficient as we can on the cost side. And as Eric has been talking all morning we're going to continue to price to the value proposition. So we're not throwing the towel in terms of the margins but we know we\u2019re going to face the headwind of those mix changes.","Cleo Zagrean","And my second question relates to coal. Can you please discuss to what extent share shifts may have affected your volumes in a flat Western coal market in the first quarter? And your outlook for Colorado, Utah, with any kind of detail you want to share on the market for that coal and whether your long-term export outlook has changed? Thank you.","Eric Butler","Yes, there were no material contractual share shifts that we saw.","Lance Fritz","And what about Colorado Utah, Eric?","Eric Butler","There were no material shifts.","Cleo Zagrean","Okay, because we have seen been up like mid high single digits and your volumes down. So I was wondering whether those are related in any way, it's just totally separate tracks so to speak?","Eric Butler","We can't speak to their business, naturally. We kind of describe the dynamics we saw in our business, it would not surprise me if they had a much greater opportunity for inventory replenishment for their customers in the first quarter than we had, simply because we had more deliveries last year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","I had one quick one on frac sand adjusting to the current outlook down mid-teens in the second quarter. But as opposed to something like coal where you have natural gas and inventories as you mentioned, a little bit of a leading indicator. With sand it's a little tougher as the amount of sand per well continues to go up and different basins move ahead at different rate. So do you have any sense of the visibility into the second half of the year either in what you're seeing in actual orders or talking to your customers directly what the programs might look like at this point? Thanks.","Eric Butler","I'm not quite sure where does what you are asking but it would be basically be similar to what we kind of said before.","Lance Fritz","Brian, were you asking for a crystal ball on frac sand in the second half of the year?","Brian Ossenbeck","Yes call please. I was asking how you think about the second half of the year with frac sand?","Eric Butler","I think our frac sand volumes based on current activity will probably be more similar to 2013 volumes than 2014 volumes.","Operator","Our next comes from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Keith Schoonmaker","Knowing the strength in autos in the period, will you please comment on how your expectations for trades with Mexico compared with maybe somewhat tempered with overall growth rate?","Lance Fritz","Let me jump in just on the very long-term and, Rob mentioned this early on in a comment about our franchise because we do serve all six rail gateways to Mexico and because of Mexico's opening up of some of their core industries, as well as the significant foreign direct investment from the very long-term perspective, we feel very, very good about our business and growth with Mexico.","Eric Butler","I have nothing more to add with that. Mexico continues to be an upside for us. We have a great franchise and we're optimistic about the outlook.","Keith Schoonmaker","Yes if Mexico does grow outsize compared to business in the U.S., would this be accretive?","Lance Fritz","Not necessarily. With that question actually has been in fact what we have experienced with last decade, our volumes in and out of Mexico have grown at a slightly faster pace than the overall enterprise volumes. And I would not try to draw conclusion in terms of margin -- those moves.","Keith Schoonmaker","Is it longer haul though?","Lance Fritz","It can be, again, I would say overall scheme of things, it's no different than are overall enterprise mix.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen this concludes our Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the call back to Lance Fritz for closing comments.","Lance Fritz","Thank you, Rob. So you heard us talk about today was our first quarter where we came into the year, volumes changed on us dramatically and we've spent the quarter aggressively trying to write-size and just fell short of that mark. As we look forward into the second quarter, we're looking forward to continue that work and improve our service product and our efficiencies and we\u2019re confident that\u2019s going to happen. And we look forward to talking to you about it the next time we get together. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."]}}
