Welcome to Best Buy's First Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time today.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Mollie O'Brien - Director-Investor Relations","Good morning and thank you. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our President and CEO; and Sharon McCollam, our CAO and CFO.","This morning's conference call must be considered in conjunction with the earnings press release we issued this morning. Today's release and conference call both contain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain business events. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to facilitate meaningful year-over-year comparisons, but should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for and should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures for the period. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earnings release.","Today's earnings release and conference call also include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address the financial conditions, results of operations, business initiatives, growth plans, operational investments and prospects of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and SEC filings for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.","In today's earnings release and conference call, we refer to consumer electronics industry trends. The consumer electronics industry, as defined by the NPD Group includes TVs, desktop and notebook computers, tablets not including Kindle, digital imaging and other categories. Sales of these products represent approximately 65% of our domestic revenue. It did not include mobile phones, gaming, movies, music, appliances or services.","During the quarter, as announced on March 28, the company consolidated the Future Shop and Best Buy brands in Canada under the Best Buy brand. The consolidation is expected to have a material impact on all of our Canadian retail stores and website on a year-over-year basis. As such, all Canadian revenue has been removed from the comparable sale space and international no longer has a comparable metric. Therefore, Enterprise comparable sales will be equal to domestic comparable sales until international revenue is again comparable on a year-over-year basis.","I will now turn the call over to Hubert.","Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Mollie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with an overview of our first quarter results and I will then provide highlights of the progress we've made in our fiscal 2016 priorities and then turn the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook.","So first, our financial results. Enterprise revenue of $8.6 billion, in addition to our non-GAAP operating income rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS, all exceeded our expectations during the quarter due to a stronger-than-expected performance in the domestic business. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 2.6% was flat to last year, including approximately 35 basis points of increased costs to support our investments in future growth initiatives, and our non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.37 was up 6%. In the domestic business, against a backdrop where the NPD-reported consumer electronics categories, which represent approximately 65% of our revenue, were down 5.3%, our comparable sales in contracts, excluding the impact of installment billing, declined only 0.7% as we continued to take advantage of strong product cycles in large screen televisions and iconic mobile phones and continued growth in the major appliance category.","Offsetting these positive trends was continued industry softness in other categories, most notably in tablets and computing where we have significant market share. For NPD, the tablet category declined nearly 30% similar to last quarter and computing declined high single digits versus low single digits last quarter.","Throughout the quarter, our strategy of delivering Advice, Service and Convenience at Competitive Prices continued to resonate with our customers. While merchandising, marketing and operational execution were the tactical drivers of our better-than-expected first quarter financial results, strategically, we believe the cumulative impact of the progress we have made to improve our multi-channel customer experience is what has allowed us to consistently outperform the market. We have made real progress and it is showing in our results. I therefore want to thank our teams across all functions for delivering this progress and these results. All of us know that we have significant opportunities and work ahead of us.","Thus, we continue to invest in the first quarter in the fiscal 2016 growth initiatives that we outlined in March. While these investments did and will continue to put pressure on our operating income rate, we believe they are imperative to driving future growth and improving our customer experience at every touch points. Today, we interact with customers in three distinct and complementary channels: online, in-store and in-home. We believe our ability to do this particularly in-home is a strategic competitive advantage that with these investments will further differentiate Best Buy from the competition and allow us to deliver uniquely personalized experience to our customers where, when and how they want to be served.","As we invest, we will keep the obsessive focus on the customer experience that forms the core of our strategy. We operate in a retail world where good service is expected, therefore, we have to continue to identify and eliminate customer pain points as quickly as possible and in parallel, continue to focus on building uniquely engaging customer experiences which will be the basis for stronger long-term customer loyalty.","I will now provide highlights of the progress we have made against our fiscal 2016 priorities, including our growth initiatives around key product categories, life events and services. So first from a merchandising standpoint, in appliances we rolled out 11 of the 60 additional specific kitchen and home stores within the store plan for this year. We also continue to invest in our fixed infrastructure to support the scaling of our appliance business as industry competition continues to provide opportunities to gain share. While these are multi-year investments, we do expect to see gradual and incremental improvements over time. In fact, in the first quarter, we saw early progress in improving our Net Promoter Score in appliance delivery and installation.","In mobile phones, we extended our mobile phone installment billing selling capability online with AT&T and plan to roll out other carriers this summer. At this time, we are the only non-carrier retailer who can offer these types of plans both online and in-store and we believe this is a critical capability as consumer demand for installment billing continues to accelerate. We also continue to build out our key life events program. Of course, it is still very early for our newly launched wedding and gift registry, but we continue to see our new mover program drive significant revenue growth, particularly in televisions.","We also launched an improved version of our multichannel gift center to deliver a better customer experience by significantly expanding the curated products to include more price points and more occasions. This was accomplished by supporting both Canada-based events like holidays, as well as using our Athena customer database to capitalize on other key events, such as birthdays and anniversaries.","I'd like to share some of the recent developments related to our online experience. With such a significant and fast-growing portion of traffic now coming from mobile devices, it is imperative that we accelerate the transformation of our mobile customer experience. And so I'm pleased to say that in the first quarter we launched a new mobile app. The new app, which includes the acceptance of Apple Pay, has received strong customer reviews.","During the quarter, we also launched new search capabilities that include the online visibility of returned open-box inventory. While there are more capabilities being implemented this year to improve recovery of our returned, replaced and damaged inventory, to-date we've made it much easier for customers to find, view and shop open-box products by adding the relevant information and links to the product listing pages and search results.","Lastly, we began recruiting for our new technology development center in Seattle, which we believe will be instrumental in continuing the transformation of our e-commerce technology platform and mobile customer experience.","Turning to services. We envision services playing three important roles. Number one, to be a differentiator by offering a unique service as part of the product purchase. Number two, to be a business driver contributing to product sales and a stronger customer relationship. And, three, to be a profit center in its own right.","We view services as a source of strategic competitive advantage based on our ability to provide these services online, in store and in the customers' homes through our own system designers and Geek Squad agents. We are encouraged by the early progress we have been making. For example, we are seeing strong and improving NPS scores across our service portfolio.","We're also getting a positive customer response from our in-home consultations and services provided by our Magnolia Design Centers and the classes we began offering in some of our stores. We also know that we are in the midst of a multi-year transformation of our services activities that entails significant work around our service offerings, capabilities, processes, tools and systems across all customer touch points.","Of course, as we look forward to fiscal 2016 and beyond, it is imperative that we continue to focus on reducing costs and driving operational efficiencies to fund investments in our future. Therefore, as we announced last quarter, we're continuing to aggressively pursue the benefits from the second phase of our Renew Blue cost reduction and gross profit optimization program and encouraged by our early work. As a reminder, our Phase II target is approximately $400 million over the next three years, including the remaining benefit of approximately $250 million from our previously discussed returns, replacements and damages opportunities.","These savings are not expected to begin until the back half of fiscal 2016 due to their structural nature and the time that it will take to develop systems to capture the opportunities. These savings will be partially offset, however, by the incremental investments we're making in our future growth initiatives, which for this year we expect to be in the range of $100 million to $120 million or $0.17 to $0.21 in diluted EPS. In the first quarter, we invested approximately $30 million or $0.05 of diluted EPS to fund these initiatives.","Turning to our international business. We're aiming to strengthen our long-term position in Canada as the leading provider of consumer electronics products, services and solutions by consolidating our Future Shop brand into the Best Buy brand. This plan includes permanently closing 66 Future Shop locations, which we did in March, and converting the remaining 65 Future Shop locations and Future Shop website to the Best Buy brand. With these store closures, the company now has a total of 192 locations across Canada, including 136 large-format stores and 56 Best Buy Mobile stores.","This plan also includes building a leading multi=channel customer experience which replicates successful aspects of our domestic Renew Blue strategy, including launching major appliances in all stores, working with our vendor partners to bring their products to life in a more compelling way, increasing our staffing levels to better serve our customers and investing in the online shopping experience, including expanding our in-store pickup areas, launching ship from store and introducing the marketplace program.","To deliver this leading multichannel experience, as we've previously discussed, we're projecting to invest up to $160 million in capital over the next two years. So in summary, while the consumer electronics industry is subject to product cycles, we are excited about the role that technology plays in people's lives and the opportunities that this creates. We are also confident that we're executing against the right investment strategy that will allow us to capitalize on key technology waves and customer experience opportunities to build sustainable long-term shareholder value.","I will now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our first quarter financials and our financial outlook.","Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our first quarter results versus last year, I'd like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Our enterprise revenue of $8.6 billion exceeded our expectations due to stronger than expected growth in our domestic business. Our non-GAAP operating income rate also exceeded our expectations by 30 basis points to 50 basis points due to a mix shift to higher margin computing hardware and a better than expected performance of our credit card portfolio, again in our domestic business.","I will now talk about our first quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue decreased 0.9% to $8.6 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.02 to $0.37, driven primarily by lower net interest expense and a lower non-GAAP effective income tax rate due to a discrete income tax benefit in the quarter. In our domestic segment, revenue increased 1.4% to $7.9 billion. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by an estimated 130 basis point benefit associated with installment billing and a $40 million or 50 basis point improvement in the performance of our credit card portfolio, partially offset by a comparable sales decline of 0.7% excluding installment billing. Our domestic comparable online revenue increased 5.3% primarily due to increased traffic and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total domestic revenue, online revenue also increased 30 basis points to 8.5% versus 8.2% last year.","Versus last year's growth rate of 29.2%, this year's online growth rate of 5.3% was primarily due to the expected 1,000 basis points of pressure from lapping last year's gaming console introductions and the chain-wide rollout of ship from store as well as the industry softness in tablets and computing which represent a large percentage of our online revenue. We do expect the online growth rate to continue to be lower than last year's growth rate into Q2 due to again lapping over 1,000 basis points of growth from ship to store in Q2 last year.","From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in televisions, mobile phones and major appliances was more than offset by declines in tablets and computing. We also saw a comparable sales decline in services. This decline of 10.3% was primarily driven, though, by the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower claim frequency, an operational positive, and lower extended warranty attach rates.","In our international segment, revenue declined 22.1% to $668 million due to a negative foreign currency impact of 1,000 basis points, the loss of revenue from one month of the Canadian brand consolidation and the ongoing softness in the Canadian consumer electronics industry.","Turning now to gross profit. The enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate for the first quarter was 22.9% versus 22.8% last year, an increase of 10 basis points. The domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 20 basis points to 22.9% versus 22.7% last year. This increase is primarily due to a 40 basis point benefit from our credit card portfolio, a positive mix shift to higher margin computing hardware, and additional positive mix shift due to significantly decreased revenue in the lower margin tablet category and the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans which resulted in lower costs due to lower claim frequency.","These increases were partially offset by increasing inventory reserves on non-iconic phone inventory due to declining inventory valuations and a negative mix shift into certain lower margin iconic phones. The international non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 100 basis points to 22.8% versus 23.8% last year. This decline was primarily due to the disruptive impact from the Canadian brand consolidation and increased promotional activity in Canada.","Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.7 billion or 20.3% of revenue versus 20.2% last year, a dollar decrease of $5 million but a rate increase of 10 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.6 billion or 19.8% of revenue versus 19.6% last year, an increase of $35 million or 20 basis points primarily driven by approximately 35 basis points of increased costs to support our investments in future growth initiatives and higher incentive compensation. These increases were partially offset by the realization of last year's annualized Renew Blue cost reduction initiatives and a discrete benefit from an operating tax settlement.","International non-GAAP SG&A was $179 million or 26.8% of revenue versus 25.5% of revenue last year, a decrease of $40 million. This dollar decrease was primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange rates and the elimination of expenses associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation. From a rate perspective, the 130 basis point rate increase is driven by year-over-year sales deleverage.","For the balance of the year, as we announced in March, we are continuing to project a non-GAAP diluted EPS impact from the Canadian brand consolidation in the range of negative $0.10 to negative $0.20 due to lost revenue from the closed stores, disruption to the rebranded stores and higher SG&A due to the short-term investments we are making to maximize customer retention from the closed stores. This non-GAAP diluted EPS impact which was minimal in the first quarter due to just one month of disruption is expected to be fully incurred in fiscal 2016. The top-line negative impact from the store closing net of customer retention rates, however, is expected to continue long-term. Ultimately, we expect the Canadian business to be more vibrant and more profitable with profitability being defined as both higher operating income dollars and a higher operating income rate.","I would now like to talk about our financial outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This outlook is based on the following assumptions. Number one, in the domestic business, a flat-to-positive low single digit revenue growth rate; two, higher year-over-year non-GAAP domestic SG&A dollars due to increased investments in future growth initiatives and SG&A inflation; three, in international, a revenue decline of 30% to 35% due to store closures and overall disruption from the Canadian brand consolidation in addition to the ongoing negative impact of foreign exchange rates; and four, an international non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of negative 3.5% to negative 5%, reflecting the near-term impacts of the Canadian brand consolidation that we've already discussed.","With these assumptions, our enterprise outlook for second quarter includes a flat-to-negative low single digit revenue growth rate and a year-over-year non-GAAP operating income rate decline in the range of negative 30 basis points to negative 50 basis points, which is in line with our previous outlook. This revised outlook however now assumes a strengthening in our domestic business versus the previous outlook, offset by the near-term impact of the Canadian brand consolidation. Additionally, we expect the non-GAAP continuing operations effective income tax rate to be in the range of 38% to 40%.","While underlying this outlook is a cautious view on the NPD consumer electronic categories overall, we are encouraged by the strong product cycle in large-screen high-definition television where we have a high market share and our momentum in the growing categories like mobile phones and appliances where we have a relatively low market share.","So with these opportunities and our track record in outperforming the NPD categories, we are confident in our ability to execute against the outlook we provided today.","I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll have our first question from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.","Aram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. Thanks so much for taking the question. Two quick ones, hopefully easy. Anything that you can help us with to give us a line of sight into the holiday season this year on how you think that might shape up? And then I had a follow-up.","Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Aram. As you know, we're not talking about holiday today. It's still \u2013 it's too early to provide any color commentary. I think we've made some positive comments about some of the categories that are driving our growth in the large-screen televisions, phones and appliances. That pertains to the next quarter and going forward but it's premature to talk about holiday at this point. I wish I could tell you more.","Aram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And the second thing is you're operating in an industry that's shrunk by 3% in Q4 and shrunk by 5% in Q1. Can you just talk broadly about things that might be on the horizon to help you? Because you're doing a great job of gaining share but it makes your life a lot easier if that was not a negative? And then also are there any other big opportunities in margin or SG&A that you work on and develop that haven't yet been announced that could be in case that industry trend continue ad infinitum?","Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so let's \u2013 we need to be very clear. The 5.3% decline we called out pertains to the NPD tracked categories which are our most traditional product categories. They represent about 65% of our revenue. So you have other product categories that are not included in there, in particular, phones and appliances as well as gaming and entertainment. As you would know, phones and appliances are growing categories. Now, there's not immediately available precise information on these categories but I think if you look around you would assume that phones and appliances in particular are growing nicely. So I would not conclude even though we don't have precise facts for the quarter, I would not conclude that the industry as a whole is down by that much. Okay? So that's the first.","It's really important to understand from an investment thesis standpoint because the industry is not down 5%. Okay? Now, it's hard to track exactly the number but it's not down 5%. Now, talking about categories we are excited about into the future. I think we've been consistent in saying, in fact, in particular that phones and appliances where a key area of focus for us, these are large markets that are growing, they -where our market share is low, so that's a significant area of focus that we talked about. And you're very familiar with some of the investments we are making. We've called them out on the call.","The area of connected home is also an area of intense focus from a strategic standpoint. And it's not just the lighting or the locks; it's the fact that all of our homes are connected today compared to, you remember a few years ago, you had a PC, you had a CRT TV and a nice stereo system. Now, everything is connected which provides opportunities for us. There's a gap between what customers understand they can do with technology and what technology can do. So we are there to close these gaps. So we think about these waves of technology and I've given you two or three that are areas of intensive interest.","As it relates to efficiencies, I think our entire strategy since day one of Renew Blue has been a balanced view between cost and revenue between the customers and the efficiencies, which is why we have the second phase of Renew Blue cost take-out that we've quantified at $400 million. As a management team, we're as intensively focused on that second phase as we were on the first phase. It's different in nature though. So it's more related to eliminating waste, driving efficiencies in our processes. So it goes after more structural systems-driven improvements, which is why we've indicated that start seeing the results in the next few quarters as opposed to in the first half of the year. But we're not betting on the market to all of a sudden becoming a rising sea to go after these efficiencies. This is a dual-track strategy.","Aram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you for that.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Nagel, Oppenheimer.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning.","Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Brian.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. First off, a question on TVs. You called out the TV categories, one of, so to say, the bright spots in sales. How would you describe right now the overall momentum in that business from a product cycle standpoint and then relative to what the products may be coming out as we get closer to the holiday season? Thanks.","Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, thank you. It's evidently an important driver of our quarter. Let me try to describe what you would see if you were looking at NPD data. The market is actually not up in the quarter. It had been up in Q4. It's not up in Q1. However, you have something that is going on which is a genuine customer interest for larger screen televisions. And, in particular, as the quality of the pictures has improved, and partly it is driven by 4K, a large-screen television is actually very appealing given a set number of pixels. And so what you're seeing is this wave in the large-screen television.","What you are also seeing for us, and let me emphasize this because it's something we control, the work that our team, our merchandising team, has done in the stores in particular to showcase the latest TVs is quite extraordinary. As you know, we've done that in partnership with some of our key vendors in the stores, so Sony and Samsung in particular, with a pretty dramatic exposition of the TVs, as well as investment in expert labor. So there's more and more knowledgeable labor. So for these new TVs, I'm going to be judge and jury, but I'm going to say we're the destination for this and the better customer experience is really driving what is a material market share gain for us.","Now, looking ahead at holiday, I think the one piece of uncertainty is going to be what the average selling prices are going to do in the back half as it relates to these TVs. So there's no doubt that the customer interest will continue. But the average selling price, of course, in our industry has a big impact on our top line. And how much deflation we will get, I think it's anybody's \u2013 it's a bet at this point in time. These are some of the key mechanics of what we are seeing.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","That's helpful. Then maybe as a follow up on that. If you look at that dynamic right now with some of this new technology coming through the TV side, is ASP right now a positive? Or what's helping the business more on the unit side?","Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","What's going on is that there is significant price deflation. And I think if you visit our stores regularly, you'll be amazed by some of the prices we are offering. So all of you on the call, I encourage you to come and visit. What is helpful on the flipside is the mix. As we are mixing into a higher weight of large-screen TVs, the average selling price given the mix is actually helpful, but the individual prices are going down. I hope I was clear in describing that.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you.","Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Scot Ciccarelli, RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. How are you?","Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. I guess this is a little bit of a follow up on Brian's question. I mean, if you look at Best Buy's history, you guys have always significantly over-indexed with new technologies. You did mention having a higher market share in the new technology TVs.","Can you give us an idea or some sort of range on what your rough share is? And specifically, how would you expect that share to change as the category starts to mature, especially as prices start to come down, as you just referenced, Hubert? Because obviously we're in a bit of a different competitive environment than what we were the last time we saw a major product innovation outside of the Apple ecosystem.","Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so this is a highly competitive arena. There's intense competition around this category. So I am going to refrain from giving too much information to our friends around the other players.","We do see and as we've highlighted this morning, a material share gain for us, so that's very clear. I've also told you that we are indeed doing better, as you've highlighted, with the large-screen new television 4K. as is the case. So over time, we fully expect that this market share may go down as the new technology becomes more mass market. When that will happen, I think it's hard to call with precision.","But we would expect that the benefit of what we've done will continue as I think we've really created a material difference in the customer experience as relates to buying these TVs. And it's still early in the cycle of adoption of these large-screen TVs and 4K TVs. So we don't expect a reversal in the short-term, but over time it will happen, always does, and then we focus on the next big thing.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So maybe a little bit of a different question then. So as you wind up seeing the ASPs on the new technology come down, because you mentioned significant price deflation, can you give us a general description, at least in terms of what you're seeing on the margin on that product? Thanks.","Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, so your question is, does ASP deflation, does it have an impact on our gross profits?","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Correct.","Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Again, the answer is absolutely, yes, because it is a game of percentages and dollars. Even if the percentages stay the same when the ASP goes down, the dollar gross profit rate goes down. So welcome to our world. It's a world where we need to race constantly to beat these trends. And I think that what we're seeing in this quarter is the demonstration of our ability to do a very strong job taking advantage of the opportunities in the market. But it's hard work.","Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer","Our expectations \u2013 the expectation for the entire industry going into the back half of this year and going into next year would be that you would see increased volume because of the lowering ASPs, which then makes them more approachable to the mass. And then that would be true probably across the industry. So you end up with increased revenue and a slightly lower gross profit rate. That would be how we would see that playing out. And I'll just add to that that another place where we are in our minds clearly being able to inspire the customer and be able to put ourselves in a better position, of course, is from the promise that we can make to the customer on advice, service and convenience.","Hubert talked a lot about it in his prepared remarks. And we clearly recognize that when somebody's in a Best Buy store and they are looking to invest in this type of technology, which is complex technology that we have a service offering that is not available across the landscape of retail and it makes a significant difference when you are changing technologies like this. So those combined is one of the reasons why we believe that it's a competitive advantage for us to be able to offer this more encompassing experience for the customer.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.","Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Lasser, UBS.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Two, actually. In recognizing that there's not a lot of visibility in the sales outlook for the second half of the year, can you discuss some of the puts and takes on the margin side and some of the discrete factors that we should expect to see as you move into the third quarter and fourth quarter?","Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer","Michael, yes. We didn't guide the third quarter and fourth quarter at this point because we're still looking for clarity, obviously, around the top-line. I just described what we expect around the industry for television going into the back half. We are extremely focused in the back half of the year on executing against the Renew Blue initiatives that we had laid out earlier in the Q4 release and then of course the efforts that we have been putting towards our waste efficiency and other types of optimization, margin optimization initiatives. So we'll give you guys more color.","We are very confident as we look toward the back half of the year in what we can execute at Best Buy. We are making a lot of progress on the system side. You guys are giving us the latitude of being able to make these investments in our future growth initiatives. And as a result of that, we have taken that and run with it. You can see what we have been doing. We actually told you guys we would allow you to track that. We gave you real numbers this quarter around how much we invested in the first quarter in order to be able to drive the type of outcome you would all be looking for in the back half of the year and that, we, ourselves are looking for.","So we are \u2013 as we go into Q4, everything we are doing right now is to be able to execute another very strong fourth quarter and again the cycles are very \u2013 I think are going to be helpful to us. While we don't like where NPD is, we don't sit around internally talking about NPD being down X percent. Our field teams are obsessed with the ability to continue to drive our outcomes that are in our control, not allowing the industry to dictate it and if you saw the momentum that we're seeing right now in the fields, we haven't talked a lot about ISP, our individual sales tracking, and the work that we're doing against that.","So we have a lot going on right now that we believe is all setting us up to really execute well in Q4. We can't tell you what the industry is going to look like, we can't tell you what exactly what products are going to be the big sellers but what we can tell you is that with the investments we're making and what is happening right now, I call it magic in our stores. We are prepared to execute a really strong Q4.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC","Understood. And a quick follow up on the television category. We heard from many others that inventory was scarce of advanced televisions because of the West Coast port strike in the first quarter presumably given your strong inventory position you're going to be ahead of others to get products. So do you think that you were in better in stock position with that product during the quarter and that helped you gain some market share? Or was that really not part of the story?","Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer","I'm going to applaud our inventory demand planning teams and our supply chain teams here because the port strike seems to be coming up in a lot of announcements. We made a decision as we talked to you guys about in Q3 of last year that we were going to stay ahead of this.","We did bring in more inventory, we did work with our vendors and partner with them, it was a small price to pay to be able to serve our customers. Being in stock is critical in our goals around our NPS. So we don't have a port strike story to tell you. Do we wish we had more? Yes. Do we have some pluses and minuses? Of course. But overall, the execution from those teams has been very strong. So we are applauding them and recognizing it's difficult. But at this point, we feel that we're in a good place, always like to have more but we're in a good place.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC","Understood. Good luck with the rest of the year.","Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer","Thank you.","Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Michael.","Operator","We'll go next to Matthew Fassler, Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks a lot. Good morning.","Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'd like to focus on two details from the P&L in the quarter. First of all, if you could give us some context for the credit card line item. How often do you true this up? Is this a thing you look at once a year? With more frequency, if the performance remains good, could we get another item like this? So how do we think about the cadence of credit card impact in the P&L?","Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer","So, remember, associated with the credit card that year-over-year last year we were down almost, I believe, it was 45 basis points year-over-year. So what we did this year \u2013 that was the transition period of the credit card. So this year we are obviously coming into a place where we are much more stable in the projections around the credit card and all transition for the most part is gone. We are benefiting in the credit card portfolio right now by a very strong backdrop which I would call the economy which of course gets around your loss ratios and other things in the credit card. Not to mention the fact that we're executing well at retail and building our portfolio. So it is a combination of two things.","But the place, Matt, where we will be cautious \u2013 it's not cautious, it is a macro situation that we have to recognize is that the economy is tracking along. At any point there can be moments in the economy, both positive and negative, but the negative ones are going to probably impact your loss ratios. We tend to operate at a very high credit score. So it's going to be less impactful to us initially but that is the nature of these co-brands and private label credit card portfolios. So at this point, we felt like Q1 was a very strong quarter. We're maybe getting a little bit of residual off of the previous agreement which could potentially not continue. But as far as drama goes around the credit card at this point, we don't have any to talk about.","Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And if it's possible to make the distinction, would you say that this favorable item was simply cycling the hit from a year ago? Or was it actually better than expected performance relative to the run rate?","Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer","I think it's both.","Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then a second question on the gross margin side, it relates to the reserves that you took for phone inventory. It's interesting that you had a lot of positives on the margin side. You spoke about the phone write-downs. If you could give us some dimensionalizing of that. And I don't think you spoke at great length about price investment, so does that remain a part of the margin story for you?","Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer","Yes. We did continue to make price investment in the first quarter. Because remember last year, we were investing each quarter measuring and then continuing. So it accumulates and then of course it comes \u2013 whatever we did in Q3 and Q4 of last year, it hits us in Q1. So absolutely invested in price. On the phone reserves, it's very simple. There are some very strong phones in the markets. And then there are other inventories that you may have whether they are new or open box. And these inventories, because of installment billings, a customer buying a used phone or a new phone or higher price phone, the monthly charge of that is quite small, the difference. So I can buy a more expensive phone without a lot of financial impact to myself through installment billing. So it takes the valuation on some of the less iconic phones and it impairs them.","And I think that the great news is that we are so strong in the iconic ones that we saw this incredible performance of mobile. And the other side of that, (44:31) driven by that is this \u2013 what happens to the other phones when that occurs. So we do not see this as a long-term issue or something that's going to continue each quarter but it is associated with the other side of our performance, which was a very overall, including this reserve, strong performance in mobile.","Operator","We'll go next to Peter Keith, Piper Jaffray.","Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","First off, just on the improved domestic revenue outlook, it looks like maybe came in towards the high end of your expectations for Q1, now expecting better results in Q2. Could you talk about what's driving that near-term whether it's products or store execution?","Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, good morning, Peter. I think that Q2, it was \u2013 there's a few things we can highlight. First, from the phone standpoint, if you compare to last year, we have two iconic phones in the market compared to last year. I think we can agree with this. Second, still on phones, we are now in a position compared to last year where we're offering installment billing, we were just beginning last year and it was just ramping up. And so that's another positive. From an internal standpoint, I would also highlight that last year we did something pretty much right around this time, which was the reorganization of our field structure. Remember, we talked about this. This was a very material reorganization. We're very happy with the outcome of that reorganization but as you can imagine, this was disruptive at the time. So these are illustrations of what is leading to a better outcome \u2013 expected outcome in Q2 of this year versus last year.","Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. Thank you for that. And then a follow up maybe for Sharon. Some good detail on the outlook for Q2. If we're backing into it right, it looks like you're thinking about the domestic gross margin flattening out or maybe declining. I was wondering if you could verify that and maybe what changes from Q1 where the gross margin performance was pretty good.","Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer","Yeah. So, we're not guiding individual line items. And depending on how you're modeling, you could potentially come into a margin within a fairly wide range based on the guidance that we gave you. Again, what we're anticipating, of course, is that we're going to see positive revenue. And when we see that, depending on the mix of that revenue, we'll see how that plays out.","It gets into some of the discussions that we had about this increase in volume and some of these categories you're seeing declining ASPs, but you're going to see more volume. We're expecting to see a strong \u2013 remember what we said, strong product cycle in television. So that is a possibility. But I think that when we look at our business, it is difficult by line item to give future outlooks. From an execution point of view, obviously we do feel like we are going to have a solid outcome.","Now, remember, on the OI rate, Q2 is going to be one of our big quarters of our investments in our growth initiatives. Across the board, in just about every one that we laid out, there is a layering in of expense in the second quarter. So on the SG&A side, while you may see it in gross profit in the way you've modeled, I would tell you that on the SG&A side is where we actually are anticipating to see much more pressure.","So gross profit is interesting, but actually the place where the Q2 \u2013 and this started, we talked about this even last quarter, it hasn't changed. What did change as far as those investments went, what did change is the fact that we're going to have the higher revenue in the domestic business, which gives us certainly more leverage of those investments in Q2. So that was a little circular way, you asked me a specific question, I had to go to the SG&A because in your modeling, you're looking at it gross profit, but it's really SG&A.","Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. That is helpful. Thank you very much.","Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer","Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Seth Sigman, Credit Suisse.","Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks very much and nice progress in the quarter, guys.","Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","The $0.10 to $0.20 impact from the Canada restructuring, how is that weighted throughout the rest of the year? Is it heavily weighted to Q2 or pretty balanced? And then if you look at the other side of that as you think about the potential benefits from the consolidations, I realize it's early, but what type of transfer rate are you seeing on those stores that you're consolidating early on? And just in general what type of benefits, if any, are included in the outlook at this point?","Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer","I'm going to let Hubert talk about how the Canadian consolidation is progressing. And then when he's finished, I'll come back and talk about the $0.10 to $0.20. Hubert, do you want to take that?","Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Thank you for the opportunity to lay out what's happening in Canada. This was obviously a very significant decision we made. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we've closed the stores that we were going to close. We've also closed the Future Shop site. The Best Buy stores are doing great. There's a lot of momentum there.","The remaining Future Shop stores, the 65 that are open and that are converting to Best Buy are very much in a period of transition. It's very important to understand. If you go to Toronto or Vancouver, you're going to be surprised because you're going to see Future Shop stores that are operating with sales associates wearing a blue T-shirt. And so that's a bit confusing for the customer.","So let me describe now what's ahead of us. What's ahead of us, over the summer we're going to re-sign, if you will, or change the signage and really convert the Future Shop stores to Best Buy stores. So by the end of the summer, they will look like Best Buy stores. And that's going to take the next three months.","The other thing that we're very excited about \u2013 well, let me first say I'm very proud of one thing which is how our Canadian team has remained extremely focused on serving the customers during that period of time, so I have to salute them there. What we are excited about is the work that the team started to do after we announced, because remember that before the announcement, this was a fairly closely held decision. So we started to work with our vendor partners in Canada and we started to work on the design of the stores of the future, if I can call them that.","Very encouraged by the reaction from the vendor community that see the change we've made as a material opportunity because it's given the opportunity to invest in fewer stores and make them great, which is the essence of this transition to multichannel. When you go to the store, the customer experience needs to be amazing. So the teams are working on this design.","Later this year, we will implement in a few stores, we're still defining exactly how many, but it's likely to be a handful roughly speaking, of stores that are going to be representative of what the stores are going to look like in the future. In these stores, there will be disruptions because it's a complete revamp of the store and we'll see how it does during holiday. And next year, we will expand that to the remainder of the chain.","So this is really next year after we've done the conversions and the investments that we will have a good sense of where the ongoing retention will be. So far, we're pleased by what we're seeing, but I don't think it's meaningful, right, as the essential idea was not simply to close stores because the customers, you're not doing anything for the customer but to reinvent the customer experience as we move forward. And I think what we're going to see is going to be exciting, but it's going to be a journey as many things we do.","Sharon, about the $0.10 to $0.20?","Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer","Yes, so within that range, first of all, we feel very comfortable within that range. In Q2, you're going to see obviously a bigger impact than Q1. Remember, we only had one month in Q1. So I think that I've actually given you specific OI rate guidance for Q2, so there's no mystery in what Q2 is. Last year the international rate was a negative 3%. They're coming up against a very weak quarter last year, so the impact doesn't look as big in Q2. But if you got to the low end of the range that I provided on the outlook, which was a negative 5% for Canada, that would be looking something like a $0.01 or so of negative impact to the EPS. And then in Q3, it's going to get bigger and the largest piece of it's going to come in Q4.","You got to remember that in Canada historically, their jump from Q2 to Q3 on revenue if you just look at the international segment is much bigger than the way the U.S. jumps from Q2 to Q3 and then it jumps again from Q3 to Q4. So that's how you should be modeling your impact as you look there. And then in Q3, as Hubert mentioned, all the work that we will be able to get done this year, we will of course do before we go into holiday. So Q3 gets some pressure from that as well.","Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you for all that color. I appreciate it. And if I could just clarify when you say that the Best Buy stores in Canada are doing great, is that a result of transferring sales from the closed stores? And if so, is there any implication for the U.S. store base and how you're thinking about that longer-term? Thanks.","Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Yes. So the positive comments about the Best Buy stores in Canada is very much related to the impact of the store closures. As it relates to the U.S., the situation \u2013 I would say two things. We've always said that we would on an ongoing basis optimize our store footprint, so I will reiterate that. That said, the situation in Canada is completely different from the U.S. In Canada, the store footprint was driven by these two brands. So again, for those of us who have been to Canada, we have seen these parking lots where you had the Best Buy store and in the same parking lot quite often the Future Shop store. So that is a gift from heaven, right, because the retention there is going to be quite extraordinary if we manage to create something great for the customers in the remaining stores.","The configuration of the store footprint in the U.S. has nothing to do with that because we've always had only one brand. And so it's not the same kind of opportunity which we saw in Canada or in what our Canadian teams saw is the fact that as many of you would have guessed, consolidating the two brands was the right thing to do and was going to unlock the opportunity to save on SG&A and be able to invest with our vendor partners strategically in the remaining stores. Different situation in the U.S. That said, of course, we will look. We're always learning, so we will look at what we can learn from the Canadian experience but the translation is not going to be immediate. I want to be very clear about that.","Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Understood. Thanks very much.","Operator","And we'll go next to Joe Feldman, Telsey Advisory Group.","Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations.","Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Wanted to ask \u2013 you guys have talked about services and the efforts that are going on there but, I guess, are there other maybe specific things you could talk about, I guess, within that? Hubert, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned we need to identify the pain points and fix them quickly, and I was just wondering if you had an example or two that you could share that that maybe where you are doing that?","Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, thank you for your comments, because indeed, services is a big part of our competitive advantages. One area that I've commented upon is appliance delivery and installation. It's a big part of our growth strategy. And doing appliance delivery and installation right is not easy. You're talking about moving (57:57), making sure it's not damaged in the process, then delivering it in people's homes.","If there is installation work related to gas or electricity or water, getting licensed professional into people's homes and coordinating the entire process is an area where \u2013 that we identified candidly as an area of opportunity, where we have high standards at Best Buy, where we want to make this great and a source of differentiation. So there's a process redesign work going on, both impacting the online buying experience as well as the in-store buying experience because everything needs to go well at every step in the process. So that's an example of fixing pain points.","On the flip side, an example of providing an inspiring customer experience which is the \u2013 increasingly we're going to spend more time on the latter. And I would highlight a couple of things that we are excited about and that I've recently mentioned, which is the in-home consultations provided today by, in particular, by our Magnolia teams and that would apply to probably everyone on the phone.","If one day you feel that your network is not functioning properly, and I'm assuming that that would be a widespread phenomenon or if you're asking yourself questions about how your audio or video system should evolve, we provide the service where we'll go to your home and will have a professional that will work with you, understand your situation, your needs, and come up with something that is a range of solutions. And when you think about the entire room around video, around entertainment, around productivity, around your home office, around security, around access to content, there's so many complex areas and being able to go to your home is something that is very inspiring.","Similarly, classes, we've deployed \u2013 we're deploying in a number of our stores, camera experience stores where we have a hub and spoke system, a bigger assortment, better staffing, better expertise. We are also doing classes in these camera experience stores and for those of us who are passionate about photography, this is something that is inspiring, creates traffic to the stores, create, of course, add-on sales opportunities. So these are the range of examples that we're working on and that can provide opportunities for us.","Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","With this said, I'm looking at the clock and, operator, with your permission, this will be the last question. I want to thank all of you on the call for your continued support, your kind comments this morning. We're working hard on your behalf to continue to deliver great experiences for the customers and great results for our investors.

","I will now turn the call over to Hubert.","Hubert Joly ","","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In today\u2019s call, we\u2019re going to start with a recap of our fourth quarter results and an overview of the progress we have made against our fiscal 2014 renewable priorities. Then we\u2019ll provide an update on our Renew Blue strategy and our outlook for fiscal 2015.","So as we discussed in our holiday sales call, the fourth quarter was an environment of declining retail traffic, intense promotion, fewer holiday shopping days, and severe weather. It was also an environment of weaker than expected industry sales in the consumer electronics category, in an environment of evolving consumer behavior, as the customer\u2019s affinity for online shopping continued to escalate.","So what did we do? We focused on the things we can control, without losing sight of what was really important, our customers, and the promises that we make to them. As such, we continued to invest in our price competitiveness, albeit at a cost, and identified our focus on improving our [personal] efficiencies, driving down our costs and lowering our inventories. ","The net financial result of these efforts was a comparable store sales decline of 1.2% and an operating margin decline of 120 basis points. While of course we cannot be satisfied with a fourth quarter operating margin decline of 120 basis points, the decline included an expected approximately 100 basis point negative impact associated with our mobile warranty and new credit card agreement economics that we called out in our Q3 call.","Thus, we were able to materially offset the price investments we have been making with substantial cost savings and other operational improvements. Within these results, though, were mixed outcomes I would like to highlight.","First, we gained market share, but as I said, it came at a cost. When we entered the quarter, we knew that pricing would be [unintelligible], and we tried to invest 40 basis points in structural and promotional pricing. To defend our market share and stimulate traffic, we increased our price investment by an estimated 85 basis points to 125 basis points.","Make no mistake, though, while we know we have an opportunity to improve the effectiveness of our marketing and promotional activities, this price investment was strategically important. Why? Because it is imperative in our transformation that we retain and attract new customers to our brand. And to do so, we had to live up to our customer promise to be price competitive, and we were.","And the customer noticed. In the environment we were operating in, where industry sales and our own store traffic were down, our price investment and improved customer experience allowed us to mitigate our adjusted domestic comparable store sales decline to 0.6%, and improve our [unintelligible] Net Promoter Score by 300 basis points. It also allowed us to aggressively drive our online business, which grew more than 25% in the quarter compared to 11% last year. ","Additionally during the quarter, the shift to the online channel crystalized for us what we had believed all year, that the pace at which consumers would migrate to the online channel would accelerate in the fourth quarter, and we were prepared. Operationally, virtually every metric that we use to measure the [unintelligible] in the online channel was up in the fourth quarter and our domestic online sales reached 12.7% of total domestic sales, which was 10% last year.","But this, too, came at a price, as profitability in the online channel today is lower than retail. Why? Because today, the online channel has a higher mix of lower margin hardware sales and [attach] rates on services and accessories are lower. So while we\u2019re working on our online capabilities to increase attach rates and drive a more profitable sales mix, we expect the improvement to come gradually and incrementally over time.","Now, to close on fiscal 2014 as a whole, I would like to take a moment and take stock of the progress we have made on our Renew Blue priorities. First, after only one year, we have exceeded our Renew Blue cost reduction target of $725 million, delivering Renew Blue cost reductions totaling $765 million. Second, we have made progress in standardizing our top and bottom lines. ","Domestic comparable store sales for the year were virtually flat, domestic operating margin, however, was down 70 basis points. That\u2019s compared to 130 basis points in the previous year. Again, excluding the impact of the increased mobile warranty expense, our cost savings and other operational improvements have materially offset our pricing and other Renew Blue investments. "," ","Third, and very important to our future, we\u2019ve enhanced how we serve our customers, and we\u2019ve been building key foundational capabilities. Most notably, we have increased domestic online sales for the year by 20%, which significantly increased our price competitiveness, and have rolled out ship from store to more than 1,400 locations. We have opened 1,400 Samsung and 600 Windows stores within a store, and completed the first phase of our floor space optimization. ","We have increased our Net Promoter Score by more than 300 basis points, and we\u2019ve relaunched our loyalty and credit card program. We\u2019ve advanced the transformation of our ecommerce platform and customer database, and we have significantly strengthened our balance sheet to a renewed focus on our core business and a substantially more disciplined capital allocation process. ","So before I talk about the next phase of Renew Blue, I will now turn the call over to Sharon for additional color on our fourth quarter financial results.","Sharon McCollam","Thank you, and good morning everyone. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I\u2019d like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you in our holiday sales press release.","In the holiday sales press release, we said that we expected our fourth quarter operating margins to decline 175 to 180 basis points due to the intense pricing pressure in the holiday season. What we reported this morning was an operating margin decline of 120 basis points. This 55 to 60 basis point favorability, all in the month of January of course, was primarily driven by an overall less promotional retail environment, stronger than expected participation from our vendors in the support of our price investments, and tighter expense management.","I\u2019ll now talk about the fourth quarter versus last year. Enterprise revenue declined 3% to $14.5 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS declined to $1.24 versus $1.47 last year. This decline was primarily driven by a significant investment in price competitiveness, the negative impact associated with our mobile warranty and new credit card economics, and a lower gross margin in mobile due to the lower attachment rates on mobile service plans.","These declines, however were substantially offset by a $0.15 per diluted share favorable income tax resolution in fiscal \u201914 that did not occur in fiscal \u201913, the favorable impact of our Renew Blue cost reduction initiatives, tighter expense management throughout the company, and lower incentive compensation.","Domestic revenue of $12.3 billion declined 1.8% versus last year. This decline was primarily driven by a comparable store sales decline of 1.2%, but excluding a 30 basis point impact from the rationalization of noncore businesses and an additional 30 basis point impact from the services related profit sharing payment that occurred in January \u201913 but did not occur in January fiscal \u201914, domestic comparable store sales would have declined approximately 0.6%. ","From a merchandising perspective, growth in computing, appliances, and gaming was more than offset by declines in other categories including digital imaging, movies, and home theater. The domestic online channels delivered strong growth during the quarter as comparable store sales increased 25.8% to $1.6 billion.","This increase was driven by a higher average order value, improved inventory availability supported by ship from store and the expansion of our online distribution network, increased traffic, and higher conversion on both our core and mobile sites. As a percentage of total domestic revenue, online sales increased 270 basis points to 12.7% from 10% last year. ","As we expect this online mix shift to continue, it is important to recall from Hubert\u2019s earlier comments that the profitability of the online channel today is lower than our retail stores. Over time, though, through a series of initiatives to improve online attach rates and strategic pricing, we do expect online profitability to gradually and incrementally improve. But in the short term, it will remain under pressure due to the investments necessary to achieve these outcomes as well as to significantly improve the customer experience.","In international, revenue declined 9.6% to $2.2 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by the negative impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, the loss of revenue from large format store closures in Canada and China, and a comparable store sales decline of 1.7% driven by declining industry trends in Canada and Mexico.","Turning now to gross profit, the enterprise gross profit rate for the fourth quarter was 20.2% versus 22.3% last year, a decline of 210 basis points. The domestic gross profit rate declined 230 basis points to 20% versus 22.3% last year. Excluding the 30 basis point impact from the periodic profit sharing payment that we just discussed, the domestic gross profit rate declined 200 basis points.","This decline was primarily driven by the 125 basis point incremental year over year investment in structural and promotional pricing, a 40 basis point negative impact associated with the new credit card agreement, a 35 basis point negative impact from the increased mobile warranty costs, and a lower gross margin in mobile, [unintelligible] lower attachment rates on mobile service plans. The attach was substantially offset, however, by the realization of [unintelligible] cost reduction and other supply chain cost containment initiatives.","The international gross profit rate was 21.3% versus 22.3% last year. This 100 basis point decline was primarily driven by increased promotional activity and a mix shift into lower margin products in Canada.","Now turning to SG&A, enterprise level non-GAAP SG&A was $2.3 billion, or 15.7% of revenue, versus 16.6% last year, a decline of over $200 million or 90 basis points. Non-GAAP domestic SG&A expenses declined approximately $150 million, or 90 basis points, to $1.9 billion, or 15.5% of revenue versus 16.4% of revenue last year.","This 90 basis point rate decline was primarily driven by the realization of Renew Blue cost reduction initiatives, tighter expense management throughout the company, lower legal related expenses, and lower incentive compensation. These impacts was partially offset by Renew Blue investments in online growth and advertising.","International non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $363 million, or 16.7% of revenue, versus 17.7% of revenue last year, a decline of over $62 million or 100 basis points. This decline was primarily driven by Renew Blue cost reductions and tighter expense management in Canada.","Also during the fourth quarter, the company recorded pretax restructuring charges totaling $115 million, primarily related to severance charges associated with the optimization of the field and store operating models in the U.S. and Canada. The majority of this $150 million is expected to be paid in cash this year.","The company also recorded $65 million of nonrestructuring asset impairment. These noncash impairments were primarily related to our U.S. stores, both big box and mobile. In light of these impairments and our continued focus on the evolving retail environment, we will continue to focus on optimizing the real estate portfolio over time. These restructuring and impairment charges are excluded from our non-GAAP results. ","I will now turn the call back over to Hubert to talk about our plans for 2015 and beyond.","Hubert Joly ","Thank you, Sharon. I would now like to discuss our plans going forward. Our strategy is clear. It is to be the authority and destination for technology products and services. And as our transformation is a multiyear journey, and we are operating in an ever changing retail environment, we thought it was important today to share with you our Renew Blue roadmap over the next 24 months.","During this time, we will continue to address three business imperatives. Number one, improving our operational performance, number two building foundational capabilities necessary to unlock future growth strategies, and number three, leveraging our unique assets to create significant differentiation that is meaningful for our customers and our vendors.","Our roadmap for achieving these business imperatives is built around the following areas: merchandising, marketing, online, stores, supply chain, Geek Squad services, cost structure, and employee engagement. Let me cover each of these.","Our first area is merchandising. Our goal is to create a compelling assortment online and in the stores, with a superior end to end customer experience that yields enhanced [unintelligible] returns. ","Our priorities in merchandising over the next 24 months are to develop compelling and differentiated strategies for key categories that make promoters out of customers and that leverage Best Buy\u2019s competitive assets; to strengthen our vendor partnerships, including launching new vendor shopping experiences; to implement an enhanced online shopping experience for key categories and to continue to optimize space and shoppability in our stores as well as improving visual merchandising; expand our private label and branded exclusive product assortment; expand [unintelligible] in home and Magnolia design centers stores within a store, which are proving to provide a superior customer experience; and then of course optimizing returns, replacements, and damages through operational improvements [unintelligible] from store. And of course, we will continue to refine our pricing and promotional strategy. ","So that\u2019s for merchandising. Next is marketing. Our goal here is to unlock growth opportunities by creating and effectively communicating new compelling value propositions for customers that go beyond price. ","Our priorities in marketing over the next 24 months include developing more targeted, more relevant, more personalized, digital customer communications for key touchpoints of the customer experience and shopping journey in support of our category strategy. ","The next is to implement programs for key buying occasions like gifting, life events and registry, and new movers. And it is to create greater engagement with customers through our loyalty program and our credit card offerings.","Let me highlight here the opportunity we have related to developing a more relevant and personalized marketing approach. As you know, Best Buy has one of the biggest house files in retail. We have been working on a big data project called Athena that will enable a more targeted approach to customer marketing, based for example on past purchases, browse history, location, and demographics. With Athena in place, over time we will be able to shift more of our marketing effort to targeted email messages and offers. ","The next area is online. Our goal here is to continue to capture online share and serve the customers based on how, where, and when they want to be served. Our online priorities over the next 24 months are to further improve the online shopping experience by enhancing search, tools, recommendations, and product and price information to make it easier for customers to find and choose products. ","It is to encourage customers to complete their technology solutions by improving the presentation and messaging of accessories and services that enable customers to build their own bundle. It is to leverage our expanded supply chain capabilities to provide superior fulfillment solutions. It is to continue to reengineer our ecommerce technology platform so that new features and functions can develop quickly and optimize across platforms.","The fourth area is our retail stores. Our ability to transform Best Buy is of course highly dependent on our ability to transform our in-store experience. To that end, we are evolving our sales organization based on what we see as the mission of retail, which is, number one, the maniacal execution of category and functional strategies, number two, the development and implementation of effective market level strategies that take into account local specificities, and number three, the ability to lift our performance in terms of employee engagement, customer satisfaction, sales, and profitability.","To do this, we\u2019re making significant changes to the field and store structure. We are organizing retail around the stores and making the stores fully accountable for their performance under the leadership of the store general managers. We\u2019re designing the structure above stores to support the general managers and their teams by providing both strategies that are readily executable and the tools and support necessary to execute them, and we are organizing around key markets with the goal of having a winning strategy for each of these markets. And finally, we are ensuring that any investment we make is customer facing and adds value while minimizing indirect spend.","What we expect from these changes is a high level of performance. In addition, our customers will see concrete changes in the stores stemming from our collaboration with key vendors, which we started last year, and the improvements in visual merchandising we mentioned earlier, as well as better tools made available to our sales consultants and customers.","The fifth area is supply chain. Our supply chain is a competitive advantage. It is driven by a powerful network of strategically located distribution centers and now with ship from store, our national retail footprint with shipping capabilities. ","Our goal over the next 24 months is to leverage this network and improve our customer experience by providing, number one, increased inventory availability, number two, improved speed to customer, and number three, improved home delivery and installation capabilities for our large [cube] assortments. To achieve this, we will continue to invest in systems and infrastructure to drive significantly enhanced delivery options. ","One example that has proven to be transformational is ship from store. In the fourth quarter, even in its early stages and with limited deployment, ship from store enabled significant online growth, improved online conversion, and increased store comps. ","Now that we have ship from store across our full store chain, in the first half of this year we will be able to use our over 1,400 stores and eight well located distribution centers to improve speed to customer, enabling faster delivery of online purchases at lower cost to Best Buy. In fact, we\u2019ve recently reduced the delivery window promise to customers by two full days, and we will also begin adding returns and open box items that are sitting in our stores to our online inventory. ","Along with the clear customer experience benefit, this capability will accelerate our online growth and provide us a major opportunity to further reduce the over $400 million we lose each year from returned products.","Our next priority focuses on Geek Squad services. The Geek Squad is one of Best Buy\u2019s biggest competitive advantages, and yet, at the same time, it is an underutilized asset. Our goal for the Geek Squad is to deliver an amazing and lasting customer experience while providing a key revenue and profit growth engine for the company.","Our goals for Geek Squad over the next 24 months are the following. Number one, to continue to reduce our legacy cost structure to help fund our price competitiveness. Number two, to improve our service delivery and the service experience we provide to our customers. Number three, it is to refine existing service offerings like our extended warranty services. Number four is to improve the merchandising of our services. And number five is to build new offerings that meet the needs of customers in the context of today\u2019s technology environment.","The next area is our cost structure. Our goal here is to more quickly and deeply reduce our costs. We announced this morning that we have eliminated a total of $765 million in annualized costs out of the original $725 million North American opportunity. ","We are now increasing our target from $725 million to $1 billion, and these additional cost reductions will be coming primarily from returns replacements and damages, logistics and supply chain, and procurement. And of course we will continue to rationalize our organization, and as we have done in the past, we will report on these savings when they have been executed. ","One key opportunity worth highlighting is returns, replacements, and damages, which are approximately 10% of revenue and are costing the company over $400 million a year in P&L losses. We feel confident that we can meaningfully reduce these losses. ","Actions we are taking include making this inventory more visible and easily purchased by customers by leveraging store clearance areas, [unintelligible], and ship from store. Also, improving the shopping experience for buying online clearance items through better site design, assortment, and clearance pricing, by expanding clearance pricing to more core categories and to open box products.","Finally, let me talk about a key foundational area of focus for us, which is employee engagement. Across the company, we must have a passionate commitment to serving our customers in such an extraordinary manner that they become promoters of Best Buy. Key to achieving this goal is the talent and engagement of our people.","In line with this, we\u2019ll be pursuing the following key initiatives over the next 24 months. Number one, successfully implementing our new field and store operating model. Number two, strengthening our talent in the critical areas of ecommerce and targeted, personalized marketing. Number three, enhancing our performance management process by streamlining the number of metrics and aligning team objectives across the company. And number four, redefining key business processes to better support our multichannel customer focused strategy. ","Now let me say one word about international before I conclude. In our international business, we will continue to focus on improving our performance. Largely as a part of our renewable initiatives, we reduced international SG&A by 12% in fiscal 2014. In the first quarter of this year, we have taken significant further actions to reduce Canada\u2019s cost structure.","So in summary, while our transformation is off to an encouraging start, it is still in its early stages. During fiscal 2014, we began the strong foundational work that will allow us to begin improving our performance and quite frankly we continue to be very excited by our concrete operational improvement opportunities. And of course, all of these initiatives we discussed today are in the pursuit of our long term non-GAAP target of 5% to 6% operating margin and 13% to 15% return on invested capital.","Let me now turn the call back over to Sharon for more comments about our financial outlook.","Sharon McCollam ","","Thank you, Hubert. In fiscal \u201915, as Hubert shared with you, we are focused on three imperatives to drive our Renew Blue transformation: improving our operational performance including more quickly and more deeply reducing our costs, building foundational capabilities necessary to unlock future growth strategies which will require incremental investment, and leveraging our unique assets like our customer database to create significant differentiation that is meaningful for our customers and our vendors.","With each of these imperatives that Hubert outlined comes year over year financial change, both positive and negative, and we know that modeling such changes absent additional information in a transformation like ours is extremely difficult. ","Therefore, as we have done in the past several quarters, we are providing you today with our quarterly estimates of how these discrete financial impacts will affect our quarterly operating income rates for 2015. ","These financial impacts continue to include the following business drivers: the negative impact of ongoing pricing investments, the negative impact of our incremental Renew Blue SG&A investments, the temporary negative impact of our mobile warranty costs, the negative impact of the economics of our new credit card agreement, and the offsetting positive impact of the realization of Renew Blue cost savings, which now total $765 million on an annualized basis.","In our Q3 fiscal \u201914 earnings release, we quantify the net year over year impact of these drivers to the operating income rate by quarter, as follows: negative 60 to 90 basis points in Q1 fiscal \u201915, negative 70 to 100 basis points in Q2 fiscal \u201915, and negative 30 to 60 basis points in Q3 fiscal \u201915.","Today, due to a higher than expected negative impact from the economics of the new credit card agreement, and the incremental year over year pricing investments, we are now expecting the net impact of these drivers to be a negative 70 to 90 basis points in Q1 fiscal \u201915.","But for Q2 and Q3 fiscal \u201915, we have good news, because due to the timing of the benefits associated with the greater Renew Blue cost savings that we discussed this morning, we will be able to significantly offset the impact of the negative P&L drivers that we provided in Q3 for those quarters.","We will also have discrete year over year impact related to income tax in fiscal \u201915. In Q1 fiscal \u201915, we expect to reorganize certain foreign legal entities to simplify our overall structure. This reorganization will accelerate a noncash tax benefit of approximately $0.87 to $1.01 per diluted share.","Due to its materiality, this benefit will be treated as a non-GAAP adjustment. In prior years, this benefit has been historically recognized, though, on a periodic basis. So as a result of this acceleration, the company will have a higher quarterly income tax expense and income tax rate going forward on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.","For tax purposes, this benefit will continue to be amortized. In addition, there are other discrete year over year income tax related items that we also expect will have a negative impact on the fiscal \u201915 income tax expense and the fiscal \u201915 income tax rate. We estimate the combined diluted EPS impact of these discrete income tax related items on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis to be as follows: negative $0.03 to $0.04 in Q1 fiscal \u201915, flat to positive $0.01 in Q2 fiscal \u201915, flat to negative $0.01 in Q3 fiscal \u201915, and negative $0.09 to $0.10 in Q4 fiscal \u201915.","From a revenue perspective, in light of overall economic concerns, we are assuming that the industry declines in the consumer electronics category that we saw in the fourth quarter will continue. As a result, it is reasonable to expect that total company revenue and comparable store sales will remain slightly negative, similar to Q4 fiscal \u201914 in the first half of the year.","But it\u2019s important to note that while it appears that our comparable store sales actually declined in January, in fact they were actually slightly better than the holiday. But due to the 30 basis point profit sharing payment that occurred in fiscal \u201913 that did not occur in fiscal \u201914, it appears that the cost was down, but in fact it was in line.","Thank you, and with that, I\u2019m going to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser - UBS ","I was hoping to get a little more clarity on what\u2019s driving your expectation for the industry to be down in the first half of the year, and then how that translates to your comp performance. You have been taking share, so why wouldn\u2019t we necessarily believe that share gains could offset a difficult environment?","Hubert Joly ","As we go to expectations, we\u2019ve seen the industry trends in Q4. We also see, and many retailers are reporting [unintelligible] on this, an environment with economic uncertainty, retail challenges. And of course, in consumer electronics, a lot of the market is dependent on new product introductions, and so until you know what the products are going to be, it\u2019s hard to predict.","So we find it\u2019s appropriate for us to be planning in a relatively proven fashion, if you will, that the market will not turn - until we see evidence that it turns, we should assume it will not turn - and focus on, as we have done in Q4, on what we can control. And so therefore the comment that Sharon made at the end of her observations that we are not planning positive comps during the first half of the year, though we won\u2019t complain if the comps turn positive, but in our planning. ","And therefore, you highlight everything we\u2019ve said about more deeply, more quickly reducing the costs, improving our operational performance, driving the efficiencies, [unintelligible] the foundations for our future in store growth. So we\u2019re focusing on what we can control and approaching the year in a prudent fashion. It\u2019s more a planning assumption than a true forecast, if you will. ","Michael Lasser - UBS ","What is the spread between the profitability of the online business and the store-based business now? If you could give some quantification of it? And how long do you think it will take to close that gap?","Sharon McCollam ","We\u2019re not going to quantify that. We think it\u2019s highly competitive, I think you would agree, as we compete with some of the giants. But what I would say is that what we expect is gradual and incremental improvement. ","And as you can see on the cost side, once we get the Athena project up and running, productivity of email and other aspects of online, sea changes in performance. So I won\u2019t reiterate all of the initiatives we had online, but when you look at those and you look at how they will benefit conversion. ","The other area that is significant for us in the online channel is attach rate. And right now we just launched the ability to attach services. That\u2019s a new capability that we brought on in Q4. But there is so much that needs to be done there, because you know that in our business, hardware comes at very low margins, and to improve the margin it\u2019s about the basket. So we have to be able, online, to compel the customer to fill out that hardware purchase with different services, accessories, etc.","So those are the big opportunities for us online, but as you look at our investments, this is going to be gradual and incremental, and quite frankly, there\u2019s only one direction that we would expect it to be going. It\u2019s a multiyear journey, for sure. There is a distance between these two numbers today, and that\u2019s why there\u2019s so much opportunity.","Operator","And our next question is from David Magee from SunTrust.","David Magee - SunTrust ","I have a question about the shops in the shops in 2013 and during the holiday. Net-net, how happy are you with the performance of those shops, and could we expect to see additional shops in 2014?","Hubert Joly ","The way we evaluate the shops in the shops is what the customers think, what the vendors think, and what we see. The customers have been very happy with the shopping experience, which is really transformational, very helpful. I think the vendors, I don\u2019t want to speak for them, maybe you can ask them directly, but let\u2019s say I think they\u2019re quite happy.","And for us, the way we measure the aggregate performance increasingly is in the overall performance of the company, and it\u2019s definitely having a positive contribution. So while we\u2019re not making specific announcements today in our good tradition of talking about things once they are in place, you can expect more and better of the same in this fiscal year. ","Operator","And our next question is from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. ","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research ","Your online business was up 25%. Your retail business was down 5%. I think some of the historical definitions of retail, looking at things on a per square foot or per store basis, are getting a little bit archaic. Can you talk to us a little bit about the behavior of your customer and how your revenue per active customer is looking, and if your online initiatives are making new customers, or just kind of preventing existing ones from defecting?","Hubert Joly ","You\u2019re absolutely right that thinking about the two channels independently makes no sense anymore, even though technically you can track where the transaction is completed. What we see is the [unintelligible] of our shopping experience is online. Customers start their shopping experience online. And that\u2019s why our strategic investments in the online shopping experience both with traffic and the experience on the site is fundamental. It\u2019s fundamental to our online business, and to our store business. ","So throughout the company, it\u2019s online first. The way our merchants are now thinking about the overall strategy, they spend so much time on that path, and improving the shopping experience. Of course, there\u2019s no blue shirt on the site, so you have to expand the shoppability of the site.","Now, whether or not the transaction gets completed on the site, for us, is a little bit irrelevant. This is up to the customer. We don\u2019t have a bias. Even though the economics in the short term are different, we don\u2019t have a bias. We\u2019re so incredibly customer focused, and so we drive this based on what the customer wants to do.","And I don\u2019t know, Sharon, if there\u2019s anything you want to add to this.","Sharon McCollam ","No, I think also that when you look at the competitive advantage that we have, realistically we have a store within 15 minutes of the U.S. population. So when you think about that, and you think about the online channels being the window into our business, the one thing that our online competitors cannot do is give it to them now, at this moment. And there are some abilities out there that are being developed, but if I want control of my purchase, we have a [moat] that makes it very easy for the customer to be served where and when they want to be served.","The interesting fact about that, which Hubert alluded to, is that today a very high percentage of our online sales actually are customers that picked the inventory up in our stores. And we love that, because that gives us the opportunity to interact with the customer, that gives us the opportunity to continue to build that personal relationship with the customer, and going forward we see that as a tremendous competitive advantage as we continue to get better and better at it. And we\u2019re making some very significant investments in that area so that the customer has a completely seamless experience as they go through the entire process. ","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research ","I appreciate that. I\u2019m also curious if you guys have a way of measuring whether or not you\u2019re attracting new customers with these initiatives, or whether we\u2019re kind of preventing customers from defecting the channel.","Hubert Joly ","I\u2019m sorry. I knew I was not completely answering your question. It\u2019s both. A significant portion of our growth is coming from new customers, and one of our key opportunities, by the way, as a company, is to expand our presence and become the preferred brand for the Millennial population. We do extremely well with the Boomers, I think we have opportunities with the Millennials, and our online push is going to be very helpful from that standpoint. And of course online is a way to expand the relationship with existing customers. ","So it\u2019s really both, and we\u2019ll continue to push in these areas. But I\u2019ll highlight some of the opportunities we have: attract new customers, expand the relationship with existing customers, and expand our share of wallet as we look at the various buying opportunities they have. ","Sharon McCollam ","And we saw that in the fourth quarter. In Hubert\u2019s remarks, he talked about the fact that we relaunched My Best Buy and the credit card. We saw a significant number of new members doing My Best Buy. In addition to that, we saw a higher penetration of customers using our financing and our credit card. So again, engaging that customer and putting our arms around then so that long term, when they look to where they want to buy their consumer electronics, they will choose Best Buy.","Hubert Joly ","In fact, I would like to highlight one thing. One thing that\u2019s very gratifying, both for the quarter and the year, is to see how customers are responding. Because we\u2019re gaining market share, so that\u2019s clear. And while the top line comps are slightly down, of course it\u2019s after the effects of deflation. From a transaction standpoint, customers are voting with their feet, both online and in aggregate, and giving us more of their business. ","So the combination of enhanced price competitiveness and improved customer experience, resulting in these gains, shows the strength of the Best Buy franchise and the foundations, the platform we have for growth looking ahead. That\u2019s very, very important. ","Operator","And next is Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank ","Can you discuss the promotion activity currently? What has changed since the holidays? It sounds to me, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, that the holidays just got extremely brutal and promotional and maybe things are more normal now. And so how do we therefore then think about gross margin trends for 2015 relative to that decline that you saw in the fourth quarter?","Sharon McCollam ","In my prepared remarks, I mentioned that in January we saw a less promotional environment. So once we exited the holiday, while it is still more promotional than a year ago from a cadence through the quarter point of view, we clearly saw the promotional environment be mitigated. As we look forward to 2015, obviously in the forecasts or the estimates that I gave you, one of those investments is pricing. ","And on a year over year basis, as you know, from Q1 to Q2 to Q3 to Q4, we had two pieces of our pricing. One is structural, and then one is the competitive side of it, and price matching, etc. So as we progress through 2015, in Q1 as an example, all the investments we made in Q2, Q3, and Q4 were not in Q1 last year. So in Q1 we\u2019re seeing the biggest impact, and then it starts to mitigate in Q2, and then in Q3 it mitigates again. ","And then of course our perspective, as Hubert said, is that we believe that even in an equal environment of promotional cadence next holiday, we believe that based on the tools and the marketing and the capabilities that we\u2019re building this year that our marketing effectiveness is going to be substantially better, and that when we go into the fourth quarter, even in that kind of an environment, we would see a much better margin outcome. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it for 2015. ","Operator","Next we have Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.","Gary Balter - Credit Suisse ","You went into Christmas kind of prepared, and then Walmart and Amazon and Target and everybody else went crazy. As we go into next Christmas, what do you envision will have changed? Will you have more vendor support? Will there be better control over UPC? How do you envision Christmas happening? Because it seems like every year we hit that point and people go whacko on pricing.","Hubert Joly ","A key thing that we are working on is we continue to improve capabilities of the foundational elements that I was talking about. Let me highlight a few. One is our marketing and promotional effectiveness. The ability for us to communicate to our customers in a relevant and more personalized fashion, we think, as we develop it gradually, is going to be helpful compared to blast emails only talking about price. So we think that\u2019s the first one.","The second thing is that continued improvements of the shopping experience. Those, as I think Sharon and I highlighted, are how on the site we are going to continue to make these improvements. Similarly, the shopping experience in the stores. So our strategy is to be price competitive and to build meaningful customer differentiation in terms of the unique value propositions we can offer to them as well as how we talk to them about this.","So these are new capabilities that we are developing and that we think are going to be helpful. Are we\u2019re planning the year with the assumption that all of a sudden the wolves are going to become sheep? No, of course not. And we\u2019re going to continue to be in there ready to compete and so forth. It is possible that what happened during holiday, the players, the industry, will be, you used the word \u201ccrazy\u201d, I\u2019m not going to say our competitors are crazy, but the intensity may go down. But we\u2019ll focus again on what we can control, which is what we do for our customers, how we talk to them, and then of course our efficiencies.","Sharon McCollam ","And then I\u2019d just like to add to that that there\u2019s a couple of other things that we did this year that we, because of the timing of our transformation, when Hubert came in, etc., a lot of these things got launched in October, right before the holiday season. So take My Best Buy, the launch of the new credit card, some of the ecommerce capabilities. We put new buying guides on the website. There was a litany of things that we did.","Obviously, when you do that you are putting in new capability, you are learning from those capabilities, and a year down the road is like a lifetime. So all of these programs, all of this investment, which was substantial, as you know, you can see our capex, that going into 2015 holiday we are going to have a lot more experience in that. ","The other area that Hubert alluded to was pricing. We are investing in pricing capabilities this year. He\u2019s said from the day he started that we\u2019ve had a very underdeveloped pricing, modeling capability in the company. So when you start working on those things, they make a substantial difference, and we will continue to invest in those all year. They\u2019ll get better and better, and by the time we get into holiday, we think that we\u2019ll be able to put all of those together and come to market and to our customer in a substantially more compelling way.","Operator","And next is David Schick with Stifel. ","David Schick - Stifel","I\u2019d like to go back to online. Your online sales have accelerated quite nicely, 10% up into the teens. It even looks like the accelerated from holiday to the full quarter. So out of the holiday. How much of that is just the way consumers are thinking and interacting with Best Buy, the way you talked about prior, or how much of that is new capabilities you\u2019re turning on and\/or anything you\u2019re doing with compensation for store associates or measurement regarding the online trend?","Hubert Joly ","I think you\u2019re absolutely right to note the acceleration. And we hope to continue to accelerate the acceleration. And we have to wait now. I think because [unintelligible] we\u2019re gaining share online, which of course is our goal. We have some catching up to do. So this is the result of more traffic going to the site, and we are doing a better job converting that traffic, both on the site and then in the stores.","So to take some examples of the latter meaning, the new capabilities, that\u2019s [unintelligible] ship from store. We had highlighted how, in the past, a portion of the traffic on the site, looking for a product, the product was not available in the online distribution centers, but was available in the stores. The unlocking of ship from store, up to 400 stores doing [unintelligible], now all of the stores, has allowed us to accelerate the online growth in a significant fashion.","Our in store pickup capabilities are a very strong competitive advantage. It\u2019s roughly half of the online purchases that are picked up in the store, showing how meaningful our stores are as an asset. And please know that at Best Buy the store general managers and their teams are compensated not only on the brick and mortar revenue, but on the holistic revenue, and clearly with all of our stores now involving ship from store, they completely get it. ","And increasingly, the focus in the store, same as online, is the product is not available in the store, how can I get it to you? From another store? From our DC? And not available is not part of our vocabulary, and finding an answer is always part of our vocabulary. ","So I think we are appealing to new customers, and gradually, we\u2019re doing a better job of responding to our customers.","Sharon McCollam ","Another very important aspect of that, especially in holiday this year, was the implementation of a new search engine on our website. Earlier last year we talked to you about the fact that the search engine that was operating on the site was nearly 10 years old. And customers were coming to the site and they were searching for products and of course the search engine was not robust enough for them to find what they were looking for. ","And when customers are trained by companies like Google, I type it in and it shows up, that\u2019s what they expect. And they\u2019re not going to type very many times until they get bored and walk away. The new search engine is state of the art technology and these search engines get smarter over time. ","Again, this gets into the discussion of the fact that we launched it right before holiday and again, it\u2019s getting better and better as we move forward. But during holiday, the new search engine certainly made a substantial difference as well, another investment that we made that made a big difference. ","Operator","And our final question comes from David Strasser with Janney Capital Markets.","David Strasser - Janney Capital Markets ","One question around pricing optimization, I guess. You had talked about that in the past. Is there an opportunity there as you go into this year? Where does that play into sort of what you\u2019ve talked about? And I guess along those lines, during the call you had mentioned vendor support, and I was just sort of curious if you could give a little bit more detail how that vendor support changed from December to January and helped the gross margin from what you had seen over holiday and sort of how that happened?","Hubert Joly ","So price optimization, our strategy is to be price competitive, and we will continue to invest in that, as we\u2019ve done last year. But of course you can be smart about it. And pricing is a very sophisticated science, so I would highlight a couple of areas to think about. ","One is marketing and promotional effectiveness. I don\u2019t know any company in the world that doesn\u2019t have opportunities in this area, and believe me, we do. So making sure that the promotions we do have the right return on investment. It\u2019s back to relevant communication to the customers of how we talk to them, to whom, when, and how. And then there\u2019s also tactical optimization. I don\u2019t want to go into too much detail, but there\u2019s more optimization really at the regional level, and so forth. ","As it relates to vendors, I\u2019m not going to give a lot of color around this, but one of the key assets that has always struck me ever since I joined the company is how important Best Buy is for key vendors and [unintelligible] to their success. And so our teams work closely with them. There were some dialogs after the holidays, and there was good contribution, as is always the case. There was nothing extraordinary, but until it\u2019s in the bank, you don\u2019t necessarily bank on it.","And so we\u2019ll continue to work with our vendor partners to optimize the business for the customers, for themselves, and for ourselves. So it was part of the surprise that changed our expectations as it relates to the EPS for the quarter.","David Strasser - Janney Capital Markets ","Any thoughts on buybacks? I know you\u2019ve kind of gone back and forth on that last year. Any further thoughts when you look at your cash balance and cash flow and stuff about this year and buyback?","Sharon McCollam ","We\u2019re going to continue to evaluate our cash balance, obviously. Hubert and I believe deeply that putting a [fortress] on this balance sheet is really important. Obviously we know what bumps in the road look like, but we also know that over time there is a level of cash that makes sense and is a fortress and then there\u2019s the time when you exceed that. At this point, we are very comfortable with where we\u2019re sitting on our balance sheet and we\u2019ll be talking about this over the next 12 months. But at this time, we do not have any plans on a share buyback.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Hubert for closing comments.","Hubert Joly ","Thanks, everyone, and before I close, I absolutely have to say something, which is of course these accomplishments that we\u2019re excited about would not have been possible without the dedication, the commitment, the hard work of the entire Best Buy team throughout the country and the world, and our vendor partners. And I have to honor them for their [unbelievable] contributions. ","And also I have to thank all of you and our customers, and hopefully all of you are customers, for the business, and your ongoing loyalty and support to our company and our brand. And with this, I would like to thank you for your attention, your continued interest in our company. I wish you a very good day. Thank you all. "],"3582":["Best Buy Co., Inc.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 1:00 P.M. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions].","I will now turn the conference over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Mollie O'Brien","Thank you and good morning everyone. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our Chairman and CEO, Corie Barry, our CFO and Chief Transformation Officer and Mike Mohan, our U.S. Chief Operating Officer.","During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earning release, which is available on our website.","Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.","I will now turn the call over to Hubert.","Hubert Joly","Thank you Mollie and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for what is my last earnings call as CEO of this great company. As you know, we made an exciting announcement last month. On June 11, Corie Barry will become the fifth CEO in Best Buy's 53 year history. At that time, I will transition to the newly created role of Executive Chairman of the Board. Also, Mike Mohan role will be elevated as he moves from being our domestic Chief Operating Officer to the company's President and Chief Operating Officer.","I am very proud of the seamless transition we have decided to implement as it reflects positively on our momentum as well as on our focus on executive development and succession planning. It is clearly designed to ensure strategic and leadership continuity and I am grateful to the members of our Board of Directors for their diligence and care in overseeing this critical process.","Before I share more thoughts on our leadership transition, let me first review our quarterly performance and provide an update on our progress as we implement our Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue strategy. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our financial results and outlook.","So Q1 was a strong quarter and a good start to the year. We reported $9.14 billion in revenue and grew our enterprise comparable sales by 1.1%, which was at the high end of our guidance. We also delivered better-than-expected profitability. We expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate by 50 basis points and delivered on non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.02, which was up 24% compared to the first quarter of last year. I want to thank our associates across the company for their hard work and dedication in delivering these strong results.","Before I discuss the progress we made on our Best Buy 2020 strategy, I would like to share some brief thoughts on tariffs on goods from China. First, let me say that the administration has so far done a very good job of minimizing the impact of tariffs on U.S. consumers by limiting the number of consumer products on the tariff list. They have done this in part by taking input from companies like us. And so far, we have been able to minimize the impact of these tariffs by employing a number of mitigation strategies, including by buying products ahead of the tariffs being implemented and by working with our vendors.","Second, --","[AUDIO GAP]","Operator","Pardon the interruption. This is the operator. We are having a little bit of trouble hearing you, sir. Sir, we are still unable to hear you.","Hubert Joly","Okay.","Operator","Sir, we are still having a little bit of trouble hearing you. Ladies and gentlemen, we are experiencing a temporary interruption in today's call. Please stand by and the call will recommence very shortly.","Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your patience. The conference will now recommence.","Hubert Joly","We are sorry for the interruption because of and I apologize for that, technical issue. I will recommence my comments with when I started to talk about tariffs and tariffs on goods from China.","So what I was saying is that first, the administration has so far done a very good job of minimizing the impact of tariffs on U.S. consumers by limiting the number of consumer products on the tariff list. And they have done is in part by taking input from companies like us. And so far, we have been able to minimize the impact of these tariffs by employing a number of mitigation strategies, including by buying products ahead of the tariffs being implemented and by working with our vendors.","Second, no decision has been made by the administration at this point on the actual implementation of tariffs on additional product categories. There is a comprehensive process the administration will be going through to take inputs and we intend to be actively engaged in this process to help the administration continue to minimize the impact of tariffs on U.S. consumers.","In addition, there is time for the trade negotiations to progress before any decision gets made. As Corie will discuss, our fiscal 2020 guidance incorporates the estimated impact of the recent move from 10% to 25% tariffs on this List 3. As a reminder, we estimate that List 3, which is the $200 billion list that went into effect last September is only about 7% of our total annual cost of goods sold. Many of the products on this list are accessories.","And while we understand List 4 as proposed is comprised of many consumer items, including many electronics, we think it is premature to speculate on the impact of further tariffs as it is unclear whether List 4 will actually be implemented, what products would ultimately be included, at what rates and when. But one thing is of course certain as other retailers have noted the impact of tariffs at 25% will result in price increases and will be shelled by U.S. consumers. We will of course continue to work to minimize the impact of the trade negotiations on U.S. consumers and will continue to update you on this matter.","Now let me update on our progress as we implement our Best Buy 2020 strategy to enrich lives with technology and further develop our competitive differentiation. In health, we continue to make progress, both in terms of scaling the GreatCall consumer devices and services and advancing our commercial monitoring service with a focus on aging seniors. Our focus is to enable seniors to live longer in their homes and help reduce their healthcare costs. We believe that the combination of technology and our human touch provided through the ability to access and engage people in their home is a highly relevant and differentiated proposition. We are excited to continue to build our capabilities to support the growth of this business.","First, we will be opening a third GreatCall caring center in October. The center, located in San Antonio, Texas with 400 care agents and provide 24x7 technical phone support, concierge services and urgent response services to customers. Second, this month we have required a senior focused health services company called Critical Signal Technologies or CST to help scale the commercial monitoring business. CST has approximately 100,000 senior subscribers.","Some of [indiscernible] services as a supplemental benefits under their Medicare Advantage plan. Coverage under Medicare Advantage plans is helpful to growing our commercial business because it allows us to engage with insurers and build our service into their plans as a way to both improve their member experience and help them save on costs. The acquisition of CST will thereby help facilitate our access to in penetration of the commercial market.","We are excited about the prospects of combining CST's services and relationships with the existing GreatCall business. More broadly, this tuck-in acquisition, together with GreatCall, complements our existing capabilities like Geek Squad and In-Home Advisors to better serve both the seniors in their home and those who support them like payors and providers.","During Q1, we also continued to expand our Total Tech Support program, which provides members unlimited Geek Squad support for all their technology, no matter where or when they bought it. We continue to grow the member base at a steady rate while executing on our roadmap to drive the customer experience. Another first quarter example of how we are expanding what we do for customers is the rollout of our lease-to-own program.","The financing provided through our Best Buy credit card is an important benefit we offer customers where there are people who are going to be interested in getting a credit card who are unable to quantify for it because of low credit scores or in many cases, simply no credit history. Our lease-to-own program provides another option for enabling customers to make periodic payments over a fixed period eventually leading to full ownership of the product once the agreement has been fulfilled.","During the quarter, we launched the offer across 36 states or about 70% of our stores and expect to roll it out to another nine states later this year. Customers are using the option to acquire products across a wide variety of categories with the largest being computing. In addition, we found during the pilot that a significant number of customers are choosing to pick advantage of Progressive Leasing's 90-day purchase option, which consist of a $79 initial payment plus the retail price.","The offering is consistent with our strategy to enrich lives through technology by opening up the experiences that we offer to new customers that might not otherwise have the chance to acquire the kind of solutions that we sell. In many cases, it will allow us to catch customers early on in their credit history and build a relationship with them over time.","In addition to expanding what we do for customers, we are continuing to evolve the way we interact with our customers across their homes, our stores and digitally. As we mentioned during our last call, we are developing a holistic home strategy to leverage all of the ways we currently interact with customers in their home to create meaningful relationships and further differentiate Best Buy.","Our in-home consultation program is one of the ways that we deliver experiences in the home today. The program continues to build and it is clear there is a real customer need we are addressing. And from a financial standpoint, we continue to see higher revenue per order and higher gross profit from these interactions in the store and online. We expect to add a similar number of advisors this year as we did last year, which would put us around 700 advisors at the end of the year.","In addition, we are working to enhance the productivity of our advisors, but eliminating manual processes so that they can focus more time on their customers. For example, starting this quarter we will begin automating our proposal and client telling processes and enable the ability for customers to chat online real-time with their advisor.","I would also like to say a few words about how we are transforming our supply chain to improve the experience for our customers. When we laid out a multiyear plan at our Investor Day in 2017, we shared our belief that the vast majority of our assortment need to be available anywhere you wanted the next day at the latest. Through a combination of initiatives including expanded partnerships, the deployment of metro e-commerce centers across key cities and automation, we continue to improve our speed of delivery to customers and expand next-day and same-day delivery options.","As we shared last quarter, we offer same-day delivery on thousands of items in 40 metro areas. In addition, we offer next-day delivery options in 60 metro areas on orders over $35 for free with no membership fees. In fact, customers can order as late as 8 P.M. in Los Angeles and New York City and 5:30 P.M. in the other metro areas and will get their package delivered the next day. 77% of Best Buy customers are in a ZIP Code where we are able to offer this service today and thousands of SKUs are eligible.","In addition to our various shipping options, all of our customers also have the extremely convenient option to pick up their products in our stores within one hour of placing their order. Even with all the improved shipping options and enhancements available to our customers, they are increasingly choosing to pick up their products in one of our nearly 1,000 stores. And so in-store pickup of online orders is now about 40% of our online revenue and growing.","Automation is an important part of our supply chain transformation and starting in Q4 of last year, we have been rolling out new automating boxing technology in our distribution center that builds real-time custom boxes for products coming down a conveyor belt. Earlier this year, Barron's named Best Buy number one on its list of the 100 Most Sustainable Companies. And this cutting-edge boxing technology is an example of our sustainability efforts. In addition to driving productivity, it reduces environmental waste by eliminating excess corrugated cardboard and all-plastic packaging fillers.","Overall our supply chain strategy is to leverage our assets of stores, distribution centers and metro e-commerce centers in a portfolio approach. That allows us to optimize speed, convenience and cost to meet customer needs at the right time and place. We are still in the midst of this multiyear transformation, but we like where we are and where we are going.","Of course, we also continue to drive efficiencies and reduce costs in order to fund investments and offset pressures. During the first quarter, we achieved $35 million in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies, bringing the cumulative total to $575 million since Q2 fiscal 2018. This is towards our fiscal 2021 goal of $600 million.","Before I turn the call over to Corie, I would now like to say a few words about our upcoming management transition and my excitement about the future of our company. The choice of timing of the CEO transition is probably more of an art than a science. I personally felt it was the right time for me to trigger this leadership transition for several reasons.","First, I had felt we had achieved what I had hoped to accomplish when I joined on the company in 2012. I am proud of what we have delivered for customers, our employees, our vendors, our shareholders and our communities.","Second, I felt we had built the depth and breadth of talent necessary to carry Best Buy into the future. Last September, we put in place a new leadership organization by elevating Corie and Mike to new roles with greater responsibilities. In the time since then, I have been very impressed by the effectiveness of our team and these leaders.","Third, with a clear an exciting purpose to enrich lives with technology, we set out two years ago to implement a strategy focused on addressing key human needs in entertainment, productivity, communication, food, security and health and wellness. We have essentially achieved fiscal 2021 revenue and non-GAAP operating income target two years ahead of plan. And while we still have a lot to do from a transformation standpoint, it is clear that we are on the right path.","Fourth, we have announced plans to host a meeting with the investment community later this year. I thought it was important that the leaders who stand in front of this audience to lay out our roadmap for the future with a team that is responsible for carrying that strategy forward. So in my new role, I will of course continue to lead the Board of Directors. I will also advise and support Corie on key matters such as strategy, capability building, M&A and external relationships. In addition, I will assume certain responsibilities at Corie's request in areas like government affairs, community relations and leadership development.","In closing, let me say that I could not be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us and confidence in the team we have built as well as our talents, culture, heart and soul. I look forward to continuing to work with Corie, the team and the Board in my new role manual to help them strategy and transformation with one goal in mind fulfilling our purpose to enrich lives with technology, doing well by doing good.","And I want to thank you, our shareholders and journalists who cover, for your support over the past several years, I have thoroughly enjoyed our ongoing dialogue. Our interactions have not only been stimulating, but it has challenged us to be better as a management team and as a company. And likewise, I want to thank my colleagues for our collaboration and their friendship. Working together, we turned around and then began going this wonderful company. It has been the honor of my professional life to work with all of you as we did this. The company is in good hands with our new leadership and the best of talents we have. And I am confident that the journey we began in 2012 will continue well into the years ahead.","And now, I am very excited to turn the call over to our CFO and future CEO, Corie Barry.","Corie Barry","Good morning everyone. I am deeply grateful to Hubert and the rest of the Board of Directors for their confidence in me and their clear belief that this leadership evolution is in the best interests of Best Buy and all its stakeholders. Nearly seven years ago, the Board made a stunningly good decision when they asked a Frenchman with no retail experience to save this company and he brought his remarkable brain, boundless energy and deep passion to the job. My personal gratitude to Hubert knows no limits and I am delighted to have him nearby to call upon for advice and counsel in his new role as Executive Chair.","As I think about my new role, I could not be more fortunate to have Mike Mohan at my side as our President and COO. I have worked closely with Mike for the past 15 years and I am so excited to continue to work with him and the rest of the leadership team in this next chapter as we implement the strategy that we helped build together. As far as my successor in the CFO role, we are in the midst of the search process for a new Chief Financial Officer.","Now on to the Q1 financial details. Before I talk about our first quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. On enterprise revenue of $9.14 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.02. The EPS result exceeded our expectations and our revenue performance was near the high end of our guidance range. Our operating income rate exceeded our expectations, primarily due to a higher gross profit rate and strong expense management. The lower effective tax rate also provided a benefit of approximately $0.03 versus our earnings per share guidance.","I will now talk about our first quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 0.4% to $9.14 billion, primarily due to the comparable sales increase of 1.1%. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.20 or 24% to $1.02. This increase was primarily due to higher operating income, which was driven by lower incentive compensation and a $0.06 per share benefit from the net share count change.","In our domestic segment, revenue increased 0.8% to $8.48 billion. This increase was driven by a comparable sales increase of 1.3% and revenue from GreatCall, which was acquired in October 2018, partially offset by the loss of revenue from 105 Best Buy mobile and 12 large-format store code closures in the past year. From a merchandising perspective, the largest comparable sales growth drivers were appliances which includes both major and small appliances, wearables and tablets. These drivers were partially offset by declines in our entertainment category. Domestic online revenue of $1.31 billion was 15.4% of domestic revenue, up from 13.6% last year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 14.5% on top of 12% growth in the first quarter of last year, which was primarily driven by higher average order values and increased traffic.","In our international segment, revenue decreased 5.2% to $661 million. This was primarily driven by approximately 390 basis points of negative foreign currency impact and a comparable sales decline of 1.2%. The comparable sales decline was driven by Canada and was partially offset by positive comparable sales in Mexico.","Turning now to gross profit. The enterprise gross profit rate increased 40 basis points to 23.7%. The domestic gross profit rate was 23.7% versus 23.3% last year. The 40 basis point increase was primarily driven by the impact of GreatCall's higher gross profit rate and improved product margin rates, which included the benefit of gross profit optimization initiative. These favorable items were partially offset by higher supply chain costs. The international non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 80 basis points to 24.2%, primarily due to higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada, which included improved gross profit rates in several product categories and increased revenue in the higher margin rate services category.","Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise non-GAAP SG&A was $1.82 billion or 19.9% of revenue, which decreased $5 million and 10 basis points to last year as a percentage of revenue. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.66 billion or 19.6% of revenue versus 19.7% of revenue last year. SG&A dollars were essentially flat to last year as GreatCall operating expenses were primarily offset by lower incentive compensation expense. International non-GAAP SG&A was $158 million or 23.9% of revenue versus $164 million or 23.5% of revenue last year. The $6 million decrease was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, which were partially offset by the impact of new stores opened in Mexico in the past year.","On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate of 20.1% compared to 20% last year. Versus our guidance, the effective tax rate was approximately 250 basis point better than expected which was primarily driven by a larger tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. From a cash flow perspective, we ended the quarter in line with our expectations. We returned a total of $232 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $98 million and dividends of $134 million. Our regular quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share was an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. As we announced last quarter, we intend to spend between $750 million and $1 billion on share repurchases in fiscal 2020.","In the first quarter, we adopted a new standard for lease accounting. The most significant impact of adoption was the recognition of operating lease assets of $2.7 billion and operating lease liabilities of $2.8 billion, respectively. The standard does not materially affect our consolidated statements of earnings or cash flows.","Lastly, I will discuss our outlook. Our original full year guidance provided last quarter reflected our estimated impact from the List 3 tariffs at 10%. Today, we are reiterating that guidance. It balances our better-than-expected Q1 earnings, the fact that it is early in the year and our best estimate of the impact associated with the recent increase in tariffs on goods imported from China. Specifically, I am referring to the increase in tariffs from 10% to 25% on the products on the $200 billion List 3 that originally went into effect last September.","Our fiscal 2020 guidance does not incorporate a List 4. As a reminder, our full year fiscal 2020 guidance includes enterprise revenue in the range of $42.9 billion to $43.9 billion and enterprise comparable sales of 0.5% to 2.5%. This topline growth expectation is on top of the best two year stack in 14 years and reflects factors such as the anticipated cyclical slowdown of the traditional console gaming category and the continued maturation of the mobile phone category.","We expect our enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate to be approximately 4.6%, which is flat to fiscal 2019's rate and reflects our focus on balancing investments in our strategy, pressures in the business and efficiencies. We expect our non-GAAP effective income tax rate to be approximately 24.5% and our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.45 to $5.65. Finally, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $850 million to $900 million.","I would like to reiterate the assumptions reflected in our annual guidance that we shared last quarter. Our investments, in particular in specialty labor, technology and increased depreciation related to strategic capital investments and ongoing pressures in the business will be partially offset by a combination of returns from new initiatives and ongoing cost reductions and efficiencies. Although there will be variations between quarters, our outlook for the full year assumes gross profit as a percent of revenue will be approximately flat to fiscal 2019 as continued investments in supply chain and higher transportation costs are offset by the higher margin rate of GreatCall.","SG&A dollars are expected to grow as a percentage in the low single digits and be approximately flat as a percent of revenue to fiscal 2019. Increased expenses of GreatCall and continued investments in technology and wages are expected to be partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense as we reset our performance targets to align with our fiscal 2020 expectations.","For the second quarter specifically, we are expecting the following, enterprise revenue in the range of $9.5 billion to $9.6 billion, enterprise comparable sales growth of 1.5% to 2.5%, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.95 to $1, non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 24.5% and a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 269 million shares.","I would like to provide a few notes of color for Q2. We expect our Q2 gross profit rate to expand slightly versus last year. We also expect our SG&A dollars to grow as a percentage in the low to mid single digits. This increase in SG&A is expected to come primarily from the higher GreatCall operating expenses and increased advertising spend. Although the higher SG&A will be partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense, the benefit versus last year is anticipated to be considerably lower than the year-over-year benefit we realized in Q1.","Lastly, the acquisition of CST closed during Q2 and was funded with existing cash. The acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on our revenue or non-GAAP operating income this fiscal year.","I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Brian Nagel","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Hubert Joly","Good morning Brian.","Brian Nagel","First off, congratulations to everyone on their new roles. Very well deserved.","Corie Barry","Thank you.","Brian Nagel","So I wanted to ask you one question. I just want to talk about the lease-to-own please program, Hubert, you mentioned in your prepared comments, but you have started to roll this out now. I guess the question is, if you look at this program, how big could it be? And the consumer that you are serving with this, is it truly an incremental consumer to Best Buy? And how should we think about any financial implications to Best Buy from these sales?","Corie Barry","Yes. So I will start and Hubert can pile on. I think what I would start with first is what we want to offer is a variety of customer purchase options. So I think that's really important and you know that. But I think it's important to start with, our branded credit card is already 25% of the business that we do. You can see that in any of our filings. So that's kind of our starting point in terms of customer purchase options. What we like then is adding Progressive on top of that because it's what you are digging at, there is another suite of customers who just might not be able to qualify for the branded cards or frankly might not want to and would like to look at something that's a little bit different. We are seeing so far that the customers that engage with this program do think of the incremental to Best Buy and so they are not customers who would be necessarily, for the most part, maybe seen before or haven't certainly seen in a while. And you heard in our prepared remarks, we have now rolled out to almost 700 stores, 689. So that's two-thirds right now. We are hoping that by the end of the year, we can go out to another nine states before holiday. And so that will get us significantly across our store base. We are not sizing it right now and because we are still rolling, we are learning a lot even as we roll. Like we said in our prepared remarks, we rolled halfway through the quarter. And one of the things we know for sure is that as the stores are on the program longer, they become more and more proficient around the program. And so you know, we like what we are seeing. We feel like we really are addressing a customer need, very in line with the strategy and that we are providing a whole another suite of purchase option and we will continue to see how it grows over time.","Brian Nagel","Perfect. Thank you very much. And congratulations.","Corie Barry","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Joseph Feldman of Telsey.","Joseph Feldman","Yes. Hi guys. Good morning and congratulations to everybody. I just wanted to ask, I noticed inventory was up a little bit. Is anything going on there that you can talk about? Maybe it's just bringing in goods ahead of the tariff list? Or just ready for the spring or anything with that?","Corie Barry","Thank you Joe. A little bit more of the latter, honestly. Because if you think about when the tariffs going out, it was actually very close to the end of our quarter. And so this is really about us making sure we felt we have a good position heading into Memorial Day and then Father's Day and really light in a couple of spots last year. And so, as a team we had the opportunity to bring inventory to make sure we were well set.","The other thing I would say, I am incredibly impressed by our merchant demand planning team and the health of the inventory is some of the best that we have ever seen. We have very low [indiscernible] left right now and we have been moving to the inventory nicely. So really nothing to read into there, just preparing for what is that string of kind of secondary holidays that happened during 2Q.","Joseph Feldman","Got it. Thanks. And then, I know you mentioned that part of the SG&A maybe being up a little bit in the second quarter. You talked about ad expenses being a little higher. Is there a different strategy that you guys are employing this year ago to after some of those like Father's Day, graduation, holidays? Or what would be the reason for that?","Corie Barry","Yes. I think we have liked so far what we have seen in some of our newer brand positioning. And you are absolutely right, if we are going to over-index in a quarter, Q2 makes a lot of sense given the string of secondary holidays we have. You have got Memorial Day. You have got Father's Day, the Fourth of July, even head into prime day later.","And so you have got a whole string here and we feel like if we are going to over index and prefer a return on that spend, this is the right period of time for us to do it. And we can lift up some new and refreshed brand messaging. And so we felt like it is an important time of the year for us push a few more of our chips in on that.","Joseph Feldman","That's helpful. Thanks and good luck with this quarter, guys.","Corie Barry","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Mike Baker of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Please go ahead. Mr. Baker. Your line is open. It appears Mr. Baker has stepped away from the phone. We will go to our next question from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simeon Gutman","Hi. Good morning. Hubert, I have a feeling that my name gets like that. I think it happened on the first call that you did a long time ago. So my first question or I guess my only question is, anything surprised you about sales in the first quarter with regard to cadence, with regard to categories? And just drilling into the computing and mobile category, can we talk about laptops, desktop trends? And then anything with mobile as far as replacement rate, uptake in the category in general? Thank you.","Corie Barry","So on the overall sales cadence, it actually played relatively closely to how we thought. If you remember, how we kind of set up the quarter we said, we felt like the consumer environment remains relatively favorable and I think most metrics would point to that continuing to be a good environment. We did have a little bit of pause around tax refunds that we mentioned.","And if you remember, when we were into the quarter, refunds both quantity and amount were down about 40% and we said we were still gauging how much of that will come back. You ended up based on the IRS data with tax return total amount down about 2.4%. So we think that probably is like just a little bit of softness in this quarter, which again was kind of in line with how we guided for the quarter.","And it is important to note, we also and we said we saw a softer than expected revenue in international. Now that's very much tied to the macro environment there. You can see that GDP is down in Canada and oil prices are struggling. And so you have got a bunch of things happening there that we think are more macro side. But in general, that wasn't anything that was an outlier.","In terms of the computing and mobile business, I am going to take those a little bit separately. Computing, we kind of look at computing and tablets together. We talk about tablets as being an area of strength but it's a lot of the higher end, higher processing power, big gun kind of tablets which you can imagine you look at in light of computing. We didn't see a major change in trajectory there as we think about those categories together. A little bit more strength on the tablet side, a little bit less on the computing side. But we can see people making trade-offs between those two spaces.","From our mobile perspective, that was actually just a slightly bit better than we thought it would be but it was still down year-over-year. And so again that's a category where we have said for a while, we kind of have some moderate expectations around growth there. It's definitely maturing and we continue to see a highly penetrated category, where there is a kind new reasons to buy.","Simeon Gutman","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jonathan Matuszewski of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Matuszewski","Great. Thanks for taking my question. So Total Tech Support seems to have some nice momentum lately in terms of enrollments and some healthy renewal rates based on our work. Could you just spend some time talking about the bigger picture here and the behavior of a typical Total Tech Support member since you rolled out the program acknowledging the fact that the initiative is still new? So when you are looking at the data, are you able to see a lift in the number of categories that these customers shop after joining or an increase in the number of visits to the store or better online engagement or anything along those trends? And I guess related to that, when do you typically see a ramp in any of these changes? Is it after they utilize the membership a few times or after they renew their membership or some other guidepost? Thanks.","Corie Barry","Absolutely. So first, I am just going to take one step back and say, the most important thing around Total Tech Support is, we strategically like the relationship it helps us build with our customers. Now what's tricky is that we are just now lapping our nationwide rollout of Total Tech Support. So we are just starting to see in a larger quantity what do renewal rates look like, what does customer behavior look like over a year. And again, with us, it's a little trickier because our customers tend to have lower frequency overall than some other retailers. So it takes us a long way to figure out what are the longer term customer behavioral implications.","We talked a little bit about it on the last call. We are definitely seeing nice usage upfront in the program. And renewal rates have stuck at the levels we thought they would. And so we are seeing usage in line with what we thought. We are seeing renewal rates in line with what we thought. We are seeing a ton of surprises but we just don't have a lot of data on yet is, is it pushing more purchase behavior, is it keeping people engaged with Best Buy longer. We just need a little bit longer on the program to be able to give you some more information and data around that.","In terms of what we see when we try to ramp programs like this, as you can imagine, it's not just about ramping the program because that has proficiency implications with how we sell at the store. Our associates have done an amazing job really learning about this program and then helping customers see the true benefit of it. It's a very different service sale than anything we have done historically. And I think our associates have learned a lot over the last year and continue to just get better and better helping a customer understand why this would be perfect for them.","I think the other thing that we are also behind the scene were continuously trying to improve the customer experience, both from a digital perspective, how I can sell, how I can see what I have, how I can look up how to repair something myself, but also importantly from how we help you, how we prioritize your service visits and how we make sure we are helping you in the moment as quickly as possible. And so I think you are going to continue to see a ramp in performance here and it's not just proficiency. It's also how do we continue to add customer value propositions behind the scene that makes us more and more palatable for customers as a way to stay engaged with Best Buy.","Jonathan Matuszewski","Great. That's helpful. Thank you.","Corie Barry","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from Gregory Melich of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Gregory Melich","Great. Thanks Hubert. Thanks for everything over the years. And Corie, my congratulations, well deserved.","Hubert Joly","Thank you.","Gregory Melich","So no good dead goes unpunished. Thank you for the tariff information. If you were to look at List 4 now, what percentage of your COGS would that be? It was nice to have the 7% on the current list, but could you help us on that front? And then I have a follow-up.","Corie Barry","So I think the trick with List 4 is that it hasn't actually, it hasn't been defined. It hasn't even got into place yet. There's a lot of discussions that Hubert alluded to in his opening statement around what exactly will be included on that list and when it will go into implementation. And so it's very difficult right now, given the amount of change that's happening in that list for us to size it at this point and we haven't come out yet with any sizing on that list.","I think Hubert, you might have something to add.","Hubert Joly","Yes. Greg, what I would highlight is that the administration is going to be going through a process of listening. And as said in my prepared remarks, no decision has been made. I think Secretary Mnuchin yesterday made a comment about the fact that he is going to be very attentive to the impact on consumers. So this is a complex discussion. No decision has been made. Even when decisions will be made, what rate will be applied, to what products, when, the when is going to be very important and then of course, we have always assumed that this negotiation process with China would not be linear.","And so there is a meeting at the end of June and so rather than trying to forecast something, I think that our actions today are to be engaged in the discussion process. We would like to be as helpful as we can in support of the administration goals to minimize the impact on U.S. consumers. So expect us to be very active on this front in the future to be helpful.","Gregory Melich","Yes. Maybe given your experience with the washing machine and laundry product tariffs, maybe take us through what you think, how that played out and the impact on consumers and any sort of demand response? If you can glean anything from that, that would be helpful.","Corie Barry","Yes. So the appliances tariff is tricky, specifically washing machines and definitely the price increases were certainly, to begin with, passed on directly. Units did decline, but that impact was offset somewhat by higher prices. The hard part is, I would not try to drive comparisons with that category, because that's a category, you go buy a washing machine because of duress or need and it doesn't have the same elasticity as some of the other products that we sell. And so I don't think that's a great indicator of how behaviorally people will respond, especially at the different levels of 10% to 25%, I think you are going to end up with potentially some different consumer buying behaviors.","Gregory Melich","And also across more categories, right, because ultimately people have to make decisions. All right. Okay. Thanks a lot and good luck to all of you and congrats.","Hubert Joly","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Zach Fadem of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Zach Fadem","Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to talk about the demand you have seen over the years for appliances, home theater, smart home, et cetera? And could you walk us through just how much of your business you believe is related or tied to housing? Whether you see that as a headwind today? And maybe talk about how you see home services fitting into this ecosystem? Thanks.","Corie Barry","Yes. So actually, we have done some correlations with how it, we actually don't have a super high correlation to housing. Some of those individual categories might have a slightly higher correlation, but we don't tend to have a very large one in total.","In terms of how we see services playing with those categories, definitely as we have grown larger TV and large appliances, we have seen services like installation, delivery, those type of services expands materially as we have been able to grow those businesses. And so I think even part of what you are seeing and the reason people like Total Tech Support is, it can help them with some of those delivery and installation experiences as they are buying these larger products. And so the nice part is, we haven't seen kind of correlations right now in our business to housing and we continue to see nice results in those categories.","Hubert Joly","And what I would add, Corie, is it's above and beyond what the market does, which we continue to be very excited about and that's the essence of our strategy, the opportunity to deepen the relationships with our customers. We have highlighted at our Investor Day back in 2017 that our share of wallet of existing customers was around a quarter and a lot of the initiatives we have underway are designed to strengthen and deepen and broaden the relationship with these customers. And when you have a relatively low market share, which we think is our case, then you are excited about the upside from increasing that penetration which could very much outweigh any kind of short term situation in the underlying macro.","Zach Fadem","I appreciate the color and congratulations as well.","Hubert Joly","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Mushkin","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a question on, I guess more of a two-part. Sales drivers, I want to talk about the back half of the year. How you guys are thinking of what can maybe move the needle as we get into back half? But then I want to think more long term and kind of looking out how we should view some of the strategic initiatives like GreatCall, CST, In-Home Advisor, Total Tech Support, the move to 5G in relation to kind of how you guys are thinking about your longer term sales growth rate? Thanks.","Corie Barry","Yes. So we will start with the back half. Definitely, some of the consistent sales drivers that we have even seen coming in to the first part of the year here, we continue to see appliances as an ongoing opportunity for us and feel very well situated there. There continues to be interesting innovation in some of the other categories like what we are seeing in smart home and what we are even seeing in innovation. And you can see the different categories at different times.","A new wave of tablets creates new interest. Some of the new in-home automation products creates new interest. Some of the new TV even evolutions, continued penetration in 4K and even the ability to see 8K and some of the new technologies, that continue to drive interest. And so I think this combination of continued strength in some of the underlying categories like appliances and then a continued evolution of technology in a few of the other categories, we continue to see a lot of interest in the products that we carry.","Importantly, as we look ahead, I will spend just a moment on health. And we have said from day one, even when we had our Investor Day, health is a bit of a longer term value driver for us. But we absolutely like what we are starting to see in health. And if I just take you back for a second to why is it that we think we are uniquely well-positioned in this space and why is it that we built the relationship with GreatCall, I think importantly, number one, we have always said, we feel like it's very in line with our strategy. It addresses that key human need question around health and wellness. And in particular for us, when we are really trying to get pointed around our purpose, this is a very important purpose question around helping older Americans live a more independent life in their homes with the help of technology which aligns very well to what we are trying to accomplish overall.","That space is exciting. There are 50 million people over 65 and that number is going to grow more than 50% in the next 20 years. And so you have a real population of people who would like to have some help. And then with GreatCall, we felt like we really acquired a great asset with already 900,000 members and already a good profitable business. I think importantly, between the two companies now what we are seeing is that, we jointly bring to life a number of really interesting value creation opportunities.","We are the only place that has that a nationwide footprint of in-home capabilities around technology as well as importantly the support backbone that keep those things running over time. We are agnostic across ecosystems. So we will help you with whatever technology you already have or whatever technology you want to put in. And as we bring on GreatCall's assets, their ability to help us with the human touch combined with more predictive analytics, it becomes very powerful because then you not only start to see major medical events might happen, but we have some of that human intervention that also is helpful.","And so I think we are continuing to build on that thesis and I think you can hear us every time we talk to, we get a little bit more clear about the space that we play in that we feel like no one else can. That being said, it's going to take us some time to continue to build the capabilities and then to build the footprint. Right now we just have a few small kind of publicly announced partnerships with Senior Whole Health of Massachusetts and long-term care insurance of CNA, which is one of the largest U.S. commercial property and casualty insurance companies. So those are couple of small proof points and we are going to continue to try to build on those over time. I think that's likely a longer term thesis for us, but a very exciting one in terms of a unique space where we have capabilities.","As I think about other growth mechanisms like 5G, I might actually turn it over to Mike and ask him to add a little color to what we think that could do for us.","Mike Mohan","Hi Scott, it's Mike. You brought up IHA and 5G and they both apply in different ways, but we think there's some good excitement. I will start with IHA.","We already know it's an incremental part to our business and it just helps us build a deeper relationship with our customers and expand the share of wallet. And so as I look at that going forward, it's an area we think we just started, we are in the first few innings of what that could look like to drive a longer and deeper relationships with customers across a whole host of products and services.","When I think about 5G, it's a place where we are really in a good spot to help our carrier partners and OEMs bring new technology solutions to life, because this one's being roll out market by market and you are going to need an environment where you can actually get into people's homes, get into people's businesses with qualified and trained teams and then use our stores for opportunities to showcase what's possible with a higher network speed. So we are optimistic about it. It's just starting and we think it's going to be a great journey to be participating.","Hubert Joly","And then of course in terms of specific numbers, that's why we have this meeting in September in Q3, where the team will have the opportunity to try to update long term prospects and that's something we had announced on our call at the end of February.","Scott Mushkin","Great guys. I look forward to the meeting. It sounds like we could see some sales acceleration. So I do look forward to the meeting. And I offer my congratulations too. It's just a wonderful group of people and look forward to the next chapter. Thanks.","Hubert Joly","Thank you.","Corie Barry","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning, guys. Unfortunately, I do have another tariff question. Corie, you have highlighted that tariffs were expected to impact about 7% of your COGS. I guess what I am trying to figure out is, of that 7% exposure, can you help us understand how much of your mitigation process was handled or managed through vendor negotiation basically pushing that price increase, if you will, back on to vendors? And how much was handled through you guys having to increase prices, just so we can kind of think about how the forward tariffs may work? Thanks.","Corie Barry","Yes. So I will try to give some color. We talked last time about some of the ways that we are going to try to mitigate tariff. And we broke that into a few buckets. In some cases, we obviously have worldwide vendors, who might make some decisions to push that across their whole worldwide business. In some cases, we also know that we have vendors who would absorb costs as a way to retain some of the business. And then in some cases, we have people are already moving supply chains, moving the business around, finding other ways to bring things. And then finally, there is the question of increasing cost.","I think what's difficult is at 10% for that List 3, you have a much greater ability to influence using a variety of methods and even the absorbing method becomes easier because at 10% and you are not sure if it's an extended period of time or a limited period of time, you might be willing to absorb that. As you move to 25%, the discussion becomes quite different because there is a much lower likelihood that you can absorb that as a vendor completely and you have to really think differently about how quickly you can actually move your distribution. And it takes longer in the consumer electronic space.","And so I wouldn't say that what we have seen in the 10% where I think we haven't seen as much of an impact is applicable to the 25%, Hubert said at the prepared remarks, at 25% level, there will be higher prices for consumers. Now it's tricky and I think you have heard it from variety of retailers is figuring out SKU by SKU, vendor by vendor which of those tactics are going to work and which aren't and then how that will actually play into the back half. So that's the work the team is doing and definitely we did our very best to try to size it. But there's still a lot of work to do there.","Hubert Joly","And I certainly want to comment the skills of our merchant teams. Of course, given the size of the U.S. market, size of Best Buy in those markets, these teams do a wonderful job of navigating these waters and that's one of the, when I talked about the depths and breadth of talent at the company, that's clearly one of the areas where we have wonderful assets.","And looking at the clock and this is not only my last call as CEO, but the last minutes of my last call as CEO and before we have to call it, I will quickly say this, I am clearly passing the baton, which is a French word, to Corie and our team with a very happy and full heart and with a strong conviction that the right team is in place for this pivotal moment in Best Buy's history and I very much look forward to watching Corie and her team do their magic. And so my thanks to all of you. Have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session and this concludes today's call.

We\u2019re thrilled to have him on board, and excited about reinvigorating this growth engine within the company.","Now let me come back to our second quarter results. In November of last year, at our investor meeting, we talked about the two problems we had to solve: declining comparable store sales, and declining operating margins. Since that time, the resolution of these two problems has become our Renew Blue rallying cry, and the organization\u2019s goals and objectives as we prioritize accordingly.","While we are clear that there\u2019s much more work ahead, we have made measurable progress since we unveiled Renew Blue last year, including near-flat comparable store sales, substantial cost take outs, and better than expected earnings in the past three consecutive quarters.","From a financial perspective, we delivered better than expected results on both the top and bottom lines during this last quarter. On total company revenue from continuing operations of $9.3 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.32. As expected, domestic comparable store sales were down 0.4%.","This was driven by short term disruptions caused by the retail deployments of the Samsung Experience shops, Windows stores, and floor space optimization, as well as our continued rationalization of noncore businesses. Excluding these impacts, domestic comparable store sales were flat to slightly positive for the quarter.","During the second quarter, we continued to make substantial progress on our Renew Blue priorities. This progress included, number one, driving a more than 10% increase in domestic comparable online sales; number two, improving our net [unintelligible] score; number three, enriching our retail customer experience for the rollout of our Samsung Experience shops in Windows stores; number four, piloting our buy online, ship from store initiative in 50 stores; and number five, eliminating an additional $65 million in annualized costs, bringing our nine-month total of annualized cost reductions to $390 million toward our target of $725 million.","We also continued to focus on the six Renew Blue priorities that we outlined for you at the beginning of the year. Number one, accelerating online growth; number two, accelerating the multichannel customer experience; number three, increasing revenue and gross profit per square foot to enhance store space optimization and merchandising; number four, driving down cost of goods sold for supply chain efficiencies; number five, continuing to gradually optimize the U.S. real estate portfolio; and number six, further reducing SG&A costs.","I will now provide you an update on each of these priorities. To accelerate online growth, we\u2019re continuing to focus on those initiatives that are designed to drive and improve customer experience, increase traffic, and higher conversion. In Q2, these initiatives, including the replacement of our 10-year-old onsite search platform, the dynamic creation of product recommendations for browsing customers with empty carts, the easier attachment of Geek Squad services, and the implementation of a richer tablet shopping experience.","We also implemented the dynamic creation of location-specific product offers and have begun a campaign to drive the quantity and quality of customer product reviews. Product reviews are a powerful tool to drive conversion and based on our year to date run rate, we expect to quadruple the number of reviews we have on our site by year-end.","Including all of these initiatives, our domestic online channel delivered a 10.5% comparable store sales increase in the quarter, excluding the preorders of new gaming consoles. Including these preorders, which we do not expect to ship or recognize as revenue until Q4 of fiscal \u201914, comparable online demand increased over 16%.","Now, there\u2019s still significant growth to be done on the site. Our next phase of initiatives as we head into the holiday season includes, number one, the optimization of site navigation, including the rapid narrowing of search results through drop-down editing; number two, the implementation of single-site sign on for Reward Zone customers; number three, the online display of all in-store clearance and open-box inventory; number four, the introduction of new product buying guides; number five, the addition of new marketplace partners to increase our online-only product assortment; and number six, the enhancement of our buy online, pick up in store experience by creating an easier process for customers to add service plans to their final purchase upon arrival in the store. From all of these online initiatives, over time we expect to see measurable improvements in the customer experience, natural and on-site search, and conversion.","The second Renew Blue priority for this year is to escalate the multichannel customer experience. We use NPS, or Net Promoter Score, to measure not only the satisfaction of customers that buy, but also the customers that don\u2019t. In the second quarter, our NPS score improved by approximately 300 basis points year over year.","While we know there\u2019s still much to do here to provide a consistently great customer experience across all of our channels, we were very pleased to see that the service provided by our blue shirts in the stores was not only a key contributor to our year over year improvements in our NPS score, but also to our improved in-store close rates during the quarter.","In addition to the rollout of NPS, there are three customer experience initiatives that we believe will have a significant benefit on both the top and bottom lines. The first of these initiatives relates to our price competitiveness.","Price competitiveness is [table stakes]. During Q2, and heading into the back half of the year, we\u2019re continuing to invest in our price competitiveness when needed for price matching and price reductions. Pricing is the capability that is underdeveloped at Best Buy, an area that we will be making greater investments in and increasing our focus on over the next several quarters through improved analytics.","The next customer experience initiative relates to retail leadership performance. Plain and simple, a great store requires great leadership. To this end, we have implemented a more rigorous and consistent performance management approach that measures not only the financial metrics but also customer satisfaction metrics like store level NPS to drive improved retail leadership performance.","Although we are only in our rollout, this [rigor] is creating a new level of visibility, ownership, intensity, and accountability that we believe over time will help drive an improved in-store customer experience.","The third customer experience initiative is buy online, ship in store. As we mentioned last quarter, there are numerous reasons that we believe this initiative is going to have significant customer experience and financial benefits when rolled out at scale, including, number one, improving our online conversion, which is currently well below many other retailers; number two, more profitably selling returns and clearance inventory that is trapped in our stores; number three, reducing mark down risk on product transitions; number four, improving inventory management by increasing visibility to true multichannel customer demand; and number five, enabling more accurate demand planning.","To put this opportunity into context today, 2-4% of our online traffic in any given week does not buy, because we do not have the inventory in our online distribution centers and we\u2019re telling the customer that it is out of stock. And yet much of the time we actually have it in one or more of our retail stores.","But today, in our 50-store pilot, we are seeing examples of these customer service and financial benefits, including a 90-basis point average lift in July comps for those 50 stores, and half of the units sold being either transition or closeout SKUs that were sold at higher margins than the stores outside the pilot. Based on these encouraging results, and the successful implementation of the IT requirements to do so, we plan to extend the ship from store pilot to over 200 stores in time for holiday.","The third Renew Blue priority is to increase revenue and gross profit per square foot, to enhance floor space optimization and merchandising. During the second quarter, we continued our floor space optimization efforts, which included the deployment of the Samsung Experience shops, the rollout of the Windows stores, the increase in space dedicated to growing and profitable categories like mobile, tablet, and small appliances, and the creation of new clearance areas that offer clearance, returns, and open box items.","Today we are largely done with the deployment of the Samsung Experience shops. They are now in almost all of our large format and mobile stores. In June, we announced our agreements with Microsoft and began to roll out the Windows stores in 500 of our large format stores.","As of the end of the second quarter, we had deployed 240 Windows stores and expect to be done with the rest by the end of September. There will also be additional existing category optimization efforts that will continue into October. You should note that the deployment of the Windows stores and other aspects of this project are more disruptive than the initial work on the Samsung Experience shops. Nevertheless, while this is very early in the deployment of the Samsung and Windows stores, the customer feedback on both has been very positive.","The fourth Renew Blue priority for this year is to drive down cost of goods sold through supply chain efficiencies and reverse logistics. In the second quarter, we completed the rollout of our enhanced retail store inventory replenishment model and continue to rationalize our network of supply chain vendors through service level benchmarking and competitive bidding processes.","From these initiatives we have begun to see lower retail store replenishment costs, lower transportation costs, and improved service levels to our customers. In the third quarter, we will complete the expansion of our online fulfillment capabilities to our final three of our eight distribution centers and begin allocating inventory to the distribution center closest to the customer to improve the time and cost of delivery.","Reverse logistics has been another top supply chain priority. As we discussed last quarter, customer returns, replacements, and damages are approximately 10% of revenue and are costing the company over $400 million a year in P&L losses. Based on the steps we are taking, we feel confident that we can meaningfully reduce these assets.","Actions we are taking include making this inventory more visible and easily purchased by customers by leveraging store clearance area and the ship from store pilot I talked about earlier. It also includes improving the shopping experience for buying online clearance items through better site design, assortment, and clearance pricing, and includes expanding clearance pricing to more core categories and to open box products.","Based on the magnitude of the returns, replacements, and damages opportunity, and the other supply chain opportunities we have discussed, we continue to be confident in our Renew Blue commitment to reduce cost of goods sold by $325 million. To date, we\u2019ve delivered over $65 million in annualized savings and expect to deliver substantially more over the next several quarters.","Our fifth Renew Blue priority is to continue to gradually optimize our U.S. real estate portfolio. Occupancy cost reduction and retail capital allocation remain a key focus. As such, during the quarter we renegotiated overall rent reductions for a number of stores and closed three mobile stores at lease expiration.","In parallel, we\u2019re continuing with a number of new store within a store openings before the end of the quarter, including five Magnolia Design Centers and 12 Pacific Kitchen and Home stores within a store. These concepts provide a higher end and higher touch customer experience, and have tested well in 28 and 55 stores, respectively.","Our sixth Renew Blue priority is to further reduce SG&A costs. As we laid out at our investor meeting last November, we believe there is an opportunity to remove $400 million in SG&A from our North American business and we\u2019re making substantial progress. Since the company\u2019s last earnings release, we have eliminated an additional $30 million in annualized SG&A costs, and this brings us to $325 million and we plan to take out additional costs as the year progresses.","In addition to our activities in the U.S., we are continuing to roll out Renew Blue in our international business, and are excited about the new focus we have in place in Canada and China.","And I will now turn the call over to Sharon to cover more details on our second quarter financial performance and our outlook for the year.","Sharon McCollam","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning everyone. Like Hubert, I would like to echo how encouraged we are by the progress we are making against Renew Blue priorities, as demonstrated by our second quarter results.","The financial highlights of the quarter were as follows. Enterprise revenue for the second quarter declined 0.4% to $9.3 billion, and non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 23.1% to $0.32. This EPS increase was primarily driven by strong expense management and Renew Blue cost savings, partially offset by higher year over year investments and price competitiveness.","Domestic revenue of $7.8 billion increased 0.1%. This increase was primarily driven by incremental revenue from 57 net new Best Buy mobile stores, partially offset by a comparable store sales decline of 0.4%.","Excluding the disruptive comparable store sales impact that Hubert discussed earlier, though, domestic comparable store sales were flat to slightly positive for the quarter. Domestic online comparable revenue increased 10.5%, due to increased traffic and a higher average order value, including gaming preorders\u2019 comparable online demand increase over 16%.","From a merchandising perspective, strong growth in mobile phones and appliances was partially offset by declines in other categories, including gaming and digital imaging. Of note, comparable store sales for the television category were flat in the quarter, which is considerably better than the trend we\u2019ve seen over the last few years.","International revenue of $1.5 billion declined 2.9%. This decline was due to the loss of revenue from 15 large format stores that were closed in Canada last year, and a comparable store sales decline of 1.8% driven by lower demand for consumer electronics and ongoing competitive pressure in Canada, partially offset by increased consumer demand in China due to expiring government subsidies that were supported by increased promotional offers.","Turning now to the gross profit, the enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate for the second quarter was 23.7% versus 24.2% last year, a decline of 50 basis points. The domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate was 24% versus 24.3% last year, a decline of 30 basis points. This decline was primarily driven by increased product warranty related costs associated with higher claims frequency in the mobile category and a greater investment in price competitiveness, particularly in appliances and mobile.","These impacts were partially offset, however, by improved overall product mix and the accelerated recognition of previously deferred revenue associated with our Capital One credit card portfolio that will be sold to Citibank in the third quarter.","The international gross profit rate was 22.3%, versus 23.8% last year, a decline of 150 basis points. This decline was primarily driven by a higher mix of China revenue that carries a lower gross profit rate and higher promotional activity in China.","Now turning to SG&A, enterprise level non-GAAP SG&A was $2 billion, or 21.5% of revenue, versus 22.3% last year, a decline of 80 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $1.67 billion, or 21.3% of revenue, versus $1.72 billion, or 22.1% of revenue last year, a decline of 80 basis points.","This decline was primarily driven by strong expense management, Renew blue cost savings, and the impact of Q2 fiscal year \u201913 store closures. These reductions were partially offset by our Renew Blue investments in the optimization of our retail floor space and the replatforming of bestbuy.com.","International non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $332 million, or 22.3% of revenues, versus $359 million, or 23.4% of revenue last year. This 110 basis point rate decline was primarily driven by a higher mix of China revenue which carries a lower SG&A rate and cost reductions in Canada and China.","From a working capital perspective, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet during the quarter. Cash and cash equivalents increased $1.3 billion to $1.9 billion. This increase was primarily driven by the sale of Best Buy Europe and proactive working capital management.","Receivables increased $290 million, or 32.3% to $1.2 billion, primarily due to the LCD settlement and the remaining receivable on the sale of Best Buy Europe. During the quarter, we received approximately $30 million in cash of a total $229 million LCD settlement, with the balance to be received in installments over the next eight quarters.","Merchandise inventories increased $399 million, or 6.8%, to $5.4 billion, primarily due to aggressive inventory management and an ongoing reduction in clearance inventory.","Accounts payable decreased $362 million, or 6.8%, to $5 billion, primarily due to lower inventory purchases. As a percentage of inventory, accounts payable remained flat year over year.","The current portion of long term debt decreased $495 million to $44 million, due to the issuance of a new 5%, 5-year, $500 million bond, which replaced a 6.75% $500 million bond that matured in July.","As we now look forward to the back half of the year, it goes without saying that we are encouraged by the momentum that we are seeing from our Renew Blue priorities and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. But to build on this momentum, and to position us for a strong fiscal 2015, we have to continue to invest in those initiatives that are driving our success today.","As such, our investment plans for the balance of the year now include a greater Q3 and Q4 investment in price competitiveness in addition to our previously announced $150 million to $200 million investment in incremental SG&A to support the Renew Blue priorities Hubert discussed earlier in the call and that are outlined in today\u2019s press release.","In addition to these investments, though, there are two additional back half impacts that are not investments, but that we would like to discuss. The first is a temporary increase in our mobile warranty costs that is expected to continue through the first quarter of fiscal 2015. This increase is considered temporary because it relates to higher claims frequency on our legacy Geek Squad protection programs that will expire or be operationally restructured out over the next several quarters.","The second is a change in the economics of our private label credit card program that is being sold by Capital One to Citibank in the third quarter. This impact is due to the expiration of our previous credit card agreement with Capital One, which offered Best Buy substantially better financial terms than what is commercially available in the market today due to changes in both the regulatory environment and the general consumer credit market overall.","To partially offset the investments and increase operational costs, however, we expect to see a positive financial benefit from our year to date $390 million in annualized Renew Blue cost savings in addition to the further savings that we are expecting to deliver in the third and fourth quarters.","So while it was not our intent today to provide comprehensive financial guidance on the total company P&L for Q3 or Q4, or fiscal 2015, we recognize that it would be difficult for our investors to estimate the potential magnitude of these investments and increased operational costs without further context.","We also recognize that having a financial estimate from us, particularly in light of our transformation, was important to understanding and accurately projecting future results. Therefore, to assist our investors with these future projections, in our release this morning we provided our latest quarterly estimate of the year over year basis point impact of these factors on the total company operating income rate.","These estimates reflect the net sum of the three P&L drivers we just discussed, the negative impact of the pricing and SG&A investments, the increased operational costs, and the positive impact of the Renew Blue cost savings.","For the third and fourth quarters, these estimates were as follows: negative 90-110 basis points in Q3, and negative 40-70 basis points in Q4. While I will not discuss them now, continuing impacts into fiscal 2015 are also outlined in this morning\u2019s release.","Again, these basis point estimates on the operating income rate only pertain to the specific P&L drivers I just outlined, and should not be used or interpreted in isolation as a calculated projection of our expected year over year change in the total company operating income rate, because as we have seen in the last three quarters, our core business performance is stabilizing, and our product mix and cost containment initiatives above and beyond our Renew Blue cost average have been stronger than expected. As such, we expect that through continued improvement in our core business performance we will be able to offset some or all of these impacts.","Thank you, and I\u2019ll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs ","My question relates to the impact of the credit card item on gross margin in the second quarter. I guess it\u2019s a quick two-part question. The first part is can you tell us how much that aided gross margin here in Q2? And secondly, does that reflect any kind of change in the net economics of that deal? Or just some acceleration of the [pad] that you would have ultimately received?","Sharon McCollam ","That was an acceleration of the payout that we would have received because the accounting requires that you book those bounties over time. As far as quantifying the amount, we obviously have confidentiality agreements, so I\u2019m not going to go there. But let me just give you one other piece of information.","When you look at the gross profit this quarter, again, we have two offsetting items. We have the credit card income, but the offset is this Geek Squad protection warranty negative. And quite frankly, they virtually net each other out. So the margin that you\u2019re looking at is very clean. There\u2019s two specific items within it, but net, when you\u2019re looking at the actual number that we reported, it\u2019s very clean.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs ","So any gross margin discussions that anyone would have had a quarter ago, this 24.0% domestic would essentially be, on those same terms the other stuff cancels out?","Sharon McCollam ","That\u2019s right, and the reason for that versus last quarter is very much driven by mix. We talked about the product mix and this quarter we had very strong growth in the mobile and the appliance businesses, and with that comes a rate mix benefit.","Operator","Our next question is from Gary Balter with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Gary Balter - Credit Suisse ","I\u2019m just going to focus on the online. You mentioned the 50-store test that you\u2019re doing. What\u2019s different in that in terms of the pickup at store? Because right now when I go on, you see like 6-7 day delivery if you want to buy it at the stores, this next day pickup. And as part of that, given the success that you\u2019re having with it, why not roll it out faster?","Sharon McCollam ","The buy online ship from store is invisible to the customer. Historically, as Hubert laid out in his prepared remarks, 2-4% every week of our customers come to bestbuy.com and ask to buy something, and because it is not in the online distribution center, we tell them that we do not have it. And yet much of the time, we have it in one or more stores.","So, by opening up those 50 stores, what happens is that when the system checks the online DC, and does not find the inventory, it then checks those 50 stores, and if that inventory is there, it fills the order, completely invisible to the customer.","In last quarter\u2019s call, we talked about the reason that we were going to roll 200 stores for holiday, and why we haven\u2019t rolled sooner, we had two systems issues to solve. Remember, we have never shipped out of the back room of the store, so this is a very different process.","The good news, that you just pointed out, is that the store associate has already learned by buy online pick up in store how to have a pick ticket dropped to the floor and to be able to pick the order and put it in the basket. Now, the next phase of that is to put it in a box, create a shipping label for UPS, and have it distributed.","The system had two enhancements that had to be made. The first is that because we had never shipped out of a store, we were not able to populate the UPS label, with shipping. So the back room associate is actually having to take the pick ticket and type in the address. This is a very simple IT fix, and not the one that is the bigger of the two that\u2019s caused us to push to 200 stores for holiday and then to open it up next year to a greater number of stores.","The second one is the fact that in our system - and this is very common in retailers - when inventory is actually sold, it takes up to 4 hours to be able to update the inventory. And what we are working on today is the problem with that is during peak times it is very possible, if you only had two of an item left in a store, that you\u2019re going to go ahead and promise it to that customer and you may sell it in that 4-hour period.","So we were not comfortable rolling this, because this is such a big NPS issue for the customer, that we had to get that timeframe down to 15 minutes before we were comfortable rolling it out. And that is what we will have achieved by the time we roll this with the 200 stores before holiday.","Operator","Your next question is from Anthony Chukumba with BBT Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Anthony Chukumba - BBT Capital Markets","My question was actually related to your balance sheet. You got the money from Carphone Warehouse. You essentially refinanced on the debt, saved 175 basis points. You\u2019re now going to be getting this money from the LCD settlement. How do you think about starting to buy back stock? I understand why you stopped doing it last year, the numbers just continued to get worse, and there was a lot of uncertainty, but given the fact that it looks like things are on the right track, and your balance sheet is just so strong, how do you sort of think about that?","Hubert Joly ","We believe that having a strong balance sheet is a very important factor for our success. And in fact, when we look at a lot of our competitors and other players that do have very strong balance sheet, and so do a lot of our vendors, having a strong balance sheet is very helpful to us as we negotiate with our vendors. You always want to be negotiating from a position of strength. So we have this as a governing thought to have a very strong balance sheet as we operate the business. For now, this is how we think about it. I don\u2019t know, Sharon, do you want to add anything to this?","Sharon McCollam ","No, I couldn\u2019t have articulated it better.","Operator","And our next question is from David Gober with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Gober - Morgan Stanley","Just one quick clarification on the credit card agreement. I know you said it didn\u2019t have any impact on the gross margins, but given that there is a recognition of deferred revenue, did that have any impact on top line?","And then just a follow up on the commentary on the TV business, definitely interesting to hear that that has flattened out after a sustained period of more difficult trends. Can you give us a little bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing there, in terms of whether it\u2019s screen sizes or different technologies, what do you think is actually driving that? Or is it just a function of the more competitive pricing that\u2019s been in the market.","Sharon McCollam ","I\u2019ll take the question on the credit card. Obviously you completely understand the accounting for these credit card bounties. They do go into revenue. This is completely immaterial to our revenue. So it is not a huge number. It had the gross margin impact, which I answered the question on gross margin. It has an offset on the product warranty side. So we have no material impact on either line. I don\u2019t want to put this number in a bigger light than it should be.","Hubert Joly ","And as it relates to the TV business, the driver of this more favorable performance from the comp store sales standpoint is the size of the TVs. The mix is shifting to larger screen TVs. The units have always been up. It was the average selling price that was the issue. The shift towards larger screen is helpful. We are, of course, also intrigued by the innovation in the space with 4K TV, OLED TVs, and so forth. We love the fact that in our stores now there\u2019s TVs with a price point of $15,000, $8,000, and that\u2019s helpful from the top down selling standpoint.","Operator","And our next question is from Kate McShane with Citi. Please go ahead.","Kate McShane - Citi ","Sharon, I wondered if you could give a little bit more detail about the increase in investment in price competitiveness. Is this mainly just for the holiday season? Or is this ongoing? And what form is this going to come in?","Sharon McCollam ","We believe that investment in price competitiveness is the way we have to operate our business. I think in Hubert\u2019s prepared remarks we call it table stakes. So the investments that we are making are where they\u2019re needed, and where we see that, versus the marketplace and competitors that we believe are relevant, our pricing is not in the market. We are making changes to that. There is the price matching, but that is not the big piece of this. We are proactively moving forward with price adjustments where we are not competitive. And we expect that to continue.","Really, it started in the back half of Q4, and then advanced in Q1, came again in Q2, the investments in Q3 and Q4, on a year over year basis, and then we\u2019ll assess. I think we\u2019ve seen several analyst reports and various analyses that have been done on our pricing versus other retailers, and the general consensus seems to be, and we would agree, even from our own data, that we are getting closer to the competition every month that passes.","Operator","And our next question is from Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Horvers - JPMorgan ","You laid out the pressures in the coming four quarters or so from those three items. Can you talk about how much those items impacted the second quarter here as well as the first quarter?","Sharon McCollam ","The impact that we had in the second quarter obviously was substantially less than what we are anticipating for Q3 and Q4 on a year over year basis. Remember it\u2019s all about your compares. So on a year over year basis, it\u2019s substantial. On a sequential basis, it\u2019s important.","So the pricing is one of the issues, but the second one that is even more substantial is this Geek Squad protection and the rapid exchange and the frequency that we\u2019re seeing on repair. And we\u2019ve sold a lot of phones, we\u2019ve sold a lot of Geek Squad protection plans, and when frequency goes up, it is an expensive business proposition.","Obviously these legacy contracts that we sold, many of these contracts might be 24 months old, we are very very lenient in how we interact with the customer related to this. So it\u2019s something we have to work through. But the biggest impact that we\u2019re seeing from a sequential point of view is in the Geek Squad warranty protection.","Chris Horvers - JPMorgan ","And then just related to that, given the reflowing of the stores, the Samsung and the Microsoft, do some of the cost savings flow through on a more robust basis in the back half versus perhaps the second quarter as well?","Sharon McCollam ","Hubert also, in his prepared remarks, called out that in Q2 we had an impact from the Samsung stores and Microsoft stores as well. But the impact of the Microsoft stores is substantially greater than what we did with Samsung. Because you\u2019re talking about the entire computer department. Also, the biggest piece of our own floor space optimization, where we\u2019re moving everything around in the store, is in Q3. And that is going to have a significant impact and disruption in the store. We expect that to be substantially bigger than it was in Q2.","Hubert Joly ","To elaborate a little bit, there is an impact on the top line. When a store is impacted by this optimization, the supply is impacted. And of course there is some cost associated with moving things around in the store. We expect of course for this year to be completed by the end of Q3, as we wouldn\u2019t want to be moving things around during the holiday season.","Sharon McCollam ","And I\u2019ll add one more thing to that. That cost is going to show up predominantly in SG&A. A lot of the work we\u2019re doing cannot be capitalized, and it will flow through in the SG&A line.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Lasser - UBS ","First, on the Samsung stores, now that you have the majority rolled out, what is the sales impact that you\u2019ve been seeing from that initiative? And then second, what\u2019s the early competitive response that you\u2019ve seen from the pricing investments that you\u2019ve made?","Hubert Joly ","On the Samsung Experience shops, we are seeing, number one, very positive customer response. The same with Windows, but of course Samsung started earlier. The customers really appreciate the live displays, that you can actually touch and feel live product, which is not the case for other types of stores. They appreciate the combination of the expertise of the Samsung experts as well as the support and advice of the blue shirts.","They appreciate the opportunity to navigate the store and look at these different ecosystems. Customer have choices. It\u2019s a wonderful experience to look at these various vendors. So a lot of positive feedback for Samsung, and the same is true for the Windows stores.","There is of course a positive impact on the sales of the Samsung products, as you would expect. What we will be measuring is of course the impact on the overall store. But the way we\u2019ll measure it is in the overall comp store sales, because our goal as a company is of course to optimize and solve our two problems. And it\u2019s still very early in the game. The best way to measure it will be the overall performance of our comp store sales throughout the stores. So we are very excited about this.","Your second question has to do with what\u2019s the competitive response to our pricing actions. This is a very competitive space, so I will not comment on the reactions of our competitors. To be clear, our goal is not to be lower than the competition. We believe that Best Buy offers a very compelling set of customer promises, with the assortment, the advice, the convenience, the service, and so our goal is simply to eliminate price as an obstacle to buy.","We started with the price match. A year ago, everybody was talking about showrooming and so forth, so we love the traffic on our site, in our stores, and we don\u2019t want to lose a customer because of price. But we don\u2019t [see there\u2019s a need] to be lower than the competition, we just don\u2019t want to be beat.","Operator","And our final question is from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank","I wanted to ask a little bit more about the TV business. You said it was flat. When was the last time it was flat? Do you think you\u2019re gaining share there? Or is that more a function of what\u2019s going on in the market? And you said one of the reasons for that was higher ASPs as the mix is getting to bigger TVs, but can you talk about the ASPs on a like-to-like TV this year versus last year? Has that started to stabilize at all?","Hubert Joly ","We believe that it\u2019s been three years since the comps in TVs were flat, which is why we highlighted this today. I want to also highlight the fact that while we have a positive impact on the top line from a comp standpoint, the U.S. consumer is still value-oriented.","And so the choice the consumer is making is very much biased towards opening price points in these larger screen TVs. And so that means there continues to be margin pressure from that standpoint in the category.","And frankly, I highlighted 4K and OLED and so forth, and why I think all of us can be excited by these shiny new objects. We don\u2019t expect that this is going to have a significant impact from the volume standpoint, but I would still encourage all of you on the call to consider visiting our stores, and we\u2019ll take care of you.","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank ","And do you think it\u2019s a function of share because of your aggressive in price, or is it the market doing better in TVs?","Hubert Joly ","We have been very competitive in TVs, so we\u2019re feeling good about our market share, our trends, again, our value proposition to the customer in that space.","Operator","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference back to Bill Seymour for closing comments.","Bill Seymour","That concludes our call.

Thank you for joining us. I\u2019ll begin today with a review of our fourth quarter performance and the progress we made against our fiscal 2017 priorities. I will then provide a preview of what we are focused on for fiscal 2018 before turning the call over to Corie for additional he details on our quarterly results and our financial outlook. We\u2019re pleased today to report very solid results for the fourth quarter and for the full year. In the fourth quarter, we delivered enterprise revenue of $13.5 billion which is near the midpoint of our guidance range. We improved our non-GAAP operating income rate by 80 basis points to 6.7%, and we delivered higher than expected non-GAAP EPS of $1.95, up 27% compared to $1.53 last year.","Our strong bottom line performance was driven by a disciplined promotional strategy, continued optimization of merchandise margins, and strong expense management. Our non-GAAP EPS results also benefited approximately $0.10 year-over-year from a lower tax rate. Domestically, we continued to gain share across the majority of categories and we believe in aggregate this was due to the quality of our you assortment, the strong advertising and promotional cadence and the superior customer experience across channels. From an overall merchandising perspective we saw year-over-year sales growth in connected home, computing, headphones and home theater. This was more than offset by declines in gaming, tablets, health and wearables, and mobile phones.","We continue to drive significant growth in the online channel, with e-commerce revenue increasing 17.5%. E-commerce revenue was 18.6% of total domestic revenue, compared to 15.6% in the fourth quarter of last year. From the a top line perspective, our revenue was hindered by constrained product availability across multiple vendors and categories, only some of which was anticipated. While we\u2019ve experienced constrained product availability before, the situation felt unprecedented, given how widespread these issues were. As you may have noticed, there have been public reports regarding several of our vendors on this topic.","These issues impacted multiple categories including phones, tablets, wearables, computing, and drones, and were on top of the of previously communicated $200 million of top line pressure related to the Samsung product recalls. Also, significantly impacting our top line results was the softness in the gaming category. We expected some decline in gaming sales heading into the quarter, but the level of industry softness across both gaming hardware and software was much steeper than anticipated. As a note, the fourth quarter is a much more material quarter for the gaming category, as 50% of the annual revenue from gaming occurs in the fourth quarter. In the international business, our teams drove a significant improvement in profitability, increasing operating income rate 240 basis points to 7.1%.","On a full year basis, we delivered the top line performance we outlined at the beginning of the year, with materially better earnings growth than originally expected. For the year on revenue of $13.4 billion, we increased our non-GAAP operating income rate from 4% to 4.5%, and grew non-GAAP EPS by 28% from $2.78 to $3.56. Our free cash flow for the year was $2 billion, compared to $633 million last year, and we ended the year with $3.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. We returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and today we announced plans to increase our cash return to shareholders over the next two years.","During fiscal 2017, we executed against the three priorities we shared at the beginning of the year, which were to build on our strong industry position in multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing be business, to drive cost reduction and efficiencies, and to advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation. The successful execution against these priorities drove our positive results. Let me take a minute to provide some highlights. One, we continued to gain share in home theater, appliances, computing, and nearly all of the major C categories. And we believe the total market for our product categories was down low single digits in calendar 2016, so clearly, our market share gains helped us offset the market decline. We increased our Net Promoter Score by over 350 basis points. We grew domestic online revenue 21%.","The successful Canadian transformation was the primary driver of more than $100 million in international operating income, compared to a loss of $4 million last year. Including an additional $50 million in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve now achieved $350 million of our three-year target to reduce cost and optimize gross profit by $400 million, enabling us to invest in customer experience improvements, while maintaining near flat SG&A. As for the third priority, fiscal 2017 was a year of exploration and experimentation. We\u2019re continuing to test several concepts around the country that have the potential to be compelling customer experiences, and we will be rolling out a number of them in fiscal 2018, something I\u2019ll talk about in a minute.","So overall, another year of significant progress. I\u2019m very proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished, and I want to thank all of our associates for their hard work, their dedication, and customer focus. As you may recall, in November 2012 we introduced our transformation strategy called Renew Blue. Since then, we\u2019ve stabilized comparable sales, increased our non-GAAP operating income rate 110 basis points from 3.4% to 4.5%, and grew our non-GAAP EPS from $2.54 to $3.56, at an average rate of 9% per year. We also increased our return on invested capital or ROIC 110 basis points from 10.8% to 18.9%.","A little more than four years later, we figured it is time to call Renew Blue officially over and enter the next phase of our journey. Today we are unveiling Best Buy 2020, building the new blue. In this next phase, we go from turning around the Company to shaping our future, and creating a Company that customers and employees love, and that continues to generate a superior return for our shareholders. At the core of Best Buy 2020 is of course the customer. Technology is evolving and is more and more exciting, with new capabilities that are opening up an increasing range of possibilities. It\u2019s also more complex, and many of us need help with it. So we believe we\u2019re uniquely positioned to help our customers in a meaningful way with our combination of unique assets, including our online, store, and in-home capabilities.","As we look ahead, our purpose is to help customers pursue their passions and enrich their lives, with the help of technology. We want to play two roles for them. Be their trusted advisor and solution provider, and be their source for technology services for their home. Our customer value proposition is to be the leading technology expert, who makes is easy for them to learn about and confidently enjoy the best technology. We believe we can and should go beyond selling products to customers. We want to focus on their underlying needs which is entertainment, communications, security, energy management, and health. We believe this approach will better meet their needs, and build a stronger relationship with them. This will also allow us to expand our addressable market.","From a financial standpoint, the equation that we\u2019re seeking to solve with Best Buy 2020 is to gradually increase our rate of top line growth, pursue material ongoing cost savings necessary to both offset inflationary pressures and fund investments, and build a more predictable set of revenue streams, built on more recurring revenues and stickier customer relationships. More specifically, with Best Buy 2020, there are three growth pillars we will be pursuing: One is to maximize the multi-channel retail business. Two is to provide services and solutions that solve real customer needs, and help us build deeper customer relationships. And three is to accelerate growth in Canada and Mexico.","With the first pillar, maximize the multi-channel retail business, we plan to continue to enhance the customer experience and drive revenue by growing both existing and new channels, growing certain key product categories, and developing broader, stickier customer relationships. With the second pillar, provide services and solutions that solve real customer needs, we plan to meet the significant technical support needs of customers across their home, whether or not they have bought their products at Best Buy.","We also plan to offer more complete solutions to our customers that meet their underlying needs. As an example, instead of just selling them security cameras, this would mean selling an ongoing security monitoring and home automation service. With our third pillar, after significant transformation efforts, we believe Canada and Mexico have the opportunity to accelerate their growth. All together, we\u2019re quite excited about the range of opportunities we have in each of these areas. We also know we have work to do to capture them and create a meaningful impact on our results. As with Renew Blue, we will regularly update you on our progress on our journey to build the new blue. In this context, we see fiscal 2018 as a step in the direction of building the new blue.","Completely, we\u2019ll be executing against the following four priorities: First, we will explore and pursue growth opportunities around the pillars I just discussed. Most notably, we will continue to innovate our digital capability to effectively help our customers in their shopping journey. We will pursue growth around key product categories, including emerging product categories like connected home, appliances where we believe we can continue to grow share and revenue, and mobile, where we have the opportunity to return to growth by providing a more compelling experience to our customers. We plan to expand our In-Home Advisor program, or IHA to more markets. With our IHA program, customers receive a free in-home consultation with our experienced technology advisor, who can identify their needs, design personalized solutions, and become a personal resource over time.","We will continue to test new concepts around the country that have the potential to be compelling customer experiences. We have a pipeline of opportunities, some of which we will expect to ramp up later in the year. And we\u2019ll drive growth in the international business by continuing to drive our e-commerce channel, and by expanding the rollout of the successful store remodels in Canada, and opening nine new stores in Mexico over the next two years. The second priority is to improve our execution in key areas. We believe we continue to have significant opportunities from improving our sales effectiveness and proficiency, improving our supply chain for large product fulfillment and small package delivery and developing our services fulfillment capabilities.","The third priority is to continue to reduce costs and drive efficiency throughout the business. As I mentioned before, we\u2019ve achieved $350 million of our current $400 million cost reduction target. We\u2019re working on the next phase of cost savings and we will update you on the next goal once we complete our current program. The fourth priority is to build the capabilities necessary to deliver on the first three, which will involve making investments in people and systems to drive growth, execution and efficiencies.","Now, before I turn the call over to Corie, I\u2019d like to provide some thoughts about our financial outlook and updated return of capital plan for fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2018, which is a 53-week year, we\u2019re expecting enterprise revenue growth of approximately 1.5%, and an operating income growth rate in the low single digits. On a 52-week basis, we\u2019re expecting approximately flat revenue and operating income. Our annual outlook is influenced by a number of factors including expected share gains and the positive impact from our new initiatives, offset by our assumption that the industry growth will remain negative, and product availability issues will continue, particularly in the first half of the year. We are also expecting our investments and ongoing pressures in the business, including approximately $60 million of lower profit share revenue, to be offset by a combination of returns from new initiatives, and ongoing cost reductions and efficiencies.","While we\u2019re expecting flat top and bottom line results for the full year, of course, our quarterly performance can fluctuate, based on product cycles, inventory availability issues, and industry dynamics. In our Q1 fiscal 2018 guidance reflects the softness we\u2019ve seen and reported so far this quarter in the NPD tracked categories, and continued softness in the mobile phone category, due both to last year\u2019s product recall and the assumption that new product launches will occur later in the quarter than they did last year. Corie will provide more detail about our Q1 guidance.","Let me now say a few words about our return of cash to our shareholders. We have a strong cash position today, and continue to drive significant cash flow generation. We remain committed to our previously articulated capital allocation strategy, which is to first fund operations and growth investments, including potential partnerships and acquisitions, and then to return the remaining excess free cash flow to our shareholders over time with dividends and share repurchases, while maintaining investment grade credit metrics. We continue to believe it is important to reward our shareholders by being a premium dividend payer, and increasing our earnings per share through ongoing share repurchases.","As such, we announced this morning that our Board approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.34 per share or $1.36 per year. The Board also approved our plan to spend $3 billion on share repurchases over the next two years. Last year we announced a plan to spend $1 billion over two years and we spent $750 million in the first year. So with this new plan, we intend to accelerate our repurchases over the next two years.","So in summary, we\u2019re very proud of the results we delivered in fiscal 2017, and we are excited about our opportunities and the strategy we\u2019re pursuing. I want to again thank all of our associates for what they do every day, and for their passion to build the new blue. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our CFO, Corie Barry.","Corie Barry","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. As Hubert mentioned earlier, our disciplined promotional strategy was key to delivering better than expected profitability, despite enterprise revenue near the midpoint of our fourth-quarter guidance. On enterprise revenue of $13.5 billion, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.95, which exceeded our expectations, primarily due to a lower than expected effective income tax rate, and outperformance in the domestic business from both a higher gross profit rate and lower than expected SG&A.","I will now talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue decreased 1% to $13.5 billion, primarily due to an enterprise comparable sales decline of 0.7%. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.42 or 27% to $1.95. This increase was primarily driven by, one, a $0.14 per share benefit from the net share count change. Two, the domestic business, primarily due to a higher gross profit rate and lower SG&A including the expected $38 million or $0.06 per share of net negative impact from the lapping of the periodic profit sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio.","And three, a $0.10 per share benefit from a lower effective income tax rate, due to the resolution of certain discrete tax matters. In our domestic segment, revenue decreased 1.4% to $12.3 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by a comparable sales decline of 0.9%, and the loss of revenue from 11 large format and 31 Best Buy mobile stores closed during the past year. Industry sales in the NPD tracked categories, which don\u2019t include categories such as mobile phones and appliances, declined 2.8%.","From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in connected homes, computing, headphones and home theater was more than offset by declines in gaming, tablets, health and wearables, and mobile phones. In services, the comparable revenue growth of 6.3% was primarily driven by higher warranty sales, as we have now lapped the investments in services pricing from last September. Domestic online revenue of $2.3 billion increased 17.5% on a comparable basis, primarily due to increased traffic and higher conversion rates.","As a percentage of total domestic revenue, online revenue increased 300 basis points to 18.6%, versus 15.6% last year. In our international segment, revenue increased 2.5% to $1.14 billion, driven by comparable sales growth of 0.9%, primarily from our business in Mexico, and approximately 90 basis point periodic profit sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio, which is excluded from comparable sales, and approximately 70 basis points of positive foreign currency impact.","Turning now to gross profit. The enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 90 basis points to 22.5%. The domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 70 basis points to 22.3%, primarily due to improved margin rates in the computing and home theater categories, and the positive impact of decreased sales in the lower margin categories of gaming and wearables. These rate increases were partially offset by margin pressure in the mobile category and approximately $30 million or 20 basis points of net negative impact due to lapping the periodic profit sharing benefit.","The international non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 280 basis points to 24.6%, driven by a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada due to improved margin rates in the computing and home theater categories, and approximately $10 million or 65 basis point periodic profit sharing benefit, and the positive impact of decreased sales in the lower margin gaming category.","Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise level non-GAAP SG&A was $2.1 billion or 15.8% of revenue, a decrease of $10 million. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.93 billion or 15.6% of revenue, a decrease of $18 million. This decrease was primarily driven by lower variable costs, as a result of decreased year-over-year revenue. Additionally Renew Blue phase two cost reductions continued to offset investments in the business. International non-GAAP SG&A was $200 million or 17.5% of revenue, an increase of $8 million. This increase was primarily driven by slightly higher payroll and benefits and advertising costs.","From a cash flow perspective, fiscal 2017 was another year of strong cash flow generation, driven primarily by working capital changes and increased profitability. The decrease in working capital was primarily due to a higher accounts payable to inventory ratio, which was the result of, one, timing from last year when we brought in inventory early and subsequently paid for it before year-end, thereby reducing our accounts payable to inventory ratio in fiscal 2016. And two, the lack of product availability in certain key categories during Q4 fiscal 2017.","On a two year basis, our working capital was relatively in line with our historic cash flow impact. The continued strong cash flow generation allowed us to return a significant amount of cash to our shareholders for the second year in a row. This year, we returned over $1.2 billion in cash in addition to the $1.5 billion we returned in fiscal 2016. As it relates to capital expenditures, we ended fiscal 2017 with $582 million in capital spend, and we expect fiscal 2018 capital expenditures to be approximately $650 million.","I would now like to talk about our Q1 fiscal 2018 guidance. As Hubert mentioned, in the domestic business, we are seeing softness in the NPD tracked categories, due in part we believe to the delay in tax refunds that resulted in many consumers not having their refunds in time for the Presidents\u2019 Day retail holiday. Additionally, we expect pressure in the mobile category, which is not included in the NPD tracked categories we referenced due to, one, the continued impact of the Samsung Note 7 recall, which is estimated at $50 million in lower revenue year-over-year. And two, the assumption that potential new phone launches will occur later in the quarter than they did last year.","With these items factored in, we expect enterprise revenue in the range of $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion, and an enterprise comparable sales decline in the range of negative 1% to negative 2%. On a segment basis, we are estimating domestic comparable sales to decline in the range of negative 1.5% to negative 2.5%, and international comparable sales in the range of flat to positive 3%. It is important to note that due to expected foreign currency headwinds, we anticipate international revenue growth to decline low-single digits. We expect to deliver non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.35 to $0.40.","Assuming a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of 38% to 38.5%, and a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 313 million shares. This guidance range includes lapping approximately $15 million or $0.03 per share of net negative impact from the periodic profit sharing benefit from our Canadian service plan portfolio that was recorded in Q1 fiscal 2017.","As Hubert mentioned earlier, when talking about our full year expectations, we will have a 53rd week in fiscal 2018, which will occur in the fourth quarter. We expect that extra week to add approximately 1.5% of annual sales at an operating income rate that is materially higher than the fourth quarter. This operating income rate differential is driven by the added leverage of our fixed costs, which are not impacted by the extra week.","We expect to provide more detailed expectations of the 53rd week impact when we provide Q4 fiscal 2018 guidance later in the year. I would also add that we are expecting the fiscal 2018 full year non-GAAP effective income tax rate to be approximately 36.5%, compared to 33.2% in fiscal 2017.","I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kate McShane. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kate McShane","Hi thank you, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Hubert Joly","Good morning, Kate.","Kate McShane","Good morning. Hubert, I was wondering if you could maybe walk us through the promotional environment in the fourth quarter, and how you managed through it. I think that was a highlight during \u2013 in the press release today, that it was better managed. So if you could give a little bit more perspective on that versus last year that would be helpful.","Hubert Joly","Thank you, Kate. I think we\u2019ve developed that capability. This is not the first year we\u2019re doing this. I think it\u2019s been a theme for us, I would say over the last three years. I have to recommend our merchant and marketing team for this. There\u2019s a greater science that\u2019s being applied to our marketing and promotional activities that is resulting in this outcome. We\u2019re trying to combine being very price competitive, and as we had said three years ago, not chasing every rat into every rat hole. From time to time a competitor will have a very aggressive promotion with very limited quantities available or not necessarily the products that our customers actually want, and we\u2019ll be thoughtful in terms of what we want to do from that standpoint.","So that\u2019s at the highest level, that\u2019s what I would describe. The other driver of course has been the optimization of our merchandising activities, and the resulting impact on gross profit margin. As you\u2019ve noticed, our customers like the more advanced, tend to prefer the higher-end premium products oftentimes, and we\u2019ve been able in multiple product categories to really developed a superior merchandising and customer experience both online and in our stores around this. That will be true in TVs. That will be true in computing, for example. And we are also benefiting from that. Corie, anything I missed?","Corie Barry","No, I think you hit most of it.","Hubert Joly","Thanks.","Kate McShane","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Binder. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Dan Binder","Thank you. Hubert, I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit more about the opportunity on in-home advisory services and products, what you saw in the tests, and in terms of average spend, and the type of customers you\u2019re targeting, and the scalability of that?","Hubert Joly","Yes. Thank you, Dan. I think we\u2019re very excited about the customer experience from this program. As a reminder for everyone, this is an expert technology advisor, who has got great both product proficiency across everything we sell, and great customer relationship skills, will typically go to the customer\u2019s house. Why is it important to go to the customer\u2019s house? In many cases, if we want to have a discussion about your networking needs, or your home theater, or how you want to automate your home, we really need to have this conversation in your home.","And from a customer standpoint, this is not limited to luxury and premium. We\u2019ve had this motto that Corie introduced when she was leading this program of no order too small, no sale is too small. We see this as the beginning of a beautiful friendship, as we would say in Casablanca, or the beginning of a customer relationship, as the In-Home Advisor can become an ongoing resource for the customer. The results are very encouraging, Dan. The customer satisfaction from this is very material. Our stores \u2013 the front liners are a good test of whether something makes sense or not. And the level of excitement in the field, I think, it\u2019s very high.","Financially, this is resulting in positive results, there is a higher sale average, sale per visit, tend to be also a better gross profit margin, because it\u2019s going to be a more complete solution. And then of course, what we expect is the tail, that again this is going to be a strong ongoing relationship, a higher share of the basket.","Now, this is something that from a scaling standpoint, we\u2019re not rushing, because we want to make sure we get this right, and we scale this right. This is \u2013 it\u2019s easy to talk about, but finding the right personnel, training them appropriately, managing them effectively, giving them the right tools, CRM tools, for example, the ability also to build a customer in their home. So we\u2019re pacing ourselves. We do believe this is going to scale. In fact, in my prepared remarks, I commented on the fact that we would go to more markets. But, because this is almost a professional services business, you don\u2019t want to go overnight to full scale. So we\u2019ll pace our self, and we\u2019ll update you as we move forward.","So, all together, very, very exciting. It\u2019s a good illustration, if you will, Dan, of where the Company is going. We go beyond just selling products and solving real customer needs, touching people\u2019s lives. There\u2019s so many great stories about how our In-Home Advisors have really touched people in their lives, changing how they live. It\u2019s not just about using technology, it\u2019s about touching their lives. I\u2019m becoming emotional, so I\u2019ll stop.","Dan Binder","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brad Thomas. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Brad Thomas","Yes, thank you, good morning. I wanted to ask about the consumer electronics category. Really a nice performance in that category in the quarter, and hoping you could talk about some of the potential catalysts for that category in 2017, particularly the performance of the home theater area?","Corie Barry","Yes, so good morning, Brad. This is Corie. There\u2019s a few things going on there. I\u2019m going to start with home theater. Home theater continues to perform well, but it is not the biggest driver of this quarter of some of the increase we\u2019re seeing, other things that are included in the consumer electronics category are our connected home products. We\u2019ve seen some very nice growth out of our home automation products, in particular. And we also actually have our headphone category in consumer electronics, which has been a strong performer for us over the last quarter.","And then finally, we actually saw a bit of a tick- up in our digital imaging business, as well that contributed. So really, in home theater we continued to see good results. Sequentially that\u2019s been pretty consistent. It was some of those other categories that really outperformed in Q4.","Brad Thomas","Got you. And how are you thinking about home theater in particular in 2017? Thank you.","Corie Barry","Yes, so obviously, I\u2019m not going to give category guidance, but in general what I\u2019d say as we \u2013 we expect into the same dynamic to play out, which is, we\u2019ve seen good unit growth over time as new technologies become more and more accessible. But that has obviously come at lower ASPs, and what we like for us is that the balance between those two things, and the mix of business for us, that\u2019s what Hubert commented on, this ability for us to sell the more fully featured, the up and coming technology, to really experience what a 60, 70, 90-inch TV\u2019s looks and feels like, that mix of business for us has been very helpful and very strong.","Now, obviously we\u2019d expect continued proliferation of technologies, always means a moderation in the ASP gains and we\u2019ve said we\u2019d expect some of the share gains to moderate, but we don\u2019t expect this to look like a cliff for us. We expect continued evolution and development in the category, and we think we\u2019re really well positioned to continue to see this category through the next year.","Brad Thomas","Very helpful. Thank you, Corie.","Corie Barry","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Michael Lasser. Please go ahead.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. It dovetails on the whole market share conversation. Can you describe why this spread between your sales and the NPD results narrowed this quarter? And as part of that, where is your absolute level of market share today across all categories, and is it just harder to grow share at that level, absent more store closings from competitors?","Corie Barry","I will try these one at a time. First, on the spread question, in the actual categories that are included in NPD, our spread was actually very similar in Q4 as it has been in Q2, Q3, and if anything, it actually might have grown a little bit. The tricky part is the categories that are not included in NPD, and a couple of those we specifically called out multiple times in the release and that is mobile and gaming.","In those categories, we said we saw pressure, due to a couple different factors. But it\u2019s those categories that are creating a little bit of the shrink in the differential between our results, and what you see in NPD. In terms of the overall share of the markets, we haven\u2019t ever publicly released what we think the overall market share looks like. We did talk a little bit in the release about the fact we just generally believe that the overall market has been down, certainly down in the last calendar year, and that we\u2019ve been able to gain share, and we continue as we said, going forward, we continue to believe we\u2019re well positioned to do that.","Hubert Joly","Maybe if can add a couple of sentences to what Corie said. I think back in the Renew Blue presentation in November 2012, we actually had some aggregate market share numbers, and Michael, if you go back, they were in the mid-teens. That\u2019s if you go across all of the categories. And so one of the things we\u2019re very clear internally is that as long as we\u2019re not at 100% market share, we have opportunity to grow. This is still a very fragmented market.","Of course, our share varies across product categories. We think that the needs of customers in our categories are very sophisticated. We\u2019re raising the bar. There\u2019s probably a couple of competitors who are also raising the bar, but it\u2019s hard for people to compete in this category at the same pace and level of investments we\u2019re making. So we think there is a lot of runway in terms of gaining market share.","Now, as we introduce Best Buy 2020, building the New Blue, our strategy is not just to gain market share in these product categories. It\u2019s to go beyond that and address underlying customer needs in terms of services and solutions, which significantly expands our addressable market. While there\u2019s a lot of work we have to do to capture these opportunities, that\u2019s another axis, if you will of our growth potential.","Michael Lasser","Thanks so much.","Hubert Joly","Thank you Michael.","Corie Barry","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the Matt Fassler. Please go ahead.","Matt Fassler","Thanks so much and good morning. My question revolves around the mobile category. It\u2019s been challenging now, I guess, for a year or more. And I understand there\u2019s some idiosyncratic challenges with products and recalls, et cetera. Can this return to being a growth category for you, as you think about market growth, your market share, and the profitability of the category?","Hubert Joly","Yes, so there\u2019s several factors. One is the market, the other one is market share. Clearly after many years of increasing penetration of smartphones in this country, the penetration is now at a very high level, and you\u2019re more in a replacement market, specifically during the quarter. In addition, the market which we think from a handset standpoint in calendar Q4 was down, the market was hindered by the product recall issue, and then by demand supply issues that the other vendor had in this category and that was reported on their call.","So we don\u2019t expect significant growth in this category from a market standpoint. What we briefly commented upon in my prepared remarks, is that we believe that we have the opportunity, and that\u2019s going to be our goal, to gain market share. As you know, this is one of the categories where our share is the lowest, in single digits. We continue to believe that buying a phone today at any retailer is not a pleasant experience. It\u2019s actually quite painful, and our ambition is to provide a smoother, easier, more compelling customer experience, and on that basis, leveraging the rest of our assets including the very large traffic we have both online and in our stores to do this. So we\u2019re working on that, and so we have the ambition to grow a little bit our market share. It\u2019s much more that, than expecting the market to grow.","Matt Fassler","If I could just ask a brief follow-up. If you think about the various pricing models and the way they have evolved over the past year or two, and I know that remains dynamic, does that impact the margin structure of the category for you, or can the margins be as good as they are, say, today?","Corie Barry","Hey Matt, its Corie, I think it\u2019s reasonable to say that we\u2019d expect there to be a bit of margin pressure in the category. It\u2019s not just the changes, it\u2019s broader than just the changes in how people are paying. It\u2019s also, as you think about the unlocked and prepaid businesses being much more viable models as well for customers, which again we think is great space for us to play in because it offers choice and gives us a different way to position ourselves in the category. You\u2019ve seen it for the last few quarters at least, listed as one of the margin pressures for us, and I think that continues.","Matt Fassler","Got it thank you so much guys.","Hubert Joly","Thank you, Matt.","Corie Barry","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from is from Simeon Gutman. You line is open please go ahead.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks. Good morning. My question is on the operating profit outlook. So it\u2019s mentioned in the release, you have the $60 million headwind from profit share, and then there\u2019s just natural cost creep. I played with some numbers. You can get anywhere $50 million, $60 million, maybe $100 million. Then you\u2019re investing in businesses. I don\u2019t know if the size is as important, but this idea that you\u2019re still able to reduce meaningful expenses, which is where the guidance implies, can you talk about where it\u2019s coming from, especially as you continue to make investments? Incrementally, is it getting to find? But it looks like there\u2019s some sizable numbers embedded in the Fiscal 2018 guide.","Corie Barry","Yes, there is a couple of things going on with the guide. Number one, let\u2019s take the cost side first. Obviously, we\u2019re very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made thus far on the Renew Blue phase two cost reductions. $150 million in FY16, $200 million in FY17, and we feel like we\u2019re well positioned to close that out this year, and then talk more openly about what comes next. In those buckets, the places where we\u2019ve seen some really nice progress.","If you remember back to when Sharon would talk a lot about some of the returns, replacements and damaged inventory, the teams have done some really exceptional work in those areas and across the board have created profitability. Remember, sometimes these show up in gross profit. Sometimes they show up in SG&A. Some of this is the work that actually ends showing up in gross profits. And is improving some of that return and damaged inventory. Another place where we have seen some good improvements is across supply chain and across contractually how we think about some of our agreements with our carriers and the way we\u2019re making some of our supply chain choices.","We think some nice cost reductions there as well. I think we\u2019ve said it from the beginning, that this phase, it is more cross functional. It is very different than the first $1 billion we took out. It requires us to think differently about our processes. To your question about, is there really going to be more, isn\u2019t it just going to get harder? I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s easy, but I think we all fundamentally believe that. Just like you would expect in manufacturing. We have to continue to find productivity in our business, and better and more efficient ways of doing things. Frankly, at the end of the day, they typically also result in a better employee and a better customer experience.","The truth is if we have costs that we\u2019re embedding, somewhere down the line, it\u2019s breaking. The second piece, Simeon, I want to make sure that I call out, and we said it in the release, is that we also are expecting to roll out some of these new initiatives, and we\u2019re expecting some return on those initiatives, as well. It\u2019s not just the cost reduction side. It\u2019s also an expectation that we see returns on these initiatives that to be clear, we\u2019re vetting very carefully, based on the tests and pilots that we\u2019re running thus far. Does that help.","Simeon Gutman","Yes. Thanks very much, good luck.","Hubert Joly","I want to amplify what Corie said. I don\u2019t want there to be any doubt. Not that there was any ambiguity in what Corie said, but in terms of the cost take-out and we said it on previous calls, this is for us an ongoing focus and discipline, and while we\u2019ve not communicated today the goal for the next phase because our tradition is to first complete the phase. And then we announce the next phase, we believe there is going to be ongoing continued material opportunity for improving performance, our effectiveness, efficiency across our key processes.","Lean is a term that\u2019s been used throughout the Company, and there is ample opportunity. So while we\u2019ve announced today a new strategy, Best Buy 2020, building the New Blue that has a strong growth orientation, customer orientation, equally important is this focus on cost, which is critical to offset the pressures. We don\u2019t have cost creep, we have some precious and have some pressures and then we have investments to fund. So this continues to be a balancing act, but I don\u2019t want any doubts about the sense we have about the opportunity, and our commitment to ongoing cost optimization. Am I clear?","Simeon Gutman","Yes. Thanks, Hubert. Very clear.","Operator","Our next question is from Alan Rifkin. Your line is open please go ahead.","Alan Rifkin","Thank you very much. My question has to do with the product availability. At the beginning of the quarter, you had said that there would be about 150 basis point impact to your guidance for the fourth-quarter comp due to Samsung alone. Obviously the product availability in the quarter spread beyond Samsung. I was wondering either with respect to dollars or comp, what was the impact of difficulty in procuring some of the product, and what gives you the confidence that these difficulties will be alleviated at the beginning of the second half? Thank you.","Hubert Joly","Alan. Thank you for the questions. Calculating the missed opportunity is not an exact science. We have tried to quantify what we believe is the impact in the quarter from these really unprecedented constrained product availability issues. We believe it was well over $100 million of missed sales in the quarter, and frankly could be close or around $200 million, and that\u2019s on top of the $200 million impact from the Samsung recalls. And this was across multiple vendors, I won\u2019t go through all of the details but many vendors have spoken about this supply demand, imbalances on their calls or the press has reported, and you may have experienced yourself in our stores or online because I know all of you are frequent shoppers. That\u2019s about the order of magnitude, Alan",". In terms of next year or this fiscal year, in our prepared remarks, both Corie and I have spoken about the impact in the first half, notably from the product recall from last year, meaning the Note 7 not being available for sale. This year that\u2019s about $50 million. And then at least there\u2019s an assumption on our part based on various public indications that the launch of a new phone would happen later in the quarter, even though we don\u2019t have a firm date at this point in time.","So some of these things erode in the second half. So clearly a bit like last year, in aggregate, we\u2019re seeing a softer beginning of the year, and then a recovery in the second half. We have to be humble in terms of forecasting, because frankly, these product availability issues could not have been anticipated at the beginning of the last year, and so we are sharing with you some assumptions. But it\u2019s hard to be certain of course, at this point in time.","Alan Rifkin","Thank you, Hubert.","Hubert Joly","Thank you Alan","Operator","Our next question is from Anthony Chukumba. Your line is open please go ahead.","Anthony Chukumba","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I guess I had two questions. The first one was just in terms of the domestic gross margin. Obviously, the performance was very strong. Looks like you continue to do a very nice job of having very effective promotions. But I wonder, do you worry that you might have left some sales on the table, maybe some gross margin dollars on the table, by maybe not being a little bit more aggressive promotionally? How do you think about that?","Hubert Joly","So this is something we constantly look at, particularly during this holiday quarter, which is very and so forth. If we could have generated more sales, more profitable sales through more promotional activity, we would have done it. I think the cap on our revenue is really the two things we highlighted. One was the product availability issues. No point in promoting a product that\u2019s not available, obviously. And then the very material softness in gaming. So the short answer to your question, Anthony, is no, we don\u2019t feel \u2013 this is not completely scientific. We don\u2019t feel we left money on the table from a top line standpoint based on promotional decisions.","Anthony Chukumba","Okay, great. And then just real quickly\u2026","Hubert Joly","I want to reiterate, profitable top line. You can always lose money, but that\u2019s not what you want us to do.","Anthony Chukumba","Understood. Agreed. Agreed. And then just real quickly. One of your competitors, a multi-regional appliance and consumer electronics retailer, seems like they\u2019re in a pretty bad spot right now. They may be filing for bankruptcy. How do you sort of think about the market share gain opportunity, if and when that happens, and to the extent that leads to significant store closings?","Hubert Joly","So thank you for this question. So we\u2019re not going to mention the name of this particular retailer, but I think that if we\u2019re thinking about the same, they have about 200 stores roughly, so it\u2019s about 20% of our stores have an overlap with them. I think they do about $1 billion of revenue in appliances, and the rest of their business is mainly furniture, don\u2019t have much electronics left. If they do file and close their stores, which we have no information about, then you can assume that the $1 billion would be shared across a variety of players. These are the orders of magnitude, so not something transformative for us.","There\u2019s been a pattern in this category of some players consistent generous share donors, and we do expect that to continue in the quarter, which is one of the reasons we\u2019re excited about the appliance category.","Anthony Chukumba","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Nagel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Brian Nagel","Hi, good morning and Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask, just on e-commerce. We\u2019ve seen a very strong performance out of your e-commerce sales now for the past several quarters, it\u2019s pushing up towards almost 20% of your business. Two parts. One, any thoughts on where that ultimately drives to as a share of total sales? And second, as e-commerce now is a much more significant part of your business, any thoughts on or how should we think about the profitability of those sales versus more traditional sales in your stores? Thanks.","Hubert Joly","Thank you, Brian. So let me take the first part, and then Corie will lead the second part on the economic impact. So number one, very proud of the performance of our e-commerce channel. I think if you go back four years ago, the experience on our site and the experience on our site today and mobile app, this is a sea change, complete transformation, both on the shopping experience, as well as the supply chain, so very, very proud of that.","From the beginning, we said that we wanted to be driven by how customers want to buy, and shop and buy. And so, in the way we run the business, we\u2019re not trying to steer the customer towards one channel or the other. And in fact, it\u2019s increasingly difficult to identify what channel is responsible for the business, because the customers will usually start online, maybe complete the sale online, may go to the store and back and forth, and of course 40% of the orders are picked up in the store or shipped from the store. So there\u2019s a blurring of the two channels.","There is clearly a trend, though, in particular for the smaller, simpler items, for customers to buy online, something that you\u2019re familiar with. It\u2019s hard to know how high it\u2019s going to be. What we also know is that for the larger cube, higher touch categories where seeing the product, having access to an experienced sales associate, and then having the in-home experience, that set of assets is really critical for us. So we\u2019re driven by innovating the customer experience, developing competitive experience, combining our two sets of assets.","In general, that means we believe the online piece will continue to expand, and we do believe that our stores have a critical role to play. Now, from an economic standpoint, Corie, tells us how we see it.","Corie Barry","From a channel shift perspective, while it\u2019s true that in general, we tend to see lower profitability in gross profit online, and a lot of that due to obviously some of the attach, the things that you do in the store in a relationship, that are a little bit harder to do online. The team has done an exceptional job of improving the profitability of our online business year-over-year. And so while you have the mix impact, that puts a little bit of pressure, you have a rate improvement in the channel in and of itself which has really been helping us mitigate that channel shift.","Additionally, one of the things that\u2019s a little bit different for us is that we obviously invest in our in-store expertise, and we spend time with our customers, and we invest in that expertise which means obviously when you\u2019re in store, there is an expense profile associated with being in store. And that helps create a balance with actually the expense profile that we have, and usually associated with shipping and some of the other supply chain metrics online.","And so we don\u2019t find the disparity between the channels to be as great as some people would talk about, but at the same time, we\u2019re very clear about our belief that this continues, and it continues because of how people like to shop, and it\u2019s also a big part of the reason that Hubert talked about. We believe strongly that cost control continues to be something that\u2019s really important for us, as we think about our business going forward.","Brian Nagel","Great. Thank you very helpful.","Corie Barry","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our last question from Scot Ciccarelli. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mike Lehrhoff","Hi, this is Mike Lehrhoff on for Scot Ciccarelli. I was wondering if you could discuss your expectations for the gaming category in the coming year, as well as any guidance on future store closures this year?","Corie Barry","All right. We\u2019ll start with gaming. Obviously we\u2019ve seen, like we said, softness coming out of Q4. Gaming is very interesting for us. We tend to over-index on the hardware side of gaming. And so we tend to be very tied to major releases and the demand around the excitement on those releases, and so it\u2019s a little bit difficult for us to understand exactly what some of those product launches will look like. In general, we don\u2019t expect a massive change in the trajectory, other than the extent to which those releases are exciting for people.","So obviously, as we go into Q1 here, we have the switch as part of the guidance that we gave you for Q1 and the excitement around that. From there on out, we don\u2019t have a ton of visibility to how the market will change over time, but we\u2019ll continue to update you as we know more about the product cycle on that one. But in general, I think that\u2019s the hardware side. On the software side, we definitely continue to see a move towards digital and that obviously, from the way that we sell, puts some pressure on our sales, because we tend to be more of a physical gaming retailer versus a digital one. I think I would expect that shift to continue and that pressure to continue to be there, as we go forward.","Your second question on store closures, and so, we obviously have a very stringent process here for looking at our stores. Within the next, oh, call it five years, we\u2019re going to see about 70% of our leases \u2013 we see about 100 a year. That gives us some flexibility. As we look at those leases, as you would expect, we do have a pretty high bar that we set for our stores. We talked earlier about our expectation that online growth continues at the pace we\u2019ve seen it. We build those expectations into the expectations for our store performance.","And we assume that there\u2019s a definite chunk of that, that cannibalizes those stores. And so as we think about the store performance, we\u2019re setting a high bar, based on what the store actually needs to perform, assuming that online growth. Given that, you can see over the last two years we\u2019ve closed about 24 stores, and so I would expect us to continue to see that store closure effort going forward, and that will continue to use those high expectations for growth in the online channel.","Hubert Joly","Thank you Corie. Maybe in closing, let me just say a couple of things. As we close fiscal 2017, clearly we\u2019re very proud of the results we\u2019ve delivered in this last year, and as we begin fiscal 2018, we\u2019re very excited about the next phase of our journey that we\u2019ve announced today, Best Buy 2020. We\u2019re also excited about the return of capital plans that we\u2019ve announced this morning. Thank you very much for your attention this morning and your continued support. Have a great day.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"3576":["Best Buy Co., Inc.

I'll begin today with a review of our third quarter performance, briefly discuss holiday and then review some of the progress we're making against our Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue strategy. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and our financial outlook.","So today, we are reporting strong top and bottom line results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. We grew Enterprise revenue 4.2% to $9.32 billion, which is a 4.4% Enterprise comp, and we increased earnings per share 30% to $0.78 compared to $0.60 last year.","These results include the negative impact of 2 significant factors. First, despite what we characterize as moderate expectations for mobile phone launches in the quarter, revenue in the mobile category was materially lower than expected. This was due to the fact that a major new phone did not start selling until November, which is the first month of our fourth quarter. This resulted in significant softness in sales of existing mobile phone models in October as customers delayed their purchases. The related revenue impact in the quarter was more than $100 million.","Second, like most retailers, we felt the impact of the natural disasters in South Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and Mexico. Our first priority during these disasters was, of course, the safety and well-being of our associates in the affected communities, and we're happy to share that all of our associates are safe even though some of them suffered material losses. We estimate the negative impact to our Enterprise comparable sales was 15 basis points to 20 basis points, and that with the related costs, including insurance, deductibles, repairs and employee-related pay, our earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $0.03.","Now despite these two factors, the results we are announcing today are within the earnings guidance we shared in August and are strong in absolute terms. Earlier this year, we announced the launch of our growth strategy, Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue. And well, we're growing. In fact, year-to-date, our revenue growth rate is 3%. This is materially above what we had guided at the beginning of the year.","Technology innovation is fueling demand, and our strategy is resonating with our customers. And while we are investing in key initiatives and capabilities, we're also able to generate significant returns for our shareholders through the growth of our EPS and our capital allocation strategy.","As such, I want to thank all of our associates for their great work in delivering these results. I am incredibly proud of the collective and individual talent, the heart and the soul of this organization.","Looking ahead, we are excited about our plans for holiday. Our teams across all functions are ready and keen to take care of our customers online, in our stores or in the customer's home. We have a curated assortment of great new products across multiple categories, including smart home, phones, gaming and tech toys. We have a compelling promotional calendar with strong brand messaging. We are, again, this year, offering free shipping with no minimum, and we're offering a range of new capabilities, including our new In-Home Advisor program now available nationwide, an updated gift center and same-day shipping in 40 cities.","So while we are, as always, thoughtful about product availability during the fourth quarter, we're increasing our top line and bottom line guidance both for the fourth quarter and, again, for the year.","Now we'll review some of our progress in the implementation of our Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue strategy. We are excited by the opportunities we have in this next chapter to develop deeper and stickier relationship with our customers and build a strong, vibrant, growing company with significant competitive advantages. We are committed to building a company that can thrive in both today's and tomorrow's environments. As we laid out at our Investor Day in September, Best Buy 2020 is designed to take advantage of key growth opportunities by expanding what we sell and evolving how we sell.","The work we're doing in the smart home space is a great example of how we are expanding what we sell. We plan to build on our leading position in the smart home market by continuing to expand our curated assortment, demonstrating new technology solutions in a meaningful way and expanding in the solutions and services part of the market. We believe needs-based demonstrations and experiential merchandising are critical, and we have a unique capability to showcase the products, both online and in store. In this spirit, as we head into holiday, all of our stores have enhanced smart home departments. In addition, as previously announced, 700 stores have new Alexa and Google experiences developed in collaboration with Amazon and Google and 450 stores have a Best Buy Smart Home powered by Vivint home automation and security offering.","To complement all of this, we've added an incremental 1,500 dedicated smart home store employees to make sure that when you come to shop with us, we'll do a great job identifying what smart home solution would work best for you. As we discussed at our Investor Day, as a natural offshoot of our smart home focus, we are testing opportunities to leverage technology to help the rapidly growing segment of aging seniors stay in their homes as long as possible.","We're piloting a service called Best Buy Assured Living that uses a non-invasive set of smart home connectors and sensors to help adult children remotely check in on the health and safety of their aging parents. Aging parents also benefit from the increased automation in their home such as connected door locks and smart lighting. We're very early here, piloting the opportunity in the twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul and in the Denver market.","As it relates to supporting customers, we're also focused on expanding what we sell. We believe that customer support needs are not limited to a specific product. The need now is to have all of their technology working together to improve and simplify their lives as promised.","Total tech support is a new Geek Squad offering that provides support for all of the customers' technology no matter where or when they bought it. This support is available to customers 24\/7 via online, in store and phone and includes significant discounts if in-home services are needed.","In September, we expanded the pilot to just over 200 stores across 10 cities in the U.S. Meanwhile we are evolving how we sell to focus not only on selling products but also on solving customers' underlying needs. We see material opportunity in our ability to continue to improve the customer experience within and across channels.","Almost all of our customers currently use both the store and the online channel, and they have different expectations on what the channels should do for them depending on their mindset. As an example, customers often use the online channel when they are most certain about their purchase and the store channel when they are less certain.","In our online channel, we've made a great deal of progress and have driven innovation, and we continue to see strong growth in online sales. In Q3, we grew online sales 22% to $1.1 billion, which is now 13% of our Domestic revenue.","We've also significantly improved the in-store experience as evidenced by increased NPS scores and our revenue growth. Going forward, we see continued opportunity in examining how customers use the various channels in their shopping journey and designing and linking experiences across channels. Ultimately, this makes it easier for customers to start their shopping process online and finish it in the store or vice versa. We are notably using this approach to more effectively address customer needs in areas where we have significant growth potential, particularly appliances and mobile phones.","In appliances, for example, where a significant portion of sales are the result of broken appliances that need to be replaced, we are making it clear to customers searching online which appliances are available realtime at their local store for those customers who'd like to replace very quickly.","In mobile, we're enhancing the online experience to smooth pre-orders and streamline phone choice, allowing customers to do most of the work online before they pick up their phone in store for activation. We're also improving the in-store experience to make the various carrier pricing options more clear, reducing the time it takes to activate a phone and using text alerts for clarity on the timing of activation.","We're also focused on building our in-home channel. To that end, in September, we expanded our In-Home Advisor program to all major U.S. markets with 300 advisers. The In-Home Advisors are professional sales consultants with broad product knowledge, who have completed an extensive five week training program. They provide free consultations and serve as a single point of contact for customers covering all technology needs across all vendors.","Our advisers are still ramping up, and we continue to be pleased with the results of the program. In fact, based on the early results, we're planning to expand the number of advisers to 335 by early next year based on initial demand.","To deliver on our strategy, we're investing in a range of enablers. We have built a great set of assets over the past several years, and we're expanding on these assets by investing in key capabilities and tools. So, for example, we're making technology investments in Enterprise customer relationship management, the services platform and knowledge management tools.","We're investing in our supply chain to build for volume, choice, speed and efficiencies that help us offset the normal volume-based increases in expense. For example, during the quarter, we opened a new distribution center in Compton, California, in time for the busy holiday season.","As we've begun work on some of these investments, this is resulting in higher capital and operating expenses this year, and this is going to be a multiyear journey, which is why we are committed to creating efficiencies to help fund investments and offset ongoing pressures in the business.","After reducing costs by $1.4 billion in the past five years, our current target, established in Q2 of this year, is $600 million in additional annualized cost reductions and gross profit optimization to be completed by the end of fiscal 2021. During the quarter, we achieved $50 million towards our new goal to a total thus far of $100 million.","So in summary, we delivered strong top and bottom line results in the third quarter despite the pressure from the later iconic phone launch and the multiple natural disasters. We've also made significant progress against our Best Buy 2020 strategy to position us well for long-term value creation.","Additionally, we returned approximately $1.5 billion in cash to our shareholders so far this year through both dividends and stock buyback. We are pleased to announce that we're planning to spend approximately $2 billion on share repurchases this fiscal year, ahead of our original expectation of $1.5 billion.","With all of this momentum as backdrop, we believe we are well-positioned for a successful holiday season and are, therefore, raising our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and for the year. So, again, I'd like to thank all of our associates for their work this last quarter and for, of course, what they will do this holiday season. You all are amazing.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Corie Barry, for more details on our Q3 performance and our Q4 guidance.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you, Hubert. Before I talk about our third quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. On revenue of $9.32 billion, we delivered diluted earnings per share of $0.78, both of which were within our guidance range.","As Hubert discussed, we saw strong top line growth with positive comps across almost all of our product categories. However, the lower than expected mobile phone revenue caused by the later phone launch, estimated to be more than $100 million, was material enough to pull our comparable sales below our comparable sales guidance range.","In addition, as Hubert mentioned, we estimate that natural disasters had a 15 basis point to 20 basis point impact on our Enterprise comparable sales and a $0.03 negative impact on our earnings per share. Like many other companies, we made decisions to support our employees, our customers and our communities, including organizing the delivery of much needed supplies to our associates in Puerto Rico, where we have three stores and a distribution center, within a few days of the devastation. Many of these decisions came at a cost, but they were definitely the right thing to do.","Slightly offsetting these pressures are lower than expected Q3 tax rate provided a $0.02 benefit.","I will now talk about our third quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 4.2% to $9.3 billion. Enterprise diluted earnings per share increased $0.18 or 30% to $0.78. This increase was primarily driven by the flow-through of higher Domestic revenue, a $0.07 per share benefit driven by a lower effective income tax rate and a $0.04 per share benefit from the net share count change. These increases were partially offset by higher Domestic SG&A from expected increases in growth investments and higher variable costs due to increased revenue.","Additionally, we had $25 million or $0.05 per share of net negative impact from lapping the Q3 fiscal 2017 periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio. In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 3.6% to $8.5 billion. This increase was primarily driven by a comparable sales increase of 4.5%, partially offset by the loss of revenue from 10 large-format and 44 Best Buy Mobile stores closed during the past year.","From a merchandising perspective, we saw positive comps across almost all of our product categories with the largest drivers being appliances, computing and smart home. As it relates to the home theater category, the industry was down for the third straight quarter, but our Q3 sales were up slightly on a year-over-year basis, resulting in another quarter of material share gains in this category.","As Hubert mentioned, mobile phone revenue was impacted by the timing of launches. Even though we saw $100 million of pressure, revenue in the mobile category was up slightly on a year-over-year basis. Domestic online revenue of $1.1 billion increased 22.3% on a comparable basis, primarily due to higher conversion rates and higher average order value.","International revenue of $829 million increased 10.1%. This increase was primarily driven by approximately 530 basis points of positive foreign currency impact and comparable sales growth of 3.8% due to growth in both Canada and Mexico.","Turning now to gross profit, the Enterprise gross profit rate decreased 10 basis points to 24.5%. The Domestic gross profit rate was flat versus last year at 24.7%. Improved margin rates across multiple categories, particularly in computing and smart home, were offset by, one, margin pressure in the appliances categories; and two, an approximately 25 basis point negative impact from lapping the $25 million Q3 fiscal 2017 periodic profit-sharing benefit from our service plan portfolio.","The International gross profit rate decreased 210 basis points to 22.2%, primarily due to a lower year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada due to lower sales in the higher margin services categories, mainly driven by the launch of Canada's total tech support offer, a long-term recurring revenue model.","Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise SG&A was $1.93 billion or 20.7% of revenue, which increased $42 million on a dollar basis, but represented a 40 basis point rate decline. Domestic SG&A was $1.75 billion or 20.6% of revenue, an increase of $31 million. This increase was primarily due to expected increases in growth investments, higher advertising expenses and higher variable costs due to the increased revenue. These increases were partially offset by the flow-through of cost reductions. The 40 basis point rate decrease was driven by sales leverage.","International SG&A was $181 million or 21.8% of revenue, an increase of $11 million. This increase was primarily driven by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. The 80 basis point rate decrease was primarily driven by sales leverage.","From a cash flow perspective, we ended the third quarter in line with our expectations. On the balance sheet, our inventory and payables were up 5% and 6% year-over-year, respectively, due to our strategic decision to bring in more inventory early, ahead of the holiday quarter.","As it relates to capital expenditures, we are now expecting to spend approximately $750 million to $800 million in fiscal 2018 as we have chosen to accelerate certain strategic investments in our e-commerce and supply chain functions. This is versus our previous expectation of approximately $700 million.","I would now like to talk about our full year fiscal 2018 guidance which, as a reminder, has 53 weeks versus 52 weeks last year. We are raising our revenue growth outlook to approximately 4% to 4.8% versus our previous outlook of approximately 4%. And we are raising our non-GAAP operating income growth outlook to 7% to 9.5% versus our previous outlook of 4% to 9%.","As a result, we are raising our Q4 outlook versus what was implied in the annual expectations provided on our last earnings call. Our Q4 Enterprise revenue guidance is $14.2 billion to $14.5 billion, with comparable sales growth of 1% to 3%.","On a segment basis, we are expecting Domestic comparable sales growth of 1% to 3% and International comparable sales growth of flat to 3%. Our Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance is $1.89 to $1.99.","Our Q4 EPS guidance assumes a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of 36% to 36.5%, which is materially higher than last year's 30.2%, which benefited from a number of discrete items.","Finally, our guidance assumes a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 296 million shares. Our Q4 guidance reflects a number of factors. First, as we discussed on last quarter's call, we made strategic decisions to proactively make additional investments in the back half of the year to continue to drive the Best Buy 2020 strategy forward. Those additional investments are in areas such as customer choice in shipping, e-commerce and our long-term strategic vision for supply chain.","Second, the outlook includes approximately $20 million or $0.04 per share of lower profit share revenue than we received last Q4. Third, our fourth quarter and full year performance is expected to drive higher incentive compensation expenses in the fourth quarter than last year's fourth quarter.","This higher incentive compensation is due to both better performance this year and the fact that we are lapping a reversal of incentive compensation expense in Q4 fiscal 2017 that adjusted accruals from earlier quarters of the year. Fourth, as a reminder, the extra week in the quarter adds approximately $100 million of additional SG&A expense.","I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go first today to Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Good morning, Scott.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","So wanted to get your thoughts on the TV category as we get into the fourth quarter, and then my second question would be just labor costs, not only in the fourth quarter, but as we look out to next year, we're getting a lot of noise from people that it's becoming a pretty big problem. Wanted to get your take on that? So, those two things. Thanks.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","So I'll do my best here, and then maybe Hubert can add a little bit more color. In terms of TV, I mean, the first thing that I would say is we continue to be very excited about the technology innovation in the category. And within that, we feel like we're very uniquely positioned to show off those new technologies.","Obviously, according to what we can see in the NPD data, in Q3, the industry TV revenue was down about 5%, which was better than the down 10% we saw in the first part of the year. For us, we actually \u2013 we saw that business was up slightly in the quarter.","Similar to Q2, units were down, but ASPs were up, and a big part of that was mixing into those bigger screen sizes and more fully featured technologies. We like that positioning heading into the fourth quarter. Obviously, it's a highly competitive quarter, but we're excited about the plan that team has put together, and we think we're really well positioned.","On top of that, you asked a little bit about labor expenses. One of the investments we have actually called out over almost the last two years is continued investments in specialty labor. And we, first of all, have been a little bit better positioned than some other retailers just given that a vast majority of our labor is a little bit more highly compensated as it is already specialty labor, and then we've been making investments on top of that to ensure we remain very competitive in the marketplace. So for us, we feel like that has been a piece of the investment, and we even said at Investor Day that likely going forward will continue to be a piece of the investment thesis.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","One thing I would add on this, Scott, is that we believe one of the drivers of our very strong performance is the much reduced turnover of the labor in the stores. We think it's at the historical low, it's been materially reduced really as a result of great leadership and focus on that to make it an exciting place to work together with the compensation, but there's other actions. And of course, if you have lower turnover, people are more proficient. It's a reflection of more engagement, and I think we've got a lot of feedback on the level of energy and proficiency in the stores, and we're very excited by it, and we're committed to continuing to work on this and to make it a great place, great employee experience resulting in a great customer experience.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks, guys. Thanks for the thoughts.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Nice results. Was curious just on continuation of the industry backdrop balance versus market share. Could you give a perspective maybe on how NPD trended for your categories? And then do you feel like with this pickup in same-store sales growth that it's partially a result of accelerating market share gains in the industry?","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Yeah, thank you for your question. NPD performed much better, and it's not the first quarter, but it's around plus 2%, something like that. And of course, as you all know where we compete is much broader than NPD. We think appliances is performing well, but mobile, not maybe so strong this quarter. So there's a lot of \u2013 but in general, what we're seeing is technology innovation driving demand. And we spent quite a bit of time during Investor Day sharing our enthusiasm for the fact that this is an opportunity rich environment. When we look ahead, the pace of innovation, how meaningful it is and of course, the help that customers need, that creates a rich environment for us.","In the quarter, to your question, we continue to gain market share. The pace of market share gain is relatively steady, steady as you go. And so the strong performance in the quarter, as I said in my prepared remarks, is really the combination of technology innovation and the fact that our strategy is continuing to resonate. And we like that combo because it's \u2013 and hopefully, you see it as a great company in a great neighborhood.","Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.","That's great. And maybe a quick follow-up, Hubert. There was a nice pickup in the appliance category this quarter with an acceleration. Could you provide a little bit of color on what drove that?","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Yeah. We think that \u2013 I mean, the housing recovery by all measures is still young and still very far from the peaks we have seen a few years ago. So that's helpful, and we're continuing to gain share in this category. The fact that, of course, some competitors have suffered is another factor, but I would highlight, as far as what we can control, the continued investment in the customer experience.","Our teams, rightfully so, are very proud of the fact that we were awarded the best performance by J. D. Power and Associates from a customer experience standpoint across all of their seven criteria. We're continuing to invest there. We think we continue to have many opportunities. So in general, strong category, strong focus on customer experience, and we think that this is an opportunity that's rich with opportunities for us. So excited about that.","Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you very much. Good luck with the holiday season.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse.","Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the Q4 outlook. So you're guiding to comps in the 2% range at the midpoint. Can you just remind us some of the things that were lapping from last year, including the Note7? You had some product supply issues. If we assume that you get some of that back or maybe even a lot of it back, and then you have this $100 million shift from Q3 to Q4, it would basically imply that the rest of the business would be down slightly in the fourth quarter. Obviously, it's been trending much better than that. So just wondering is that math, right? Is there reason for that other than just conservatism and that a lot of the holiday is still ahead of us? Thanks.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Seth, as per usual, you are very good with math. You're absolutely right. And that if everything performed perfectly, so as a reminder, last year we had $200 million of Note revenue we estimated on the quarter and than we said another $100 million to $200 million related to product shortages, because it's not a perfect science. We said thought that was the range. So $300 million to $400 million.","And then obviously, there's the question of moving some of the volume from Q3 into Q4. Not all those things are perfectly additive because remember, where we saw some of the product shortages was in phones. And so that -you're kind of double counting there, obviously.","And the underlying business, it's not that we particularly see a lot of risk. I think we're trying to be thoughtful about the puts and takes across the business. And obviously, during the holiday season and the competitive environment that you're going to see, not everything performs exactly like it does in Q2 and Q3 leading into the season.","And so we do feel like we're very well-positioned. We feel like this range is thoughtful given the plans that we have in front of us, and it does incorporate all of those factors back into it. And obviously, like Hubert even said in the prepared remarks, we're always thoughtful again about availability as we head into the quarter.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","The only thing I would add, Seth, is that when we do the scorecards, we're mindful or thoughtful about share of wallet. There's only so much that customers will spend during the quarter. And if one category or one type of product do better, it's exciting, but there's secondary effects. So we're trying to be thoughtful about this, and so the 1% to 3% outlook reflects our best thinking that's what I would say.","Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Just follow-up question on your store comps. So if you exclude e-commerce, they've been up about 2% over the last two quarters, a pretty meaningful improvement. Can you just help us better understand the drivers of that? Are you seeing traffic actually pickup in the stores? Is that better conversion as you've improved service? Is it a change in basket? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Sure, happy to provide color. This is a great call out and a great reflection on the role that stores play in our category and of course, the great performance of our store teams across the company. I think we're seeing significant shifts in customer behaviors in terms of what they buy online and what they buy in the stores. So clearly, from a traffic standpoint, we're continuing to see traffic decline as customers tend to buy online the higher frequency, smaller items, and they tend to focus their trips to the store for more discovery, experiential discovery, interaction with our great Blue Shirts and gravitating to higher-ticket items, more complex solutions in the stores.","So clearly, we're seeing increase in the basket or the average order value in the stores, also higher conversion rates. In fact, based on the higher proficiency and great engagement of our store associates, but also the fact that customers have done more research before they go to the stores. So you see a significant shift in the performance. But in totality, we're very excited about how we can help customers online and in how we can do great things for customers in the stores.","And then looking ahead, I think we're going to continue to \u2013 you had felt our excitement about the in-home channel and I had some comments about how the initial response to our In-Home Advisor program is very, very positive. So lots of excitement in our ability to help customers online, in the stores and in their home is, in fact, a unique competitive advantage. And we're happy with how it's resonating with customers.","Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. Thanks very much and good luck for the holiday.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you Seth.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Alan Rifkin with BTIG.","Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC","Thank you very much. I'll add my congratulations as well.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC","First question relates to services. Obviously, it's a major initiative for you guys going forward. But if you look at the performance in this quarter, the comp performance within that category was the lowest of any category on what is the lowest base. I was wondering, and I understand it's early in the program, but where are you in terms of growing the services business compared to your early expectations that you laid out?","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you, Alan. What we report in the comps in services is compared to what we're looking at for the future, a relatively narrow view of services. To a very large extent, it's the commission on the warranties as well as some of the tech support services from the Geek Squad. As you look at the overall strategy Best Buy 2020, there's many service-oriented components of the strategy that are actually not reflected in that number and will not impact that particular line. In-Home Advisor, as a great example, is a free consultation in the customer's home. So no revenue from the consultation, and of course, it triggers these enhanced revenues that are largely product and some services. So it's a service-oriented approach.","Similarly, the more we're moving to managed services such as Best Buy Smart Home powered by Vivint, that's not today in that line either. So the service \u2013 and looking ahead, we may \u2013 we're going to think about how to best keep everyone on that journey so that we have some meaningful indicators. We're going to take our time to think about this.","But \u2013 so hopefully, I'm clear in the fact that the service line is a narrow view of what is an overall service-oriented, customer-oriented strategy. Now on the performance in the quarter of that line, our business today in services is largely an attached business related to extended warranties and some installation services. The number is broadly in line with the comps, the aggregate comps, as it's an attached business. So not surprising that in the short term, there's no material change. Corie, anything I would have missed on that?","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","No, I think you hit it.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC","Thank you, Hubert. I appreciate that explanation. The second question has to do with mobility and in particular, obviously, the iPhone launch. Can you maybe talk about your allocations of the new iPhones compared to past allocations? And historically, what type of lift to traffic in the stores has a new launch of an iPhone given you? Thank you very much.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you for your question, Alan. I am very excited about a number of things. One is how our teams have improved the customer experience, in particular around launches, and it's a good \u2013 one thing is the allocations. I won't give you specific numbers about a specific product, but let me just say, in general, we have great relationship with the key handset vendors, and we work very closely with them. But in terms of what we control, the work we've done online, in particular, to facilitate the pre-order process is very, very strong and then the ability to continue to take orders even when the delivery lead times extent, we've worked with the key vendors on making it easier to continue to take pre-orders for out times. We have described on the call we've improved all of this, both online and then in the store.","So really great performance there, making it easy to do most of the work online and then making it easier to purchase in the stores. The phone category is a very exciting category. We're focused on it. Whenever there is a great iconic launch, it creates excitement. In partnership with the handset vendors, we've created great experiences in the stores. So I think these are positive, and you saw that, in fact, the fact that this iconic phone launched in our fourth quarter had a material impact. So that gives you an indication of the impact in this category.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Alan, to your specific question about the traffic.","Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC","Yes.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Like with any launch that we see, whether it's sometimes it's gaming, sometimes it's mobile, we absolutely across our channels, I think that's what important, both online and in the stores, we absolutely can see some more peaky traffic. I think what's important to note, though, is reinforcing what Hubert said overarchingly our traffic patterns when you broaden it across a quarter haven't looked that much materially different.","Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC","Thank you both and best of luck for the holiday season.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you Alan.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. I wanted to focus on the long-term initiatives, the in-home services and those other initiatives. So in your long-term plan, you have about $2 billion in incremental sales roughly. Can you break down how much of that is coming from these services and initiatives and how much from product, please?","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Good morning. So we \u2013 and we said it at Investor Day, too. At this point, we're not breaking down specifically the long range plans from each of the initiatives. Part of that's simply being that we have many of them still very much in test mode. If you think about what we're doing in total tech support as an example, you're in 200 stores at this point and testing three different models to that plan. So it's difficult to for me to tell you on the longer tail where do we think that goes.","What I would reinforce is in the places where we're starting to roll things out like In-Home Advisor, Hubert started to hit on the fact that we're excited about what we're seeing there. And in fact, we already started to increase the number of advisers we have slightly based on the demands that we're seeing. And so our hypothesis definitely was that that $2 billion would need to be supported by some of these initiatives and a combination of them likely, but we're really early in that process.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Yeah. Qualitatively \u2013 and again as soon as we can, we'll try to provide more color. But qualitatively, the direction of Best Buy 2020 is of course around growth, and it's around deeper, meaningful, stickier customer relationships and over time, building more recurring revenue streams. This is going to be a journey because you have to recognize that Best Buy is a relatively big company. So in order for these numbers to become meaningful, it's going to take time. But the direction is very exciting, and for me seeing how these new approaches resonate with customers is very encouraging. So sorry, we cannot be more precise. But hopefully, you feel the direction this is heading.","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. And if I could follow up on that, you are adding 35 more in-home advisers. Can you talk about what are you seeing that's causing you to add that? Is it certain markets? Is there any way to break down like are certain markets working better than others? Or is it the ones that have been in place longer, they're starting to need some help? Just a little bit of color on the successes that are causing you to add those people.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Sure. So we're adding \u2013 we're moving from 300 to 375. So that's 75 additional. So it's a meaningful. It's more than 20% higher that initially planned, and we'll probably continue to add next year. So I think all of you could actually test this. We underestimated demand across the country, and so the lead time if you were to try to get an In-Home Advisor now, we wouldn't be into your home this afternoon. It would be several days. We're trying to work the lead times down. I think we're probably out a week, something like this at this point, and so we were a bit \"overwhelmed\" by the initial demand. And this is a case where we'll try to pace ourselves because these are highly skilled professionals. And if you rush it, if you grow too quickly then you run the risk of deteriorating quality. So while we are pleased to be adding 75 by the beginning of next year, we don't want to go overboard, so it's going to be a fine balance, but the quick answer to your question, we underestimated the demand and the days out were a bit too high, frankly.","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for the color. I appreciate that.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Can you talk about what you're seeing on the connected home side in terms of where are we on that adoption curve? You started to see strong results in that category about a year ago. So are we stacking comps higher in that category? And how long do you think the tail is in terms of the consumers adoption of Alexa and the In-Home Advisor, the Google platform?","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Yes, Google Home. I think we're still early days. This is a significant wave, and we'll be able to measure it based on the number of devices that people have in their homes that are connected, and it's not just the voice assistance. It's all of the devices that are connected, and there was actually a survey of my home. I'll share an anecdote with you.","I have 90 connected devices in my home. Now that's a bit extreme compared to the average American home, but we're in the teens probably nationwide. And so we certainly anticipate, I referenced it in my prepared remarks that during this holiday this is going to be the voice assistance in particular, but smart home more generally speaking are going to be in high demand.","We think it's going to continue because what we're seeing is once people have bought, let's say, a smart camera or a smart lock, a smart device, they'll tend to then continue to add. So this is a very exciting space and we think it's still early, frankly.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure. I guess, just following up on that, so from the actual voice assistant, is that sort of the primary driver of growth at this point? And any sort of differentiation in terms of the adoption of those specific devices versus the cameras and the locks and thermostats and so forth?","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","One of the things that's been most exciting about smart home and that supports much of what Hubert said, is that within the category, depending on the quarter, we're actually seeing different aspects of the category grow. Sometimes it's been monitoring that many people are interested in, in the cameras.","Definitely, voice consistently has been a big part of the growth story, but we're seeing different pieces of that within kind of the sub-categories within that, all growing at different points. So the nice part is we definitely feel like heading into holiday voice assist continues to be a very big driver both just of curiosity but also of purchases. But the good part is that surrounding that, we're also seeing the other parts of smart home grow nicely within the category.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","And this whole smart home trend, of course, plays, and I'll state the obvious, plays really well to our strengths, all right? Because we are a player with online store and in-home capabilities, the ability to help customers across a wide range of devices and brands. We're really well positioned from the discovery stage then to the implementation and support stage. So a big part of Best Buy 2020 is about winning the home.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood, and then the follow-up question is the International gross margin took a pretty big hit. Is that how you rolled out the total tech services? Is that something we should think about in terms of the rollout in the U.S.? Thanks very much.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","That's a great question. So I would not, at this point, correlate the two, because like I said, in the U.S., you're at 200 stores, but three different models that we're testing, and we're doing that so that when we're ready we can come to you with a very fulsome point of view about what we think the implications are.","I mean, that being said, obviously, moving to a model that looks more like support over time where you have ratable payments over time looks quite different than what Hubert talked about earlier, which is attaching a warranty to the business on the front side. And so we've rolled out well, and the customers are adopting the product, and they're enjoying their interactions with the product in Canada.","It's more a question of as you provide the support model over time, and it will look great as we get into the over time part of it. It's just that the first part is you're rolling it out, and you incur some of those expenses upfront, but you get the revenue tail over time, it causes a little bit of a different financial model in the near term, but I would not correlate that yet to the U.S. because we're very early in determining what it is that we want to do here. And once we know that, I promise you we'll be quite clear on what we think the implications are.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","And what I would add is a big difference between Canada and the U.S. is that in Canada, the only version we're offering is a monthly subscription. So of course, very different than if you sell an annual subscription. In some markets in the U.S., we have monthly, but we also have annual. So I really want to reinforce the fact that what Corie said that don't extrapolate to the U.S. at this point.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Have a great holiday.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. With everything being pulled forward and holiday now really starting at the beginning of November, I wondered if you could comment at all on November in terms of what you're seeing so far from the competitive environment? And is there anything markedly different than you anticipated?","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Good morning, Kate, and thank you for the question. Every holiday changes slightly, but every holiday is massively promotional. I think you're right in that, definitely, especially if you look at the trends over the last 5, 10 years, you can see the holiday pulling earlier and earlier, and you can see much bigger peaks on those large promotional periods like Thanksgiving week or like Christmas week. And so that's changing kind of the composition of how holiday builds.","I wouldn't say there's anything that I see out there, and I think the team would support this, that we'd say is massively more promotional or massively different year-over-year. It's more how the holidays are flowing, continues to evolve over time. Again, not something unexpected. We even talked about bringing in some of our inventory a little earlier so we could support some of these earlier sales. And so it's not unexpected, but it's definitely kind of changing the composition of the holiday.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Yeah. And one conclusion, Kate, I've drawn from being here for the last several years is that nothing is over until the fat lady sings, meaning that \u2013 that's an opera reference, right, okay? No, seriously. You have to wait until the end of holiday to see what the results are because the timing varies significantly, including this year, if you remember last year there was a presidential election. And the consumer was distracted for a few days, so clearly, this year, we're seeing a different pattern. But no conclusion can be drawn until the end of that singing that I was referencing.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's great. Thank you. And can you just remind us with regards to how the fulfillment to the customers is changing this year versus last? I think you had mentioned that there is a number of cities where you're going to have same-day shipping to customers, and can you just tell us what is incremental this year versus last year?","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","In terms of what we're offering in terms of shipping options?","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","So that like last year, Kate, we're offering free shipping with no minimum. So that's not a change.","The change is the same-day delivery in 40 cities. That is not free. The charge varies a little bit. I think it's going to be $5.99, I believe the last time I ordered something for same-day delivery, that's what I paid. So that's \u2013 same-day delivery in 40 cities is really the new factor.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","I think in general, and we talk about some of the supply chain expensing included into the Q4 guide. In general, we're trying to build for speed and flexibility. So it's same day, it's next day, it's two-day, it's weekend, it's cut-off times, it's all those things that the team is continuing to invest in so that whenever customers want it, they have the flexibility to get it in the timeframe that matters to them.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Matt McClintock with Barclays.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, yes. Good morning, everyone.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Good morning.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hubert, I'd like to actually stay with the In-Home Advisor just for a second. You're hiring 75 more in-home advisers because the demand was better than you thought. I know you alluded to potentially marketing the program maybe this holiday season at some point at your Investor Day.","Can you talk about how that went? I know you have a commercial out there, but did you pull back on marketing spend, because there's just been so much demand and you didn't want to maybe frustrate your consumer? Or are your marketing plans continuing exactly how you expected?","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you, Matt. The plans are continuing as expected. We asked ourselves the question, the marketing team and the store team seeing the early results, reviewed things and the weight of the marketing on in-home advisers is actually relatively light. And so there was no anxiety around that. Our focus is more on operationally doing a great job, we're trying to do a great job of being responsive to customers and reducing these lead time, and so on and so forth. So that's been the approach.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then Corie, just a housekeeping question. You extended the share repurchase to $2 billion this year. Can you update us on your thoughts on the level of cash balance that you would prefer to keep on your balance sheet going forward?","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Yeah. A great question. And so first, I just want to make sure that I'm clear that we're not updating the $3 billion of repurchase that we set at the beginning of the year over the two years. We still are planning to achieve that amount.","That being said, we've never come out and said exactly what we believe the ending cash balance is that we're seeking, but we're very clear that we're using our new capital allocation strategy to make sure that we continue to work that balance down in a really thoughtful way.","We've always said and as a reminder, first, we want to reinvest in the business where we feel like we have the right investments and the right return. And so we continue to do that. But at the same point, we're obviously pacing in some of this repurchase and the dividend so that we make sure we return cash wherever possible.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.","If I could follow-up on that, just theoretically, as your business model shifts more towards service or reoccurring revenue stream that Hubert outlined at the Investor Day, would that imply that you could maintain a lower cash balance than historically on the balance sheet?","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I think there's a lot of things actually that work into implying that you likely can have a lower cash balance certainly than we do today. One is just the overall strength of the business and the performance, and that's what Hubert alluded to, these really strong partnerships with our vendors. Those are some of the most important things. And then obviously, over time, as you continue to beef up that stability in your business, that is absolutely what gives you more confidence to go ahead and work that cash balance down.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","I do want to reiterate that the development of recurring revenue stream is something that's going to take time. So I don't want you to assume that already next year this could be a very material part of our business. It's going to take time. It's a very meaningful transformation, but it's going to take time.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thanks for the color. Looking forward to that though Hubert.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Great. Same here. Thank you.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Good quarter, guys.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","A quick question on the earlier one, conservatism maybe on the fourth quarter outlook. Any reason to think that $1,000, as people are veering towards the X that price point could eat into other sales? And then can you just remind me, if I'm buying out the phone versus taking an installment plan, is the revenue any different to you?","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","So let me start with kind of you referenced really what the share of wallet question, and Hubert even hit on this, which is it is difficult when you have $1,000 price point phone, even a $800, a $500 price point phone. And obviously, when you're thinking about how much of your expendable income you're going to spend on CE, we are quite thoughtful about that share of wallet question, particularly over the holidays when people often go in with a budget and are trying to think about how to stretch that budget as far as they can. And so that's absolutely part of what we are thoughtful about when it comes to Q4. Then obviously, over the last two years, three years, four years, the Q4 has not played like the earlier quarters of the year.","And so we're trying to take some of that knowledge we've gained into account as we think about where we believe the fourth quarter is going to go. In terms of the revenue profile, from a revenue perspective, in whatever way we sell the phone, the revenue profile is similar. The piece that looks different is depending on whether or not there's a plan attached to that and what the consumer decides to purchase alongside the hardware. That's what changes the profile, but the revenue profile is the same no matter what.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then thinking past fourth quarter and into next year, you're going to have some tough product compares next year. Do you expect the momentum generally to continue? And then will the service offering be meaningful enough next year to enable the business to continue comping, I don't know, at these current rates, but in healthy low-single digit rates?","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Yes, obviously, we're not, Simeon, providing guidance for next year today. This year is going to turn out, I mean, so far this year, the growth rate have been very significant. And based on our outlook, would have been a very strong year. We provided two months ago a three-year outlook in terms of the revenue with implied revenue growth rates on a compounded basis that are below the number that we have so far this year. So we're not providing guidance for next year. But yes, carrying over these exact numbers for next year, I would not encourage you to do this at this point in time.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Well, with this I want to conclude our call and really thank you for your continued work on our behalf, following us and sharing our excitement about where we are and where we are going. Sometimes when you look at these numbers, you have to go back a few years ago and thinking about Best Buy with the kind of comps and EPS growth we're reporting today, 4.4% comps and 30% EPS growth on top of a 51% EPS growth last year, you have to almost pinch yourself thinking about where we are compared to where we were five years ago, so very excited, which gives me the opportunity to thank again all of our associates. They are just terrific, amazing, dedicated, big heart, big soul, and great skills. And then finally, we look forward to seeing you in the stores. If you want to get that Sharp, 50-inch, 4K TV at $179.99, I would encourage you to be early in the stores on Thanksgiving at 5:00 because can you imagine that? 4K TV, $179.99, 50-inch, how cool is that? In any event, we'll see you in stores or online, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 11:00 AM Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mollie O\u2019Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Mollie O\u2019Brien","Good morning and thank you. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our Chairman and CEO; and Corie Barry, our CFO. This morning\u2019s conference call must be considered in conjunction with the earnings release we issued this morning. Today\u2019s release and conference call both contain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain business events.","These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to facilitate meaningful year-over-year comparisons, which should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for and should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures for the period. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning\u2019s earnings release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com.","Today\u2019s earnings release and conference call also include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address the financial conditions, results of operations, business initiatives, growth plans, operational investments and prospects of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.","Please refer to the company\u2019s current earnings release and SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.","In today\u2019s earnings release and conference call, we refer to NPD-tracked categories. The categories tracked by the NPD Group, includes TVs, desktop and notebook computers, tablets, digital imaging and other categories. Sales of these products represent approximately 63% of our domestic revenue. It does not include mobile phones, appliances, services, gaming, Apple Watch, movies, music or Amazon branded products.","I will now turn the call over to Hubert.","Hubert Joly","Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I\u2019ll begin today with a review of our third quarter performance and then provide an overview of the progress we are making against our fiscal 2017 priorities before turning the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and our financial outlook.","We\u2019re pleased to report, today, growth on both our top and bottom lines with enterprise revenue of $8.95 billion, an increase of 1.4% and non-GAAP EPS increasing 51% from $0.41 last year to $0.62 this year. These results were due to the strong performance in both our domestic and international segments. In our domestic business, we delivered comparable sales growth of 1.8%. This was on top of comparable sales growth of 0.8% last year.","We saw continued positive momentum in our online channel, delivering their third straight quarter of 24% revenue growth. From an overall merchandising perspective, we saw year-over-year sales growth in home theatre, mobile, and emerging categories like wearables and connected home. This was offset by continued softness in gaming. We also continued to drive considerable year-over-year improvement in our net promoter score, which increased approximately 400 basis points over Q3 last year.","In our international business, revenue grew 4% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, international revenue increased 3.3%. Altogether, we have delivered another strong quarter, which reflects the strength of our value proposition and our execution. And I want to thank all of our associates for their dedication and hard work in achieving these results. I am and I hope they are proud of what they\u2019ve accomplished.","Now before I go into more details on our third quarter performance, I would like to address the recent highly publicized product recalls in mobile phones and appliances. As you would expect, it did have a negative impact on the third quarter, particularly during October. We expect the magnitude of the impact to be more material in the fourth quarter, as the impact will be on the entire quarter in Q4 versus only a part of the quarter in Q3.","As we looked at our revenue guidance, we had to incorporate the fact that certain products will simply not be available for sale during our fourth quarter as originally planned. The expected impact of these recalls in our fourth-quarter domestic revenue is approximately $200 million. With that incorporated, we\u2019re planning to deliver comparable sales in the range of minus 1% to plus 1%. Still, we expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to increase by 6% to 9% versus last year.","Now, I\u2019d like to update you on the third quarter progress against our fiscal 2017 priorities. The first priority is to build on our industry position and multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing business. We\u2019re pleased with our progress here as we\u2019re driving growth across multiple areas of our business. In home theatre, we continued to grow sales and market share due to the strength of our Magnolia design centers, continued success of our vendor experiences and strong performance online.","We believe we have built a market-leading customer experience around home theatre and large screen TVs, based on our assortment, our merchandising, our online experience, the expertise of our in-store sales associate and of course, ability to help customers in the home. The combination of new technology and declining ASPs has been driving growth and interest in the TV category. We offer a unique experience in assortment to our customers including 4K ultra Hi-Definition televisions with high dynamic range, OLED televisions and a variety of other emerging technologies.","Also, our strategy at Best Buy is not just about selling TVs. It is about helping customers with their entertainment needs, driving growth in audio, streaming devices and other accessories, as well as delivery and installation. We are excited about the continued television product innovation being introduced to the market. And we believe advances in picture quality, content availability and smart home integration will continue to drive excitement and demand in the industry. This plays to our strengths as the technology and service leader in the category.","We also delivered revenue growth during the quarter in the mobile category. As expected, new product launches stimulated demand during the quarter. This growth was partially offset by the well publicized issues with the Samsung Note 7, which has been recalled and is no longer being produced or sold. As a result, the mobile category performed better than last year but not as strong as our expectations heading into the quarter.","Our strategy to win in this category is, in part, focus on our ability to be an advocated for every phone owner. Our Blue Shirts have the tools and training to analyze customers\u2019 current phone plans and their actual needs and then recommend the right plan at the right cost. We can also recommend hardware upgrades, add family members to existing plans, and create entirely new family plans. Using these tools, we have found that at least 50% of customers are able to save money on their monthly mobile plan.","Also we\u2019ve increased our AT&T and Verizon stores within the store to 426 from 247 at the end of last year. In support of our strategy, these vendor experiences feature highly trained specialists who provide access to the carrier\u2019s products, services and detailed customer information, and the ability to learn about a wide set of connected or smart devices. We also drove growth in several emerging product categories. We are as excited as ever about the role that technology can play in people\u2019s lives, and the opportunity this creates for us.","Emerging categories are gaining traction in part due to our ability to physically showcase products and offer expert help to customers. In connected home, we\u2019re seeing strengths in home automation including security, lighting, and video monitoring. Drones are also becoming a more meaningful part of the business and virtual reality products hit all of our stores during the third quarter with new, dedicated virtual reality departments in more than 700 stores.","These new departments will offer demonstrations, virtual reality products, PC gaming devices and accessories. Since we first began offering install demos, customers have experienced approximately 300,000 virtual reality demos at Best Buy.","In appliances, we leverage our 203 specific kitchen and home stores within the store and ongoing market share gains to deliver our 24th consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth. We reported 3% comparable sales growth this quarter on top of 16.4% in Q3 of last year. Our growth decelerated late in the quarter due in part to product recalls and shipping delays that resulted in constrained inventory with key vendors.","In services as expected, our comparable sales trend improved significantly in the third quarter as we began to lap the pricing investments made last year and we are seeing higher attach rates and revenue growth from new products we introduced. In addition, we continue to drive improvements in our service quality and increased our net promoter score. We expect comparable sales in our services business to be slightly positive in the fourth quarter.","Turning to our digital channel. We delivered our third consecutive quarter of 24% domestic online sales growth. This growth was driven by increased traffic and the cumulative benefit of our investments over the past few years in the digital customer experience and enhanced dot-com capabilities. We continue to refine our search, research, and checkout capabilities with a focus on streamlining the customer experience across all channels.","For example, a new feature that can filter product search results by local store availability is resonating with customers as it makes their shopping journey a little easier. In addition to help customers after their purchase, we\u2019re piloting product support pages, which provide customers information about the products they\u2019ve purchased including transaction details, product specs, Geek Squad plans and quick access to expert help.","We also launched a pilot in the Best Buy mobile app that allows customers to book 30 minute in-person appointments to consult with Blue Shirt experts. In our physical stores, we\u2019ve continued the momentum from the investments we\u2019ve made in training and coaching from the reduced employee turnover that we discussed last quarter. Heading into the holiday season and the fourth quarter, we have armed an increasing number of associates with tablets that allow them to look at product and customer information and transact. Also, we invested additional labor around key holiday product categories where customers need more help and in the fast growing in-store pick up area.","In our international business, we recorded strong top and bottom line results in both Canada and Mexico. In Canada, we are seeing positive early results from the new store redesigns we have developed in partnership with key vendors. And we are also pleased with the growth of our services business there and excited by the lessons we are learning as a result.","I\u2019ll now turn to our second fiscal 2017 priority, which is to reduce cost and drive efficiencies throughout the business. As it relates to our Renew Blue Phase 2 target of $400 million by the end of fiscal 2018, we achieved another $50 million in the third quarter. This brings our current total to $300 million in annualized cost reductions and gross profit optimization. As a result of our successful focus on driving out cost, we are able this year to improve the customer experience while maintaining flat SG&A.","Our third fiscal 2017 priority is to advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation. We intend to be the company that makes it easy for customers to learn about and enjoy the latest technology as they pursue their passions and take care of what is important to them in their lives. With our combination of digital, store, and in-home assets, we believe we have a great opportunity to address key customer pin points, build stronger ongoing relationships with our customers, and unleash growth opportunities.","As we\u2019ve stated before, fiscal 2017 is a year of exploration and experimentation. And we are testing several concepts across \u2013 around the country that have the potential to be compelling customer experiences. Based on early results, we\u2019ve expanded both the in-home advisor program and the Geek Squad on-demand pilots to additional markets. The in-home advisor program pilot involves a free in-home consultation with an experienced technology advisor who can identify our customers\u2019 needs, design a personalized solution and become a personal resource over time. Our Geek Squad on-demand pilots provide services to customers who need immediate technology help or advice including same day.","We also recently launched a new program called Magnolia Care to provide ongoing support and troubleshooting for the comprehensive custom home theatre solutions we provide to our Magnolia Design Center clients. Also in Canada, we\u2019re testing a new service called Geek Squad Home Membership that provides support for all of the technology products that customer may own regardless of whether they were bought at Best Buy. On the connected home front, we are testing different merchandising concepts like creating displays with actual front door experiences to demonstrate front door security solutions.","So in summary, we are excited by the continued industry product innovation we\u2019re seeing, the role we play for customers, the growth opportunities in front of us, the quality of our execution, and the strengths of our financial performance. Looking ahead, our teams are ready to execute our plan for the holiday season. As our marketing tagline, Holiday Gifting Made Easy, states, our goal is to make holiday shopping effortless for customers. To win holiday and deliver on this promise, we have created an exciting assortment of great and competitively priced products, and we have mobilized our assets, including our leading-edge digital capabilities, fast and free shipping across the entire site during holiday, and of course our knowledgeable Blue Shirts and Geek Squad agents who are here to provide compelling in-store experiences and in-home services.","And so in closing, I\u2019d like to thank all of our associates and their families for everything they will do this holiday to delight our customers. I say to our associates, you are Best Buy, and I appreciate you very, very much.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our CFO, Corie Barry.","Corie Barry","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about third quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Enterprise revenue of $8.95 billion exceeded our expectations, driven by out-performance in the domestic and international businesses. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 also exceeded our expectations, primarily due to higher gross profit rates in both businesses and lower than expected SG&A in the domestic business.","I will now talk about our third quarter results versus last year. On a constant currency basis, enterprise revenue increased 1.5% to $8.95 billion, primarily due to comparable sales growth in the domestic business and the continuation of the strong performance we\u2019ve seen in international throughout this year. On a reported basis, enterprise revenue increased 1.4%, reflecting approximately 10 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.21 or 51% to $0.62. This increase was primarily driven by one, a higher gross profit rate and the flow through of higher revenue in the domestic business; two, a $0.05 per share benefit from the net share count change; and three, Canada, which as of the end of Q3 has now lapped the disruptive impact from the brand consolidation last year.","In our domestic segment, revenue increased a greater than expected 1.3% to $8.2 billion. This increase was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 1.8%, which was partially offset by the loss of revenue from 14 large formats and 23 Best Buy mobile store closures. Industry sales in the NPD-tracked categories, which don\u2019t include categories such as mobile phones and appliances, declined 3.1%.","From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in home theatre, mobile phone, wearables, and connected home was partially offset by declines in gaming. In services, the comparable revenue decline of 1.8% moderated as expected as we have now lapped the investments in services pricing from last September. This decline in services revenue during the quarter was entirely due to the ongoing reduction of repair revenue driven primarily by lower frequency of claims on extended warranties. Domestic online revenue of $881 million increased 24.1% on a comparable basis primarily due to increased traffic, higher average order values, and higher conversion rates.","As a percentage of total domestic revenue, online revenue increased 200 basis points to 10.8% versus 8.8% last year. In our international segment on a constant currency basis, revenue increased 4% to $753 million driven by growth in both Canada and Mexico. On a reported basis, international revenue increased 3.3% reflecting approximately 70 basis points of negative foreign currency impact.","Turning now to gross profit. The enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 70 basis points to 24.6%. The domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 60 basis points due to improved margin rates in the computing and home theatre categories, which were partially offset by the mobile category.","Unlike Q2 of this year, we did not see year-over-year pressure on our gross profit rate from the investments in services pricing or a periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio. The international non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 190 basis points to 24.3% driven by a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada due to a more favorable product mix and lapping the disruption and corresponding increased promotional activity last year related to the brand consolidation.","Now turning to SG&A, enterprise level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.88 billion or 21% of revenue, an increase of $18 million; however, the enterprise revenue increase resulted in leverage of 10 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.71 billion or 20.9% of revenue, an increase of $20 million. This increase was primarily driven by the timing of previously outlined investments.","International non-GAAP SG&A was $169 million or 22.4% of revenue, a decline of $2 million driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. The 110 basis points of SG&A rate decline were driven by sales leverage. In the third quarter, we returned $290 million in cash to our shareholders, $201 million through share repurchases and $89 million in regular dividends. This brings our year-to-date total cash return to over $931 million.","I would now like to talk about our fourth quarter guidance. For the fourth quarter, as we execute our holiday plans, which includes a disciplined promotional strategy, we expected to deliver non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.62 to $1.67 compared to $1.53 last year. This outlook assumes a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 315 million and a non-GAAP effective income tax rate in the range of 35% to 35.5%.","Note that our revenue and EPS expectations include approximately $30 million or $0.06 of net negative impact from the lapping of the periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio that we received in the fourth quarter of last year. From a revenue standpoint, we are excited by the rate of technology innovation, the quality of our assortment, and our ability to execute.","As Hubert said earlier, we also need to factor in our projections the impact of recent product recalls that happened in the last few months, and that certain products will simply not be available for sale during our fourth quarter as originally expected. The impact of the recalls on Q4 is expected to be approximately $200 million.","With this incorporated, our enterprise revenue expectation is $13.4 billion to $13.6 billion. Underlying our enterprise performance is domestic comparable sales in the range of negative 1% to positive 1% and international comparable sales in the range of negative 2% to positive 2%.","Lastly, I want to take one final opportunity to remind everyone that as we announced earlier this year, we will no longer be doing a holiday sales release in early January due to the growing importance of that month to our Q4 financial results. We look forward to talking to you in February on our Q4 call.","I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Matthew McClintock. Please go ahead.","Matthew McClintock","Hi, yes. Great quarter, everyone. Congratulations.","Hubert Joly","Thank you.","Matthew McClintock","I was [indiscernible] be for a second. Home theatre outstanding results during the quarter, seems like there\u2019s been a proliferation of 4K TV skews and maybe lower demographic channels or lower price point channels, the value channel. And I was just wondering, how do you see the competitive dynamics of 4K TVs playing out especially as we enter the peak holiday season this year, thank you.","Hubert Joly","Thank you for your question, Matt. So the TV category is playing out pretty much as we expected. There is indeed a reduction of ASPs and the combination of reduced ASPs and great product is stimulating unit demand and in that context, I don\u2019t want to talk so much about the competitors, but I can talk about us. The customer experience we provide combination of assortment, merchandising, the online experience and experience in the stores, our service capabilities is allowing us to continue to gain market share. These market share gains have slightly moderated, because it doesn\u2019t continue forever but we\u2019ve built a capability that\u2019s quite unique.","The other thing that we want to highlight and we\u2019ve talked about it on previous calls, the cycle of this time is different from the time where TVs went to digital and it was a much more contained cycle. We see continued product innovation today and coming in the future and this continued product innovation allows us to appeal to the type of customers that we appeal to which are in part the leading edge and early adopters, provide this great experience and allows us to stay ahead of the game.","So we aren\u2019t surrendering by any stretch of the imagination. I think there\u2019s been some words around us we\u2019re \u2013 in the game to win and we\u2019re very proud of the capabilities we have.","Corie Barry","And Matt, I would just add as you can hear in our prepared remarks, it\u2019s not just about the 4K cycle but because we supply solutions and the more full experience particularly in some of the vendor experience shops, we also see a very nice halo to the accessories like streaming devices like audio, within the category as well.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Scott Mushkin. Please go ahead. Mr. Mushkin, please check the mute function on your phone.","Scott Mushkin","Hey guys, sorry about that. The mute button on. And thanks for taking my questions. So I guess first kind of housekeeping item. The loss of $200 million in revenues is that about a nickel to EPS as we look at the fourth quarter is that a good approximation?","Corie Barry","Yes. We are not going to translate it all the way down into profit at this point. So\u2026","Scott Mushkin","Okay. And then the second question not housekeeping is just because what Corie was talking about a little bit in the efforts in 2017. You guys are now starting to see comp accelerate a little bit. Are we \u2013 are you going to be able to outside of what you think like TV cycles and other things maintain a better comp stance given I\u2019m talking over multi-quarter year type of look given some of the changes you\u2019re bringing to the business? Is that kind of the goal here as you look out 2017 and 2018?","Hubert Joly","Yes. Thank you, Scott. Clearly today we aren\u2019t providing any guidance for next year or the following year. But as you have heard us talk about, one of our key priorities this year is to find ways to accelerate our growth. We believe that from the standpoint of all of the stakeholders including our shareholders, if we are able to accelerate our growth in a profitable way, this creates a different outcome. And we believe that we are in an opportunity rich environment by focusing on the underlying needs of our customers and creating this better customer experiences and providing solutions and services to them, we do believe we have opportunities.","We\u2019re taking the time to explore and experiment this year, we\u2019ve shared with you a few of the things we are exploring but I have no doubt, a key area of focus for our Management team and all of our associates every day is to grow the Company. So without providing any guidance I can share with you that we\u2019re very focused on that while continuing to drive efficiencies to drive the investments in the future. So no guidance but a very clear focus as we look ahead, as we discussed, as we are beginning this year.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Mike Baker. Please go ahead.","Mike Baker","Thanks. Just a couple on the mobile category. First, so as it relates to the recall, what you typically \u2013 what have you seen this quarter and what do you think you\u2019ll see? Do people just hold off on buying if they were interested Samsung, do they just hold off and buying a phone or do they replace it with another phone and then related to that it seems like you got a bump from the iPhone 7 launch. Typically how long does the bump from a new successful iPhone launch last? Is that a couple quarters? Is that into next year until you lap it? Thanks.","Hubert Joly","Yes, thank you for your question. So on the Note 7, it\u2019s early to say. We do see a fair bit of brands and Operating Systems and size loyalty and so the customers are not rushing to buy something else at this point in time so we\u2019ll see how it evolves during the quarter but this is a pretty much hold your breath kind of a situation for many of these customers, you want to take the iPhone 7, Corie?","Corie Barry","Yes, on the iPhone, we are actually seeing a pretty much just in line with what our expectations were. If you recall we kind of said we didn\u2019t think it would be quite the bang of an iPhone 6 nor quite the slowness that we saw last year somewhere in between and that\u2019s a little bit of what we are seeing. To your question about how long does the trend last it\u2019s a little tricky, remember we talked a bit about single skew and the ability to buy the phone across multiple carriers that means we add a better supply of inventory, add more inventory that is available for customers, so that means quicker sell through early on.","And so we\u2019re watching it now to look at the trends that implies going out. We like where the trends are holding up right now and typically as we watch the cycle it obviously tails as you go through the year, but it usually when people want the phone it\u2019s a cycle that continues. So again, we are not going to quite provide guidance into next year, but it tends to be a cycle that continues over time as people replace their phones.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Horvers. Please go ahead.","Chris Horvers","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to follow-up on the product recall and availability issues that you mentioned. Can you frame out what you thought the revenue impact was to the third quarter? Is it all Samsung and is it all mobile and appliances and then following up on the earlier question, it sounds like you\u2019re saying there\u2019s very little substitution across brands, which if something breaks particularly on the appliance side, the rule of thumb is that two-thirds of demand is sort of failure or repair driven. So just trying to frame out the components how much it impact third quarter, what\u2019s your estimate between mobile and appliances and then thinking about the substitution aspect.","Corie Barry","Yes. So in the third quarter like we said the impact was a little bit less materially less than what we\u2019re seeing in Q4. We thought the total amount of the impact was probably around $60 million that was heavily weighted toward mobile, much lighter on the appliance side of things. To your question about you kind of elaborate on the replacement cycle, Hubert had started on it. The truth is yes, there is definitely a repair aspect, but the phone still can be repaired. And if you are quite loyal to both the Operating System and the size of your phone, which we are seeing people be loyal to then you might be more willing to go through some of the repair work and wait for whatever else might be coming.","So we actually are seeing a ton of people move into other devises. It seems like people are pretty loyal to that combination of Operating System and size that\u2019s offered and was offered by the Note.","Hubert Joly","In case to elaborate, as Corie said the vast majority is on sounds to your question about appliances, people replacing the product after a failure, you are absolutely right on that front that the percentage of the missed sales is quite, is relatively small in appliances. Okay.","Chris Horvers","Understood. And then so maybe just following up on the appliances comp in the third quarter, the growth rate has decelerated pretty sharply and listening to Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s this week they both had very good quarters in appliances. So are you more heavily weighted to brands that were dislocated because the shipping issues or is there pressure coming in from J.C. Penney, how would we think about your market share trends there? Thank you.","Hubert Joly","Yes, thank you. The latest data we have from a market share standpoint go to September. So we don\u2019t have October. As of September based on the data we have \u2013 we continue to gain market share materially. And yes, we are more weighted towards the Korean brands in appliances.","Chris Horvers","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Simeon Gutman. Please go ahead.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks, good morning. Hubert, going back to I think it was the first question on the TVs, can you share with us what you are anything directional on your premium versus non-premium business, because I think the battle is being waged maybe on the non-premium side. So if you can give us context of where your business sits and how is that evolving? Is the business mix evolving more towards or less from premium? And then just as part of that can you also talk about computers? I don\u2019t think it was called out maybe I missed it in the remarks, but there was a resurgence. I\u2019m curious how that\u2019s going, it\u2019s a pretty big category and curious how you think about it into the fourth quarter?","Hubert Joly","Yes. Thank you, Simeon. So on TVs, if you breakdown the industry in our business by TV size, you\u2019ll see a very different picture and this is an important point to highlight because it\u2019s not just about 4K\u2019s and OLED TVs it\u2019s very much about large screen TVs. And the customer demand is gravitating of course towards the larger screen TVs and the competitive landscape is different by TV size. So our customers and the experience we provide allows us to gravitate towards the higher \u2013 the larger screens and more fully featured TVs and not just 4K\u2019s, again this new innovation with HDR and OLED, so that is playing to our strength, so that dynamic is helping us, okay.","And in a sense we also create \u2013 helping to create the dynamics is our merchandising efforts, our online efforts, our in-store efforts is allowing us to create that excitement about this more fully featured larger screen TVs. I think computing remains very important strength for us and this is another case where the industry is now doing great frankly from a top line standpoint. And combination of the assortments the creation of a premium more fully featured exclusive assortment on the Windows side and our strong presence with Apple, the great experience in the stores in partnership with our key vendors has really made us a great destination, great customer experience, great market share and evolution of the market.","So this is a case where in partnership with our vendors and everything we can do we are helping to drive the market and a better outcome. So these are exciting categories. And looking at Q4, from a demand standpoint, there\u2019s potential excitement with both existing categories and then of course these new emerging categories because of course there\u2019s ways of growth and there is indeed this year quite a bit of innovation.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Greg Melich. Please go ahead.","Greg Melich","Hi, thanks. Congrats on a great quarter.","Hubert Joly","Thank you, Greg.","Greg Melich","I guess I had two questions. One I would just start with, the last few questions were all about how you guys are really winning with more premium product and the whole experience and offering. And so I guess I\u2019d ask the question from a different way, which is if you were to look at the whole store in that 1.8 comp, if you could help us get a sense of how much of that is transaction count growth versus an ability to expand the basket or the ticket with customers by selling them a whole home theatre as opposed to just a TV and then I had a follow-up.","Corie Barry","Yes, so on that one, I think when we look at the store what we\u2019re most pleased with is our ability to offer the more premium products and the bigger solutions and the other products that go with it. Obviously from a traffic perspective, we\u2019ve continued to see consistent performance in the stores with obviously a traffic pick up online. And so where we are seeing a lot of the benefit in the store side is definitely around that ability to provide the more premium product and then that product surrounded by a much more fulsome experience that\u2019s really supported by some of that expertise that we\u2019ve been talking about in our stores.","Greg Melich","So I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like traffic trends to the store are unchanged, but the improvement has been once you get someone there you\u2019re selling them a fuller package and then online growth as well helping that?","Hubert Joly","And of course Greg, online we do have a traffic growth 24% is very robust. And yes, the trends you\u2019re highlighting are very much in line with our strategy and focus of our teams. We have such a rich set of opportunities to provide solutions to our customers, once they are in a stores, we need to take care of their needs and it\u2019s both the basket that\u2019s an opportunity, but also the share of wallet I think that\u2019s building these relationship with their customers helping them over time and becoming a resourceful is another set of opportunities. So these are very exciting opportunities ahead of us.","Greg Melich","Yes. Maybe Corie, you mentioned something how the markets changed, now you saw more people getting streaming and audio systems attached. Are there any metrics you can provide of that versus like five years ago, where I don\u2019t know a third of TVs have a surround sound and it used to be 20% or anything?","Corie Barry","I\u2019m probably not going to provide metrics at this point. But suffice it to say, I mean, obviously when you think about five years ago streaming was a little baby and it\u2019s come a long ways since then and obviously as the TV has gotten thinner you have absolutely zero sound quality associated with those TV is not there but it\u2019s difficult for you to get any sound out of a very, very beautiful thin, lightly bazel panel. And so I think it\u2019s the evolution of technologies naturally lended itself to adding in some of these other experiences.","I mean, obviously we don\u2019t want anyone to go home and not love their home theatre system. And so we\u2019re trying to find ways to make sure they understand up front, look you may not feel like you\u2019re getting the full experience when you get home without something to help you on the audio side. So I think that it\u2019s not only what we are doing, it also, you kind of are watching technology trends that lend themselves [indiscernible] this continued evolution that lends itself to a more complete experience.","Greg Melich","And then just on the guidance, just to make sure I\u2019m backing it right, gross margins are expected to be down just a little bit in the fourth quarter, if I\u2019ve put in everything?","Corie Barry","No, actually I\u2019d say probably something that looks more like flattish to up maybe to fittest.","Greg Melich","Okay. Thanks a lot. Good luck.","Hubert Joly","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","And we will take our next question from David Schick. Please go ahead.","David Schick","Hi. Add my congratulations, not only on the results but on the engagement level in stores, the energy level, I know we\u2019ve talked about it before, but in the retail industry it\u2019s exciting to see it in the stores.","Hubert Joly","Thank you so much David. Goes to our heart, thank you.","Corie Barry","Thank you.","David Schick","My question is this, so the share gains have continued and compounded. And as you say, at some point they can\u2019t keep accelerating but they can stay there to some extent. I guess, how does the compounding really of the conversation or the work with the vendors go? So I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t talk specifics, but as you\u2019ve become more and more important in the way that they develop new products, that they introduce new products, that they talk to customers, I mean, how is the conversation different with the vendors than maybe broadly than 18 months ago or 36 months ago? I think that would be helpful to think about the evolution of the sector.","Hubert Joly","Yes. Thank you, David. Clearly these vendor partnerships partnering with our key vendors has been a big part of the story of Best Buy forever, but certainly in the last four years. If anything we\u2019re deepening these partnerships, as we focus on solving problems for customers and providing solutions, we are adding a services dimension to these discussions. So that we can provide an end-to-end seamless experience and support to customers. So that\u2019s an area we are exploring this, I can talk about specifics here because we\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s an infomercial opportunity and we are a service provider \u2013 authorized service provider and we have a pilot with Samsung on in store repair for the phones and the tablets.","And so again providing \u2013 if you have a Samsung product we\u2019re the only place where you can actually go to get this and of course Apple has go their own stores, but we have a very significant footprint. Also collaboration upstream in product design is something that is a great capability that we have and we are able to work with some key vendors upstream together create a winning strategy for our coming customers. And so being a player, in the North American market is such an important market for these vendors and Best Buy being a leading edge player in that creates a unique opportunity to create something very compelling for customers so these are some of the developments and as you can see they are pretty exciting.","Corie Barry","I think one just last piece I\u2019d add is you continue to see especially in the emerging categories our ability to showcase experiences. We talked about VR and the 300,000 visits to experience VR. We\u2019ve talked about kind of our working on creating some of those Connected Home Solutions you can actually experience what those things do for you. I think that\u2019s where you continue to see our vendor partners interested and what we provide uniquely in our stores.","David Schick","Thank you, so much.","Corie Barry","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Peter Keith. Please go ahead.","Peter Keith","Hey, thanks a lot and great quarter.","Corie Barry","Thank you.","Peter Keith","Corie, hoping you could comment a little bit on the gross margin drivers for Q3? With better margins in home theatre and computing, I\u2019m guessing some of that is better attach. But could you maybe give us little more specifics? And is that a dynamic that you think can carry forward into the next couple of quarters?","Corie Barry","Yes, so let\u2019s talk about gross profit a little bit. So what we saw in both home theatre and computing is really reflective of a little bit of what Hubert hit on, which is around kind of our mix, our assortment, our merchandising strategies and then absolutely to the last part of your question, some of that ability to have the basket due to the sales expertise that we have in our stores.","Additionally, we talked about our ability to take out cost especially around some of our reverse logistics and we\u2019re also seeing some of that benefit our profit rates there. That however, was also offset by a little bit of a decline in the mobile category where we also have some mix challenges there.","The other thing that I would note is as you compare to the second quarter and you think sequentially about what\u2019s happened in profit, we did not see material pressure from the investments in services pricing or the periodic profit share benefit. And so you kind of took those pressures away and then saw this bit better results around some of that mix and assortment. And it was very helpful to our overall margin rate.","And then in terms of your question about do we see some of this going forward. That obviously, we have confidence in our expertise and our strategies and merchandising elements. I always, I\u2019m thoughtful around Q4 which is such a very different competitive quarter than the rest of the year. And so the guidance that we are giving you incorporates where we think we\u2019re positioned to provide the very best value and very best experiences to our customers. And then also obviously Q4 you have to take into account what I hit on before which is the 25 basis points of pressure from that periodic profit share lapping from last year.","Peter Keith","Okay. Thank you very much and good luck with the holiday.","Corie Barry","Thank you.","Hubert Joly","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Brian Nagel. Please go ahead.","Brian Nagel","Hi, good morning.","Hubert Joly","Good morning.","Brian Nagel","Very nice quarter, congratulations.","Hubert Joly","Thank you, Brian.","Corie Barry","Thank you.","Brian Nagel","So the question I wanted to ask just on the holiday. In your comments here, I think it\u2019s fair to say you sound pretty constructive as we head into this holiday season. The questions I have and I\u2019ll lump them together, to what extent \u2013 as you look at either your promotional plans or maybe what you\u2019ve seen from competitors, does that seem more subdued or rational than prior years?","And then to what extent does maybe the spreading out, the de-emphasizing of Black Friday help to give you confidence that we lower the risk of maybe some irrational behavior out there? Then the final question with that, is there a product \u2013 I know we talked a lot about TVs and other categories, but is there a product that you think will really help to drive the holiday season this year? Thanks.","Hubert Joly","Thank you, Brian for the question so is the promotional environment this year likely to be more subdued, short answer is no. I think it\u2019s always promotional and our category as we all know is used by certain player as a way to attract traffic. So there sometimes it will be aggressive promotions \u2013 often times limited quantities, but it creates, so no \u2013 we cannot see any chance from that standpoint.","Black Friday I think what until the game is played it\u2019s hard to know but we do see a combination of a bit of spreading out but also peaks and valleys being higher and steeper as the consumer has been trained to shop when the prices are more promotional, so I don\u2019t think that there is a material chance here.","From a product standpoint, I think what\u2019s exciting this year is that there\u2019s a broad range of exciting categories across what I would characterize as some of our more traditional product categories like for example, TVs and computing the new TVs are just extraordinary and computing our teams have done a great job as well as these emerging categories, so around connected home, around wearable, around drones, around virtual reality, there\u2019s many reasons to come and check our products.","Portable audio, there\u2019s also headphones. There\u2019s some really cool new headphones. I\u2019m personally so excited about my personal holiday shopping. I have to disclose I\u2019m going to buy a new drone. I bought one last year but I\u2019m going to buy a new one. This is exciting.","Brian Nagel","Well thank you and congrats again.","Hubert Joly","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli. Please go ahead.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning, guys. Hopefully a quick housekeeping item here. Corie, did you guys see an improvement in merchandise margins? And then secondly, can you guys talk about the In-Home Advisor test a little bit more? How far has that been rolled out in your testing? And is there any color that you can potentially provide us regarding kind of take a perspective in terms of the performance there. Thanks.","Corie Barry","So from that \u2013 what you refer to as merchandising margins perspective, obviously I think you can tell based on my comments around some of the assortment in the mix and driving in computing and home theatre. Yes, that is part of where we saw some of the improvement. To your question about in-home advisor, I\u2019ll give a little color and if Hubert would like to add any, he\u2019s more than welcome. So obviously we noted that we\u2019re at least rolling out to one more market. It\u2019s still very early and a test like this obviously it takes time not just from an understanding results perspective, but also just from a learning for us expertise training and ensuring we have seamless hand off between our stores and the in-home experience.","And so we are really working hard to ensure that we understand all those operational components. We like the experiences we\u2019re learning about in the home. It reinforces I think for us this idea that there\u2019s a lot of technology. It continues to evolve very rapidly, but there is confusion once people have it in their homes in terms of not just how to use it, this isn\u2019t just about broken, it\u2019s also about how do I do the most with it and actually understand how to take it to the next level and then when I\u2019m comfortable doing the most with it, I\u2019m often more likely to investigate and play with more things in my home.","So we like the things that we\u2019re learning. You can tell we\u2019re taking a very measured approach to making sure that if we\u2019re going to do this we do it right and we have a lot of confidence in the value prop. That being said at this point, the teams are incredibly focused on delivering holiday and all of the intricacies that go with that. And so we\u2019ll continue to learn and then we\u2019ll obviously update you as we head into next year.","Scot Ciccarelli","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from David Magee. Please go ahead.","David Magee","Yes, hi, good morning and great quarter.","Corie Barry","Thank you.","David Magee","Actually a related question to Scot\u2019s, on the Geek Squad with all of the moving parts there lapping the price cuts and these new programs, anything you see there that changes your opinion about the ultimate potential of that business over the next several years?","Hubert Joly","Yes. Thank you, David. We continue to be excited about the opportunities for a couple of reasons. One is there\u2019s a need of customers for support and again it\u2019s evolving towards maybe less break fix and more support and more help. And two, traditionally, we\u2019ve been focused on selling services at the point of sale as an attach and we see the opportunity to help customers at their point of need. So that\u2019s where Geek Squad on-demand is an opportunity. And if you do the math given our product market share and our percentage of attach, the bulk of the market is something that historically we had not addressed and we\u2019re seeing some exciting green shoots, and experiments. We talked a bit on the call about Canada. We are talking about Magnolia Care.","So this is hard work because it\u2019s building a new business in a sense of reinventing an existing business, but we continue to be excited by the opportunity and very focused on doing what it takes creating the right products, service offerings, also the processes to deliver, the capabilities, and then the go to market. So this is going to be, this is going to take time, but we continue to be excited about this.","David Magee","Thank you, Hubert. And then just a real quick, on the appliance side, are you seeing your customers embrace connected appliances at this point?","Hubert Joly","Yes. This is very early days around that. So it\u2019s good that there\u2019s innovation and people learn from that and so forth. It is not a primary driver of purchase decision for the bulk of the market at this point.","David Magee","Thank you.","Hubert Joly","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our last question from Dan Wewer. Please go ahead.","Dan Wewer","Thanks. You noted that we have anniversaried the disruption from future shops, restructuring. I wanted to follow-up on that. Where do we stand on rolling out the major appliance departments into the Best Buy stores in Canada? And do you anticipate that once you add a major appliance department, it can grow to 9% of store revenues as it does in the U.S.?","Hubert Joly","Okay. So thank you, Dan. So in international, you\u2019ve seen the numbers. There\u2019s quite a bit of momentum there. In Canada specifically, we\u2019ve mentioned in the prepared remarks that the new prototype stores that we\u2019ve developed in partnership with the vendors are performing very promising and so there will be more on that. Appliances is the other opportunity. So when we deploy these new prototype stores, it does include an appliance department and then we also in the process of we\u2019ve begun the process of deploying appliances in the other store.","We don\u2019t have a forecast at this point in terms of the percentage of the business. It\u2019s well represented and of course bear in mind that whatever space we allocate to appliance will cannibalize other product categories, but there\u2019s no doubt that this is an opportunity \u2013 a significant opportunity for us, the same view that we have in the U.S. about the opportunity for us exists in Canada. So it\u2019s going to take time to roll this out and we\u2019ll take some investments, but we\u2019re quite excited about it and so more to come on that.","Dan Wewer","If I could just follow-up, once you complete these investments in Canada, can the operating margin rate be equivalent to that in the U.S.?","Hubert Joly","Again, no specific guidance but conceptually and bear in mind that international is not just about Canada. So don\u2019t directly apply this to your model. But conceptually, certainly is President of Canada is on the phone and listening, Ron Wilson, there\u2019s no reason for Ron not to be able to perform to that same level all the time and it\u2019s going to take time. And I have to congratulate our Canadian team they have done a remarkable job going through that brand consolidation. And then using that as a springboard to move forward, I was with all of their store general managers last month and there is definite momentum here. We have a great team. And so it\u2019s very exciting and we\u2019ll see how quickly they can go through higher levels of margin. So if he\u2019s not on the call, I\u2019ll certainly relay your question to him.","Dan Wewer","Okay.","Hubert Joly","Thank you.","Dan Wewer","Thank you.","Hubert Joly","Thank you. In closing, I\u2019d like to do three things. One is, wish every one of you and your family on the call a wonderful holiday season. Number two, I would say that I hope you will give us the opportunity to help you with your holiday shopping this season. And we look forward to serving you either online or in the stores or in your home. And then number three, I\u2019d like to really thank you for your attention and your support throughout the year and hopefully going forward. So thank you. Have a great holiday season. Thank you so much.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s call. You may disconnect at any time and have a wonderful day."],"3578":["Best Buy Co, Inc.

Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our Chairman and CEO and Corie Barry, our CFO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are meaningful can be found in this morning's earning release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com.","Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.","I will now turn the call over to Hubert.","Hubert Joly ","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will begin today with a review of our first quarter performance and then provide an update on our progress against our fiscal 2019 priorities as we continue to implement Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue strategy. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results in our outlook. ","So, today we are reporting the first quarter Enterprise comparable sales growth of 7.1% and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.82, which is up 37% compared to last year. This strong performance was broad based, with positive comparable sales across all channels, geographies on most of our product categories. The top line strength is a result of three main factors. Continued healthy consumer confidence, product innovation in multiple areas of technology, and our unique value proposition resonating with customers. We are executing well, and customers are responding positively to the unique experience we provide to them online, in stores and their homes. This is of course tied to our continued investments in the customer experience. And so, I want to thank all of our associates for their commitment to our company's purpose to enrich lives through technology and their continued great leadership and execution. ","Now we only had a strong first quarter we also continue to make significant progress in the implementation of our strategy. As I mentioned, our purpose as a company is clear. It is to enrich lives through technology. We aim to do this by addressing key human needs in areas such as entertainment, productivity, communication, food preparation, security and health and wellness. ","To fulfill our purpose and grow the company, we're focused on expanding what we sell and evolving how we sell and building the related key enablers while continuing to take cost out. I'd like to share a few examples of how we're making progress beginning with expanding what we sell. The first two examples illustrate how we are leveraging our unique assets to help leading technology companies commercialize their new products. We've recently announced a partnership with Amazon that leverages our product expertise as well as our merchandizing, marketing and sales know how. In a multi-year exclusive partnership, we're working together to bring the latest generation of Fire TV enabled SmartTVs to market. The exclusivity of our partnership extends to all SmartTVs with the Fire TV experience built in. The TV's will be available exclusive in Best Buy stores on Bestbuy.com and on Amazon.com through Best Buy as a third-party seller. We will be rolling out more than 10 models this year beginning this June. ","Our unique in store and online experience also makes us the logical partner for tech companies innovating in areas like virtual reality, which is still an emerging technology, that customers need to experience in person. And Best Buy is the only retailer where customers can demo the new Oculus Go, virtual reality headset from Facebook, which is now available in more than 700 stores and on bestbuy.com. ","Now in addition to products, we also have some very exciting services initiatives focused on expanding what we sell. The first initiative that I want to highlight is our Total Tech support program. We've rolled out Total Tech support nationwide earlier this week after piloting the program with more than 200,000 customers in 200 stores in some major markets. Total Tech support is a great example of Best Buy focus on helping customers get the most out of their technology well beyond the initial purchase transaction. ","For $199 per year, members get unlimited Geek Squad support online via chat, in-stores in the palm of their hands with the new Best Buy home app. All their technology is covered no matter where or when they brought it as we believe that support should not be limited to a specific product and believe that the customer need is to have all their technology work together. We're launching this program nationwide at the time we hit a highest ever NPS scores for the quality of our service delivery, setting up our members to benefit from the best Geek Squad experience we've ever delivered on all their tech. ","Tech support is a great value as members also receive free internet security software and discounts on in-home services and purchases of annual Geek Squad protection and Apple Care service plans. What is equally exciting is that the futures and capabilities provided by Total Tech support will be expanded all the time. ","The second services initiative is the health space. As we discussed at our Investor day, we are exploring the health space with a focus on older Americans. We already have sold a variety of health-related products and technology products designed for seniors, like specially design phones and medical alert systems. We are also testing a service, called Assured Living, to help the aging population stay healthy at home, with assistance from technology product and services. And we will continue to learn and we find our approach in this space. ","Now turning to evolving how we sell, we continue to improve the customer experience across all of the ways our customers interact with us. In the digital channel we are focused on streamlining the online buying process for our customers, in our stores we continue to work with our associates to develop their proficiency and their ability to deeply understand and meet customer needs and in the home channel, our in-home advisor program is ramping up well, since launching nationwide last September, we have seen strong results similar to those we saw during our pilots. At the end of the quarter, we had 380 advisors providing free in-home consultations to help customers address their needs across our full range of products and services. ","While it is very important that the customer have a great experience in their first consultation, a goal of the program is that this initial interaction is the beginning of a deeper and more relationship-based experience with Best Buy, over the long-term. And we believe the program will continue to improve and mature as our advisers are in their roles longer, master what are sophisticated skills and as we further enhance the tools and systems that help them do their jobs. ","In addition, we are using technology to bring together the advantages of our various channels in a way that is seamless and intuitive to customers. Here is an example, our customers told that it can be hard to compare products in store if you don\u2019t want to speak with our associates, so we\u2019ve recently launched a new app feature that makes it easy for customers to use their mobile phone to compare products when shopping in a store. We have the scan to compare feature, customers can use their app to scan the QR code of up to three products and then see the comparison of the specs and features of the products on their phone to help them research and determine which product best meets their needs. ","Now getting across all of this, is how we are evolving as a Company and as a brand, for the last several years with the expert service and unbeatable price tagline, we have emphasized employee expertise and price competitiveness [indiscernible] serve as well. And so, as we transitioned to building the new Blue Strategy it's now appropriate to innovate our brand identity. The functional elements of expertise and price of course are important but it is not the whole Best Buy story. So, let me explain the essence of our new brand identity. Our brand identity starts from within with our people it is about how as a company we aim to be an inspiring friend, who helps customers understand how technology can help them achieve great new things. ","It celebrates the role of our Blue Shirts by agents and all of our associates play in support of this with three key behaviors. Being Human, Make it Real and Think about Tomorrow. And our new internal and externally focused rallying cry let\u2019s talk about what's possible encapsulates this. And one thing that is exciting is that this new brand identity celebrates who we are when we are at our best. Now you may have already begun seeing the new expression of our brand on our website in our app and in marketing vehicles and we continue to roll this out gradually. ","Importantly our goal overtime is to ensure our new brand identity comes to life in everything we do. To implement our Best Buy 2020 strategy, we are investing in a range of enablers as we described at our Investor Day in September across people, technology and supply chain. We are investing in areas such as specialty labor, enterprise customer relationship management, knowledge management capabilities, the new services platform and new digital tools for sales associates to help them be more productive. ","We've also begun a multi-year transformation of our supply chain designed to expand our bandwidth for growth and speed. We invest into significantly increased automation, deals more local distribution capabilities for online orders and expand the space and improve the customer experience while growing sales of large products that must be delivered. ","To help offset our investments and pressures in the business, we continue our long-standing diligence on increasing productivity and decreasing cost. Our current productivity target established in Q2 of fiscal 2018 is $600 million in additional annualized cost reductions and gross profits optimization to be completed by the end of fiscal 2021. During the first quarter, we achieved approximately $70 million in annualized reductions bringing the cumulative total to $305 million towards our goal. ","Now another element of our Best Buy 2020 strategy that we not often talk with you about is our focus on contributing to the common good. We believe businesses that this not need to deliver value to shareholders, but also to positively impact their various stakeholders and to contribute to the common good. For us, that is tied to our purpose to enrich lives through technology. And we are particularly excited about the commitment we've made last year to help prepare 1 million underserved teams for tech relying jobs each year by 2020. One of the ways we are and will be doing this is through our growing number of think tech centers. We're looking progress and attracting a wide range of industry partners to work with us on this important effort, and we are heartened to find that companies and organizations, large and small, are eager to engage with us. ","So, in summary, we continue to believe that we are operating in an opportunity rich environment driven by technology innovation and customers need for help. We are the market share leader with the unique opportunities to expand what we sell and evolve how we sell and grow the company that customers love. We're focused on providing services and solutions that solve real customer needs and on building deeper customer relationships. We want to provide ongoing value to our customers beyond their periodic technology product purchases to inspire them with what technology can do for them and support them to make sure all their tech is working the way they want. We are excited both by our growth momentum and opportunities and we're investing in people, technology and supply chain in support of our strategy. And we believe this have the opportunity to continue to generate significant value for our shareholders.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to CFO, Corie Barry for more details on our Q1 performance and our fiscal 2019 guidance. ","Corie Barry","Good morning everyone. Before I talk about our first quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. On enterprise revenue of $9.1 billion, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.82, both of which exceeded our expectations. The higher than expected revenue occurred in most product categories with the home theater, computing and tablet category being the largest drivers. The EPS was primarily driven by better than expected performance in both the domestic and international segment. Our gross profit rate and SG&A rate were both in line with our expectation. SG&A dollars were higher than expected, primarily due to incremental incentive compensation expense for our field employees and increased variable costs associated with the higher revenue. A lower effective tax rate also provided a benefit of approximately $0.02 versus our earnings per share guidance. ","I will now talk about our first quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 6.8% to $9.1 billion primarily due to the comparable sales increase of 7.1%. I would like to add a few clarifying points on our comparable sales calculation. First, our comparable sales are computed on like-for-like fiscal week and are not shifted to more closely aligned calendar week, following last year's 53-week year. If we were to adjust our last year Q1 comparable sales to match this year calendar week, the comp would be approximately 70 basis points higher than the 7.1% we reported. ","Second, as a result of our March 1, announcement to close all our domestic Best Buy mobile stores, we excluded these stores from our Q1 fiscal 2019 comparable sales results beginning this past March. ","Lastly, in Q1 fiscal 2019, we adopted new revenue recognition guidance that will change the timing of revenue recognition and the presentation of revenue for certain items. The adoption had an immaterial impact on the company's revenue and net earnings for the quarter and had no impact on cash flows. We expect the impact to be immaterial on an ongoing basis. The comparable sales base has been adjusted to incorporate minor changes in presentation as a result of the new standard. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.22 or 37% to $0.82. This increase was primarily driven by a $0.15 per share benefit from a lower effective tax rate and a $0.07 per share benefit from the net share count change. In our domestic segment, revenue increased 6.3% to $8.4 billion. This increase was primarily driven by a comparable sales increase of 7.1% partially offset by the loss of revenue from 17 large format and 193 Best Buy mobile store closures. ","From a merchandising perspective, the company generated comparable sales growth across most of its categories with the largest drivers being mobile phones, appliances, computing, tablets, and smart home. Domestic online revenue of $1.14 billion increased 12% on a comparable basis primarily due to higher average order values and higher conversion as a percentage of total domestic revenue, online revenue increased 70 basis points to 13.6% versus 12.9% last year. ","Our online sales growth reflects multiple factors including the types of products and the needs of customers. For example, in the first quarter we lapped launches that over index to the online channel last year, but since the Nintendo Switch and the Samsung S8. Based on our data, we believe we continue to gain share online. We also continue to see our customers shopping in multiple channels as well as material increases in the number of customer choosing to pick up their online orders in stores. ","In our international segment, revenue increased 13.1% to $697 million. This was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 6.4% driven by growth in both Canada and Mexico, approximately 500 basis points of positive foreign currency impact and incremental revenue associated with six new large format store openings in Mexico over the past year. ","Turning now to gross profit. The enterprise gross profit rates decreased 40 basis points to 23.3%. The domestic gross profit rate was 23.3% versus 23.6% last year. The gross profit rate decrease of approximately 30 basis points which have been primarily by rate pressure in the mobile phone category and prior year legal settlement proceeds of $8 million or 10 basis points in the services category. These pressures were partially offset by gross profit optimization initiatives and an approximately $5 million legal settlement that occurred in the current year. The international gross profit rate decreased 110 basis points to 23.4%, primarily due to a lower year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada due to one, lower sales in the higher margin services category primarily driven by the launch of Canada's Total Tech Support offer a long term recurring revenue model; and two, margin pressure in the computing and mobile phone categories. Partially offsetting these items was a favorable legal settlement of approximately $2.8 million. ","Now turning to SG&A, enterprise non-GAAP SG&A was $1.82 billion or 20% of revenue which increased $101 million but decreased 20 basis points versus last year. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.66 billion or 19.7% of revenue versus $1.57 billion or 19.9% of revenue last year. The $86 million increase was primarily due to, gross investment which includes specialty labor and higher depreciation expense, higher variable costs due to increased revenue and higher incentive compensation. These increases were partially offset by the flow through of cost reductions and reduced advertising expense. International non-GAAP SG&A was $164 million or 23.5% of revenue versus $149 million or 24.2% or revenue last year. The $15 million increase was primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and increased depreciations. ","On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate decreased to 20% from 35.6% last year. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate as a result of tax reform and lower income tax expense associated with stock-based compensation. From a cash flow perspective, we ended the first quarter in line with our expectations. ","I would now like to talk about our Q2 and full year fiscal 2019 guidance. Our Q2 guidance reflects our expectation for continued momentum in the business as well as lapping strong comparable sales last year. It also reflects continued investments in our long-term strategy. Our second quarter outlook is the following. ","Enterprise revenue in the range of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion. Comparable sales growth of 3% to 4%. Domestic comparable sales growth of 3% to 4%. International comparable sales growth of 1% to 4%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.77 to $0.82 which is an increase of 12% to 19%. ","Our non-GAAP effective income tax rate of 25.5% to 26% and a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 285 million shares. ","Please note that our Q2 guidance assumes the following impacts. In the domestic segment, the calendar shift is estimated to benefit Q2 comparable sales by approximately 150 basis points. Increased investments in supply chain as well as higher transportation costs are expected to add approximately 25 basis points of gross profit pressure. The national rollout of the Total Tech Support is expected to add approximately 25 basis points of gross profit pressure because we incur costs as members tend to receive services and discounts immediately when they join the program, while we recognize the related revenue equally over 12 months. ","I now want to spend some time talking about our full year guidance. We're pleased with the first quarter performance and the strong start to the year. We also recognize it is early in the year and the first quarter historically has represented approximately 15% of our annual operating income. At this time, we are not updating our full year fiscal 2019 guidance provided at the start of the year. As a reminder, our full year fiscal 2019 guidance is the following; Enterprise revenue in the range of $41 billion to $42 billion, Enterprise comparable sales of flat to up 2%, non-GAAP operating income rate up approximately 4.5%, which is flat to FY 2018 rate on a 52-week basis. ","Non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $4.80 to $5, an increase of 9% to 13%. This represents an increase of 14% to 18% with compared to fiscal 2018 on a 52-week basis. A non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 25%, capital expenditures of $850 million to $900 million and finally share repurchases totaling at least $1.5 billion. ","As a reminder, there are additional assumptions in our annual guidance that I would like to call out. Our investments in particular in specialty labor, supply chain and increased depreciation related to strategic capital investments and ongoing pressures in the business, including approximately $35 million of lower profit share revenue will be partially offset by a combination of returns from new initiatives and ongoing cost reductions and efficiencies. The increased investment in supply chain as well as higher transportation costs are expected to pressure the domestic gross profit rate by approximately 25 basis points each quarter for the remainder of the year. ","The national rollout of Total Tech Support is expected to pressure the domestic gross profit rate by approximately 15 to 20 basis points, but the largest impact in our fiscal second and third quarters. We continue to expect the Best Buy mobile small format store closures that we announced last quarter will negatively impact revenue by approximately $225 million with flat to slightly positive impacts on operating income. ","Finally, our guidance reflects lower annual incentive comp expense as we reset our performance targets to align with our fiscal 2019 expectations. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question from Dan Wewer of Raymond James. Please go ahead. ","Dan Wewer","Thanks. Corie, want to follow up on your comments about Total Tech Report and margin implications. How do you see the gross margin rate evolving in the second year that a customer is in the program and also if you could discuss what type of operating expenses are associated with Total Tech Support and the implications for the operating profit rate? ","Corie Barry","Yeah, thanks Dan. As we look into the out years, second, third, further years out in the program and you start to lap some of that initial first year usage, we like what we see in some of those out years and here's what I say. If you just take one step back and I think Hubert did a nice job in his comments, talking about our purpose here is around creating more relationships with our customers and longer-term relationships with our customers. And so, both financially but more importantly in terms of our interaction with our customers as we get into those out years, it becomes less dilutive financial model for us. ","In terms of our ability to deliver and fulfill on our offer, as of right now we like the infrastructure we have in place to deliver on that. We've been testing for a while, we have a nice broad cadre of Geek Squad agents both who can help you remotely, who can help chat, who can help phone. And thus far we have a lot of the infrastructure in place to actually deliver on this offer and that hence the reason that's the combination of both the customer interaction that we really, really like and the ability to already have a lot of fulfillment infrastructure in place. As time goes on we really fundamentally believe this is the right thing to do for the business. ","Dan Wewer","And then just as a quick follow up. Inventories finished the quarter, up almost 9% per square foot year-over-year. How do you see the growth in inventory playing out for the balance of the year?","Corie Barry","Yeah. I feel very good about our inventory situations. So, I'd say a couple of things. One, big kudos to our inventory and demand planning team who have found a way to have the quality of our inventory be as good as I've ever seen in my history here. We have a less out risk inventory than we've ever had in our history so that's one important note. Two, we absolutely have built inventory in line with the sales figures that we've been seeing. And frankly it is very much reflected in our NPS results where our customers are consistently telling us one of the big drivers of that improved customer experience year-over-year is inventory availability both online and in stores. And so, I feel very good about the targeted quality of the inventory and then also the levels in support of the business we've been seeing. I think we have proven even historically that we'll ratchet it up and down as we see sales up years. But we have found that to be very much in our advantage to make sure we have the inventory there for our customers. ","Dan Wewer","Okay great. Thank you. ","Corie Barry","Thank you. ","Operator","We will now take our next question from Peter Keith of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. ","Peter Keith","Hey thanks good morning and congrats on the solid quarter. A big picture question for you Hubert, just regarding the Supreme Court case with South Dakota versus Wayfair in reference to state sales tax, I know you've had some public statements out there. It sounds like you have support of a more level of plain field. I guess I was curious to get insight and you as, if you have a sense today of what amount of industry share is non-in a tax-free environment. And then when you look at Amazon rolling out, sales tax to first party purchases, where you've seeing now market share lift in those states?","Hubert Joly ","So yes, we have very excited about the decision of the Supreme Court to take this case and to hopefully revert Quill and, indeed, establish a level of plain field. In terms of the first part of your question, there has been significant progress in the last several years in terms of pure online players collecting on their first party sales including Amazon today, based on our understanding, collects the sales tax across the country where they sales tax on their first party business. They don't in general on their third-party business or marketplace business trying to estimate this may not be very precise but maybe imagine it could be half of their business where they don\u2019t collect the sales tax. That is very meaningful and of course there is other players Wayfair is party to the lawsuits. They don't collect across the country. So, it is still a meaningful fight given the large market share that's Amazon first and third party enjoy online. ","In terms of the impact on our business, as you can imagine, on that purchases, now the average tickets in our business is now -- I mean is higher than most other categories, but it's not thousands of dollars, its say maybe around $200 or something like this, but there's some products part of our business where customers are going to pay several $100, several $1,000 in an 8%, let\u2019s say $1,000 is very meaningful. And so, when we studied in the last five years really to see states start collecting the sales tax on the first study business, it was helpful incrementally. Now as a company, we've never relied on this as a way to restore our competitiveness and move forward, but I would say incrementally positive as we -- not a game changer, but incrementally positive. That's how I would characterize it. ","Peter Keith","Okay. Thank you very much for the feedback and good luck. ","Hubert Joly ","Thank you. ","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Kate McShane of Citi. Please go ahead. ","Kate McShane","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Corie, I was wondering if you could remind us why the calendar shift is going to have that level of impact and what you're gaining in the second quarter. ","Corie Barry","Yeah. So, we are trying to get clear as we can on the calendar shift here. So, in second quarter when we adjust, we keep this year the same and we adjust last year's comp base. What that does is it takes out a week in May, the first week in May, and it brings in, a week in August, the first week in August, those August weeks are back to school weeks and heading in to football weeks. They tend to be much heavier weeks. So, you back out that lighter May week out of the base and you put in that heavier August pre-back to school week and so when you go apples to apples, then it takes that comp down for Q2. ","Q2 is the quarter with the largest week shift effect to it, as you head into the back half, it becomes much more minimal in the 50 to 70 basis point range. But this is the one where we thought it was important to be transparent you pick up a lot of extra because of the shift of the week. Does that make sense Kate? ","Kate McShane","Yes. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just a follow-up question with regards to the upside that you saw to your comp this quarter, how it compared versus your plan and how should we think about the parameters as to what could drive a higher than guided comp in Q2? ","Corie Barry","Yeah. So, in Q1, we thought a few things happen. In terms of our internal plan, I think you heard it in our prepared remarks. Our incentive comp was higher than expected, that's because even versus all of our internal plans, this was a materially better outcome than we had expected. And again, we saw strength in almost every category, which was really nice coming out of holiday. ","In terms of potential upside into Q2. So, let me take a step back. One more thing that we saw in Q1 because I think it's pertinent as you did see some pretty good overall industry health and we\u2019ve said in the prepared remarks, we continue to see consumer health, we continue to see industry health and then we like very much how we're positioned within those two things. ","And so, we saw even NPD for our categories, again, only 60% roughly of what we have. But we thought NPD up about 2.8%, because that reflects a good, healthy interest in technology. So, as we head into Q2, there's a few things that could continue to perform better than we see right now. If you continue to see even more strength In-Home theater I think depending on how the new model is hit we came out transition very cleanly, we've got a beautiful new set of TVs. You potentially could see a bit more strength there. We are expecting one of the categories that was strong. We saw in our list of categories with tablets that had a lot to do in terms of refresh of the line and some of the pens and things that came with some of these new tablets. We aren't expecting that to continue quite at the pace that we've been seeing, but if that demand continues to be very strong we might see some upside there. So, I think there is a few like the both continue to rise but we felt like given what we could see in front of us the Q2 and what we're lapping so last year we felt like the Q2 was a very reasonable guide. ","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Matt McClintock of Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Matt McClintock","Hi guys. good morning everyone. Actually, I would like to take the answer to the last question and kind of extrapolate it longer term. Hubert, you've said in your prepared remarks, product innovation in multiple areas. And I was trying to think about the broad-based innovation and strength we are seeing in the industry today and try to compare it to historical times when your business was strong just off of one specific product category whether that be tablets or televisions et cetera. Can you kind of think longer term and give us your views on how this industry, the strength that you seeing today could actually be sustainable well beyond what a typical historical product cycle has been in the past for your business. That's my first question. Thanks. ","Hubert Joly","Yeah thank you Matt. I think we had talked about this at Investor Day and have spoken about this consistently. I continue to be impressed by the magnitude and pace and breadth of technology innovation. What is unique in this era is how technology now gets embedded into more and more things light bulbs, doorbells, large appliances, small appliances. And then how all of these products are now connected, the people call this the internet of things and so forth with broader and broader applications. One thing as we've talked about is how technology can help people stay in their home for longer. And there is a lot of excitement around helping people do that and reduce, improve people health and wellness and reduce healthcare cost for the country. ","And of course, what's exciting about the future is that we are just at the beginning of this era. The penetration of these devices and the use cases are just beginning. And so, I think we are in for a -- I think predicting the future is always tricky. I can share with you what I believe and what we believe as the company is that we're in a cycle -- the only thing I want to talk about the cycle there is the ways that we'll continue to deepen and broaden. And so, I think we have this positive environment. One of the reasons we've talked about it an opportunity rich environment is because of this. The other reason is that even though we are a leader our market share across all of our categories just on hardware is going to be [15%] in our share of wallets of existing customers is only 26%. So, this gives us multiple drivers all the time to really sustain significant growth for the company. ","Matt McClintock","Thanks for the color. And then just as a follow up kind of related. Corie you did really good job of explaining the online business and the share gains that you're taking even at a reduced growth rate. I was just wondering, at this stage of evolution of where technology is today, are we seeing strength in the brick and mortar channel relative to the online channel, just because consumers are less familiar with some of this product and for earlier stages and so they need that customer service, they need to go into the store. Is that potentially the explanation for why we're seeing that type of trend? ","Corie Barry","So, I will try to separate this into a couple pieces. One, I do fundamentally believe that there is a need amongst consumers to touch, feel, make final decisions, particularly when we're talking about the price points that Hubert mentioned earlier and the technologies. So, I do believe there's a need there. I don't want to imply that, I think, all the businesses suddenly going to switch into the stores. I think what we're trying to say is, and Hubert teed it up, there is more interplay between all the channels. And I know it gets overused, but it's fundamentally true, our data shows us, we literally do not have a customer who only shops us in one channel. I mean, there might be one, but on the whole, we don't have customers that only shop us in one channel and I think, you saw in my remarks I talked about like this was very much about some specific products where we had good availability, we moved through a ton online and your lap some of that. ","It doesn't change the fundamental belief which is our customers are in multiple channels, I mean the fact that we continue to see material increases in, in-store pickups, even with all of the fulfillment options that are available to customers just as to me, people want to play amongst the channels and get things and see things and touch them in the way that they want, but I don't want to imply I think the whole world is shifting, but I think it just continues to emphasize our point of view that perfectly isolating these channels separately and talking about their growth individually is exceptionally hard to do. ","Hubert Joly ","The other thing I would add is that, getting back to the continuous product innovation, the need to integrate these products and the needs for customer help, that plays really well to our ability to have customers. Across technology and product categories and ecosystems and across multiple touch points the ability we have to have them online in the stores and then in their home these two things across product categories, ecosystems and across touch points gives us a very unique competitive advantages. So that's why you can hear and feel the excitement about the opportunities we have and of course you see the momentum that we have. ","Matt McClintock","Thanks for that. Best of luck. ","Hubert Joly ","Thank you. ","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Mike Baker of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Mike Baker","Hi, thanks. I'm going to ask two questions if I could. First, not increasing the guidance, I guess it's really in the year and a lot can happen, but, in the first quarter last year, I believe you did increase your guidance. So, I'm just wondering if there's anything more to read into the not increasing guidance here except that it's early in the quarter or earlier in the year. ","Corie Barry","Genuinely there is not more to read into. I know we did it last year, we just felt like there's so much of the year still in front of us that its specifically at only 15%. What I would say out loud is we believe right now we're trending towards the higher end of our revenue range and it was a wide range we gave this year and that's one thing we gave much wider range this year, even than we did last year. And so, we kind of like where we're headed right now, but we just want to give ourselves plenty of room as we head through the rest of year given, how much of the year there is left. ","Mike Baker","Yeah. Okay, that makes perfect sense. Second question, just on some of the costs, you talked about three things. Can you sort of give us order of magnitude between the investments presumably and things like In-Home Advisors, advisors versus higher associate pay, incentive comp. And I guess what I'm getting at is are we still in the phase in the In-Home services where you're in investment mode where you're spending upfront for revenues to hopefully eventually catch up and start to leverage that spend. ","Corie Barry","Yeah. So, to be clear we put those things in the order of size. So, investments being the largest, the variables the next piece and then the incentive comp being the smallest of those three drivers year-over-year. in terms of the investments and where we are, remember we launched the In-Home Advisors full scale in the back half of last year and actually just before holiday relatively heading into holiday. We have continued to ramp up that program since then, we right now ended the quarter with about 380 In-Home Advisors. They also ramp up performance to exactly your question as they become more educated, have a little bit more time enrolled and grow their skill base. And so, you're still absolutely seeing a little bit of a mismatch between we're investing, we're training, we're bringing new people on and their productivity is ramping overtime. And so, I think throughout still this year as we add more In-Home Advisors as they continue to gain confidence and build their book of business, we are going to continue to see that program ramp. ","Mike Baker","Okay. Thanks for the color I'll turn it over to someone else.","Corie Barry","Thank you. ","Operator","We'll take our next question from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Anthony Chukumba","Good morning. I have two questions. So, the first question the 7.1% comp store sales growth in the first quarter, when is the last time you've put up a comp like that in the first quarter. My model just doesn't go back that far. ","Corie Barry","It was a long time ago. We're just focused on moving forward Anthony. We're not going to compare it to how long it's been, but it's a long time. I could say over 10 years. ","Anthony Chukumba","Got it. Fair enough. I guess I'll go back and looking at microfiche. Second question so the services business. So, this is the second quarter in a row in that you've done a 7% comp in the services business. I know we've sort of touched on this a little bit before. But I guess I'm just trying to figure out what's driving that. Because you only have 380 in-home advisors at this point. And you just rolled up Total Tech Support. So, I'm just trying to figure out what exactly is driving the growth that we're seeing there?","Hubert Joly ","Yeah thank you Anthony. So, to be clear the scope of the slide does not include In-Home Advisors because by the way In-Home Advisors the visits are free. What it includes is the extended warranties, installation and support services. And you're right Total Tech Support is new so it's not material here. I think in general, the growth of our online business is related to of course the growth of our product business. Because a lot of it is the attached. And of course, we are setting more products so that's the first driver. And then second, I think that over the last several quarters, our teams have done an increasingly good job of selling solutions and positioning not just the hardware but also the services. So, we're seeing selectively attach rates go up and it's been helpful from that standpoint. Now of course as we move to Total Tech Support because of the revenue recognition that Corie described, you'll see some different direction as we move forward. But one of the things I'm excited about is that the services focus is increasingly becoming a core focus of the company and that's really apparent in the way we're launching Total Tech Support. It's not an extra thought, it's not, oh by the way, I need to sell this to you. This is a core element of our brand positioning and brand identity. So now to be clear, the focus of our strategy is not principally to drive services revenue, it's to build a relationship, the overall relationship with customers. So, as we move forward, you've not heard us say, the services revenue is going to be x percent of our total revenue. So, this is a component of a bigger relationship and over time we may use services as a way to broaden the relationship with customers or as a revenue driver, it's not a goal. The services P&L is not a goal in and of itself. ","Corie Barry","Anthony, just one more clarifier. I know you weren't saying this, but I just want to make sure I'm clear, on the In-Home Advisors side of things. There isn't revenue associated with in-home advisor in and of itself. Often it sells more services, what may drive more, but I just want to be clear, we don't characterize the products that are sold by in-home advisors as a services sale, that is just included in the normal product side of things. ","Anthony Chukumba","Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks guys. Keep up the good work. ","Hubert Joly ","Thank you. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Simean Gutman","Thanks. Good morning everyone, and nice quarter. I wanted to focus on margin, incremental margins, in the U.S. business sales were up like $500 million, EBIT rose, I think it was just about $5 million, so I want to talk about where the buckets that are being spent on. Is it performing as you planned, are you investing anywhere, and I think you've mentioned this in the past Corie that there's not many places you can speed up investments, so you're probably investing ratably. But just trying to think about flow through where you are in the continuum and in the context of not promising much margin upside over time, but just thinking about flow through. ","Corie Barry","Yeah. So, we -- the investments that we hit on were paced roughly how we expected them to be paced, both on the people side and on the capital side. And so I would characterize our investment profile as very much in line with what we had expected and how we had guided, there was this time around some gross profit rate pressure which we had also guided for and in fact was a little bit better than even what we had guided for meaning, it was a little less of a drain year-over-year and really that had to do with some of the evolving economics of mobile, which we've talked about quite a bit somewhat offset by some of the cost reduction. I think Q1 is continuing on the journey that we laid out, which is for the year a relatively flattish, rate on a 52 weeks basis. We're going to make these investments ratably over the year so that we can continue to ramp up some of the things we talked about like In-Home Advisors and Total Tech Support. ","We feel like it's important to get this running start early in the year and frankly I'm exceptionally proud of the teams who have even in a more rapid way than in some prior years, ramped up some of the technology build and some of the physical work in the stores even faster than we've done historically. So, I think we feel like we\u2019re right on pace with what we would expect and we feel like we're investing in the right things, we're monitoring the returns and then trust me, if they're not returning the way that we think they should be, we're going to make some different decisions. ","Simean Gutman","And if I can follow up just on the TV category, can you share with us how units are performing for you if you can disclose that, and then for ASP, I think that's, it's been an ASP increasing story. Can you share with us if that's accelerating decelerating or staying the same? ","Corie Barry","Yeah, so broadly in TVs we had better performance than we expected. We continue to see a similar theme for us which is ASPs continue to increase. And so, we we've like the positioning of the category. We saw unit growth decelerate a little bit for us in Q1, but like I said better than even our internal projections. And so, I think versus the industry there is a little bit of noise in the industry numbers because again, the 53rd week make things funky. We think we were like roughly flattish versus the industry maybe down just a little bit. But we've like the positioning, we like that we transitioned very cleanly into the new lines and we're excited with the lines that we have had into Q2. ","Simean Gutman","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","We now take our next question from David Schick of Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead, sir. ","David Schick","Hi good morning and thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to walk through the math, the recapture math on the Best Buy mobile stores that are closing. How many of those customers are you seeing back in the store, how is that going? Are you losing them -- that you would lose some -- are you losing them in any different rate than you expect. Thank you. ","Corie Barry","Yeah. So, it's obviously very early in closing all these stores. So, it's a little bit early to comment broadly on what you're seeing what the closure of this size is. We obviously have been closing some stores overtime. And so, we have a relatively good deal for recapture rates based on that. Based on those expectations so far, we're not seeing anything that will give us pause or worry that this is kind of turning out in a different way than we would have expected. But like I said it's still very early including these stores. ","David Schick","Got you. Thanks very much.","Hubert Joly ","Thank you, David. ","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. ","Brian Nagel","Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my question. ","Hubert Joly ","Good morning Brian. ","Brian Nagel","My first question is from a bigger picture perspective. You now put up your two consecutive quarters of really solid outsized sales growth. It's clearly happening as there has been a number of internal initiatives at Best Buy. But also, where you have seen sales across retail pick up as well. So, the question I have as you look at your data, you know your customers grow well. How much of what we're seeing right now from an industry demand perspective is potentially a catch up to maybe after a period of more subdued spending versus actual true demand that could prove more sustainable. ","Hubert Joly ","Yeah thank you for highlighting the last two questions. For a minute, I would like to address the last four quarters comps about 4%. There is no doubt that the consumer environment is better. And you're right, we're seeing strong numbers across many, many retailers. Of course, I think our numbers are higher than probably most retailers I would say. In our case, it's really a combination, so you have the consumer that is feeling better. You have the continued housing recovery is helpful. And it's a technology innovation that\u2019s driving us. And of course, are continuing to gain market share. So, we have three engines if you will be driving our current growth. ","Now of course if one of the engines slows down, that's going to have an impact. But it doesn't impact the other two engines. So now on the 7 what percentage is the first one is hard to know. What we know is that the combination of the first and the second is material. Because Corie highlighted NPD at 2.8%. Again, it's a fraction of what we do, but we all remember the days where NPD went negative, and so the combination of the first two factors is helping, there is no doubt, hard to know between the first and the two, what is the breakdown.","Brian Nagel","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, that\u2019s helpful. The second question, it\u2019s a shorter one. With regards to TV, I think it's a follow on to your prior question, but obviously it\u2019s a bit early here in 2018, the holiday season, so a ways off. But how should we think about just some of the innovations in the TV category that we\u2019ll see for the balance of this year as potential sales driver non-core category, versus what we\u2019ve seen maybe in the last year, the last couple of years. ","Corie Barry","I mean, I think this is a phase where we've actually talked a lot about the idea of continued innovation and evolution and it is definitely a space where we get the cycle question a lot and instead I think it's actually turning into something that is more like what you're asking, which is, you know, it started with 4K, creeping up behind that. You can see technologies around, OLED or QLED, HDR technologies, 8K on the horizon. I think that the far horizon, by the way, but still on the horizon and I think this evolution of the technologies over time is going to continue to be the case in TV and for us it's why we think it's so important to highlight those new technologies. ","The second piece that I would say is it's not just about technology, it is still also about size. There are still a lot of people who want to have a larger TV experience. And so that combination of the two, I think it creates a lot of runway for people to experience both really cool technologies, but also frankly just having a lot more TV for their money in their homes. ","Brian Nagel","Thank you and congratulations on a nice quarter.","Hubert Joly ","Thank you, Brian. ","Operator","We will now take our final question from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. ","Scott Mushkin","Hey guys, a lot of my questions have been answered so, but I did want to go back to something that Simean had touched on and just make sure I understood the answer. And I hate to be so short term focused, but it seems like with the 7% comp, the call it the flow through or the profitability, really would have been -- I thought it would have been more and I guess I'm just trying to understand why it was -- quarter was great. I'm not trying to be overly critical here, honestly. I just try to understand why maybe there wasn't as much flow through. ","Corie Barry","Yeah. So, let me try to lay out kind of the two sides of this. On one side, especially as it relates to SG&A, we said out loud for the year we were going to continue to invest against our strategic priorities. The guide that we even gave for Q1 would say we're starting that investment early in the year, we're starting it in Q1 because we want to ramp as we go through the year. And so, we knew there would be investments and then we said on top of that some level of variability in SG&A. The pressure in margin, gross profit, excuse me that we talked about was really a function of --- and we talked about this kind of that continued evolution of the mobile space and a bit of pressure there and again, something we have seen in front of us and we assumed would be the case for the quarter. ","The teams are continuing to do excellent work in both gross profit optimization initiatives, they are continuing to pull cost out of the model, but we knew the phasing of the year, we knew we would be making some investments even earlier in the year, so even on the seven comp, the gross profit pressure side of things, that's not going to change as much on the seven comp, that's more volume, it's a mix of business that you're doing. ","And then on the SG&A side, like we said a couple of things that came up that we haven't had in our forecast is a comp this big and the incentive compensation that flows through with that. And so, I mean I think it's tough because from our internal perspective, most things were in line with what we would have expected for the quarter except for we actually just had a lot of better performance than we expected. And therefore, got wonderful opportunities to share that with our employees, this is not a bad situation. ","Hubert Joly ","Yeah. And what I would add this is one of the things that's leaving I was going to say is that we're able to drive the top-line, make the investments we are making. And because we're able to offset them that profitability we're not seeing a drag of our -- a significant drag in our margin, there is others who are in a different situation from that standpoint. And so, we like the -- it's really in line with what we have discussed at Investor Day which is we're pushing the transformation of the company pushing to growth. We're not trying to increase the profitability, because we're trying to position the company for the future, continue to position the company for the future. There is a key believe we have is that the return for the winners in this space other the outsized. Because there is going to be greater and greater differentiation between winners and losers. And so, this is the time created to invest and we're pleased to be able to offset a lot of the investments. There is not to minimize your question but stepping back and thinking strategically as what we're trying to do. We're pleased to be able to grow the company we are of course continuing to increase the earnings. And we fundamentally believe there is significant shareholders value creation opportunity as we move forward. ","So, because of time I am going very briefly close and thank you all for your attention and reiterate with all my immense gratitude and appreciation and admiration for all of the associates of the company, who are delivering these results and who are helping customers enrich their lives to technology every day. We be able to watch the leadership and the talent that exists at the company and many of you our customers. So, appreciate your support as well. Have a great day. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the conference over to Mollie O\u2019Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Mollie O\u2019Brien","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; Matt Bilunas, our CFO; and Mike Mohan, our President and COO.","During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning\u2019s earnings release, which is available on our website investors.bestbuy.com.","Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial conditions, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.

Today we have reported $9.76 billion in revenue, expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate by 70 basis points and delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of a $1.13, which was up 22% compared to the third quarter of last year.","We delivered another strong quarter and are excited about our continued momentum and the opportunities we have ahead of us. Our teams continued to execute well and navigate ever increasing customer expectations, a consistently competitive retail environment, and the uncertain tariff situation. And they are doing all this while making significant progress against our Building the New Blue strategy, which we believe will uniquely position us over the long-term.","Specifically, our comparable sales growth of 1.7% was on top of 4.3% last year and above the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. Our Domestic segment comparable sales were up 2%, as we continue to focus on the customer experience across online, stores, and at home. From a product category standpoint, the comp growth was driven by strength in appliances, headphones, tablets, and computing, partially offset by declines in gaming and home theater.","The Q3 profitability was better-than-expected. This was primarily the result of lower SG&A, due to strong expense management, a reflection of the culture we have built around driving cost reduction and efficiencies to help fund investments and offset pressures. The Q3 gross profit rate was flat on a year-over-year basis.","Due to the strong Q3 results, we are updating our annual guidance today. Matt will discuss in more detail later in the call, but at a high level we are maintaining the topline guidance we shared last quarter, while raising the non-GAAP EPS guidance. We are now expecting non-GAAP EPS of $5.81 to $5.91. This compares to the original guidance of $5.45 to $5.65 that we provided last February as we entered the year.","As it relates to tariffs, our assumptions of the impact on our business are basically unchanged from our last call. As a reminder, our guidance includes our best estimate of the impact of all tariffs, both implemented and planned, including List 3 at 25%, List 4A at 15%, which was implemented on September 1, and List 4B at 15% which is planned for December 15.","As we shared at our Investor Update in September, we are entering the second chapter of Building the New Blue. Our purpose remains the same: to enrich lives through technology. Our strategy is to leverage our unique combination of tech and touch to meet everyday human needs, and build more and deeper relationships with our customers.","We introduced three five-year goals at our Investor Update focused on employees, customers, and financials. As a reminder, they are: first, to be one of the best companies to work for in the U.S., exemplified by being named to Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For list.","Second, to double the number of significant customer relationship events to 50 million. This includes total tech support memberships, homes visited, active digital engagement, financial services, and senior life support.","And third, to deliver continued top and bottom line growth over time, specifically to get to $50 billion in revenue and a 5% non-GAAP operating income rate in fiscal 2025.","We believe our strategy will translate to an economic model that delivers results by better serving existing customers, capturing new demand, entering new spaces, and building capabilities while maintaining profitability over time.","Last quarter, we talked about how our penetration by geographic market varies widely, yet our tools and structure have been one-size-fits-all for our local markets. To better serve existing customers, we made strategic changes to our field operations to accelerate growth and to create a more seamless experience across channels, putting single leaders in a position to be accountable for stores, services, supply chain, and home propositions in their market.","These leaders are supported by a channel agnostic program centered around insights, data, and analytics, to view market\u2019s largest opportunities and fast-track initiatives that will make a financial impact as well as provide a more seamless customer experience.","For example, in the New York area, we are focused on expanding both our fulfillment options and in-home resources. During the quarter, we launched 175 alternate pickup locations for customers in areas where either our store locations are not convenient or the ship-to-home option is not desired. These alternate locations are in UPS stores and CVS stores in the New York market.","In New York, as well as Los Angeles and Chicago, online customers can order as late as 8 p.m. and still receive their products the next day for free. Starting in New York, we are also adding the ability for online customers who want their product the same day to select specific three-hour delivery window for that same day delivery. And for those online customers who prefer to pick up the products themselves, we are beginning the process of rolling out curbside pickup at stores in the New York market, where a Best Buy employee will bring the product directly to the customer\u2019s car.","To build awareness of these expanded experiences, we have already kicked off a comprehensive local market marketing campaign that includes stores, train stations, billboards, digital, and email. Based on our data, we believe there is much untapped opportunity to serve New York clients in their homes.","To capitalize on that opportunity, we are building capacity by adding additional in-home advisors and also increasing the training for existing advisors. We have combined additional resources from both the field and corporate teams to provide these new advisors an accelerated, locally focused training program that we believe will speed up their ramp-up time.","This will free up capacity for our existing advisors in the market to receive more training designed to strengthen their clienteling skills, which will lead to deeper customer relationships. Based on local market analysis, we have also added capacity across the country where we continue to see strong customer demand for our in-home consultation program.","On a national level during the quarter we added 100 in-home advisors to end the quarter with approximately 720 advisors. As we shared at our Investor Updates, 95% of those polled said they would continue working with their in-home advisor and we continue to see higher spend at a higher gross profit rates from our in-home advisor customers versus other customers. We expect our advisors will become more and more productive as we advance our CRM system and enhance our digital tools.","Another important way we are better serving customers and building relationships is through our Total Tech Support program. Total Tech Support provides members unlimited Geek Squad support for all of their technology no matter where or when they bought it, in addition to great discounts and installations, protection and in-home services.","We have grown the membership to over 2 million members from about 200,000 when we launched nationally in May of last year. It continues to get strong customer reviews and members spend more and are twice as likely to use other services than non-members. We are building on this early success to continue to deliver more benefits our members are asking for.","For example, we are piloting a program, we are calling Total Tech Support with networking that includes routers setup and installation, parental controls to manage every device on the network, a subscription to Microsoft Office 365, and 1 terabyte of cloud storage along with all the standard Total Tech Support benefits. We are also continuing to add new services and capabilities that have the potential to attract new customers.","As we shared last quarter, Best Buy is now fully certified chain wide as an Apple authorized service provider, becoming the nation\u2019s largest physical destination in terms of points of presence for Apple authorized repair services including same day iPhone repairs. Almost 40% of these Apple repair customers are either new to Best Buy or haven\u2019t made a purchase in the last year.","Our lease to own purchasing option is now fully rolled out in 45 states after we added the last nine states including California and New York just a few weeks ago. This provides another purchasing option in addition to our existing strong credit card offer allowing us to help customers make purchases they might not otherwise be able to. Since we began rolling out the program nationally in March, approximately 65% of lease to own customers are either new to Best Buy or haven\u2019t made a purchase in the last year.","We also remain focused on developing digital innovation and marketing strategies to drive engagement with our customers. We continue to enhance our digital shopping platforms both online and on our mobile app, with new functionality and a better customer experience. Our app continues to see strong customer ratings and year-to-date usage of the app is up more than 20%, and usage of our app within our stores is up more than 30%.","Our store employees love the app, which has also been improved with their needs in mind. They can now much more quickly see pricing, promotions, inventory and fulfillment times, through features such as Top Deals, which I will discuss in a moment, and expanded availability options. The app also provides employees other recommended products if a certain product is out of stock in their store.","During the quarter, we materially changed the way we present product deals to our customers. Several years ago, we created a digital version of our weekly ad as we transitioned away from the paper weekly ad that was distributed every Sunday.","We no longer distribute any paper weekly ads, and during Q3, we sun-setted the rigid digital weekly ad technology platform and launched a Top Deals section in our app and on our website. This leverages cost and gives us more flexibility to introduce multiple promotional cycles within the week and ensure we featuring our best offers.","Most importantly, Top Deals provides a better user experience and helps customers find products faster with fewer clicks, resulting in higher and more consistent traffic throughout the week and better conversion compared to the old experience.","At our Investor Update in September, we also spent time talking about the significant opportunity we see in the health space. Specifically, we have reiterated our focus on helping seniors live longer in their homes through our unique combination of tap and touch, thereby reducing their health care costs and bringing greater peace of mind for them and their families and caregivers.","We serve approximately 1 million seniors right now and we shared our goal to serve 5 million seniors in fiscal 2025. Today, most of the seniors we serve are utilizing easy-to-use mobile phone products and connected devices that are tailored for seniors and come with a range of relevant services.","With our five star service, customers can talk to U.S. based specially trained agents who can connect them to family caregivers, provide concierge services and dispatch emergency personnel.","We expect to continue to scale this business over time in order to reach our five-year target. We also expect to advance our commercial business where the services we provide for seniors are paid for by insurance providers. This includes services such as remote monitoring based solutions that provide meaningful insights to improve timely care and reduce the cost to serve frail seniors.","As previously discussed, we have successfully closed and integrated three acquisitions that have given us unique and essential capabilities and infrastructure, talent and a base of customer relationships to build from.","We have also hired additional talent to deepen our expertise. That includes Dr. Daniel Grossman, our new Chief Medical Officer for Best Buy Health. He is a practicing emergency medicine physician at a major academic medical center in Rochester, Minnesota, with extensive strategy and business development experiences at leading health tech companies. He has been on all sides of health care, physicians, patients, payer, disrupter and educator. We are excited to have him on our team. ","As we have reiterated many times, our continued focus on reducing costs and driving efficiencies in order to fund investments and help offset pressures is a key element of our long-term strategy. In September, we announced a new cost reduction and efficiency target of $1 billion by the end of fiscal 2025.","We made good progress against this new goal during the third quarter and plan to provide more detailed annual updates on our Q4 call going forward. In addition to our strong business results, we have continued to make strides toward our goal of becoming one of the best companies to work for in the United States.","For example, we have recently added a variety of employee benefits, including paid caregiver leave, paid time off for part-time employees, back up childcare, a PTO purchase plan and enhanced mental health resources. We also increased our adoption assistance benefit and introduced a new surrogacy benefit as part of our efforts to support employees who want to grow their families.","And finally, last month we announced an updated dress code that allows employees to wear jeans and comfortable shoes. This is something our store employees have been asking for and importantly, saves them money. These changes have all been extremely well received by our store teams across the country.","These are just a few examples of the ways we are continuing to invest in our people and underscore our commitment to be a great place to work and these investments have produced some very positive results.","Our store turnover remains in the low 30% range, compared to 50% five years ago and our average store general manager has been in his or her role for about six years. In fact, as we enter Q4, more than 92% of our store general managers already have experience leading their stores through a holiday season.","Our progress has also been noticed outside the company. We are proud of the breadth of recognition we have received in recent months, including ranking number 66 on Forbes list of the World\u2019s Best Employers and being named the number one Best Company to Work For during the holiday season by Glassdoor.","We are also honored to be ranked one of the top employers for students and graduates of historically black colleges and universities. Our culture at Best Buy is incredibly strong. It\u2019s the reason I am here and I firmly believe it is our competitive advantage. ","As we look ahead, we are excited about our holiday plans and everything we have to offer our customers this holiday season. Our team has once again put together a best-in-class assortment, prepared an amazing set of deals and ensured we have great inventory availability across all the product categories we carry, and we are supporting that work with a steady drum beat of marketing and promotions that will keep Best Buy top of mind with shoppers throughout the holiday season.","Earlier this month, we released our Black Friday ad full of thousands of deals on the hottest tech. Hundreds of those deals were available immediately and we will continue to provide compelling offers throughout the holiday season.","On the fulfillment side, we are making it even easier and much faster for customers this year. We are promising free next day delivery on thousands of items all season long with no membership or minimum purchase required.","The fact that we are able to make that promise to our customers is a huge testament to all the work our teams have done throughout our supply chain transformation. About 99% of our customers now live in a ZIP code where next day delivery is available, up from 80% last quarter and if a customer lives in an area where free next day delivery isn\u2019t available or they are shopping for an item that isn\u2019t eligible for it, they can still get free standard shipping.","As we have shared previously, we also offer same day delivery on thousands of items in 42 markets, and of course, store pick-up remains a fast and convenient option for our customers. More than 70% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Best Buy store and we promise that their items will be ready within one hour of placing an order.","And on average 80% of online orders are ready for store pick-up in less than 30 minutes. The NPS store for the experience continues to increase about 40% of our online sales are pick-up in our stores.","Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we are offering curbside pick-up in a few stores in New York and other select markets across the country allowing customers to pick-up their without even getting out of the car.","Our fulfillment options are all focused on providing customers with the choice and convenience they expect and deserve, and with the digital shopping experience on the Best Buy mobile app, it is now easy and intuitive to see your options for when and where you can get your order whether you opt for delivery or store pick-up.","I also want to highlight that once again, this year we are supporting the St. Jude Thanksgiving campaign with customer and employee donations in our stores and online. We have been the program\u2019s top fundraising partner for three consecutive years, helping to raise $80 million for St. Jude\u2019s lifesaving work since we first partnered in 2013. We hope to bring that cumulative total to more than $100 million with this holiday season.","In summary, we are pleased to report strong results for the third quarter and our teams are excited and ready to deliver an outstanding holiday season. I want to take a moment to genuinely thank our amazing Best Buy employees in advance for all their hard work this week and throughout the holidays, whether you work in one of our stores, spend your time making house calls to our customers\u2019 homes or work in a distribution center or the corporate office, please know that you are a critical part of what makes Best Buy so special. The holidays can be a fun and very busy time in retail and I want you to know how much we sincerely appreciate all that you do.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to Matt.","Matt Bilunas","Good morning, and hello, everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. On Enterprise revenue of $9.76 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.13, both of which exceeded our expectations. We saw better than expected top line results in the computing category and a bit softer than planned in the home theater category.","Our operating income rate also exceeded the high end of our expectations for the quarter. The higher operating income rate was primarily driven by strong expense management, which was partially offset by a lower gross profit rate than expected.","Consistent with our expectations heading into the quarter, recently implemented tariffs on imported goods from China did not have a material impact on our Q3 results. From an international standpoint, we generated slightly higher operating income than we expected despite our top line results being below expectations.","Lastly, the favorable earnings per share results versus our guidance also included a $0.03 per share benefit from a lower effective tax rate.","I will now talk about our third quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 1.8% to $9.76 billion, primarily due to the comparable sales increase of 1.7%. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.20 or 22% to $1.13.","This increase was driven by, one, increased operating income dollars from both a higher operating income rate and higher revenue, and two, a $0.06 per share benefit from the net share count change. These favorable items were partially offset by a negative $0.03 per share impact from a higher effective tax rate.","In our Domestic segment, the revenue increased 2.4% to $8.96 billion. This increase was driven by a comparable sales increase of 2% from revenue from GreatCall, which was acquired in October of 2018, partially offset by a loss of revenue from store closures in the past year. GreatCall revenue will be included in our comparable sales calculation the beginning of the start of this year\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter.","From a merchandising perspective, the largest comparable sales growth drivers were appliances, which includes both major and small appliances, headphones, tablets and computing. These drivers were partially offset by the clients in our gaming and home theater categories.","In addition, comparable sales in the services category increased 12.9% versus last year. Similar to the past few quarters, part of the services growth was due to or revenue recognition for our Total Tech Support offer.","As a reminder, we will begin to lap this revenue refinement during the years of Q4, so we expect the services year-over-year growth rate to slow materially compared to Q3.","Domestic online revenue of $1.4 billion was 15.6% of Domestic revenue, up from 13.8% last year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 15% on top of 12.6% growth in the third quarter of last year, which was primarily given by a higher average order values.","In our International segment, revenue decreased 4.1% to $800 million. This was primarily driven by a comparable sales decline of 1.9% and approximately 170 basis points of negative foreign currency impact.","Turning now to gross profit, the Enterprise growth profit rate was 24.2% was flat to last year. The Domestic gross profit rate of 24.3% versus 24.4% last year. The 10-basis-point decrease was primarily driven by mix into lower margin products, which was partially offset by the impact of GreatCall\u2019s higher gross profit rate.","International gross profit rate increased 30 basis points to 22.5%, primarily due to higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada, which was driven by higher margin in the services category.","Now turning to SG&A, domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.78 billion or 19.9% of revenue versus 20.6% of revenue last year. SG&A dollars decreased $24 million, primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense and strong expense management. These favorable items were partially offset by GreatCall operating expenses.","International SG&A was $173 million or 21.6% of revenue versus $178 million or 21.3% of revenue last year, a $5 million decrease was primarily driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.","On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate of 24.8%, compared to 22.7% last year. The higher rate versus last year was primarily driven by the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in the prior year.","We returned a total of $499 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $368 million and dividends of $131 million. With a year-to-date share buyback spend of $700 million we expect to be in the high side of our target of $750 million to $1 billion in share repurchases this year.","Our ending inventory addition was down approximately 7% compared to last year. This decrease is primarily due to a timing of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which occur a week later this year versus last year. Finally, we are still planning capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $750 million to $800 million.","Now, I will discuss our outlook. Let me start with a few comments specific to tariffs. As Corie mentioned earlier, the guidance we are providing today continues to include the estimated impacts of all tariffs net of the mitigating actions we are taking.","These include, one, bringing in products ahead of the tariff implementations, two, decisions around vendor and SKU assortment, three, promotional and pricing strategies, four, sourcing changes, and five, other strategies employed in partnership with our vendors.","As a quick reminder, the List 4 tariffs are at a 15% level and have two effective dates. The first effective date was September 1st and the most notable affected categories relative to Best Buy are televisions, smartwatches and headphones.","The second effective date is December 15th and the most notable categories relative to Best Buy are computing, mobile phones and gaming consoles.","Now back to our outlook. Today, we are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS range to reflect the strong Q3 profitability, as well as our improved expectations for Q4. As we shared last quarter, operating income rate expansion in Q3 followed by operating income rate decline in Q4 was assumed in the original guidance we provided at the start of the year.","In Q4, we expect a decline in gross profit rate. We expect SG&A rate to be slightly favorable on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by lower incentive compensation expense. To provide some color on the expected gross profit rate decline, there are three primary drivers all roughly similarly sized.","First, we expect a mix of products to have a negative impact on our product margin rates. As I shared last -- on last quarter\u2019s call, this was due in part to giving our teams a little more flexibility to navigate through the holiday season.","Second, we anticipate great pressure in our services category, with the largest driver being higher delivery and installation costs.","And three -- and third, our outlook, of course, also includes the estimated impacts of all tariffs.","One more note on Q4 expected gross profit rate from a sequential point of view. As I reminded you last quarter, we fully lapped the acquisition of GreatCall and the revenue recognition refinement to our Total Tech Support offer in Q4. So they will no longer be a source of gross profit rate expansion as they have been in the last four quarters.","Specifically, our guidance for the fourth quarter is Enterprise revenue in the range of $14.75 billion to $15.15 billion, enterprise comparable sales growth of 0.5% to 3%, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.65 to $2.75 and non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 24% and a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 261 million shares.","On a full year basis we are now expecting Enterprise revenue in the range of $43.2 billion to $43.6 billion and Enterprise comparable sales growth of 1% to 2%. Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate slightly up to fiscal 2019\u2019s rate of 4.6%, non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 23.3% and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $5.81 to $5.91, which compares to our previous guidance of $5.60 to $5.75.","I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question over the phone from Karen Short from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Karen Short","Oh! Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I am wondering if you could just give a little bit more color on the puts and takes on what would get you to the low versus the high end of the comp guidance range for the year \u2013 or for the fourth quarter. And then kind of looking into what that would imply on the operating margin as well, just some little more color on the puts and takes?","Matt Bilunas","Sure. This is Matt. I will take that question. First, in terms of the revenue guidance range, I think, obviously, holiday is always a special season for consumer electronics. Price and convenience is very important, and like any holiday, we take a very disciplined approach to setting the range, and so what we have set, we feel it\u2019s very appropriate.","I think in terms of what we are excited about that could be a good guide, we have a lot of exciting plans and offers and a lot of those includes very strong fulfillment options for our consumers. We still feel like the consumer is relatively strong and the economic indicators are in a good spot.","Although, there\u2019s been some -- a little bit of waning of consumer confidence, we still feel like the consumer\u2019s in a good position, so that\u2019s a good thing for us. Sequentially, mobile phones and computing are expected to improve a little bit in Q4. Home theater is also expected to get a little better than it has been on trend.","In terms of what could go the other way, I think, obviously, in the holiday period, a lot of other retailers use our category sometimes to drive traffic, so we are thoughtful about thinking about that in our guidance range.","Also -- there\u2019s always a possibility of inventory constraints. We don\u2019t see things at this point, but that\u2019s always a possibility. And in terms of gaming, that\u2019s -- it\u2019s been soft all year and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re thoughtful about the range.","On the gross profit side, I think, the puts and takes, I think, we talked about what the pressure was in Q4. I think, obviously, as you go through the holiday, you are never quite sure exactly what all the consumers are going to purchase, and the outlet sales mix can sometimes put a little bit of pressure either to the good or to the bad on your margin. Also, to the extent that our services offerings hold and continue to generate some excitement to the holiday, that could be a good guide as well.","Karen Short","Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And just to follow up on the lease to own, you rolled that out to nine new states and any early read on that, maybe percent of customers new versus existing, and then any color on any impact on the comp although I realize it\u2019s still very small?","Corie Barry","Yeah. I will tell a little bit about lease to own. First, we were going to start in the same place which is this is an offering we think, it is really good for our customers. At Best Buy, we always start with the branded credit card, but now we have another option for people who may not want to get into a credit card offering or may just have a more challenged credit history.","We have talked a little bit about that at Investor Day. It is still a relatively small portion of the comp growth that we are seeing, but it is importantly an incremental -- either new or what had been a lapsed customer for us, and so we really like this opportunity to bring that customer back in.","We didn\u2019t launch the next nine states -- the new nine states including New York and California until just a couple of weeks ago, was very late into the third quarter. So, we will see how that plays here over the holiday season and into next year.","Next year is really where we feel like we have a chance to continue to accelerate our growth here. This is something you can imagine that takes our associates some time to get comfortable with. It\u2019s a different type of offer, and they need to definitely feel like they have good comfort in offering it.","And we also continue to improve our experiences, both in-store, the information we ask for. But importantly next year, we want to be able to also offer it online, which would be a great addition for us. So we like it. It\u2019s a good secondary offer, but still relatively small in terms of the overall comp.","Karen Short","Great. Thank you.","Corie Barry","You bet.","Operator","We will now take our next question over the phone from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning, guys. So can you talk about the estimated impact on margins from GreatCall and Total Tech Support? It just seems to me those are higher margin businesses. I guess I would have expected maybe a little better gross margin performance just given the growth of those two segments? Thanks.","Matt Bilunas","Yeah. Thank you. I think in our prepared remarks, we talked about how those were both benefits to us for the last four quarters, so they have been helping on the margins. And I think it\u2019s important to remember that from a GreatCall perspective, it increases the margin rate a bit, but it also increases the operating. So from an OI perspective, it\u2019s still relatively neutral.","On TTS, what we called out is a specific part to the revenue recognition refinement that we made. Service is a much bigger category. It includes obviously all the other runoff of legacy system, great legacy support offers, as well as installation and delivery and so when you put them together, we try to think of services in totality, and that is not as we talked about, it is a pressure in Q4. So, that\u2019s kind of the way to think about those two.","Scot Ciccarelli","I guess I was looking for any kind of quantification, but are you -- but basically the way we should think about it is on an EBIT basis it\u2019s pretty similar to the rest of the corporate run rate? Is that what you are saying, no real contribution to the EBIT line?","Matt Bilunas","Yeah. The EBIT line it\u2019s pretty -- it\u2019s relatively neutral for both of those two things as you consider all the factors of services into the TTS as well.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Melich from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Greg Melich","Hi. Thanks. Just a follow-up on the operating profit in the fourth quarter and then a more strategic question. Operating rate should be down in the fourth quarter, but on SG&A dollars, I missed what do you expect is part of that, if it wasn\u2019t for the cycling the incentive comp a year ago. How much would dollars have been up in the third quarter and what would you expect in the fourth quarter?","Matt Bilunas","Yeah. We are not going to get specifics on how much dollars would have been without lower incentive compensation. In Q4, we do expect a carry on some strong SG&A management in Q4. So in Q4 the puts and takes are really lower incentive compensation, but we are also investing a little bit in advertising and labor. So it is going to be -- we do expect it to be favorable comparatively but we are not giving specifics on the lower incentives number.","Greg Melich","Got it. And then if we look, overall, I mean, obviously, the comp looks solid. You are driving some categories where maybe we didn\u2019t -- we keep seeing nice growth like appliances. If we were to take the comp in the third quarter and even look into the fourth quarter next year. How much of that comp is driven by average ticket and how much of it is by continued traffic or transaction growth, whether it would be online or in-store?","Corie Barry","So the wonderful thing about being more omni-channel now is that tends to be how we look at our organic metric where we are looking at all of our metrics together. And what we saw in Q3 was traffic across all our channels was up at as was our average order value. And so those two were up, we thought and total transactions down just a little bit, but broadly like the health we are seeing in broad traffic up and those order value is up as well.","Greg Melich","That\u2019s great. And then a last one on just tariffs, I want to make sure I am clear that we are talking -- we talk about List 4. Do you assume that the 15% is going to happen in December or is it just not material because it\u2019s so late in the quarter?","Corie Barry","Yeah. It\u2019s a little bit of both. We are assuming\u2026","Greg Melich","Okay.","Corie Barry","\u2026that that goes in at the 15th, and at the same time, it\u2019s not very -- that portion, that tranche is not very material on the quarter. That tranche becomes more of a conversation piece for next year.","Greg Melich","That\u2019s great. Well, happy holidays, and good luck, guys.","Corie Barry","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt McClintock from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Matt McClintock","Hi. Yes. Good morning, everyone. Corie, I wanted to dig into IHA a little bit. You talked about hiring an additional 100 IHAs this quarter, but then you also talked about putting in an accelerated training program for IHAs and it seems like you are building out an infrastructure to maybe meaningfully accelerate the number of IHAs that you have. Can you just dig into that a little bit, am I reading that right? Can you talk more to that? Thank you.","Corie Barry","Well, I think -- thank you for the question. I think since day one we have said our focus here is on making the very best in-home experience we can seamlessly across all the ways that we interact with people in their homes.","And we said repeatedly over the last couple of years, we are going to take our time pacing this, because we definitely want to ensure creating clienteling at scale is not an easy task and we want to do everything we can to make sure we exceed the customer\u2019s expectations if we get a chance to be in their home.","I think some of what we have learned around how best to train is now being translated into to your point a bit of a different approach to training. It used to be when we pulled someone on Board we would use other IHAs to a very large extent to really help them understand what was expected of them, how to build a base of business and how to continue to build their clienteling.","I think what we have done better now is created a much more standardized training program upfront that we can administer and allows the existing IHAs to continue to build a more robust clienteling capability while we are bringing new IHAs up to speed and getting them ready and working quickly.","And so, I think, the team is learning a lot about how best to bring people on, what you train them in first, how to take your more experienced IHAs and put them against some of the more complex jobs.","All of those are turning -- helping us continue to refine the IHA model. So to your point, I don\u2019t know if I would say it\u2019s just accelerated as much as us continuing to take the learning and pace where we think is appropriate based on the demand we are seeing.","Importantly, I would also underscore the example that we gave in the New York market, which is we also think there are specific markets where this offering could be and should be even more relevant than others.","When you look at the data about how people want to interact with us, how they want help in their homes, we think we uniquely have a really interesting opportunity to help people in their homes in these markets, and therefore, our ramping and training a little bit differently for some of these markets.","Matt McClintock","Thanks for that color. And then just as a follow-up, you talked a lot about your next day same day fulfillment and how you have improved that year-over-year. How do you look at that strategically for the fourth quarter, specifically this holiday season, given that it\u2019s a shorter holiday season? And how does that compare competitively to other people that sell your products, clearly some of your peers have those options, but for the breadth of product that you sell, it would seem like a lot of your pet competitors just can\u2019t match that?","Mike Mohan","Hey, Matt. This is Mike. Thanks for the question. I will start with the last part. We feel really good about how we are positioned competitively. Our teams there just call it two-thirds the way through our supply chain transformation and the progress we have seen to-date and the customer response has been fantastic. And we look at all aspects of what the customers see on our site versus competitors and what we are able to deliver.","I think what makes it unique at Best Buy is a combination of automation we put in our large facilities, the metro e-commerce facilities that we added to some of our major markets. And then we have been doing in-store fulfillment both in-store pick-up and ship from store, longer than anybody else.","And I think we have found ways to refine that so we can actually deliver on promises on the products that people want the most, so these high value consumer electronic items and depending on where you live in the country, we are just as good as anybody at getting you stuff right away. You can come to our stores or you can get stuff the very next day.","And what complements that, I think, that has to be said, as you have got to be in stock on these items too, and I think, that\u2019s something that our teams have proven expertise in. And so you put those all together and that\u2019s what lets us deliver on we think a very compelling fulfillment promise, one that doesn\u2019t cost us a lot of extra money, because of the investments we have made and it\u2019s something that, Matt, talked about in his remarks, we are going to lead into help drive the comp in our fourth quarter.","Matt McClintock","Thanks a lot, Mike. Best of luck everyone. ","Corie Barry","Thank you. ","Mike Mohan","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Joe Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Joe Feldman","Thanks, guys. Congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to go back to inventory for a moment. You had mentioned you knew it was down timing related to the holiday, but how should we think about it for the fourth quarter, presumably you have brought in a lot more at this point. But just what type of rate of increase should we expect for the fourth quarter if any?","Matt Bilunas","Sure. This is Matt. I think we are not going to get the rate of increase at the end of the year at this point, but I think the teams are feeling very well-positioned for the holiday week. Like I said, we had a lower inventory position at the end of Q3 simply because of the holiday shift in timing of being a week a little -- a week later this year. The teams will do what they need to do to be in a good position.","I think we are always very thoughtful about bringing in the right amount and how much of that is owned versus not. So I think we are not going to give a specific amount, but I would expect us to continue to match that with the pace of sales that we expect as we head into next year.","Joe Feldman","Thanks. And then just to get more specific on appliances, can you talk about what continues to drive the strength there? I mean, are you -- presumably you guys are taking some market share. I am wondering where you think that\u2019s coming from, but also just what is driving such good strength on top of prior strength?","Mike Mohan","Joe, it\u2019s Mike. I will amplify a bit of the fulfillment comments to Matt. That\u2019s part of the reason why we have improved our appliance business with the investments we have made in fulfillment. It wasn\u2019t just speed and small parcel, and leveraging our store network. It was our large product delivery and how we built support with our own teams and with partners and we have make sure we improved that.","And it\u2019s complemented with the investments we have made in training, marketing, the in-store experience and we thought about this category end-to-end. And as I think most of you know is, a large percentage of appliance purchases happen with something that you don\u2019t expect occurs, an appliance in your house breaks.","And frankly a few years ago we just weren\u2019t very good at that and we have made some really big improvements on how we can help customers navigate for items they can get a very next day, for things they can take with them from our stores, and then we continue the reinforcement with our in-home advisors the ability to help sell appliances when we are in your homes and continue to expand our assortment.","So it\u2019s a suite of investments across the Board that helped drive this. And as you know, we are now on our eighth year and counting on consecutive comp growth and we have been awarded JD Powers top honors third year in appliances and we like the category a lot and we like the customer response to what we are doing right now.","Joe Feldman","Great. Thanks. Good luck with the holiday period.","Corie Barry","Thank you. ","Mike Mohan","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Matuszewski from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jonathan Matuszewski","Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. So some retailers have called out lengthened purchase decision cycles resulting from tariff-driven price increases. From the strength of your comp, I\u2019d imagine you are not, but maybe just comment on that and speak to how consumers maybe digesting some of the selected price increases you have instituted and whether you are making an expectation for greater elasticity in 4Q? Thanks.","Corie Barry","This one is so difficult and we talked about before there just really isn\u2019t a precedent for where we are right now and there are a lot of moving pieces. And as you can imagine, both our teams and our vendors are employing a number of strategies.","In the third quarter specifically, we definitely saw a limited number of small price increases. And if you look at the items that were on the list on 4A things like TVs, and especially, some of the smaller screen size.","I think in general what\u2019s difficult, though, is that you now have quite a few items that are on any of the less than elasticities for any given individual item are incredibly difficult. And in fact, I think, it\u2019s even more difficult as you head into Q4, which is a highly promotional season and we will be less about whether or not there\u2019s a tariff on any individual item, it will be about promotional positioning throughout the quarter.","And so I give our teams a great deal of credit for pretty carefully navigating thus far and to have really good plans into Q4 and we are seeing a variety of mitigation tactics go into place. We talked about this last time we had the call, obviously, we are thinking about where we assort and who we assort, definitely we are seeing promotional decisions being made by every single retailer out there as we head into this period.","Obviously some of these are global vendors and they are thinking about how they move their supply chain, what pieces and parts they put into and how they decide to structure any of their different assemblies and we are already seeing some of the manufacturing move.","And so, yes, we saw a little bit of impact into Q3, but as Matt said, it wasn\u2019t material enough for us to quantify our call out. Q4 I think is all about price and promotion, and how you are positioning, and we will see how this evolves as we head into next year.","Jonathan Matuszewski","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then just you mentioned some exciting new kind of fulfillment options in kind of the New York City area. So just help us think about what\u2019s the timeframe as you think about maybe rolling out some of those options elsewhere in the country?","Mike Mohan","Yeah. Jonathan, it\u2019s Mike. New York is a great place for us to start primarily because of the density of consumers and our sheer lack of stores in some of the areas we would like to support customers and where we see opportunities from alternative pick-up locations and curbside.","Those are primarily the two things we launched in New York first. We see an opportunity to scale those both nationally as we get past this holiday because there clearly things that add value to the shopping experience at Best Buy and that\u2019s something that we think we can do. So it\u2019s a great question. Thank you for asking it.","Jonathan Matuszewski","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin from R5 Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Scott Mushkin","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So one was a thought about, as we think about next year, it looks like you guys are putting up pretty strong comps even though there\u2019s really not a product cycle going on at least that\u2019s my thought. And as we get into next year, it seems like you would have a number of drivers as we get 8K TVs coming down in price, we get a 5G iPhone, and we have two new gaming consoles. So how are you guys thinking about this year versus next year and are my thoughts right?","Corie Barry","So, obviously, we are not going to guide for next year yet. But I think what we like about this year is it underscores what has been our strategic point of view and that is people want and need electronics and those are going to continue to evolve over time and we have a very unique offering digitally in our stores and in-home that will help people make the best decisions and keep their products working. ","As we head into next year, there\u2019s obviously some things to be excited about. And counter point to that or at least something else to consider is the ongoing impact of tariffs potentially as we head into next year.","So what the teams are doing right now as you can imagine is working through all of that, all the mitigation strategies that I just talked about and thinking about how we can put together the right suite of offers and experiences for our customers next year.","I think no matter what, we feel like strategically we are positioned in the right way to capitalize on and commercialize new technology, which consistently we are able to do in a way that is very unique in the marketplace.","Scott Mushkin","Great. And then my second question actually is, I guess, more strategic, obviously, you guys have been active, somewhat active in M&A with GreatCall and others that you have done. As you look at interconnected home more broadly, Corie, is there more you can do here as we look out rather very pointed at healthcare right now, but it seems like there\u2019s a huge market and huge opportunity especially as you layer in 5G capabilities?","Corie Barry","It\u2019s interesting. We don\u2019t talk about it as much or talk about the M&A in it as much, but if you go into our stores, almost every what we would commercially refer to as department is connected to the next one or could be connected to the next one. And our associates are uniquely well-suited to help people navigate through the compatibility or the ability for people to connect broadly in their homes.","5G we have talked about it, it\u2019s going to be a slow roll. It\u2019s going to be market by market. But we have also said, we think there will be some interesting product innovation and that we again uniquely are able to help the consumer through what\u2019s available specifically for them in their market and how could it show up for them in their home in a very seamless and integrated way.","And I think, you will see and you have seen the stores continue to evolve in ways that highlight that interconnected capability. And I think, again, our team will, obviously, capitalize on that ability to commercialize any new technology, excuse me, that\u2019s coming down the pipe that will help capitalize on 5G and just processing and information power that will provide.","Matt Bilunas","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Zack Fadem from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Zack Fadem","Hey. Good morning. Can you walk us through your view of the impact of some of the Q4 headwinds around six fewer selling days? And then the Intel supply issues and to what extent you have incorporated these items in your outlook?","Corie Barry","So first on the holiday selling season, every bit of consumer data would say consumers are starting earlier in the hopes that they actually can finish earlier. We don\u2019t ever know exactly how that plays out for them, but that is every bit of consumer data that we are seeing.","And I think every bit of data that we have seen certainly over the last five years is that the promotional cycle continues to pull earlier and earlier, and that more and more people are launching ads and deals earlier and earlier.","Additionally, the fulfillment options that are available to people have completely changed the competitive landscape in terms of how quickly you can get your items with next day, same day, in-store pick-up, all of these being available and we feel particularly strategically relevant for us with our physical locations, our ability to be in your home, our next day available to 99% of the ZIP codes this really suits us well.","And so our point of view is that the less days is much less relevant than it used to be historically and that you are going to capture that demand slightly differently, but that demand is coming. We like to joke and say there\u2019s still the same number of days between Halloween and Christmas, and so we feel like shoppers are going to meet their needs the way that they want given all the fulfillment options.","In terms of the Intel news, our team would say they feel very well-equipped for holidays and that we have the right products. We have -- Matt talked about inventory, very good inventory levels, lots of availability both in our stores and online. And then we will continue to work on that issue as we head into the next year. And I would argue our merchants are very good at navigating situations like this and are working towards the impacts for next year.","Zack Fadem","Got it. Thanks, Corie. And then on the gaming category weakness, curious if you could expand on that in a little more detail whether you think it\u2019s primary -- primarily innovation driven or if there\u2019s something structural there. Just curious on your thoughts on when the category could turn around?","Mike Mohan","Yeah. Zack, it\u2019s Mike. I think, the gaming category still is exciting. We think about it broad -- more broadly than just the console category based on what we think and where consumers are looking for experiences to be enhanced.","Obviously we are on the year cycle of new devices coming out next holiday. So you have got kind of the best of both worlds for consumers thinking about what they want to do and thinking now -- between now and next holiday what they are feeling.","So we have talked about gaming not being a driver for our business and we are seeing that reflect ourselves in the result. But also the category is promotional and drives good footsteps. And clearly this holiday you can see by what we are promoting. There\u2019s some exciting offers and there\u2019s still demand for that. Just at lower price points than they historically have been.","I think there\u2019s a sizeable shift and it will be for the foreseeable future how software compliments the experience and we have seen that for some time. So the consumer wants to move into higher power costs of devices more connected as it plays really good to our strengths on getting the right devices and the right accessories to meet the solution. And we think it will still be a great category for us as we move forward.","Zack Fadem","Got it. I appreciate that. Thanks so much. ","Corie Barry","Thank you. ","Mike Mohan","Thank you. ","Operator","And our last question will come from Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Chris Horvers","Thanks. Good morning. Can you talk about what drove the improvements in the computing category relative to the prior trend, it seems like that perked up which is great for your business. And then as you look to the fourth quarter, how are you thinking about that category and what drives the expected improvement in home theater?","Mike Mohan","Yeah. Chris, it\u2019s Mike. I will start and then, Corie, and Matt, can just chime in. We don\u2019t segment our selling seasons interdependent of our quarters, but we came out of period argues are really strong back-to-school season for Best Buy.","Corie talked about in your remarks about the evolution of our weekly ad to Top Deals, which lets us to be more flexible and how we offer deals to everybody that greatly benefited our back-to-school program with our ability to offer students more directly.","We focused on a new marketing segment and went for a younger demographic with where we placed our media. And our team is, we already talked about briefly as they do a fantastic job of finding the right value propositions to get things in play and then get a handful of new products shipped during the quarter, which was excellent and we did a superb job on offering pre-orders and an ability to get rid of your old devices.","And so when I look at that for Q3 it plays itself going into Q4 quite well and we are seeing great demand on our holiday products right now, we see no reason why it won\u2019t continue, and so we feel good about that experience. We have been investing in for years continues to pay dividends for us. Corie, would you add anything?","Corie Barry","No. I would just underscore, I think, this is a place where the team\u2019s done a great job every computer that you could want to look at, feel and touch and get help with is available. And in spaces like now where there\u2019s clearly interest on processing power, interest in high-end tablets, interest in computing, we are just very well-positioned to capitalize on that.","So thank you all so much for joining us today. We look forward to updating you in our Q4 call in February, and we all hope -- we hope that you all have a safe and very happy holidays. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"3639":["Best Buy Co., Inc.

Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our Chairman and CEO; and Sharon McCollam, our CAO and CFO.","This morning's conference call must be considered in conjunction with the earnings press release we issued this morning.

Sales of these products represent approximately 65% of our Domestic revenue. It does not include mobile phones, appliances, services, gaming, Apple Watch, movies and music.","I will now turn the call over to Hubert","Hubert Joly ","Thank you, Mollie and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me begin by discussing the announcements we made today regarding Sharon McCollam and Corie Barry. Of course, I first want to thank Sharon for the profound and lasting impact she has had on Best Buy and her amazing partnership.","As you all know, Sharon came out of retirement in 2012 to help revitalize Best Buy when the company was facing a multifaceted crisis. Three-and-a-half years later, we are in a very different place and are into the next phase of our journey as a company. And so as she transitioned out of her role, Sharon can look forward to spending more time with her husband with a sense of accomplishment and confidence in Best Buy's future.","Now one of Sharon\u2019s legacies is our successor in the CFO role Corie Barry. Corie is a 16 year veteran of Best Buy and our current Chief Strategic Growth Officer. She has been groomed by Sharon for the CFO role almost since the time Sharon joined the company, and the two have collaborated on succession planning with the goal of making this a seamless transition.","Over her many years at Best Buy, Corie has held a number of operational and financial roles in the field and at the corporate level, including as Senior Vice President of US Finance and as the Interim Head of our Services business.","The Board, Sharon, and I, firmly believe that Corie has the kind of experience, skills and passion for Best Buy that make her the perfect choice for this position. I look forward to working with her in a new role.","Sharon will remain as CFO until our Annual Shareholder Meeting on June 14, at which time Corie will assume her responsibilities. As part of this transition plan, Sharon will remain with Best Buy in an advisory role until the end of the fiscal year. The duties Sharon has as Chief Administrative Officer will be assumed by several members of our executive team.","So let me say once again how grateful we are to Sharon for all that she has done. Her legacy will endure. So, Corie, allow me to publicly extend my congratulations. She has been a key player in Best Buy resurgence and I am confident she will be a great leader for our company in the years ahead.","Altogether, I feel this is a remarkable time for our company. We have an exciting set of assets and opportunities and a very strong team, committed to creating great results for all our stakeholders.","I will now provide an overview of our first quarter performance and an update on our progress against our fiscal 2017 priorities, and I will then turn the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook.","In the first quarter, we delivered better-than expected enterprise revenue of $8.44 billion, a 30 basis point improvement in our non-GAAP operating income rate to 2.9%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44 versus $0.37 last year.","In our domestic business, we delivered better-than expected, essentially flat comparable sales, versus our guidance of 1% to 2% decline. Contributing to these better-than expected results was the strong performance in our online channel which grew 24% in the quarter; and similar to last quarter's trends, from a merchandizing perspective, we saw strong year-over-year sales growth in health and wearables, home theater and appliances, offset by continued softness in mobile phones and tablets.","Industry sales in the NPD reported categories which don't reflect mobile phone and appliance sales, declined 1.9% including the benefit of the shift of the Super Bowl into Q1 fiscal 2017. We also saw significant gains in our net promoter score, which improved more than 600 basis points compared to this time last year, more than 600 basis points.","In our International business, strong execution and higher sales retention in our Canadian business, drove a better-than expected revenue decline of 1.2% on a constant currency basis, despite closing approximately one-third or 66 of our of our large format stores on March 28th of last year.","On a reported basis, revenue declined 8% versus our guidance of 15% to 20% decline, primarily due to a lower than expected negative impact from foreign currency and the higher sales retention we have seen in Canada. So all together, a strong quarter and I want to thank our teams across all functions, for delivering these results.","Now I\u2019d like to share highlights of the progress we are making against our fiscal 2017 priorities. As we discussed on our Q4 call, our first priority is to build on our strong industry position in multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing business. This involves in implementing a number of initiatives across merchandizing, marketing, digital, stores, supply chain, services and customer care.","In Appliances, we leveraged our 176 specific kitchen and home stores-within-a-store and ongoing market share gains to deliver a 14% increase in revenue, and our 22nd consecutive quarter of comp sales growth. As a reminder, we will continue to rollout incremental stores-within-a-store throughout the year.","In home theater, our market-leading customer experienced around 4k and large screen technologies continued to drive sales growth and market share gains. We continue to build on this experience by rolling out 376 new LG experiences in addition to our existing Sony and Samsung experiences.","In Computing, similar to home theater, our partnership with key vendors and the strength of our market-leading position has created a superior customer experience that is driving continued market share gains.","In mobile, we added 25 incremental Verizon and AT&T stores-within-a-store to the 250 we rolled out in the back half of last year. However, the mobile phone category remains challenging as industry demand continues to be soft. Despite this current softness, we continue to believe that over the course of the year, iconic new phone launches can drive renewed growth in this category.","In our online business, our 24% sales growth was driven by continued improvement to our digital customer experience and enhanced dot-com capabilities, including faster shipping.","We continue to focus on improving the shopping journey for our customers, including streamlining the checkout process providing visibility earlier in the shopping funnel for local store product availability, improving the quality and relevance of product recommendations and increasing search relevancy and accuracy.","In our retail stores, the level of proficiency and engagement of our associates is continuing to drive meaningful improvements in our net promoter score among both purchasers and non-purchasers and is contributing to our market share gains.","In our services business, we continue to drive improvements in our service quality and increased our Net Promoter Score. Year-over-year our Geek Squad agents also drove more customer interactions across our channels and helped more customers use and enjoy their technology products.","As expected, overall services revenue declined during the quarter due to the carryover effect of the pricing investments we made last September, as well as the ongoing reductions of retail revenue driven by lower frequency of claims on our extended warranty.","As a reminder, while at face value this repair revenue decline appears negative, it is actually financially beneficial because it reflects a reduction of our extended warranty costs.","In our international business, we remain focused on our Canadian transformation as reflected in our revenue performance, customer retention is proving to be higher than expected.","Looking ahead, our team is focused on continuing to invest in our stores and online channel to improve the customer experience and financial performance, something that is enabled by the consolidation of the two brands.","And a second fiscal 2017 priority is to reduce costs and drive efficiencies throughout the business. Reducing cost is essential for us to be able to fund our investments, those our resilience to product cycles and increase our profitability over time. A key element to achieving this is simplifying and streamlining our core business processes, simultaneously improving the customer and employee experience and driving costs out.","This work is well on its way. I want to stress that this is not an isolated short-term cost reduction program, we are establishing a lean culture focused on systematically eliminating non-quality and defects. This approach requires collaboration across teams and fractions and we are building the organizational capabilities, mind set and habits necessary to sustain changes.","As it relates to our renewed Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization target of $400 million over three years, we achieved another $50 million in the first quarter bringing our current achievement to $200 million.","The third fiscal 2017 priority is to advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation. While there may be short-term pressures, we continue to believe, we operate in an opportunity rich environment. We are investing to make it easy for customers to learn about and enjoy the latest technology as they pursue their passions and take care of what is important for them in their life.","We see fiscal 2017 as a year of exploration and experimentation around creating compelling customer experiences that have the potential to unlock growth. Throughout the year, we will be testing and piloting several concepts around the country and with our combination of digital store and in-home assets, we feel we have a great opportunity to address key customer pain points, build stronger ongoing relationships with our customers and unleash growth opportunities.","So to recap, we delivered a strong first quarter and are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 full year financial outlook that we provided in our Q4 call. That outlook includes approximately flat revenue in non-GAAP operating income, with EPS growth driven by share repurchases.","Although we are reporting better-than expected results today, we are not raising our full year outlook as the first quarter represents less than 15% of full year earnings and at this stage, we have no new material information as it relates to product launches throughout the year.","And now, and of course, it's a bit emotional, let me turn the call over to my friend, Sharon McCollam. Sharon, anything you\u2019d like to share with us this morning?","Sharon McCollam","Yes, I do, Hubert. Thank you. While I remain in advisory capacity through the end of the year, this is my last official call as CFO and as such, I want to take this opportunity to express what an immense privilege it has been to be part of this incredible transformation.","With our team of more than 125,000 people, we have worked hand-in-hand to Renew Blue. And today, as I prepare to step down to my current role, and spend more time with my husband and my family, I do so knowing that we have never been as well positioned as we are today to take Best Buy to a new level.","I\u2019d like to thank my peers, our corporate and field teams, and in particular, my direct reports for their exceptional contributions that have made this possible. I would also like to thank our Board and you, our shareholders and analysts for your confidence and support.","Additionally, I want to publicly congratulate Corie. Corie has been my strategic right-hand partner since I joined Best Buy. With her exceptional financial acumen and deep understanding of Best Buy\u2019s operations, she has been an influential leader over the financial and cost disciplines that have been established across the company over the past several years. She has also a highly respected cross-functional leader and will be an incredible CFO of whom I could not be more proud or confident. So congratulations Corie.","And of course, I want to thank Hubert, he is an extraordinary leader and an inspiring business partner and a friend. I will be forever grateful to have had the opportunity to share this journey with you and our entire Best Buy family.","Hubert Joly","Okay, thank you, Sharon. We owe you so much. Thank you.","Sharon McCollam","Thank you, Hubert. Okay, so now let\u2019s talk about our Q1 results. Before I talk about these results last year, I would like to discuss them versus the expectations we shared with you in our Q4 call.","Enterprise revenue of $8.44 billion exceeded our expectations driven equally by the outperformance of our domestic and international businesses. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44 also exceeded our expectations primarily due to the flow through of higher revenues.","Additionally, a lower effective income tax rate contributed to an incremental penny of EPS versus our expectations.","I will now talk about our Q1 results versus last year. On a constant currency basis, Enterprise revenue declined 0.8% to $8.44 billion primarily due to the impact of domestic and Canadian store closures. On a reported basis, Enterprise revenue declined 1.3% reflecting approximately 55 basis points of negative foreign currency impact.","Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.07 or 19% to $0.44. This increase was primarily driven by Canada which is lapping the disrupted impact from the brand consolidation last year and a $0.04 per share benefit from share repurchases. These increases were partially offset by the negative impact of lower revenue in the Domestic segment, and a higher non-GAAP effective income tax rate.","In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased a less than expected 0.8% to $7.8 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by the loss of revenues from 13 large format and 24 Best Buy mobile store closures. Comparable sales were essentially flat. From a merchandizing perspective, comparable sales growth in health and wearables, home theater, major appliances and computing was offset by decline in mobile phones, tablets and gaming.","As expected, television sales related to the shift of the Super Bowl into Q1 2017 positively impacted the Domestic segment by approximately 70 basis points. In Services, comparable revenue declined 10.7% due to investments in services pricing and the ongoing reduction of repair revenue driven by lower frequency of claims on extended warranties.","Domestic comparable online revenue increased 23.9% to $832 million, primarily due to higher conversion rate and increased traffic. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 210 basis points to 10.6% versus 8.5% last year.","In our International segment, on a constant currency basis, revenue declined 1.2% to $614 million due primarily to closed stores in Canada. On a reported basis, International revenue declined 8.1% reflecting approximately 690 basis points of negative foreign currency impacts.","Turning now to gross profit, the Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 30 basis points to 23.2%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 10 basis points to 23% primarily due to a prior year reserve on non-iconic phone inventory which did not recur this year and improved rates primarily driven by our more disciplined promotional strategy across product categories. These increases were partially offset by our investments in service pricing.","The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 310 basis points to 25.9% primarily driven by a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada as we lapped the significant disruption and corresponding increased promotional activities related to the brand consolidation in Q1 fiscal 2016 and we received a higher periodic profit sharing payment in our Services business.","Now turning to SG&A, Enterprise level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.7 billion or 20.3% of revenue, a decrease of $24 million or flat on a rate basis. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.56 billion or 19.9% of revenue, which was flat year-over-year as investments in the business were offset by the flow through of Renew Blue phase two cost reductions.","From a rate perspective, non-GAAP SG&A increased 10 basis points, primarily driven by year-over-year sales deleverage. International non-GAAP SG&A was $156 million or 25.4% of revenue, a decrease of $23 million or 140 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by the elimination of expenses associated with the Canadian brand consolidation and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates.","I will now discuss our fiscal 2017 and Q2 2017 outlook. As Hubert said, from a financial outlook perspective, we are reaffirming our expectations of approximately flat revenues and flat non-GAAP operating income for the full year including lapping the significant periodic profit-sharing benefits from our Services plans portfolio that we earned in fiscal 2016.","A key element to achieve this, will be the delivery of our cost reduction and gross profit optimization initiatives. Based on current industry dynamic and how we see the various product cycles playing out, we are expecting slight declines in revenue in the first half followed by growth in the back half.","As we discussed on our last earnings call, we recognize this will be challenging without a stronger mobile cycle and improvement in the NPD reported categories overall.","I would now like to talk about our Q2 financial guidance. For Q2, we are expecting enterprise revenue in the range of $8.35 billion to $8.45 and both Enterprise and Domestic comparable sales of approximately flat.","We expect International revenue to decline approximately 5% to 10% on a reported basis, but to be flat on a constant currency basis. We expect our Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.42, assuming a diluted weighted average share count of approximately $325 million and a non-GAAP effective income tax rate in the range of 36% to 36.5%.","Inline with our original expectations, there are two factors impacting our Q2 year-over-year non-GAAP EPS guidance. First, we are expecting an approximate $0.03 net negative impact from the lapping of the periodic profit sharing payment from our services plan portfolio that we received in the second quarter of last year.","Second, we are expecting an approximate $0.06 negative impact from the carryover of last September\u2019s Services pricing investment. In addition, in digital imaging, we are now expecting an approximate $0.03 to $0.04 negative impact due to the April 2016 earthquake in Japan, which is impacting inventory availability in this high marking category.","Combined, these are putting $0.12 to $0.13 of pressure on Q2 fiscal 2017 which will be partially offset by approximate $0.04 benefit from share repurchases.","I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Matt McClintock with Barclays.","Matt McClintock","Good morning, everyone, and best of luck, Sharon. Really, we're going to miss you. I was wondering if we could talk about the online growth rate for the quarter. I think that's the best growth rate you guys have achieved in two years and it's interesting, because it's coming at a time that we're seeing other retailers, their growth rates decelerate and your growth rate online is accelerating. Can you maybe talk a little bit more in detail on what's going on in that business specifically? Thank you.","Hubert Joly","Yes, thank you, Matt, and good morning. We are very focused on the digital experience for a couple of reasons, one is, the e-commerce channel is growing and two, it\u2019s impacting the entire business. Specifically, to the growth rate in e-commerce, the 24% growth rate is a very good number. It\u2019s really the cumulative effect of the investments we\u2019ve been making in the last three years that are impacting the customer experience.","We are shipping faster, that\u2019s a very important point. But if you go on the site and I hope all of you regular shoppers on the site, you know, three years ago we\u2019d have calculated our site as being clunky. Today there is all sorts of good surprises, as you shop, as you research, as you look for information about the products.","We\u2019ve made improvements in the quarter, on the checkout process. So, it\u2019s a lot of small changes, both on the site itself and of course, the mobile experience that\u2019s been investing significantly. So really a combination of what\u2019s happening on the site, the shipping experience, we've improved in-store pickup, the experience in the stores. So it's an all out effort.","Really the cumulative impact of the investment and improvements we\u2019ve been making over the last three years.","Matt McClintock","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question is from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin","Hey guys, and congratulations to Corie and good luck, Sharon. I guess, I wanted to go the same route with the e-commerce and just as it grows and I am actually on your website right now and clearly you guys have done a lot of work. Does - how does it fit into the stores? In other words, how does it fit into the asset base and your thought process around the asset base if the growth in e-commerce continues at such a rapid clip? Does it make you think that maybe some further store closures would be on the table or no?","Hubert Joly","Well, thank you for the question. If we think of the company as a company that is there to provide a great experience for the customer across all channels and increasingly it will be difficult to measure the contribution of each channel, because and you guys all know the shopping journey starts online may then be completed online or in the stores, there is a journey to the store.","If you are going to buy a 4K TV the only way to see the quality of the picture and ask questions is really in the store, but then the transaction may be completed in the store or online. So our overall goal as a company frankly, is to accelerate the total revenue growth from the customers, existing customers and new customers, so that we can create shareholder value and value for all of the stakeholders.","In a context where revenue, total revenue would be flat, then yes, it would put pressure on the economics in the business. As you know, from a store portfolio standpoint, since the beginning of the Renew Blue journey, we have said that we would over time optimize the store footprint, and we're doing this on an ongoing basis and we are ready to continue to do that. But I would say, the overriding objective is to accelerate the growth so that it can lift our boats in our journey. Sharon, anything you would like to add to this?","Sharon McCollam","Yes, Hubert, I also want to point out the strategic portfolio that we have at stores because, about a third of our customers still today actually choose to pick their orders up in our stores. So this alignment between the online channel and the ability to let the customer receive their product either through the mail or in our store, but it's more importantly about how they choose to receive it.","Additionally, our stores are the magic that go behind our ship from store and our delivery times, which as you know, we\u2019ve created North Star which is Amazon Prime, and with that, our stores are essential to that process. So the store portfolio, while to Hubert's point, we had rationalized the portfolio and we will continue to do so. The stores are also really working hard on a concept which we talked about for a long time which is our value-add.","And the stores have a critical role in the growth, not only of our store channel, but the e-com channel and today, the number of orders that are actually being placed in our stores online and that capability, that Hubert talked about capabilities that we\u2019ve been building, we have been making it easier and easier for us to convert a customer where there maybe something that may not be in a store and they want it in the stores, our Blue Shirts are doing a remarkable job of converting that order in the store which turns into an online order.","So, from a portfolio standpoint, I think our store portfolio is extremely strategic and we will continue to rationalize it, but quite frankly, it just continues to lift its performance and that\u2019s great news for us.","Scott Mushkin","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler ","Thanks a lot. Good morning, Sharon. All the best to you, of course. My question relates to wireless. If you could talk about, within that mobile and computing line item, which was picked up a little bit of ground versus Q4 what you saw specifically for the wireless trend in Q1 relative to the Q4 decline that you had noted?","Hubert Joly","Yes, good morning, Matt. The wireless industry market and there is some public information around this, has continued to be quite soft in the quarter as we anniversary a more iconic launch the previous year. So it\u2019s continued to be soft and we continue to believe that significant launches in the back half of the year can revert the trends. So really, very consistent pattern compared to the previous quarter, to be specifically answering your question.","Sharon McCollam","And just adding to that, Matt, adding to that, it is I think important to note though, that when there were some new product launches in the quarter, we did see an improvement in performance and so that gives us confidence that, as new things, I don\u2019t want to exaggerate that, as new things come to market, we have seen a slight improvement in that in the back half of the quarter.","Matthew Fassler ","And to the extent that your same-store sales declined in Domestic computing and mobile moderated to 3.5% from 6.5% was that improvement then in computing as opposed to wireless?","Hubert Joly","Yes, so, computing, we have a very strong position in computing. We\u2019ve in partnership with key vendors we built a superior customer experience we've a place where to shop for computer - we are gaining share and we\u2019ve accelerated our momentum in the quarter compared to the previous quarter, absolutely.","Matthew Fassler ","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.","Greg Melich ","Thanks. Wanted to follow-up on the SG&A comment, and I think in the prepared comments, Hubert and Sharon, you talked about taking out costs to increase investment. So if you look at that number, if you just look at the Domestic SG&A, which was flat, I guess, year-over-year, how much of that was cost out and how much of that was investment and if we thought about it going forward, is the first quarter sort of typical, if you think about the rest of the year in terms of that investment? Thanks.","Hubert Joly","Yes, so, thank you for \u2013 good morning, Greg. Thank you for your question. Strategically, we are very focused \u2013 we\u2019ve been very focused and we will continue to be very focused on driving efficiencies throughout the business. So as to \u2013 as we said, from the investments and increase our resilient cycles and over time improve our profitability.","Quarter-to-quarter things will fluctuate a little bit based on variable compensation, marketing, that fluctuates a little bit. In the first quarter, we are very proud of the cost reductions we\u2019ve made that have offset the investments. So, for the full year, that\u2019s the pattern.","We have talked about and that will continue to drive and we are pacing ourselves with the discipline that we have. We are pacing the investment base on the cost reduction. Sharon, anything you\u2019d like to add?","Sharon McCollam","Yes, Hubert. So, and as you just \u2013 remember that as you look towards Q2, we are expecting to see a similar SG&A outcome dollar decline in Q2 as well. Again, that will be investments being offset by the recognition of our Renew Blue phase two cost reductions.","But, sequentially, Q2 is always a bigger SG&A quarter for us, because our advertising kicks in to our back-to-school. So, when you are looking at it sequentially quarter-to-quarter, much better to take a look at it, because we do have seasonality in the SG&A, best to look at it year-over-year, but in the Q2 outlook, we are anticipating that SG&A will \u2013 at Enterprise level, it\u2019s going to look very similar to Q1 on a year-over-year basis.","Greg Melich ","Great. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Brad Thomas ","Thank you. Good morning. Sharon, best wishes to you and Corie, congratulations. I wanted to ask a question about International and I was just hoping for an update on how things are progressing in Canada. What kind of transfer rate you've been seeing from the brand consolidation and what sort of operating income and EPS benefit you are looking forward to this year? Thank you.","Hubert Joly","Yes, good morning, Brad, and thank you for your question. We are very excited about the changes we have made in Canada. It\u2019s going to take a while before things settle, because year-over-year comparisons are going to be little bit difficult to assess, that sort of with a lot of disruptions in Q1, Q2 and going into Q3.","So, but altogether, the decision to consolidate the two brands was very fundamental to our future. As you remember, that these two brands often time, two stores in the same parking lot made it difficult for us to invest in the stores, because many of them were sort of critical mass and so, we have unlocked that. The retention has been materially better than expected and much better than what we are seeing in the US and that\u2019s a strong capability.","Probably the reflection on our strong leadership position in the market and the combination of higher retention and closing stores of course, will have a positive impact on the profitability. This is going to be a smaller more profitable business for us, but above and beyond the short-term profit improvement, the long-term commitment with now that we have simplified the business is the ability that we have to invest in the customer experience online, in the stores and in the home.","So, that\u2019s what\u2019s it. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve given specific numbers on the retention materially, but we can almost do the math, because Canada is the bulk of the international business. We have given you the dates at which we\u2019ve closed the stores. The number of stores and you can almost do the math. It\u2019s a pretty significant retention. So we are very happy about it.","Brad Thomas ","Great. Thank you.","Sharon McCollam","Yes, Brad \u2013 just take a look at the \u2013 on a reported basis the revenue on a constant currency basis, just declined little over 1% and obviously, at the end of March last year, we closed a third of our stores about 60 plus stores. So, when you look at that, you can see the retention is pretty exceptional and the execution of that team has been remarkable.","Brad Thomas ","And of course, it looks like it's shaping up to be a nice contributor here this year, any reason that the pace of benefit that we saw in the first quarter may not continue at this rate going forward?","Hubert Joly","Yes, absolutely, because the \u2013 said in the first part of my response, the year-over-year comparison is going to be very muddy for the few quarters. Think about last quarter. We closed stores in the middle of the quarter. We actually closed the Future Shop for a full week.","The Future Shop that continued, we closed them for a full week to retrain the associates. For several months, the Future Shop stores, even though we have announced that we were closing Future Shops, the Future Shop store still look like Future Shop stores. It took us let into the summer to rebrand them as Best Buy stores.","So if you can imagine the Canadian customer who is very confused. Then there was some extraordinary expenses last year as we were going through the transition. And so, it\u2019s really difficult to \u2013 you should not extrapolate. Let me be very clear. The Q1 results, and assume that\u2019s the kind of improvement is going to be something, we fully expect it\u2019s going to be better, but it\u2019s going to be rocky comparison from the first few quarters.","Sharon McCollam","And, Brad, as a reminder, we talked about when we did the Canadian brand consolidation, which is actually exciting. We have been testing into some work in our stores. We have talked about, there would be a capital investment this year that was when we gave our outlook on CapEx for this year.","There was a little more CapEx because we were going to do more work in Canada. We\u2019ve been doing it very methodically testing seeing what works, rolling it very judiciously and what Hubert is speaking to, as we work through the year, is they are going to be periods, especially before holiday while we will be making some of those investments and so, it will be some puts and takes in the next couple quarters around Canada. But there is no question that we are expecting a improvement in their performance.","Brad Thomas ","Gotcha. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS","Michael Lasser ","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Best of luck, Sharon and congratulations, Corie. Hubert, the spread between Best Buy's Domestic same-store sales and the change in the category as measured by NPD compressed a bit this quarter suggesting that your share gains moderated a bit. Why do you think that was? And is it right to expect that this tighter spread from the first quarter will persist moving forward or might it even compress a bit further from here?","Hubert Joly","So, good morning, Michael. I appreciate it\u2019s hard to track, because what we have when we report our earnings, is NPD, and NPD for us is a meaningful part of the categories we talk about 60% flat. But it excludes appliances and phones. And so, why the NPD category has improved, and bear in mind that there is a suitable, but it\u2019s not 1.9% probably may be between 2.5% and 3% decline of NPD when normalizing for the suitable.","You have a very material decline in phones. And so, we estimated that we are continuing to gain share at a pretty consistent pattern. We have not seen any material change there. Of course, it varies by category.","We think that, I mean, if the entire strategy of the company over the last three years on top of the cost reductions was made, is the very systematic and significant improvements in the customer experience across all touch points across all channels that are resulting in us gaining share and being able to reach the revenue for this quarter. So, no material change Michael. We will continue to monitor this, but bear in mind, the softness in mobile.","Michael Lasser ","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","We will go next to Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan.","Chris Horvers ","Thanks. Good morning. Sharon, first off, congratulations on how much you contributed to the Best Buy turnaround and congratulations Corie, as well. So, just following up on that question, can you talk about share in the TV category and I think a lot of retailers talk about deceleration in the April, May timeframe.","It doesn't seem like that actually happened to you, because ex Super Bowl shift you are still guiding to about the same comp in the second quarter. So, what changed in the business during that timeframe? Was that PC getting better? Was that Mobile picking up a little bit more there? Thanks.","Hubert Joly","So, Chris, good morning. In the quarter, I think, compared to our expectations, computing was better. No doubt about this. Again the results of our partnerships with the key vendors and great customer experience across all of the touch points, computing was better and phones was softer.","And, the week-to-week, month-to-month variations are not going to go there because it\u2019s they go with this or that. But on a quarterly basis, yes, you\u2019ve heard our Q2 guidance and it\u2019s very consistent with Q1. And so, we will continue move for this. One element of philosophy for the company is that, there maybe situations in the customer buying intentions and mood and so forth, we know what we can control.","And the focus on execution, the ability to control what we can control is the key mantra to the company across all touch points, and believe me, while we are proud of what we\u2019ve done, we have so much more to do across all channels in driving our performance, we will continue to be focused on that. When we manage our teams, we are not interested in excuses of any sorts. It\u2019s all about the performance they can drive.","Chris Horvers ","And then on the TV share question?","Sharon McCollam","Yes, we did gain share in television and we\u2019d expect to, based on the premium experience that we have to offer the customer in our store. We continue with the tremendous partnership that we have with Samsung and Sony and LG, et cetera. With our partnerships, we have an exceptional experience in our stores.","These are still new technologies for all the customers that are buying new 4K TVs and we are continuing to offer the customer a very, very strong experience and I think that\u2019s differentiating us from others. I also think that as you are looking at these weeks and months as industry data, including even the NPD data, this Super Bowl shift is really a big shift for all of us.","So, I think that the conversation gets a little sloppy, because of the Super Bowl shift. So, t that\u2019s just a broad statement for all when you are interpreting all of the results that are coming out, I think that is an issue.","Hubert Joly","If I may, add one word on TVs, looking ahead, I think that everybody would expect that. Various product cycles and Best Buy tends to do particularly well in the first part of the \u2013 every product cycle and then as the technology gets more mass, then it gets into more places.","And at some point, the growth in TVs will slow down, if not revert on them, at some point, we would expect, could not be able to hold the kind of great share we\u2019ve had. We are not surrendering in advance, but as investors, you guys are been around, you know that this is the kind of thing that happens. So when it happens, don\u2019t be surprised.","Chris Horvers ","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Gutman ","Thanks, congratulations, Sharon, and we'd welcome you out of retirement any time. A question on Renew Blue two, I think you are now at $200 million of savings, about halfway to that $400 million goal. It seems like it's going well and maybe faster than you've been \u2013 you\u2019ve expected and you've mentioned there is some upside. Are there any large items that's on a future list that\u2019s not part of that bucket yet that you can haven\u2019t been able to touch, because you are waiting for other capabilities to fall into place? Just thinking about ways you can get upside to those numbers.","Hubert Joly","Yes, the pattern in the last few years has been to increase the number when we achieve the number. Remember, when we had announced $725 million, we increased it to $1 billion when we had achieved that $725 million. So, we fully expect to continue that pattern.","This said, in this new phase, I think this is a very exciting new phase, this notion of ongoing process improvements and lean approach, I think is very exciting, because it because it simultaneously improves the employee experience, the customer experience and the cost structure.","The buckets we are attacking has a lot to do which causes overall product flow integrated supply chain as you would like which of course includes the work we still have to do on returns, replacements and damages and end of life and so forth. While we have a pattern of humbly looking at one step at a time, the overall cost structure there and process improvement opportunities give us a lot of optimism around what can be done.","So, the teams are very busy at work. They are very methodical and we\u2019ll keep you updated. We are not going to give a number today, but we are confident that we will be able to have a gift that keeps giving over many years coming from that broad area.","Simeon Gutman ","And the $400 million, that goal is by the end of next fiscal year?","Hubert Joly","We had given three years. So that would be correct.","Simeon Gutman ","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse.","Seth Sigman ","Thanks. Good morning, and Sharon, congrats again and obviously Corie, congrats to you, as well. I just want to follow-up on one of the last questions about the near-term outlook. You just did flat comps basically with a 70 basis point benefit from the Super Bowl. You are guiding to flat comps in Q2, so that would imply that something is getting better and you have a pretty difficult comparison in that quarter. So, any more color on how you are thinking about that and what gives you confidence in that underlying trend? Thanks.","Hubert Joly","Yes, good morning. I think the categories that we expect to continue to do well are those that we\u2019ve mentioned, health and wearables or home theater and appliances where we have a strong continued track record offset by phones and tablets and we have referenced the digital imaging piece.","Frankly, the variations you are talking about from one quarter to the other are pretty small. So this is our team\u2019s best estimate based on the improvement in the customer experience. The promotional calendar, the momentum in the various product categories and then we are focused on delivering that.","No massive shifts, it\u2019s a lot of small moving pieces that equates to this aggregate number which is not a huge variation again. Even if you take the Super Bowl piece, it\u2019s less than 100 basis points. So it\u2019s really small, but we are on it.","Seth Sigman ","Okay, that's helpful. And just one follow-up question about the mobile category, specifically, how you are thinking about Best Buy mobile standalone stores? So I realize there is some optimism about the second half outlook here and some of the product drivers, but the growth of the category has been a little bit more challenged.","Is there any more color you can provide on how those Best Buy mobile standalone stores have performed, even just in relative terms, from a profit perspective and if there is an opportunity to maybe accelerate some of the closings, I think you still have 350 or so stores? Thanks.","Hubert Joly","Do you want to take that?","Sharon McCollam","Sure, I\u2019d be happy to. So, our Best Buy mobile stores actually play a very strategic marketing role for us at Best Buy. And we are going to have cycles in mobile ups and downs. These are obviously our smaller stores. But these teams in our mobile stores have some of the highest NPS scores in the entire mobile business, because of the specialty nature of how we can serve our customers in those stores.","They also tend to fit in malls versus our big box stores which do not fit in malls. So they play a very interesting strategic marketing role. Now we have said for the last several years that when you are thinking about in modeling our business, you really need to model the big boxes.","The mobile stores, our goal for the mobile stores is to make them a colorful marketing customer service vehicle, a convenience place for our customers, but as far as increases in profits over the years et cetera, that is not a modeling that we are doing and we\u2019d certainly wouldn\u2019t want you guys to do that, only to be plus or minus a little, but they are quite small.","And as far as the rationalization, we have closed some of the stores, again, very similar to our view on the big box stores. We want to continue to offer to our customers these retail locations where it makes sense. When a store doesn\u2019t make sense, you guys know we have not been shy about closing a few here and there. But at this point, there is no major plan out there to further rationalize that portfolio. I don\u2019t know about you guys, that I love free marketing and the fact that they can pay for themselves and offer our customers such an exceptional experience is a pretty compelling reason to let this fleet run.","Seth Sigman ","Okay. Thanks again and best of luck.","Hubert Joly","Thank you.","Operator","Next is Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli ","Hey guys. Scot Ciccarelli. Can you provide any more color on the TV business? Namely, what are you seeing today in terms of unit velocity versus ASP compression and then how do you expect that to play out in the second half? Thanks.","Hubert Joly","Yes, good morning, Scot. You do have ASP compression year-over-year, which makes it \u2013 which makes 4K large screen TVs very exciting to buy and help with the penetration. So, that\u2019s, of course the characteristic of our business and it\u2019s quite material. I think for NPD, the decline for 4K average selling price is approximately 30% during the period we\u2019ve had. So that\u2019s very material.","We expect this will continue in the back half and so forth which will make the category very exciting from a consumer standpoint. And again, we\u2019ll start to bring this to a more mass status. We remain very confident in the amazing customer experience that we\u2019ve built both online, but notably in our stores. If you want to buy a 4K TV, we are the place to do this. Our teams are ready.","Scot Ciccarelli ","Great, and just a clarification there, Hubert. If we continue to see the ASP declines that we are and presumably there tends to be some even further acceleration just from a seasonal standpoint, what are we thinking about, in terms of actual revenue from the TV category in terms of - is unit velocity, unit growth enough to offset the ASP declines or are we getting to that point where, as you referenced earlier, TV isn't necessarily growing at that point? Thanks.","Hubert Joly","Yes, of course, looking into the back half of the year, last year where we had some pretty significant ASP declines, but, to your point and my comment earlier, there will be a point of time to call exactly when, when the ASP decline will in fact impact the overall revenue in the industry. So, this is a big category for us. We are doing well with it, but there will be a point where we should expect to see that.","Scot Ciccarelli ","Okay, I'll follow-up. Thank you.","Hubert Joly","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Baker ","Thanks. So two questions, I'll ask them at the same time. One, just on product category, I know it's early, but just wondering your thoughts on virtual reality and if that can help drive the mobile business at all in the second half.","And then, I guess, an unrelated, but I'll throw it in there question, anyway, is buybacks a little bit lower than of course, in the fourth quarter, but it looks like, if we look at last year you also did not buy a lot of shares in the first quarter. So do we expect a similar type pattern to play out, not a lot of buybacks in the first quarter and then accelerating through the year?","Sharon McCollam","Yes, I\u2019ll let Hubert take virtual reality, I\u2019ll then come back to you on share repurchase.","Hubert Joly","Yes, virtual reality is a very exciting technology. I bet you all have seen that we were the exclusive place where you could try the Oculus in our stores. So a lot of excitement there. The impact on the business this year is going to be very marginal. So, I think exciting from a consumer NPR standpoint, very small at this point from a revenue standpoint. Sharon, on the buyback, why didn\u2019t we buy more shares in the first quarter?","Sharon McCollam","Hubert, yes, it really is the way our pattern has been since we\u2019ve been buying shares back. Remember that, we \u2013 because of year end earnings releases, there is a period in the middle of the first quarter where we are out of the market until we get our information out there.","So we are always going to be a little bit lower probably in the first quarter, you guys can probably expect that, because that\u2019ll be probably be the case and then of course, we are absolutely committed to our $1 billion repurchase over the next couple of years. So, we are all in on that.","Hubert Joly","Yes.","Mike Baker ","Thank you.","Operator","And our final question will come from David Schick with Consumer Edge Research.","David Schick","Hi, good morning, and I will add my congratulations to Sharon and Corie, the long list of congratulations. In our store checks, we see the Blue Shirts very engaged and consultative over the last quarter or two, not that they weren't before but sort of reaching a new level, and I know you've been working on that.","Could you talk about how that focus works at the store level? Could you talk about how we should think about that impacting the business? Is it building steam? Or is there some sort of lap we should understand in that emphasis?","Hubert Joly","David, thank you, so much for your comment. This will go to the heart of all of our Blue Shirts, the fact that we are telling them that we are seeing it, it\u2019s great the fact that you are seeing is just terrific and I want to publicly again recognize their work. The work on developing the engagement and proficiency in the stores has been a key area for us and I have to give credit \u2013 where credit is due to Shari Ballard and her team across the country in driving that.","What is the form that it takes is your question. It\u2019s a number of things. The most impressive thing is that the individual level. The philosophy is that the performance of Best Buy is really the sum of the individual performance of each individual associate. The way you lift the performance of Best Buy is by getting more of the associates to be very proficient, very engaged and to achieve their individual sales targets.","As you know we are not commissioned, but we are driving performance. The form it takes in the stores is through daily coaching. Every morning, when you check in as an associate, you spend time with your supervisor looking at the results and getting a one-on-one and it\u2019s absolutely world-class and coaching about how you can get better at your job.","The individual associates - looking at the performance will look at whatever things they can get better, they may get some ideas from their manager and then check ins during the day and then check-in at the end of the day. It\u2019s a systematic approach.","Now, on top of that, we are increasingly focused on listing the product knowledge, the proficiencies, selling skills and product knowledge with moving to certify the associates and raising the bar in terms of what\u2019s expected. All of the executive team at Best Buy is certified to sell 4K TV and high-end networking equipment showing that it\u2019s part of the job.","If the boss says kind of do the job, then, it\u2019s not a good company. So, there is a \u2013 and then of course, it goes to all of the associates. So it\u2019s really beautiful to see, we believe there is a lot more room to drive performance on that basis. We look at, Shari, the percentage of - and her team, we look at the percentage of associates who are achieving the individual sales targets, we see a lot of room for improvement.","And that\u2019s a continued focus of the way it manifests itself is that, a store gets the traffic it gets, that\u2019s not within essentially the control of the store, but they are focused on, what we call value-add, which is the difference between the traffic and then the comp stores in the stores and with a given traffic, you can get different results.","And so, with the same amount of payroll, you can get different results. So, we think that this is another gift that we will keep giving and truly a remarkable set of accomplishment so far. So, Shari, congratulations for your work. But beyond, Shari, well done to the entire Best Buy team across the stores.","Couldn't be more proud. So, I need to conclude the call. I want to thank all of you for our joining us today. Again, a very strong quarter. Again, I want to congratulate all of our teams. We are - as you can see, we are very excited to have the opportunity to continue to work on our key priorities and with the opportunities that are related to that.","I want to join everybody, of course, on the call in congratulating Sharon and Corie. I know, Corie is very much looking forward to meeting all of you and working with all of you. I know, Sharon is very much looking forward to introducing.","As a reminder, Sharon is not going away, as she is going to be here until the end of the year in an advisory role. She will introduce Corie to each of the investors and analysts and work with Corie to make this an incredibly seamless transition. It\u2019s going to be one of Sharon\u2019s legacy to have successfully onboarded \u2013 chosen and onboarded and grooomed and onboarded Corie. So, very exciting time ahead.","Thank you so much for your attention. You all have a great day.","Sharon McCollam","Bye guys.","Operator","And this concludes today\u2019s call.

I\u2019ll begin today with a review of our first quarter performance and the progress we made against our fiscal 2018 priorities. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and our financial outlook. We are pleased today to report strong top and bottom line growth for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We grew our Enterprise comparable sales by 1.6%, improved our non-GAAP operating income rate by 70 basis points to 3.5% and delivered non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.60, up 40% compared to $0.43 last year. Clearly, our revenue was higher than our expectations going into the quarter. This was due to strong performance in gaming, a better than expected result in mobile and the improvement of our overall sales trends within the quarter due to the arrival of delayed federal tax refund checks. Let me briefly elaborate on these three points.","First, we delivered a strong performance in gaming due to robust customer demand and good product allocations for the new hardware that launched during the quarter. Second, as expected, while mobile was not a growth area due to last year\u2019s product recall and the fact that new phones launched later in the quarter than they did last year, sales in the quarter were better than we expected as new unlimited data plan offers from the carriers generated increased demand across devices. Additionally, our strong multichannel execution of the preorder process for the new phone that launched in April resulted in our highest Android preorder sales ever coupled with strong services sales.","Lastly, in the Domestic business, we saw overall sales trend improve from the initial softness at the beginning of the quarter as consumers began receiving their delayed federal tax refund checks.","Let me now talk about our year-over-year performance, starting with our Domestic business. We grew our Domestic comparable sales by 1.4% during the quarter, driven by strengths in computing, Connected Home and gaming, partially offset by continued softness in tablets. We also continued to drive significant growth in the online channel, with Domestic online comparable sales increasing 22.5%, driven by conversion and traffic. Online revenue was nearly 13% of total Domestic revenue compared to 10.6% in the first quarter of last year.","In the International business, we delivered a 4% comparable sales increase, driven by continued growth of online revenue in Canada and Mexico and positive sales lifts associated with the Canadian store redesigns. On the profitability side, at the Enterprise level, continued optimization of merchandise margins and good expense management drove the 70 basis point improvement in operating income rate. So altogether, our Q1 performance reflects the strength of our customer value proposition and continued momentum in the execution of our strategy, and I want to thank all of our associates across the company for their hard work in delivering these results.","Now I\u2019d like to discuss our progress towards Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue. As you may recall, last quarter, we introduced this next phase of our transformation, which is focused on shaping our future and creating a company that customers and employees love and that continues to generate a superior return for our shareholders.","In March, we outlined four priorities we are pursuing during fiscal 2018. While it is early in the year, I will share some highlights of our progress thus far.","The first priority is to explore and pursue growth opportunities around maximizing the multichannel retail business and providing services and solutions that solve real customer needs and help us build deeper customer relationships. We\u2019re continuing to expand several of the new concepts we\u2019ve been testing related to services and solutions.","Earlier this month, we publicly announced our plan to offer a new service, Best Buy Smart Home powered by Vivint, in more than 400 stores by holiday. Guided by in-store experts, customers select from a suite of leading smart home products, including smart locks, lights, cameras, thermostats and more, and get expert installation, app-based system control and a 24\/7 professional monitoring service.","Also in the smart home area, we are curating new product categories across the home. For example, we launched during the quarter a new smart nursery assortment. More broadly, we\u2019re very focused on the smart home as a key part of our Best Buy 2020 strategy, and we will continue to enhance this category across our website and our stores this year. We also expanded the test of our new approach to tech support. Last year in Canada, we began testing a new service offering that provides 24\/7 support for all of the technology products a customer owns regardless of whether they were bought at Best Buy. It also includes other valuable benefits like discounts on installation services and warranty programs. We expanded that pilot to additional markets in Canada, and we are now piloting a version of the program in a couple of U.S. markets.","In our work to maximize the multichannel retail business, we expanded the pilot of our In-Home Advisor program to another major domestic market. We are currently operating in Atlanta, Austin, Orlando, San Antonio and Washington, D.C. We are now planning to roll out the program nationwide later this year. We continue to drive digital innovation, which is, of course, crucial to the success of Best Buy 2020. In Q1, online revenue reached $1 billion for the first time in a non-holiday quarter. We are pleased with our progress and believe there are plenty of opportunities to more effectively help our customers in their shopping journey.","We are pursuing growth around key product categories by refining how we sell, including around emerging product categories like Connected Home; appliances, where we believe we can continue to grow share and revenue; and mobile. As it relates to mobile, we have an initiative focused on improving the multichannel shopping experience for mobile phones. The smartphone industry has significantly changed over the past few years, especially with installment billing plans, unlimited data plans and the proliferation of prepaid and unlocked devices. This can make shopping for a smartphone confusing and complicated.","In response to this changing landscape, we are improving the experience on bestbuy.com and revamping the mobile departments in many of our stores to create a better, easier, more seamless shopping experience for customers. For the new phone launched last month, for example, we simplified the buying experience and provided clarity of carrier offers and ease of phone selection and saw our highest ever Android preorders. This initiative will include other enhancements such as improvements to the phone activation process, the addition of more specially trained mobile associates and new vendor displays. This work will impact several hundred of our stores by the end of Q3.","The second priority for this year is to improve our execution in key areas that support our growth strategy. For example, in our stores, we\u2019re very focused on continuing to improve our sales effectiveness. We\u2019re doing this by providing systematic coaching, training and certification; increasing tenure in our store leadership roles; and lowering associate turnover, all of which is resulting in ongoing NPS improvements related to associate knowledge.","We are also investing in large product fulfillments to both support business growth and materially improve the customer experience. For example, we are collaborating more closely with our vendors to improve inventory availability and in stock levels, and we are optimizing our supply chain process capabilities through standardization and training. Additionally, we\u2019re selectively adding distribution center capacity to support business growth and get products closer to the customer.","The third area of focus from an execution standpoint is to reduce our exposure to excess and obsolete inventories while improving our recovery rates. By more proactively planning product transitions and better managing clearance pricing across sales channels, we materially improved our at-risk inventory position in Q1 versus the prior year, allowing us to reinvest those dollars into the new inventories our customers want.","The third priority for this year is to continue to reduce costs and drive efficiencies throughout the business. We are happy to announce that during the first quarter, we achieved another $50 million in annual cost reductions and gross profit optimization. We\u2019ve now reached our $400 million target three fiscal quarters ahead of our original deadline. And so today, we are announcing a new target of $600 million in additional cost reduction and gross profit optimization to be completed by the end of our fiscal 2021. We continue to have significant opportunities to reduce costs, in particular, through the use of the continuous improvement approach, working cross-functionally to reengineer and pull costs out of complex processes. Consistent with the $400 million plan we just completed, we expect to use these cost reductions to fund investments and to offset ongoing pressures in our business.","The fourth priority for this year is to build the capabilities necessary to deliver on the first three priorities, which will involve making investments in people and systems to drive growth, execution and efficiencies. For example, we\u2019ve been investing in labor expertise across our sales associates and our Geek Squad agents. We are also in the process of rolling out our new warehouse management system and beginning to improve our customer relationship management capabilities, starting with our In-Home Advisors.","So in summary, we began fiscal 2018 with a strong start, and we are energized about our opportunities and the strategy we\u2019re pursuing. We believe we are uniquely positioned to help our customers in a meaningful way with our combination of multichannel assets, including our online, store and in-home capabilities, and I love how our teams are mobilized to deliver on our mission and Build the New Blue.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our CFO, Corie Barry, for more details on our Q1 performance and our Q2 and full year guidance.","Corie Barry","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our first quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter.","On Enterprise revenue of $8.5 billion, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.60, both of which exceeded our expectations. As Hubert mentioned, top line performance exceeded our expectations due to gaming, mobile and the overall general sales trend improvement throughout the quarter as consumers received delayed federal tax refunds, which primarily benefited the computing and home theater category. The better-than-expected EPS was primarily driven by better performance in the Domestic business from the flow-through of the higher revenue along with lower SG&A and a higher gross profit rate.","I will now talk about our first quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 1% to $8.5 billion, primarily due to an Enterprise comparable sales increase of 1.6%. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.17, or 40%, to $0.60. This increase was primarily driven by a higher gross profit rate in the Domestic business, the flow-through of higher Domestic revenue and a $0.02 per share benefit from the net share count change. In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 1.1% to $7.9 billion. This increase was primarily driven by a comparable sales increase of 1.4%, partially offset by the loss of revenue from 12 large format and 40 Best Buy Mobile stores closed during the past year.","From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in computing, Connected Home and gaming was partially offset by declines in tablets and, to a much lesser extent, home theater. As it relates to the home theater category, we continue to gain material market share. However, the industry was softer than recent trends, and our sales were down on a year-over-year basis. In services, the comparable revenue growth of 4.2% was primarily driven by higher warranty sales as we have now lapped the investments in services pricing from last September.","Domestic online revenue of $1.02 billion increased 22.5% on a comparable basis, primarily due to higher conversion rates and increased traffic. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 230 basis points to 12.9% versus 10.6% last year. In our International segment, revenue increased 0.3% to $616 million due to comparable sales growth of 4%, driven by growth in both Canada and Mexico. This growth was partially offset by an approximately 215 basis-point negative impact from lapping the $13 million Q1 FY \u201817 periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio and approximately 150 basis points of negative foreign currency impact.","Turning now to gross profit, the Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 50 basis points to 23.7%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 60 basis points to 23.6%, primarily due to improved margin rates across multiple categories, particularly appliances and home theater, and legal settlement proceeds of $8 million or 10 basis points in the services category. These increases were partially offset by margin pressure in the mobile category and the negative impact of higher sales in the lower-margin gaming category. The International non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 140 basis points to 24.5%, driven by a lower year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada due to approximately 160 basis points of negative impact from lapping the $13 million Q1 fiscal \u201817 periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio.","Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise non-GAAP SG&A was $1.72 billion or 20.2% of revenue, which was flat on a dollar basis but represented a decline of 20 basis points versus last year. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.57 billion or 19.9% of revenue, an increase of $8 million. This increase was primarily driven by slightly higher incentive compensation expenses. International non-GAAP SG&A was $149 million or 24.2% of revenue, a decrease of $8 million. This decrease was primarily driven by slightly lower administrative and payroll and benefits costs. From a cash flow perspective, we ended the first quarter in line with our expectations, which included our planned increase in the quarterly dividend and the acceleration of our share repurchase plan to $3 billion over two years.","I would now like to talk about our Q2 and full year fiscal \u201818 guidance. Our second quarter guidance reflects the continuation of much of the positive category momentum we saw in the first quarter as well as the increased level of growth investments included in our initial annual guidance. For Q2 fiscal \u201818, we expect Enterprise revenue in the range of $8.6 billion to $8.7 billion and Enterprise comparable sales growth in the range of 1.5% to 2.5%. On a segment basis, we are estimating Domestic comparable sales growth in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% and International comparable sales in the range of flat to positive 3%. We expect to deliver non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.57 to $0.62, assuming a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of 36.5% to 37% and a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 310 million shares. This guidance range includes lapping approximately $10 million or $0.02 per share of net negative impact from the periodic profit-sharing benefit from our Domestic service plan portfolio that was recorded in Q2 fiscal \u201817.","For the full year, which, as a reminder, has an extra week in the fourth quarter, we are updating our top line guidance to reflect the better-than-expected first quarter results and our second quarter guidance. We are now expecting revenue growth of approximately 2.5% versus our original outlook of approximately 1.5%. We are now expecting full year non-GAAP operating income growth of 3.5% to 8.5% versus our original outlook of 1% to 3% growth. We recognize it is early in the year, and the first quarter historically has represented approximately 15% of our annual operating income. As such, this outlook range allows for a level of flexibility as we strategically balance our pace of investments, returns from new initiatives, ongoing cost reductions and efficiencies and ongoing pressures in the business, including approximately $60 million of lower profit share revenue. As Mollie noted earlier, our updated full year non-GAAP operating income growth guidance is based on the recast fiscal \u201817 non-GAAP operating income, which is $26 million or 1.5% lower than originally reported.","I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Alright, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Seth Sigman of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Seth Sigman","I wanted to follow up on the guidance for the second quarter. The acceleration that you\u2019re embedding here, it sounds like part of that is just based on the improvement you saw throughout the first quarter. But as you think about Q2 versus Q1, can you maybe walk us through some of the incremental drivers that would support that acceleration? Is that primarily mobile and the launch late in the quarter or other drivers to consider?","Corie Barry","As we said in the release, most of it is just the continuation of the momentum that we had seen in Q1. And then, yes, you\u2019re right to call out some of the later launch of mobile, which we had said earlier would push some of that into the second quarter. So it\u2019s really continuing -- and remember, we started the first quarter incredibly soft. If you\u2019ll recall, that was part about what was embedded into the Q1 guidance. So it\u2019s really the acceleration we saw at the very end of the quarter pushing into Q2. Does that help?","Seth Sigman","That does help. And then from a flow-through perspective, obviously, very strong flow-through this quarter. It\u2019s a small quarter overall, but does that reflect some of the savings that you discussed? Or is there a timing dynamic here where you were assuming lower sales initially? And then as you think about how the year will progress, guidance seems to imply an increase in growth investments, as you talked about. Are you factoring in any incremental benefits from the cost-reduction efforts that Hubert laid out?","Corie Barry","Okay, I\u2019ll try to hit them both. So as it relates to Q2, it was not as much about cost reductions. That was really a balance between investments and cost reductions in the quarter. It was really more what we talked about, some of the profitability that we saw in our categories. And then, remember, I\u2019d mentioned we had a small legal settlement as well that was not expected. And so it was really about the profitability of the categories. And then you\u2019re right to call out maintaining that flat SG&A year-over-year, which was a bit of us kind of catching the trend of sales as the quarter went on. In the back half, you\u2019re right to call out that we believe we see potentially more investments. Really, for us, it\u2019s a balancing act. Hubert talked about a couple of the different initiatives that we\u2019re rolling out in the back half. And we\u2019re still working on exactly when do you roll and how do you roll, and this allows us a little bit of flexibility to make sure we do it right, that we invest appropriately and that we feel like we\u2019re really putting our best foot forward in some of these key initiatives. In terms of the cost-reduction plan we laid out, the guidance -- the cost reduction is implied in the guidance that we gave you. And so we told you, depending on the quarter, sometimes those things would offset nicely, sometimes they wouldn\u2019t. It kind of depends on what the investment profile looks like by quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from Peter Keith of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. ","Peter Keith","I was wondering, with a competitor of yours that recently liquidated and closed 220 stores, what you\u2019re seeing in markets where you may overlap with those closed stores. And if you\u2019d like to give an estimate on maybe what type of sales lift you\u2019ll see going forward from those closings.","Hubert Joly","Yes. Thanks, Peter. So yes, a competitor filed last quarter, and I think they\u2019re finishing the closing of their stores. It\u2019s always a little bit choppy initially, given promotions, liquidation and so forth, but we believe we\u2019re seeing some lift in the sales in the stores, of course, around their locations in appliances and home theater. To provide some order of magnitude, their appliances and home theater business, that\u2019s about $2 billion, and we\u2019ll get a share of that. It\u2019s about 200 stores, so about 20% overlap with our stores. As you can imagine, our teams are very mobilized around maximizing our return from that opportunity, appropriate inventory level position, enhanced marketing investments and, of course, great readiness on the part of our associates to really be helpful to these customers. So we expect this is going to be moderately helpful as we look forward, and we\u2019ll, of course, update you as we move forward.","Corie Barry","And keep in mind, in the $2 billion number that Hubert cited, not all of that is appliances and home theater. There are categories in there that we also don\u2019t participate in. So you\u2019ve got to kind of narrow down exactly what\u2019s available to us.","Peter Keith","Okay. And then on another note, on the gross margin line, particularly in the Domestic segment, you guys have been driving very nice and consistent year-on-year improvement. I was wondering what the go-forward outlook would be. Do you think there\u2019s some sustainability in that trend? And I note that you did comment around improved product transitions and maybe some cost take-outs. And then also, just to pile on, are warranties beginning to have any impact on the gross margin at this point?","Corie Barry","Yes. So I would not expect sustainability of this kind of margin expansion. To your point, we\u2019ve seen this kind of margin expansion, and on the gross profit line specifically, for a while now. We\u2019re starting to lap some of that expansion from last year. And so implied in our guidance is that we expect that to actually moderate into Q2 and then even potentially to have some pressure as we head into the back half, which is, of course, a completely different competitive environment. And a lot of that has to do with, like I said, the lapping. ","The other hard part is in Q1, remember, we had a positive legal settlement, and then in Q2, remember, we\u2019re lapping the profit shares from the prior year. So just sequentially between those two things, that\u2019s 25 basis points of pressure right there. And so you have to -- and we\u2019ll help model out those profit shares throughout the year, but those will continue in Q2, Q3 and Q4, where we lap all of those and they add some pressure to that gross profit line. ","In terms of the warranties, EP specifically, we didn\u2019t call it out, obviously, as a key driver in our walk. It certainly is helpful to see the services side of the business grow. And we like the growth, most importantly, and we like the opportunity to serve our customers and especially, as Hubert said, specifically around mobile, where there\u2019s a really good value proposition there for people who want to keep their phones safe.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matt McClintock from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Matt McClintock","Yes. Hubert, you just mentioned that you\u2019re planning on rolling out the in home advisory service to the -- nationwide later on this year. Can you maybe talk about what gives you the confidence to go forward in such a meaningful way with this program? Specifically because it requires a skill set of actually going into someone\u2019s home, and that\u2019s something that you maybe haven\u2019t necessarily done before in the past.","Hubert Joly","Thank you for your question. So the -- we are operating in several markets, and we\u2019ve been operating now -- it started in San Antonio and Austin 1.5 years ago. And so we have, we feel, after the experience in these various markets, some very good indications. So first, the customer experience is great. If the need of the customer is complex, if you\u2019re redoing your home theater or if your network is -- needs to be improved, having these conversations in the home unlocks all sorts of discussions with the customers. There are some needs that people never talk about in the stores. So we feel the customer response is very, very good. We also feel, to your point about skills, that we\u2019ve been able to really hone and refine the skills requirements, the training necessary to do this right. Initially, and sometimes in these conversations, we -- when people are talking, they say, is that the Geek Squad doing this? No, it\u2019s not the Geek Squad. These are professional, consultative sales consultants and they have broad product knowledge and the ability to really uncover the underlying customer needs. ","So great response from a customer standpoint; great results from a sales standpoint, because we\u2019re doing this as part of a key growth initiative. We\u2019ve also taken the time to look at the tools we need to be able to do this. So I referenced a customer relationship management system that we\u2019ll be implementing for the In Home Advisors as we move forward. Now note that we\u2019re still pacing ourselves, right? So we\u2019re going to offer this service nationwide sometime in the back half of the year. And a key variable, of course, is the number of advisers we\u2019ll have in each market, and this is something we\u2019ll tune. This is an effort where supply creates demand. And sometimes, there is lag between the time when you appoint somebody, then they have to be trained, then they have to develop the a book of business. So we\u2019re pacing ourselves. But the early indications are very positive, and it really highlights how we can leverage our various capabilities, online, the stores and going into people\u2019s homes. So candidly, we\u2019re excited, which is why we\u2019re doing this, and we\u2019ll see how big this can become.","Corie Barry","And Matt, above and beyond the In-Home Advisor pilot, Hubert hit on it, we\u2019ve had excellent Geek Squad agents going into people\u2019s homes for years. And I would also highlight particularly in our Magnolia Design Centers have been doing really complex and thorough in-home work for a long time. So we\u2019ve also used those learnings to apply to this broader experience that you get from an In-Home Advisor.","Hubert Joly","That\u2019s right, yes.","Matt McClintock","And if I could ask one follow-up just on the new expense plan. 600 million, substantially larger than the last one at 400 million. You talked about a continuous improvement approach. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how automation plays into that and how the retail industry has a large opportunity in general to automate processes that they\u2019ve used human resources before in the past for?","Hubert Joly","Corie, would you like to talk about this?","Corie Barry","I would love to talk about this. So first of all, just to be clear, it\u2019s 600 million but it\u2019s over a longer time frame than the 400 million was. The 400 million was over three years. We\u2019re committing to the 600 million by the end of fiscal 2021. So just to make sure I\u2019m very clear about that. And I love how you framed the question because you\u2019re hitting exactly where we think there is potential over time. As we invest in things like In-Home Advisor and some of those more complex, interpersonal conversations, we believe there\u2019s real opportunity to take waste out of the system through automation. And there are places like our supply chain, there are places like some of our call centers where we believe we have real opportunities to become more automated, and we\u2019ve talked about this before. With the retail landscape evolving so quickly, many times, you\u2019re putting in stopgaps as quickly as you can, and you\u2019re not thinking about how to streamline it or how to automate it. You\u2019re just thinking about how to get it done and get it implemented. And now what we\u2019re finding is when you take the time to step back, get a really smart group of people together and look at how could we do this better, how could we automate it, that\u2019s the place where we\u2019re starting to see some real opportunity. So the essence of your question I think is exactly spot on to where we think there\u2019s opportunity over this next period of time.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Mike Baker","I wanted to talk about the TV category. And you said that, that was down, I believe, or at least, home theater. Was there sort of a temporary impact that you think led to that? Or is it a case of where we are in the cycle in that business?","Hubert Joly","Maybe I\u2019ll start and Corie will augment. We\u2019re continuing to watch this. We continue to be excited by the TV category. There\u2019s continued innovation that keeps coming back or keeps coming online. OLED is, of course, a very significant one that we are excited about. Quarter-to-quarter, there will always be fluctuations based on when new products come in, capacity, pricing and so forth. So I wouldn\u2019t draw massive conclusions from the first quarter. This is something we\u2019ll have to watch as we get into the next quarters. There are some discussions not going to get into today as this is highly competitive. But don\u2019t take the trend of the first quarter as an indication of a strategic shift in the category. It\u2019s probably more of a transitionary nature.","Corie Barry","That being said, I think our guidance would imply a more moderate view on home theater. And we\u2019re -- to Hubert\u2019s point, we\u2019re watching it closely. But I think we took a prudent stance in where we think the industry might go on this one.","Hubert Joly","But we are excited that we are continuing to gain market share in that important category.","Mike Baker","Sure. That makes sense, and our data shows that as well. One other unrelated question, the e-commerce business continues to grow well. Most companies have seen margins go down as e-commerce goes up. Your margins are doing better. But as e-commerce continues to grow, do you think that will start to pressure the margins just because of shipping costs and the like on that business?","Corie Barry","Yes. I think that as we look to the back half, and we were talking about kind of some of that flexibility around investments, a piece of that certainly for us is continued flexibility around fulfillment in particular. And as you see the online business grow and you see the customer demands around speed and choice continue to evolve, we do believe that, over time, we need to continue to invest and make sure that we\u2019re delivering in the ways that our customers want. Obviously, when we talk about the cost reductions, we always talk about the inherent pressures in our business as a piece of what we\u2019re trying to offset. That\u2019s why we continue to believe the cost reduction is so important. It\u2019s because of the pressures that you can see in the -- not just the channel shift but in how people want to get their products and how we\u2019re fulfilling. And that\u2019s, honestly, both large cube and small cube for us.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Horvers","I just wanted to get some early thoughts on the back half. You\u2019ve got a number of things breaking in different directions. You\u2019ve got what\u2019s expected to be a very powerful iPhone cycle that could defer demand, but you also had inventory issues last year that I think in the third quarter was maybe a 160 basis-point headwind for you. And you\u2019re also lapping the Galaxy issue, the battery issue there. So how are you thinking about that? And maybe on those categories, what are you baking into the back half from a forecast perspective?","Corie Barry","Oh, okay. So first, let\u2019s cover -- I think I jotted all this down. First, on the iPhone, honestly, there\u2019s a wide spectrum of belief in terms of how the iPhone will perform, and we know about as much as you do in terms of exactly what this phone is going to be, when it\u2019s going to launch. We said from day one, we\u2019re taking a moderate view on the iPhone launch. And in general, I -- if you just take step back, I think you have to think about, and Hubert hit on it in his prepared remarks, the changing and evolving landscape of mobile and people moving into installment billing plans, replacement cycles extending slightly as a result. I think our guidance would imply that continued kind of moderate view, and we\u2019ll update it as we know more. But at this point, that\u2019s what we have in there.","You then hit on the inventory issues. In Q3, when we talked about supply, it was all about the Note and the lack of there being a Note. And in Q4, that expanded to include some other areas where we were having trouble with supply. You\u2019re absolutely right in that the guidance factors those things in. We are, at this point, assuming there is some kind of Note launch. Don\u2019t know when, don\u2019t know exactly what it is, but we\u2019re at least assuming that you can kind of fill up that hole in the bucket in what we gave you.","Chris Horvers","So does that make -- I\u2019m trying to put that all together in my head. So does that make 4Q -- do you think about the cadence that makes 4Q more weighted given the inventory and perhaps the timing of the release?","Corie Barry","At this point, we\u2019re not going to guide to separate quarters because here\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s so dependent on the timing of the releases, and you even saw that in this quarter, right, when we said just pushing out a few weeks given the demand that you see, particularly in that launch period, it can make a huge difference on the quarter. And so that\u2019s why, at this point, we\u2019re really just trying to talk about the back half.","Chris Horvers","I understand. So I want to jump back to a previous question on the gross -- on the second quarter. You mentioned some pressures on the gross margin or, I guess, abating tailwinds. Could you run through those again? If you look back historically, your -- I think the past three years, your gross margins rate averages about 100 basis points higher in 2Q than 1Q, and presumably, that\u2019s mix driven. So what makes that not be the case this year and would suggest you should actually have higher earnings in 2Q than the first quarter?","Corie Barry","Yes. Well, remember, there\u2019s a couple of things. Remember, first quarter was buoyed at least 10 basis points by a legal settlement that we had. In Q2, we\u2019re going to lap last year\u2019s profit sharing. So between those two things sequentially, you\u2019ve got 25 basis points of pressure just between those two things. Then underneath that, we\u2019ve said, and we\u2019ve cited it now for a number of quarters, we\u2019ve seen some strength in particularly home theater margins, computing margins, and we\u2019re starting to lap some of that strength that we saw. And so we believe we\u2019re going to start to see a bit of moderation. Not that you\u2019re going to give it up, but you\u2019re just going to see some moderation in our ability to gain at the pace that we\u2019ve been gaining.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dan Wewer from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Dan Wewer","So I wanted to talk about real estate. It looks like selling space declined another 0.9% year-over-year. Given the success of shifting revenue to your online channel, do you see an opportunity for the real estate to perhaps close at an even faster rate going forward?","Hubert Joly","We -- I think we continue to have the same view, which is ongoing optimization of the store footprint. Corie, in her prepared remarks, mentioned a number of stores that have been closed in the last year. This is an ongoing process we are managing very systematically and with great rigor on an ongoing basis. So no material change here. The stores continue to be a great asset for us. They\u2019re a great asset from the standpoint of the customer experience on the more complex categories or experiences, and they\u2019re a great asset from a shipping and logistics standpoint. So -- and as you remember, our stores are profitable. So there\u2019s no sea change that we are seeing more gradual continued evolution of our approach to real estate.","Dan Wewer","Second question, you had noted the benefits of the shift in the income tax refunds. We\u2019ve -- most companies have been complaining about this as a headwind. It looks like we know where those dollars are being spent now. But just curious, how do you know that the tax refunds shift had a benefit to sales? Was it based on the timing of the refunds? And you\u2019re looking at week-to-week trends and you saw a benefit? And also, how long do you think those benefits can continue in 2Q? Is it maybe for the first half of the period or perhaps longer?","Corie Barry","So if you remember, when we chatted with you guys what seems like just a little bit ago, we were seeing NPD trends in our business for the first few weeks of the quarter that were down more than 10%. The quarter ended at down about 3.2% based on NPDs, and so you can kind of read from that. As the weeks went on, we started to see this gradual shift back. I don\u2019t believe that, that continues on at any pace into Q2. I think -- we feel like we\u2019ve seen more of a normalization in our business and that the bump you kind of get when you get that nice refund check, we think we\u2019ve passed that.","Dan Wewer","Last question I have. Appliance revenue is up 4%. We\u2019ve been seeing that growth rate moderate. Can you discuss what\u2019s leading to that? Presumably, the HHGregg bankruptcy would benefit appliance revenues.","Hubert Joly","Well, there\u2019s the market and then there\u2019s market share. There\u2019s been, indeed, a moderation of the growth in the market. It continues to be positive, driven by what\u2019s happening in the housing sector. In the quarter, comps are in the single digits, which has been lower than what we have had historically but continue to be very positive, so we\u2019re excited about this. The HHGregg bankruptcy was more towards the tail end of the quarter, so not necessarily a huge impact in the quarter. We believe we\u2019ll continue to gain market share. And so we continue -- strategically, we continue to be excited about the sector. But you\u2019re right to underscore that, at the macro level, from a market standpoint, the growth rate has been a bit more moderate.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Schick of Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead. ","David Schick","I\u2019ll ask one question so others can ask. If you think about the last several years, you worked real hard with vendors and vendors with you to sort of differentiate the store-within-a-store, and that\u2019s given you both financial benefits and I would argue merchandising or in-store experience benefits. We\u2019re moving from a hardware to a service period, smart home, et cetera. Is it fair to say that we\u2019ll see the smart home vendors, service providers, et cetera, hardware building out in the store in the same way? Are you having those conversations? Should we see another leg of both financial and merchandising or experience differentiation going forward?","Hubert Joly","Yes. Thank you, David, for highlighting what has been, indeed, a key driver of recovery. Clearly, being the leading -- in fact, the only national specialty retailer in the sector gives us a great asset and we are able to provide great value to our vendors, and we love the way we are partnering with them from a product development standpoint, marketing and then merchandising and in-store experience. As we move into this next phase, we\u2019ll continue to have similar partnerships. I think we\u2019ll also expand them more into the services and solutions arena. So clearly, the announcement we made just a few weeks ago around Best Buy Smart Home powered by Vivint is an example, a great example of that, and you\u2019ll see that in 400 stores in -- later this year. The discussions with the vendors can also get into how do we provide a more complete holistic experience to the customers, how do we work together to solve real customer needs and problems so -- and expanding what we can do into the tech support and the solutions arena. So there\u2019s a number of conversations happening in that arena. So it\u2019s going to be an addition. So we continue to do the product partnerships and expand -- and we\u2019re very interested in expanding into the services and solutions, again, with Vivint being the first good illustration of that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Mushkin","And so I wanted to -- one of the push backs I get when I\u2019m talking to people on Best Buy is just that, historically, the TV cycle has been so important to you guys, whether it be just the TVs themselves or the warranties that go along with them. As we get into the back half of the year and maybe into next year, as 4K gets a little longer in the tooth, what would be your pushback?","Hubert Joly","Scott, could you repeat your questions? Because you cut a bit in and out. So would you please repeat the question?","Scott Mushkin","I\u2019m sorry about that. Yes, I\u2019ll repeat it. So basically, one of the big push backs I get regarding your business is that the TV cycle is so meaningful and that as we get longer in the tooth of this 4K cycle, it\u2019s going to have a pretty big impact as you get to the back half of the year and into next year because of the profitability of both the TVs and, I guess, especially the warranties. I was just wondering what your response to that would be.","Hubert Joly","Well, maybe I\u2019ll start and Corie will augment. Guidance for the full year takes into account whatever can be expected from a TV standpoint. So that\u2019s a first response. And we, both Corie and I, commented on that earlier. So whatever pressure we are anticipating this year is reflected into this. So the fact that for the full year, we were able to grow the top line by 1% and grow our operating income rate in that context indicates that there\u2019s other factors going on and that we have a range of drivers. So home theater, we are very proud of our position and capabilities in that sector. But people have to see Best Buy as also a portfolio of categories and a franchise that rests on continuous innovation across a range of categories and a position with customers and vendors that\u2019s actually broader than the TV cycle. So the last thing I would add to amplify a comment we made earlier is that -- we\u2019ve said this several times, the TV cycle or where the TV category is these years is different from the previous cycle of moving to HD, which was a more hilly, if I can say it, transition with a deadline by which people had to upgrade. Here, you see continuous innovation. The penetration of 4K is still limited. You have a new cycle around HDR. You have a new cycle around OLED. And so there\u2019s a series of innovations that are coming in. So these are the factors -- some of the factors I would highlight on this question. Corie, anything you would add?","Corie Barry ","No, thank you.","Scott Mushkin","So then my second question and I\u2019ll yield is just -- you guys are obviously doing some incredible stuff with like Vivint. And where is that revenue going to come in? And how is that reflected? And then, I guess, the same thing, and maybe it\u2019s more self-explanatory, when you expand out your services offering to not only the stuff you\u2019re selling but to just kind of anyone that wants to call and get someone in there to help them, does that go through comp? Is it going through services? So just kind of any thoughts both on Vivint and the other initiatives on how you\u2019re accounting for it?","Hubert Joly","Again, I\u2019ll start and Corie will add. So this is a key element you are highlighting a key element of the strategy from a financial standpoint, right? During the Q1 call the Q4 call, rather, we had highlighted the financial equation we are trying to solve is grow the top line, continue to drive efficiencies and then try to develop more recurring revenue streams and stickier customer relationships to help the financial equation. So in the services and solutions space, of course, this offers the opportunity to do this. Specifically, as it relates to Best Buy Smart Home powered by Vivint, I want to highlight one thing, which is, given the way we are currently approaching the business with Vivint, you should assume that the bulk of the revenue recognition is going to be from the ongoing service revenue stream as opposed to the initial hardware, so which means that the top line impact is going to be very moderate. And then there is some kind of profit-sharing agreement. So it\u2019s a recurring revenue stream with profitability over multiple years. And so hopefully, that adds some color. Clearly, in fiscal \u201818, the impact on the business is going to be very moderate because we are rolling out really in the middle or the back half of the year. There\u2019s ramp-up costs and so on and so forth. So this is a case where you have the initial investment and then the in-year impact is really very moderate.","Corie Barry","On your services question, keep in mind, right now, and we said it, these are pretty small pilots. In terms of how we think about the revenue there, it will flow as services revenue, and it would be a part of the services comp. But again, as we think about whether or not we\u2019re going to roll these initiatives and remember, this one is very much a test in pilot and we\u2019re learning. Not large, so you\u2019re not going to see much about it this quarter or likely next, but we will also keep some flexibility in terms of how we think about rolling out and the economics behind it as we head into the back half of this year and into next year and we get that model more refined.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Magee from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","David Magee","Just sort of a follow-up there on that In-House Advisor sort of revenue stream. What would be the impact you think on the EBIT line relative to your core business over time? And I know that\u2019s not really fair to ask, so maybe if you can just answer directionally.","Corie Barry","Yes, thank you. I will answer directionally. First, let me make sure I clarify kind of a difference here. On the In-Home Advisor, there is no revenue associated with an In-Home Advisor visit specifically. Remember, this is a free visit from an In-Home Advisor who\u2019s going to come and help you, a consultant for you in your home. The revenue comes from what you would choose to purchase as a result of that visit, be it hardware or services. In general, Hubert alluded to the fact that and I think there was a really good question around what gives you confidence to roll this out, after now a year and half years of testing in various markets, we like the overall financial model because, of course, you do have to prove out the investment in this case since there\u2019s both people and resources going into people\u2019s homes. But in general, we like what we\u2019re seeing when we spend that time and have that marketing folks build a relationship with one of our customers. So I just wanted to make sure I was really clear. There isn\u2019t service revenue associated with the In-Home Advisor specifically. It\u2019s more what that adviser enables.","David Magee","Sure. Secondly, anything on VR that might be meaningful this year? We\u2019re noticing, I guess, the in-stocks seem to be better on that product. I\u2019m not sure about the demand, though. Is it something that could be sort of a dark horse later this year? Or is this more a next year event?","Hubert Joly","Yes. I would say, David, that we are excited by the fact that there\u2019s a set of emerging technologies. And it\u2019s been very interesting to see the inflow and the regular inflow of a variety of technologies, VR being one of them. You had drones. You\u2019ve had a variety of products like this. The impact of VR specifically is small, but we like the proliferation of innovation across our sectors.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alan Rifkin of BTIG. Please go ahead.","Alan Rifkin","So in looking at your first quarter, an incremental $85 million in revenues flowed through very nicely, which transpired into $60 million of operating income, which is really a stepwise improvement in the flow-through. Incrementally, do you believe that what\u2019s driving that, have you hit a threshold either in the warranty business or in e-commerce where -- or on the cost savings program, where you\u2019re now seeing a -- what can be expected to be continuous flow-through of magnitude similar to that?","Corie Barry","Alan, thank you for the question. I think you can even see implied in our Q2 guidance, we aren\u2019t expecting that same kind of flow-through to continue. And part of that is the rate at which we\u2019re investing in some of the things that we\u2019ve talked about. Part of that is just flat out moderation in the gross profit rate expectations. Part of that is we start to lap some of the profit shares that we had last year that we had specifically called out as $60 million of pressure on the year. And so we -- you can see implied both in Q2 and even in the back half guidance, we would expect that to moderate as we come through the rest of the year.","Alan Rifkin","Okay. And Corie, just...","Hubert Joly","Very good -- sorry, go ahead.","Alan Rifkin","And Corie, just as a follow-up, as we look at the incremental 600 million in cost reductions, which would take you close to 2 billion since the beginning of the program, would it be reasonable to assume, and granted it\u2019s over the long term, that a disproportionately greater amount of that 600 million will flow through to the bottom line?","Corie Barry","It would not be appropriate to assume that. And we actually said we are going to need to take that cost out to help fund both the investments that we\u2019re making and the pressures we see in our business. And specifically, when you think about things like improving our fulfillment capabilities and -- I mean, you\u2019ve seen it. The rates at -- and pace at which change is happening in retail continues to be amazing, and we believe that cost reduction is necessary for us to reinvest in our business and make sure that we are also moving at that same pace.","Hubert Joly","Very good. In conclusion, several of you have highlighted the work that goes into delivering these results and you\u2019ve been kind enough to share some compliments. Corie and I will make sure to pass these compliments to our teams. The work that everybody is putting in to continuing to move the company forward is very exciting, and I want everybody at the company to know how much we appreciate and admire the efforts and the quality of the work. And of course, we appreciate your support and your continued interest. And as promised, any technology needs, you know where to find us, and we\u2019ll find you. So have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"3477":["Best Buy Co., Inc.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the call is being recorded for playback and will be available by 11 a.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Mollie O'Brien","","Good morning and thank you. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our President and CEO, and Sharon McCollam, our CAO and CFO. As usual, the media will be participating in this call in a listen-only mode.","This morning's conference call must be considered in conjunction with the earnings release that we issued earlier today. They both contain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain business events. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to facilitate meaningful year-over-year comparisons, but should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, and should be read in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures for the period.

The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.","In today's earnings release and conference call, we refer to the consumer electronics industry trends. The consumer electronics industry, as defined by the NPD Group, includes TVs, desktop and notebook computers, tablets not including Kindle, digital imaging, and other categories. Sales of these products represent approximately 65% of our Domestic revenue. It does not include mobile phones, gaming, movies, music, appliances or services.","I will now turn the call over to Hubert.","Hubert Joly","Thank you, Mollie, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I will begin today with an overview of our third quarter results and update you on the progress we are making against our Renew Blue priorities. I'll then provide thoughts on the upcoming holiday season and a discussion of our priorities beyond holiday before turning the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. So first, our financial results.","In the third quarter, our teams delivered positive comparable sales, improved profitability and continued progress in our Renew Blue transformation. This resulted in a $9.4 billion in revenue and $0.32 in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus $0.18 last year. Operationally, this year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by a 0.6% revenue growth and the benefits from our Renew Blue and other SG&A cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by strategic pricing investments and the ongoing competitive pressure on our gross profit rate.","On the top line, while sales in the NPD-reported Consumer Electronics categories declined 0.2%, our strength in televisions, computing, and tablets versus the industry, in addition to our growth in gaming and appliances, drove a Domestic comparable sales increase of 2.4%, excluding the 80 basis point estimated benefit associated with the classification of revenue for the new mobile carrier installment billing plans. Domestic online comparable sales increased 22%.","Also during the quarter, we continued to make progress against our Renew Blue priorities. In merchandising, we continued to expand our appliance offering through the opening of 15 Pacific Kitchen and Home stores-within-a-store and are on track to end the year with 117 stores versus 67 last year. In home theater, we opened 10 Magnolia Design Center stores-within-a-store and are on track to end the year with 50 stores versus 33 last year. We also continued to expand our ultra-high definition or 4K TV assortment.","In mobile, despite major phone launches being quantity constrained, the adoption of installment billing plans continued to accelerate throughout the quarter. Within these plans, we saw higher average phone prices and higher attach rates of services and phone accessories. In phone accessories, we significantly expanded our exclusive assortment through new partnerships with fashion designers and growth in our own private label brands, which allowed us to offer our customers an industry leading phone case assortment in time for the new iPhone launch.","In marketing, we continued to shift marketing dollars away from TV and print to digital media and display campaigns including a successful traffic-generating back-to-school initiative. We also continue to drive increasingly powerful customer communication through the leveraging of our new Athena database. While we remain in the early stages of being able to personalize marketing messages to individual customers, we're beginning to see better click-through rates on these new campaigns when compared to mass non-targeted e-mails.","In our online business in the third quarter, we continued to leverage our ship-from-store, digital marketing and enhanced Web-site functionality to drive a 22% increase in Domestic comparable online sales. Similar to the first half of the year, ship-from-store represented over half of this growth.","We also launched several customer-facing site improvements including significantly richer visual and editorial content for the home theater, mobile, appliance and gaming categories, expanded 'wish list' capabilities, and expanded in more inspirational holiday gift center, and an improved checkout process that provides faster and precise 'get it by' delivery dates on approximately 60% of Best Buy delivered SKUs rather than up to five to eight day range.","In our retail stores during the quarter, we continued to improve the physical presence and shopping experience by expanding our fleet of appliance in home theater stores-within-a-store, increasing our investments in store refresh initiatives adding compelling vendor displays, increasing sales training and integrating new vendor-funded labor into our premium customer experiences. While traffic to our stores continue to decline year-over-year, the trends improved compared to the first half of the year.","In services, we continued to increase our NPS or Net Promoter Score and drive down costs through operational efficiencies. We also launched a lost and theft mobile phone insurance program to supplement our historical Geek Squad Protection Plan. However, service revenue continued to decline, as Sharon will discuss in more detail later.","In our supply chain, we continued to transform our distribution and fulfillment capabilities by operationalizing a faster and more precise delivery experience to our online customers and locking a significant percentage of our major appliance and large-screen TV inventory that was systematically trapped in a single market and not available to be purchased by customer outside of that market.","In returns, replacements and damages, we launched a new section of the Web-site called Best Buy Outlet which expands the online visibility of open box inventory that can be purchased online and picked up in store. We also expanded the percentage of return products that we are Geek Squad certifying which while small is leading to higher margin recovery due to customer confidence in the quality statement that Geek Squad certification inspires.","Our Net Promoter Score was flat year-over-year in the third quarter, which we believe was driven in part by the impact of product availability associated with the launch of new phones. This plateau follows a 400 basis point year-over-year improvement last year.","And relating to our overall cost reduction initiatives, in the third quarter we eliminated an additional $65 million in annualized cost taking our total renewable cost reductions to $965 million, towards our target of $1 billion.","Now as we enter the fourth quarter, we are excited about our holiday plan, which has been built around; number one, the cumulative progress we have made against our Renew Blue priorities; number two, an operational roadmap that incorporates the specific learnings that we gained from last year; and number three, our current views on the consumer and competitive environment.","Within this plan, I would like to highlight the following growth, customer experience and profitability initiatives that we believe will drive better year-over-year outcomes. So number one is the customer-facing changes that we have made on our site and in our stores, including the merchandizing and labor upgrade I discussed earlier, that touch many of our key categories, especially home theater, accessories, appliances, emerging categories such as health and wearables and connected home, and digital imaging. Second, our ability this year to sell installment billing plans in the mobile phone category. Third, a more inspirational gifting strategy, including a greater assortment of products below $100.","Fourth is a more defined and structured approach to our promotional strategy, including greater analytics around competitive response plans. Fifth, more relevant and targeted marketing investments, including a more concise statement of our value proposition, 'Expert Service Unbeatable Price'. And sixth, increased inventory availability due to the rollout of ship-from-store to 1,400 stores versus 400 stores last year, the regional unlock of large appliances and TVs and additional online exposure of certain open box inventory.","Now, like every holiday though, of course we believe the outcome of these initiatives is and will continue to be tempered by external and internal factors, including the investments that are required to drive them. The external factors include; number one, an intensely promotional competitive environment; number two, a possible constraint in product availability in recent high-profile product launches; and number three, a potential supply chain disruption related to the West Coast port delays.","The internal factors include; number one, the increased mix of faster growing but lower-margin products in our revenue; number two, the potential impact of higher incentive compensation, particularly in our retail stores, based on our expected year-over-year improvement in performance; number three, higher growth in our lower-margin online channel; and number four, intensified investments in customer-facing initiatives.","We believe the net financial impact of these factors in the fourth quarter assuming near flat revenue and comparable sales growth will be a year-over-year improvement in our gross profit rate but flat year-over-year SG&A dollars, and Sharon will provide more color on this later in the call.","Now before this, I would like to briefly share with you some thoughts about our priorities beyond holiday as we continue our Renew Blue transformation. So at this point in our transformation, we have eliminated close to $1 billion in cost, reduced our Domestic SG&A rate by approximately 170 basis points compared to two years ago, and made progress towards stabilizing our Domestic comparable sales.","As we look to our environment, we see continued economic pressures including more rapidly declining average selling prices in key product categories in expectation of competitively matched prices, we see declining demand and increasing pricing pressures for extended warranties driven by improving product reliability and declining average selling prices for parent products, we see increasing customer service investments like free and faster shipping or expert service in our retail stores, and we see greater customer expectations around large cube supply-chain experiences. And with our more affluent demographic and complex product offerings, we are becoming more of a specialty retailer in this evolution and must offer our customer a high-touch experience.","Now against this backdrop, at the beginning of this fiscal year we outlined a roadmap for the next couple of years of our transformation. We are pursuing a strategy that is focused on delivering advice, service and convenience at competitive prices, we're focused on driving a number of profitable growth initiatives around key product categories, life events and services.","These initiatives include; number one, capitalizing on the ultra-high definition TV and gaming cycles; number two, increasing market share in growing categories with structural barriers to entry like large appliances, mobile and connected home; number three, establishing Best Buy as the destination for health and wearables; number four, further expanding branded, exclusive and private-label assortments; number five, continuing to expand our secondary market growth strategy to improve our margin recovery on returned, replaced and damaged products; number six, expanding our life events program such as 'wish list' and a gift registry; and number seven, evolving our service offerings to make them more relevant to today's customer needs.","And in support of these initiatives, we are transforming major facets of the Company. We're applying more science behind our promotional and pricing strategies, we are accelerating targeted and personalized marketing programs, we are transforming desktop and mobile site customer experience, we are enhancing our in-store customer experience from both a service and physical environment perspective, and we are taking steps to drive increased sales effectiveness and payroll leverage.","It is our expectation that delivering better advice, service and convenience at competitive prices and successfully executing our initiatives will help grow comparable sales and increase operating margins. It also requires investments. In light of our environment, we believe it is imperative that we move quickly and invest aggressively against these initiatives that we believe will allow us to continue to advance our growth and improve our financial performance.","All of these initiatives would be part of our fiscal '16 operating plan and we are excited about both our short and long-term growth prospects. We're also confident in our ability to execute against these initiatives as we have demonstrated over the past two years. The external pressures however are driving structural industry changes, and to win we have to lead. To do that, incremental investment like those I have already discussed will be required and while these investments will put pressure on our operating income rate, we believe that they will also allow us to build a differentiated customer experience and drive our long-term success.","We will more deeply discuss these external pressures, growth opportunities and investments in our fourth quarter earnings call after we have completed our fiscal '16 operating plans. I will now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our third quarter financials and our fourth quarter outlook.","Sharon McCollam","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus our expectations. As Hubert said, during the quarter we continued to make meaningful progress against our Renew Blue priorities which resulted in better than expected non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.32.","This result versus our expectation was primarily driven by the sales declines in the NPD-reported Consumer Electronics categories being lower than previous quarters, higher than expected revenue in computing and tablets, higher mobile revenues due to better than expected results from new phone launches, better performance of our new credit card agreement, and greater pricing and promotional effectiveness, partially offset by increased investments in customer-facing initiatives.","I'll now talk about our third quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 0.6% to $9.4 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.14 to $0.32, primarily driven by higher revenues and the flow-through of our Renew Blue and other cost reduction initiatives. We also saw a $0.02 per share benefit associated with the restitution from a legal claim. In addition, the lower tax rate this year drove an incremental $0.02 per share benefit due to favorable discrete tax events. These favorable impacts were partially offset however by ongoing competitive pressure on our gross profit rate.","Domestic revenue of $8 billion increased 2.3% versus last year. This increase was driven by comparable sales growth of 3.2%, but excluding an 80 basis point estimated benefit associated with the classification of revenue for the new mobile carrier installment billing plans comparable sales increased 2.4%. This increase was partially offset by the timing of recovery on mobile phone trade-in liquidations, store closures, and $8 million or 15 basis points in less favorable economics of the new credit card agreement.","Domestic online revenue was $601 million and comparable online sales increased 21.6% due to substantially improved inventory availability made possible by the chain-wide rollout of ship-from-store in January of 2014, a higher average order value, and increased traffic driven by greater investment in online marketing. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 110 basis points to 7.5% versus 6.4% last year.","As we enter the fourth quarter in the online channel, we will be comping last year's gaming console introductions and our initial 400 ship-from-store rollout. Therefore, as the fourth quarter last year was the first quarter we benefited from these growth drivers, this year's fourth quarter will experience approximately 600 basis points of growth pressure that we did not have in the first three quarters of this year.","From a merchandising perspective in the third quarter, comparable sales growth in computing, gaming, televisions, and appliances was partially offset by declines in other categories, including services, mobile excluding the impact of installment billing, and tablets. The services comparable sales decline of 10.3% was primarily driven by lower mobile repair revenue due to our success in decreasing claim severity and frequency, which is an operational positive, and lower attach rates.","International revenue of $1.4 billion declined 8.4%. This decline was primarily driven by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, a comparable sales decline of 3% driven by China, and the loss of revenue from store closures in Canada and China.","Turning now to gross profit, the enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate for the third quarter was 22.7% versus 23.1% last year, a decline of 40 basis points. The Domestic non-gross profit rate declined 50 basis points to 23% versus 23.5% last year. This decline was primarily due to a lower gross profit rate in the mobile business, including ongoing declines in customer demand for standalone mobile broadband products, structural investments and price competitiveness particularly in accessories, increased revenue in the lower margin gaming category, a highly competitive promotional environment in tablets, and a 10 basis point negative impact related to the less favorable economics of the new credit card agreement.","These declines were partially offset though by increased revenue in higher-margin large-screen televisions, the realization of our Renew Blue cost reduction and other supply-chain cost-containment initiatives, and the receipt of $11.5 million or 15 basis points in restitution from a legal claim related to an inventory dispute.","The International gross profit rate was 20.7% versus 21.2% last year. This 50 basis point decline was primarily driven by our Canadian business due to a highly competitive promotional environment in tablets and higher revenue in the lower-margin gaming category.","Now turning to SG&A, enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.9 billion or 20.5% of revenue versus 21.7% last year, a decline of $104 million or 120 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.6 billion or 20.3% of revenues versus 21.7% of revenue last year, a decline of $68 million or 140 basis points. This rate decline was primarily driven by the realization of our Renew Blue cost reduction initiatives and tighter expense management throughout the Company. These declines were partially offset by Renew Blue investments in online growth and other customer facing initiatives.","International non-GAAP SG&A was $297 million or 21.4% of revenue versus 22% of revenue last year, a decline of $36 million or 60 basis points. This rate decline was primarily driven by Renew Blue cost reductions and tighter expense management in Canada and to a lesser extent in China.","As it relates to the International segment, while we made considerable progress on our Renew Blue cost reduction initiatives, we have substantial work to do on top line stabilization. To address this, we are executing against the same Renew Blue transformation roadmap that we are pursuing in the U.S.","From a balance sheet perspective, merchandise inventories decreased $78 million or 1.1% to $6.9 billion. Although we accelerated inventory purchases in anticipation of West Coast port delays, these incremental receipts were more than offset by better than expected revenues. But as we said last quarter, we do expect to end the year with higher inventory levels in the range of $150 million in order to support our ultra-high definition television, accessories and Pacific Kitchen and Home expansions, as well as our initiatives to reduce retail out-of-stocks.","I'd now like to talk about the financial outlook for the fourth quarter. As Hubert outlined earlier, there are internal and external factors with both positive and negative implications that we believe will influence our enterprise financial results in the fourth quarter. Considering these factors, we are expecting the following impacts in the fourth quarter.","Near flat year-over-year revenue and comparable sales growth, assuming revenue declines in the NPD-reported Consumer Electronics categories are in line with Q3; an improvement in the year-over-year gross profit rate; and flat year-over-year SG&A dollars due to higher incentive compensation and intensified investments in customer-facing initiatives. We will also recognize an incremental $20 million on the SG&A line due to a greater proportion of our vendor funding being recorded as an offset to cost of goods sold rather than an offset to SG&A.","The net result of all these impacts, similar to last quarter's outlook, is an approximate 50 basis point year-over-year expansion in the Q4 non-GAAP operating income rate. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, as we said before, the estimated diluted earnings per share impact of the discrete tax items that we discussed will continue to be in the range of a negative $0.09 to $0.10 in Q4.","With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane","Good morning and congratulations. I was wondering if you could walk through in a little bit more detail the impact of mobile in Q3. Obviously there was the big launch in September. But I wondered if you could walk through what some of the dynamics were with the launch and how you think this will maybe differ in Q4.","Hubert Joly","So there are a couple of things I would highlight. Prior to this iconic launch, we saw continued pent-up demand. So the market dried up and had a significantly negative impact on our mobile revenue. Then at the launch we did quite well but then supply was uneven during the quarter. So that's a positive followed by a negative. We did see nice positives from our expanded accessories assortment. If you visited our store or the sites, I think you will have seen that. So that was a positive. Then you have the shift into installment billing.","So if you remember last year, we didn't have installment billing. We started in the spring. It's now grown very significantly with the impact you've seen on our comps, that Sharon and I have split out. The benefit of installment billing is the increased attach rate on services and accessories as well as the mix into more expensive phones. This for the customer, it's great \u2013 installment billing is a great value proposition from a customer standpoint. Now we ourselves, we want to be agnostic, we want to sell whatever makes sense to the customers, it's a great value proposition for the customer and therefore they tend to buy a little bit more.","So these are the various drivers. Now looking into Q4, a main uncertainty remains the availability of iconic phones, there's a number of them but we can think of at least one or two, and that's very difficult to focus. So we do expect to continue to be constrained during the quarter on that standpoint, which you will see however of course compared to last year is the fact that we now have installment billing which we didn't have last year. So I think in our prepared remarks we touched on that. So these are the factors I would highlight. I'm turning to Sharon to see whether I forgot anything notable.","Sharon McCollam","No, Hubert, I think you've covered it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.","Gary Balter","First of all, congratulations to both of you on results to date and I'm sure further progress. The question I had was, last year \u2013 and you touched on it, Hubert and Sharon \u2013 last year between Black Friday and Christmas, you had trouble driving traffic to the stores, and I don't want you to give your competitive \u2013 given competitors are probably listening to this call, I don't want you to give competitive sensitive information, but could you describe if anything whatever you can share with us what your plans are between Black Friday and Christmas to create more excitement in the stores?","Hubert Joly","So you are right to highlight that week two and week three of December last year were quite extraordinarily bad, candidly not just for us, this was industry-wide. If you remember, you had a bit of a perfect storm last year with a rapid shift to online and traffic to the malls and the stores that was quite extraordinary. I think last year we all agreed was, there were so many unique factors that it's going to be hard to replicate the kind of drama that we had last year.","I think we have detailed on the call the overall elements of our plan for holiday, I'm not going to give you the play-by-play, day-by-day because I know our friends [indiscernible] who are on the phone wouldn't appreciate that too much or other places in the world, but I think that the plans we've built really combine three elements. One is the cumulative effect of everything we've been working on over the last year to improve the customer experience with our advice, service, convenience, as well as all of the lessons from that including one I would highlight is gifting, as well as in particular gifting below $100 and improved \u2013 I think our improved messaging as well, marketing messaging, more targeted.","Last year if you remember it was a little bit too much of, buy in the next two days otherwise it's going to be too late, and then three days later we would tell you, buy in the next two days or it's going to\u2026 So I think we're going to be \u2013 our marketing messages, you may have noticed that, were a bit more balanced, more targeted and hopefully create some more excitement.","But to be candid, we are also prepared from the standpoint of combining science and judgment in our promotional activities and so forth. I must say that last year during these last two weeks, many of us were perplexed and there was a bit of overreaction at that time last year. So the program combines that, Renew Blue transformation and then the lessons from last year, and then wish us some luck, okay.","Operator","We'll move along to our next question, Dan Wewer from Raymond James.","Dan Wewer","Hubert, I just wanted to follow up on your comments beyond the fourth quarter of this year and specifically if you continue to believe Best Buy has the potential to reach a 5% operating margin rate, and if so, how do you envision the amount of square footage changing going forward, either closing Best Buy mobility stores, reducing the size of big-box stores and perhaps closing big-box stores if those leases expire?","Hubert Joly","So on the 5% to 6% operating income, we do believe that the structural industry changes we are seeing are going to put pressure on that range, but we also believe that these changes could drive opportunities for us as well. And so we'll continue to monitor both as we progress to the next phase of our transformation.","As it relates to the store footprint, the way we think about this, and we've been very consistent in talking about ongoing thoughtful rationalization of our store footprint, I'll repeat something we said on the last call and maybe elaborate a little bit. We do see retailers shift to online. Customers are starting their shopping journey online. It's so convenient. Sometimes they are completing the shopping journey online. We like that.","In our case, by the way, 40% of the revenue then gets picked up in the stores. And sometimes the transaction itself is completed in the stores. But the result of this is fewer trips to the store, right, either because you've completed the transaction online or because you've done so much research that you don't need as many trips to the store per purchase to complete the transaction.","So what does it mean for the stores? It means that the trip to the stores need to be extraordinary from a customer experience standpoint for the transactions that are high-touch and large-cube, it needs to be an amazing customer experience, and it needs to be very efficient for in-store pickup or, I'm on a business trip, I forgot my phone charger and I need one quickly, and by the way the stores are still and probably forever will be the best solution if you want it now. Now is convenience. And so, our vision for the store footprint is related to this.","Now the other factor we take into consideration is the fact that we have very few stores, and we've been very consistent in saying this, we have very few stores that are not cash flow positive. So we feel, we continue to feel that closing stores ahead of lease expiration is simply not helpful from a shareholder standpoint.","And the other thing that everybody has to recognize, and we certainly do, is that when you close stores you don't retain all of the customers. So one of the things we are excited about is our ability to personalize and target our communication with customers, as it increases over time will be very helpful to be able to help the customers with the journey of ongoing floor space optimization. So we continue to see that as a gradual and thoughtful process.","Now as we close stores, everything else being equal, we will even with increased personalization see some lost revenue and therefore you will see an increase in profitability with slightly less revenue everything else being equal, because of course we can also find other ways to grow the revenue. So these are our current thoughts on this continued transformation in the fourth quarter.","Dan Wewer","Okay. And Sharon, one real quick question, you talked about a 15 basis point or $0.02 per share benefit from a tax settlement I think you said regarding inventory. Does that show up on the income statement on gross margin rate?","Sharon McCollam","Yes. This was a legal settlement not a tax settlement. We have the tax issue and then the legal settlement. The legal settlement was around inventory, thus it's a reduction of cost of goods sold and it shows up in the gross profit.","Operator","We'll move along to our next question from David Strasser with Janney Capital Markets.","David Strasser","I guess a question, one of the things I notice more and more in the stores is the third-party salespeople and I'm trying to understand sort of the dynamic of that as far as whether or not \u2013 I've heard some people say, I'm pretty sure they're not your employees but they are employees of the vendors, I'm trying to understand that a little bit better, and as we go into the holiday season, how substantial you think that could be, is that helping on ASP, is that helping on close rates, at what times of the week these type of employees will be there? And I guess sort of a related question, that which could be construed as a follow-up would be, as I'm trying to look at the TV category, how much is ASP versus units in sort of the TV category strength that you saw in the third quarter?","Hubert Joly","So let me be very clear about the sales staff in the stores. With a couple of exceptions that date back a while, the labor that we have for our various vendor experiences is Best Buy labor. We get something from the vendors and they may have on their search, in reference to a specific vendor, to indicate their expertise but they are Best Buy labor. And they spend, as you would expect and appreciate, a lot of time in the stores and we pay a lot of attention to continuing to provide customers knowledgeable and biased advise because we feel that this is very valuable to the customers and so a very strong part of our culture.","This being said, we like the fact that we have put an emphasis on customer facing labor, even though we've reduced our SG&A materially. As you know, we've put emphasis on customer facing labor. We like the fact that we are getting help from our vendors from that standpoint and we love the impact on the customer experience and of course the ability to sell more and sell better.","We briefly alluded incidentally in our prepared remarks on an opportunity that we have that we are quite excited about, which is efforts in our retail stores to improve sales effectiveness and increase our leverage from labor that over time we'll be able to talk to you all about. And so that's what I would say in general about store labor. Now, Sharon, do you want to answer the question about TV ASPs and units?","Sharon McCollam","Absolutely. As you'd expect, Dave, we're seeing favorability in both.","David Strasser","Is there one more dramatic than the other?","Sharon McCollam","From a competitive point of view, we are not going to be disclosing a lot about the UHD cycle, but obviously you can see in the stores the pricing on the TVs, et cetera. So you're going to have an ASP benefit at the high end and then you're going to have \u2013 we're also as you know we play across the entire category. So a large piece of our TV business is not actually in UHD as well and we saw very strong television category this quarter, but we're going to be short on details from a competitive point of view as we go into holiday.","David Strasser","I guess I have to accept that. Thank you.","Sharon McCollam","Okay, sorry.","Operator","And we'll move along to our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser","As you look across the promotional landscape for the holidays and the deals that you're already able to see from others, what is your impression about the margin that your competition is willing to invest this year versus last year, and then how does that ebb and flow over the course of the period?","Hubert Joly","I would answer the following way. In general we are in line with our expectation. The promotional environment is very intense. It is certainly not less intense. I'm not sure, if anything it's probably a little bit more intense than last year. I think that all of you follow the sector, so I don't need to point you to this or that player. Don't know of course how much money people are spending, I don't have access to their P&L, but the promotional season is off to a very vibrant start, I would put it this way.","So as a result, in our outlook for the Q, we've not been betting on help from that standpoint. In fact we've been quite realistic. The one thing I would highlight in that context in terms of what we do about it, is again the combination of science and judgment on our own promotional activities and competitive reaction.","Michael Lasser","Okay, that's helpful. And as a quick follow-up, can you give us a flavor for how well you are able to not only attach but also cross-sell that traffic that came into your stores in the third quarter for iPhones, and do you think you'll be able to sustain that type of performance into the fourth quarter?","Hubert Joly","Thank you for highlighting that. These iconic launches generate significant traffic. We are happy with the accessories and services attached. Now is that impact related to the installment billing? I think we've said that, and in general what one of the things we've said in our prepared remarks is that the traffic trend to our retail stores was still negative has improved compared to the first half of the year.","Now, what is the weight of these phone launches versus other factors, I would actually say that the mobile part of our stores is by far not the only place in the stores where we have transformed the experience. So I wouldn't exaggerate the impact from a traffic standpoint of these launches.","Michael Lasser","Okay. Good luck with the holidays. Thank you so much.","Operator","We'll move along to our next question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers","So you've flipped to positive comps here, you're talking about sort of flat revenues in the fourth quarter, gross margin up, and all of these point to a building cash balance in the balance sheet, and I know it's been very important to see things like gross margin stabilize and sales stabilize, so how are you thinking about the cash as you get beyond the fourth quarter?","Sharon McCollam","Chris, I'll take that. We of course have said consistently we're going to continue to maintain a very strong balance sheet. And once we get past the fourth quarter, of course the cash flows in the fourth quarter are significant, we understand that at that point there's going to be significant cash on the balance sheet and we will at that point start looking at alternatives. As you know, we continue to be deeply committed to our dividend. I know your question is really about, are you going to begin implementing share repurchase programs, and that is a discussion that we are not prepared and not wanting to have today, but when we go into next year rest assured that we know how important this is to our investors and we will continue to evaluate that. But the number one use of cash for us is investing in future growth right now. So where we can utilize that cash to drive these customer-facing initiatives, that will be our top priority, and then we will look to other vehicles for using the cash beyond that.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. So as you \u2013 but I guess another way to think about it is, based on the up to date results, it would seem like you're going to have about $4 billion of cash in the balance sheet. Is there a level that your key vendor partners look to in saying, that's a cash value that is something that is a strong show of confidence and makes us feel really good about providing you great terms, as sort of a minimum cash balance level?","Sharon McCollam","I think that we have an obligation to our vendors to maintain a strong balance sheet. When you look at the investment that our vendors have made in our stores in the last 12 months, 12 to 18 months, it is incredible, it is literally hundreds of millions of dollars that they have put into our stores to represent their customer experience. So we believe very strongly that our strong balance sheet has been one of the reasons why they have had great confidence in putting that kind of capital into their customer experience in our Best Buy stores.","So you can never exactly square root what number is it that they are looking for on the balance sheet, but let's keep in mind that we are a 40-plus billion dollar retailer and we are heavily fourth quarter weighted. So I think that we need to be very \u2013 we're going to be very thoughtful about the intangibles as well as the tangible implications of any cash decision that we make.","So I know that we've had this conversation and I so recognize and we recognize the importance of the discussion of uses of cash for our shareholders, I like the fact that you guys all understand how important it is to our vendors because I think we used this example in a couple of our meetings earlier this year, but when you think about it from a vendor point of view, right now some of our largest vendors are sitting with receivables from Best Buy unsecured, nobody wants their inventory back, and they may be lending you up to $2 billion at any point in time. So what looks like a lot to some, doesn't look like so much to another Board sitting across the country, right. So that's where we sit on that topic.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. Thanks very much and good luck in the fourth quarter.","Operator","We'll move along to our next question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matt Fassler","My questions are focused on wireless. I guess as you look at all the significant changes in this marketplace focusing on installment billing and also the trade-in dynamic, which I know are present to many more transactions, how are these impacting the consumers' perception of affordability and the frequency of wireless purchases and also the basket that they seem to be looking for?","Hubert Joly","I think we continue to believe in a number of things. One is the wireless space is obviously a large and very dynamic market. Of course there's a bit of saturation from a smartphone penetration, but there's also new usage. The phone, the mobile phone is really the center of people's lives since it's highly connected, if I can use that phrase, to other topics such as connected home and health and fitness. So it's an area of very intense interest on our part and of the overall industry.","The installment billing development is a positive development from a customer standpoint because it provides much more flexibility to the customer. As you know, after one year you can actually upgrade. And so while the previous contractual arrangement of post-paid was a two-year contractual commitment, you now have the ability to upgrade after one year. The fact that it's a monthly billing also is an encouragement to facilitate we find attaching, from a customer standpoint buying services and accessories. And so these are positive development.","You mentioned trade-in. Trade-in, in effect with the installment billing is embedded into the program, and so which was a phenomenon in the last couple of years is now structurally integrated in these new offerings. So all of this constitutes a set of positive development and it's an area where we continue to see opportunities for us above and beyond simply the phone functionalities as we represent in our stores a broad range of products that can get connected in the homes and the lives of the customers.","Matt Fassler","And if I can just ask a brief follow-up, Sharon, you talked about the consumer electronics market expectation that drove your near flat comp assumption for the fourth quarter. What kind of wireless expectation is embedded into that [upside] [ph] of that CE number?","Sharon McCollam","We're not guiding, Matt, by category but clearly when you think about \u2013 you know last year we had two issues in mobile. The first was that because of installment billing, the carriers stopped upgrades, early upgrades. Remember? In addition, we couldn't sell installment billing. So we had structural impediments in the fourth quarter of last year that we do not have this year. Therefore you could obviously expect that we would hope to see a significantly better mobile business in the fourth quarter this year versus last year.","Hubert Joly","What I would add to this, Matthew, is that the flat revenue and comp indication we are providing this morning incorporate, includes the mobile phone business, it's not limited to the NPD categories. As you know, Q4 is in an intensively competitive area where a lot of retailers use CE to carry the excitement in our stores and so forth. So flat overall is the number we have shared this morning.","Operator","We'll move along to our next question from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.","Hubert Joly","And this may be the last question so that people can move on to their rest of the day.","Peter Keith","Good morning and congratulations. I'll just keep it to one question. As a follow-up to the last comment around the Q4, comp guide for Q4, one of the things that looked impressive in Q3 was that your GAAP relative to the NPD data widened, and it looks like for Q4 your comps were to kind of tighten up again. I guess I'm just wondering, structurally is there anything going on with product sales that's going to cause that tightening that we should be aware of?","Hubert Joly","I think one of the things I would highlight is the comment on discipline around promotional activities, and we are interested in comps but not [empty calories] [ph]. And so in some cases that \u2013 so in other words we don't want to be so addicted to the notion of positive comps that we would do unnatural thing from a promotional standpoint. So that may be what impacts our comments this morning on the outlook. And with that, I'd like to \u2013 or maybe, Sharon, you want to add something?","Sharon McCollam","I'll just add, there's two more points. The first is that recall that last year that we had launched 400 stores that were shipping from store. So we created that inventory availability last year. Now this year we have the 1,400 stores shipping, but the 400 stores did, as you'll recall, drive increased revenue last year. The second point is, which I also mentioned in my prepared remarks, is that last year the new gaming consoles were launched and their deliveries were in the fourth quarter. We had the pre-order revenue in Q3 but the deliveries in Q4 and those were substantial. So as we look to the fourth quarter, we are expecting to see some potential differences in the strength of the hardware related to those consoles obviously.","So those would be two other pressures, and remember that the gaming is not in those NPD categories that we discussed. So those are a couple of other points just to consider. We quantified that on the online growth last year at about 600 basis points of benefit last year, because remember we had over 25% growth in online last year. So I would not want you to put that in there when you're trying to do the math, that those two factors are necessary in order to get in line with the outcome that we put into the outlook.","Hubert Joly","Thank you so much, Sharon. And in closing, I wanted to do a couple of things. One, obviously thank our teams in all functions and geographies for the progress, continued progress and results that we collectively, they collectively have delivered, and of course for their very exciting mobilization for holiday. It's always a very special moment of the year. Our teams are ready to welcome all of our customers, including all of you on the call, and I want to salute them for their preparedness.","And of course I want to thank you and everyone on the call for your continued support and wish you a wonderful holiday season, which I know would include a few trips to Best Buy. You have at least two reasons to do that, one is check how prepared we are, and of course at the same time you can make progress on your holiday shopping adventure. So we'll see you in the stores or on our site at your convenience. So have a great holiday with your families and we'll continue to be with you on the journey. Thank you so much.","Operator","That concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation."],"3634":["Best Buy Co., Inc.

The event will be webcast live on our Investor Relations website.","I will now turn the call over to Hubert.","Hubert Joly","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin with our prepared remarks, it is important to say that our thoughts and prayers this morning are with the affected population of Texas and especially with our associates as they continue to feel the effects of Harvey. We\u2019re happy to announce that as of today, all of our associates are safe and we have mobilized to help those that have been displaced. That being said, the situation is still evolving and our primary commitment continues to be the safety of our teams.","I will now provide a review of our second quarter performance and the progress we\u2019ve made against our fiscal 2018 priorities. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and our financial outlook.","We are pleased today to report strong top and bottom line growth for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. We grew enterprise comparable sales by 5.4% and delivered non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.69, up 21% compared to $0.57 last year. Our enterprise comparable sales performance was particularly strong. The strong top-line results were not isolated to a specific category or launch. We saw higher-than-expected comparable sales growth across the majority of our categories. This higher-than-expected growth was driven by stronger consumer demand for technology products and by the strong execution of our strategy. Against the backdrop of continued healthy consumer confidence, we believe broad-based product innovation is resonating with consumers and driving higher spends. And with our effective merchandising and marketing activities, combined with our expert advice and service available online, instore, and in home, we\u2019re garnering an increasing share of these dollars.","On the profitability side, at the enterprise level, our operating income rate improved 20 basis points driven by sales leverage. As expected, expenses were higher than last year, as we\u2019re investing in people and systems to drive growth, execution, and efficiencies. We also had an increase in incentive compensation related to the stronger than expected performance. In fact, I want to thank all our associates across the company for their hard work in delivering these results. Thank you.","Now, I\u2019d like to discuss our progress towards Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue, and the four fiscal 2018 priorities we outlined at the beginning of the year. The first priority is to explore and pursue growth opportunities around maximizing the multichannel retail business and providing services and solutions that solve real customer needs and help us build deeper customer relationships.","In support of maximizing the multichannel retail business, we continue to drive digital innovation to improve the customer experience. In the second quarter our domestic online comparable sales grew 31%. Online sales were more than $1 billion for the second consecutive time in a non-holiday quarter and were 13.2% of domestic revenue, up from 10.6% last year. We are on pace to generate well over $5 billion in domestic online sales this fiscal year. Another exciting opportunity to maximize the multichannel retail business is our In-Home Advisor program. Our In-Home Advisors are professional sales consultants with broad product knowledge. They provide free consultations and serve as the single point of contact covering all technology needs across all vendors. In other words, they can help you design and put in place a great entertainment system, help you pick out your appliances for a kitchen remodel, or help you stream music and content across your home without annoying buffering issues.","After testing the program in several cities, over the last year and a half, we\u2019re currently rolling it out nationally. By the end of September, we will be offering these free in-home consultations across all major U.S. cities nationwide.","We\u2019re very focused on the smart home as a key part of our Best Buy 2020 strategy, and we will continue to enhance this category across our stores and website this year. For example, to demonstrate what is possible with voice technology, we\u2019re bringing new Alexa and Google Assistant experiences to 700 stores nationwide in collaboration with Amazon and Google. These enhanced experiences are unique to Best Buy and show how you can completely use voice technology. Specially trained Blue Shirts are on hand to provide advice and of course our Geek Squad agents can help install, set up and support the products.","The new species began arriving in stores in July, and the rollout will be complete by the end of the third quarter. Of course, we\u2019re continuing to work on a number of other initiatives around tech support, smart home, mobile and appliances, and we will provide update during our investor day next month.","The second priority for this year is to improve our execution in key areas. For example, we\u2019ve been intently focused on enhancing the customer experience around our appliance business. Our hard work in this area is being recognized, and I\u2019m pleased to announce that according to the J.D. Power 2017 Appliance Retailer Satisfaction Study, Best Buy ranks highest in customer satisfaction amongst appliance retailers. We also continued to drive improvements in our sales effectiveness and overall customer interactions during the quarter, improved associate availability and knowledge, as well as the service experience continued to result in higher net promoter scores.","The third priority for this year is to continue to reduce cost and drive efficiencies throughout the business. As you may recall, last quarter, we reached our previous goal of $400 million. We then announced a new target of $600 million in additional annualized cost reductions and gross profit optimization to be completed by the end of fiscal 2021. During the second quarter, we achieved our first $50 million towards our new goal. Consistent with our prior practice, we expect to use these cost reductions to help fund investments and offset ongoing pressures in our business.","The fourth priority for this year is to build the capabilities necessary to deliver on the first three, which involves making investment in people and systems to drive growth, execution, and efficiencies. For example, this quarter, we invested in the rollout of our In-Home Advisor program including training the advisors and implementing a new customer relationship management system to help them be successful.","So, in summary, our Q2 performance reflects positive tailwinds, the strengths of our customer value proposition, and continued momentum in the execution of our strategy. Due to our unique positioning in the market, we continue to outperform the industry and strengthen our position as the leading destination of technology products and services.","While we do not believe that mid-single-digit comps are a new normal, we\u2019re excited about our opportunities going forward and the strategy we\u2019re pursuing. We look forward to providing more details on that strategy during our upcoming Investor Day.","Finally, to all of our associates across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, again, I want to thank you for your hard work, the dedication, and your customer focus as we Build the New Blue. Without you, none of this is possible.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our CFO, Corie Barry, for more details on our Q2 performance, and our Q3 and full year guidance.","Corie Barry","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our second quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. On enterprise revenue up $8.9 billion, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.69, both of which exceeded our expectations. We saw better-than-expected top-line results across multiple categories, particularly computing, wearables, mobile, gaming and tablet. The better-than-expected EPS was primarily driven by a lower than expected non-GAAP effective income tax rate and the flow-through of the higher revenue.","I will now talk about our second quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 4.8% to $8.9 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.12 or 21% to $0.69. This increase was primarily driven by the flow through of higher domestic revenue, a $0.03 per share benefit driven by our lower non-GAAP effective income tax rate and a $0.02 per share benefit from the net share count change. These increases were partially offset by higher domestic SG&A from expected increases in growth investments, higher incentive compensation expenses, and higher variable costs due to increased revenue. Additionally, we had $11 million or $0.02 per share of net negative impact from wrapping the Q2 fiscal 2017 periodic profit sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio.","In our domestic segment, revenue increased 4.9% to $8.3 billion. This increase was primarily driven by a comparable sales increase of 5.4%, partially offset by the loss of revenue from 11 large format and 42 Best Buy Mobile stores closed during the past year. While difficult to exactly pinpoint, we believe competitor store closures resulted in approximately 30 to 50 basis points of benefit to domestic revenue growth. From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in computing, wearables, smart home, mobile phones and appliances was partially offset by the declines in tablets.","As it relates to the home theater category, we continue to gain material market share. However, the industry continued the recent trends we saw in the first quarter and our sales were down slightly on a year-over-year basis. Domestic online revenue of $1.1 billion increased 31.2% on a comparable basis, primarily due to higher conversion rates and increased traffic. In our international segment, revenue increased 3.7% to $668 million due to comparable sales growth of 4.7%, driven by growth in both Canada and Mexico. This comparable sales growth was partially offset by approximately 220 basis points of negative foreign currency impact.","Turning now to gross profit, the enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 10 basis points to 24.1%. The domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate was flat year-over-year at 24% as improved margin rates across multiple categories particularly appliances, tablets and home theater were offset by margin pressure in the mobile category, the negative impact of higher sales in the lower margin wearables category and an approximately 10 basis -point negative impact from lapping the $11 million Q2 fiscal 2017 periodic profit sharing benefit. The international non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 80 basis points to 25.1%, primarily due to a lower year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada due to lower rates in the computing and appliance categories.","Now, turning to SG&A. Enterprise non-GAAP SG&A was $1.83 billion or 20.5% of revenue, which increased $58 million on a dollar basis but represented a 30 basis-point rate decline. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.67 billion or 20.2% of revenue, an increase of $61 million. This increase was primarily due to expected increases in growth investments, higher incentive compensation expenses and higher variable costs due to increased revenue. These increases were partially offset by the flow through of cost reductions. The 20 basis-point rate decrease was driven by sales leverage. International non-GAAP SG&A was $161 million or 24.1% of revenue, a decrease of $3 million. This decrease was primarily driven by slightly lower payroll and benefits costs. The 140 basis-point rate decrease was primarily driven by sales leverage.","From a cash flow perspective, we ended the second quarter in line with our expectations, which included our planned increase in the quarterly dividend and the acceleration of our share repurchase plan to $3 billion over two years. As it relates to capital expenditures, we are now expecting to spend approximately $700 million in fiscal 2018 as we have chosen to accelerate certain strategic investments in our e-commerce and supply chain functions. This was versus our previous expectation of approximately $650 million.","Before I talk about our guidance, I wanted to address the ongoing storms in Texas. With Harvey continuing to do damage in the area coupled with unknown recovery time, it is nearly impossible to predict the impact this could have on our business at this time. We continue to monitor the situation, first and foremost the safety of our people in the area and secondarily, for the potential impact on our results. Should it be required, we will provide further updates on the business impact.","I would now like to talk about our full year fiscal 2018 guidance, which as a reminder, has an extra week in the fourth quarter. Today, we are raising our topline guidance and are now expecting full year revenue growth of approximately 4% versus our previous outlook of 2.5%. On the profitability side, we are now expecting full year non-GAAP operating income growth of 4 to 9% versus our previous outlook of 3.5 to 8.5% growth. The full year guidance we have provided today reflects stronger than originally expected second half revenue performance with profitability roughly in line with our previous expectations for the second half. The increased top line expectations are being driven by the anticipation of continued positive industry and consumer momentum coupled with the impact of product launches.","From a profitability perspective, while our original full year guidance anticipated an increased level of investments in our fiscal 2018. we have made strategic decisions to proactively make additional Q3 an Q4 investments to continue to drive the Best Buy 2020 strategy forward. Those additional investments will be in areas such as customer choice in shipping, e-commerce and our long-term strategic vision for supply chain. Additionally, our performance is expected to drive higher incentive compensation expenses consistent with what we saw in the second quarter. We believe our strong performance so far this year has us well-positioned to accelerate these investments.","With the holiday season still in front of us, our full year outlook range reflects our current use of investment, returns from new initiatives, ongoing cost reductions and efficiency, and ongoing pressures in the business including the remaining approximately $40 million or $0.08 per share of lower profit share revenue we expect to receive in Q3 and Q4, which is in addition to the $25 million or $0.05 per share of pressure we lapped in the first half.","As it relates to our Q3 fiscal 2018 guidance, our expectations include many of the positive consumer and industry factors I just discussed as well as the portion of the increased investment. With these incorporated, we expect enterprise revenue in the range of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion and enterprise comparable sales growth in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%. On a segment basis, we\u2019re estimating domestic comparable sales growth in the range of 4.5% to 5.5% and international comparable sales growth in the range of flat to 3%. We expect to deliver non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.75 to $0.80, assuming a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of 32% to 32.5%. This assumes the diluted weighted average share count of approximately 305 million shares. This guidance range includes lapping approximately $25 million or $0.05 per share of net negative impact from the periodic profit sharing benefits in our domestic business.","I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we\u2019ll go first to Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets.","Anthony Chukumba","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. On these earnings calls, sort of we all get [indiscernible] saying congratulations on a good quarter, but congrats, because this is a blockbuster quarter, particularly from a top-line perspective. I guess, my question is on -- and Hubert, I certainly understand, I mean we should not expect mid-single digit comps to be the new normal. But, I guess, I was just very surprised by the comp performance given the fact that the iPhone 8 launch is coming in September. And I\u2019m particularly surprised with the fact that you called out mobile as a strong category. I guess, how did it all come together? What all came together in this quarter that we saw this significant sequence of acceleration in the comp and the best comp performance since I don\u2019t even remember when?","Hubert Joly","Anthony, thank you for your very kind comments. I\u2019m going to have Corie talk about the forward-looking statements.","Corie Barry","Yes. So, let\u2019s start with what kind of all came together in Q2 and what really performed. If you look at really where we saw some changes in trajectory, we had a couple of things happen. One, the NPD tracked categories, which again represent about little over 60% of our business, were up 1.1% versus down 3.2% in Q1. And particularly, there we saw strength in computing, which accelerated across the industry as well as slightly less bad results in tablets, if that makes sense. We saw that trajectory change on us. It still was a drainer, but it wasn\u2019t quite as bad as what we\u2019ve seen in Q1. On top of that, we also said we saw some strength in wearables which is not an NPD, and we saw, to your point, some strength in the mobile business. And really, a lot of that was around some of the offers that were specific to Best Buy and some of just the underlying strengths, not just the new launches but in some of the older generations of phones as well. We offered our customers choice across a myriad of price points and different releases.","As we look forward into Q3, we definitely would expect some of that trajectory to continue in mobile. And remember, the biggest change year-over-year in mobile is the fact that we believe there\u2019s going to be a note, and that that will fill the hole that we had last year, and that maybe some of those other massive trajectory changes might abate just a bit as we head into Q3, and we have more interest likely on some of the new handheld devices.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Curtis Nagle with Bank of America.","Curtis Nagle","Great, thanks very much for taking the question. I guess, kind of continuing on the subject of comps, understanding that given you\u2019re probably not going to maintain a mid-single-digit comps in perpetuity. But just looking at 4Q, it does imply that -- I think that there is a bit of a slowdown. And looking at the compares, there were big product shortages last year and we now have what looks like a pretty decent mobile cycle. I would expect to be a little more strength I suppose. Is it just reflective of maybe some conservatism on your part or something else?","Corie Barry","So, thank you for the question. Q4 -- so, let\u2019s just start first of all with the nature of Q4. Q4 obviously is not necessarily comparable to our other quarters. You\u2019ve seen that even in our prior year. We\u2019re happy that we were able to raise and now expect growth of approximately 2% across Q3 and Q4. So, we like that. The trick about Q4 is you can\u2019t always carry the trends of the business forward into Q4 and it\u2019s a highly competitive quarter. Obviously, there is still a lot of unknowns around launches and availabilities. And so, right now, based on the information we have in front of us, we felt like, the Q4 was well positioned, we do still feel like it\u2019s still open at the hole that was left by the notes and we feel like it carries some level of mobile strength forward but accounts for just the changing dynamic of how sales flow in the quarter, given the highly promotional nature and competitive nature of the quarter.","Curtis Nagle","Okay. And then, just a quick follow-up if I may. What\u2019s driving such strong performance in the gaming business that at least by my calculation, it looks like you\u2019re double what the industry is doing at the moment.","Corie Barry","Thank you for the question. We feel like we\u2019re performing quite well in the switch, in particular that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the gaming category right now. We were happy with our performance over the quarter. We felt like we were well positioned, had good allocations, performed slightly better than we thought. That being said, obviously, we didn\u2019t list it as one of our largest comp -- weighted comp drivers, so it\u2019s good, and we like the change in the trajectory still given like Hubert said, we saw strength across a multitude of categories. And so, we like the switch right now. And again, as you think about what changes in Q4, I think you have to recognize the competitiveness around gaming hardware in particular and whether or not this kind of growth rate continues through Q4 broadly.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks. Good morning, nice results, everyone. My question is about investments, somewhat around Best Buy 2020. I know -- I don\u2019t want to preempt what we\u2019re going to talk about in September. I want to talk about I guess what investments you wouldn\u2019t have made or had at the top line or what would have gone slower? And just thinking about the flow-through of this business, because we\u2019re used to a very significant and strong flow-through. Granted, you are pulling some things forward, but does Best Buy 2020 at least in the early days require a greater level of investment that even when we -- let\u2019s get back to a new normal of comp, I don\u2019t know 1 to 3 whatever we get to next year, doesn\u2019t provide the same type of flow-through that we\u2019ve been used to seeing for the past several years?","Hubert Joly","Yes, so we\u2019ll be happy Simeon. We\u2019ll be happy to provide some more color and details on the growth opportunities and the kind of investments that are needed. At the highest level, the investments we\u2019re talking about in are people. So, if you take In-Home Advisor, clearly, we\u2019re adding people, we\u2019re training these people. This is a compensation level that\u2019s higher, and then we\u2019re equipping them with tools. For example, one of the great tools that they are actually very excited about is a new CRM system, customer relationship management system that we\u2019ve invested in and that we\u2019ll continue to invest in.","From a savings standpoint, clearly, your first -- assigning these new associates and training in the month of July and then investing of course in the development and the rollout of the system. And then, there is a lead time before they can be [ph] productive, because it takes time to develop a book of business. The sales cycle tends to be slightly longer in this business. And of course, as it builds a portfolio of customers and deeper relationship, it takes time to ramp up. So, that\u2019s an example of kind of investments we\u2019re talking about.","The revenue profile also on some of the initiatives we\u2019re talking about, in particular in the recurring revenue streams, related to services, this is something we\u2019ll have to walk you through; the profile is different from product sales. So, we\u2019ll try to provide as much detail as possible when we meet. But, yes, you\u2019re right, there is a phasing of these things. At the highest level, what we feel as a management team is that there is -- we have an opportunity rich environment. We have momentum. We feel our value proposition is resonating with customers. So, this is the time, play to win and invest in the context where we continue to focus on the cost takeout, which itself requires some investments. Corie, would you like to add some more details?","Corie Barry","I would just build just a little bit on what you said. I think we\u2019ve said it before. You\u2019re going to see fluctuations quarter-to-quarter because as exactly Hubert stated, you\u2019re not going to see the perfect timing between the investments and the return on those investments. That being said, we\u2019ve also said out loud, we would expect the increases in operating margins to moderate over time. And, I think in general, everyone would want that as we reinvest into the business and make sure we remain competitive and remain differentiated in the marketplace. And so, we\u2019ll try to kind of guide you through what we think the puts and takes are going be on any given quarter. But broadly, I think we would expect the operating margin, just large increases that you\u2019ve been seeing, moderate. And we even had said that last quarter.","Simeon Gutman","Great. Can I just ask one follow-up? If you take the entire investments that you have planned, let\u2019s say for the next couple of years, how much of that on a percentage can you pull forward? Just to give us a gauge of -- when you -- if you comp these 5 plus going forward, how much of that investment could we see actually lay on ahead of the payoff?","Corie Barry","Yes. So, we\u2019re not going to provide the long-term forward-looking guidance right now, but suffice it to say, we\u2019re trying to make the best possible current decisions, given the climates that we\u2019re operating in, to invest in those things that we think will help us next year and the year after and return as quickly as possible. And so, wherever we think we can and we think we have the right business case, we\u2019re trying to pull those forward. And it\u2019s evolving, frankly, every week as we were more about some of the pilots and initiatives that we\u2019ve talked to you about.","Operator","We will go next to Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks a lot and good morning. I want to talk about two outliers that are positive and then maybe one of the only softer numbers in the print [ph] and that is the surge you had in the online business and then the small step back that you had in the services comp even as you are ramping up some of these really interesting innovative service offerings. So, if you could speak to each of those would be great?","Hubert Joly","Yes. Thank you. Online continues to be an area of growth. It\u2019s been a key area of focus for us since we first launched Renew Blue. So, much of the customer experience has been starting online. So, what we\u2019re seeing today is a continued effect of the cumulative investments we\u2019ve made in simplifying and streamlining the customer experience. There is a lot of details that you do to tweak and eliminate the frictions in logging and checkout every step in the journey. And then, the drive times also have been pretty strong for us in the months of July. We have Black Friday in July event that was quite strong. The Prime Day was also quite strong for us, as well as our teams mobilized around these drive times. So, continued momentum, and we imagine that --we\u2019re working to continue to drive these results knowing that our online strategy is not just about the online channel [indiscernible] and then there is the synergies between the two channels where we\u2019re uniquely positioned to help the customers in a unique way. So, you will see us continue to invest as a priority in digital and in general.","As it relates to services, the services line in our comps is one of the hardest to track, in particular because of the way the accounting works for the extended warranties. And so, there is a difference between product sales numbers and the GAAP numbers. This is probably too much detail but there are all sorts of difference. Point of sales number is actually better than the GAAP number, and we\u2019ll be happy to provide any kind of offline tutorial on that.","The other thing that\u2019s driving services, and again we\u2019ll have to talk about it during the investor day, we\u2019re shifting the business in services. Historically, a big part of our services revenue were the extended warranties. And they provide a very meaningful service to customers. I myself recently bought a dishwasher and I benefited from the service. But, we are focused on innovating in the service arena, in particular around what we tech support where we support all of the customers -- all of the products that customer has in their home through an ongoing subscription service. The revenue recognition of this is different. You don\u2019t recognize all of the revenue upfront; you recognize it over time. And as you know, we\u2019ve rolled out this service in Canada and we are piloting it in U.S. This will have an effect; it\u2019s purely GAAP versus cash flow. So, the cash flow doesn\u2019t change, but it has an impact as well.","So, these are some of the puts and takes. It\u2019s harder to read than we would like. But, we continue to believe, generally speaking, that technical services as well as what we call, managed services or solutions like what we have with have Best Buy Smart Home powered by Vivint; recurring revenue drivers will be a good contributor to our future.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning. I was hoping you could provide us some additional color regarding the product mix differences between store sales and e-com sales today as well as the best way to think about the profitability impact of the e-commerce growth because obviously it\u2019s -- over half of the total comp growth is coming from e-commerce. Thanks.","Corie Barry","Yes, absolutely, great question. So, the mix difference is between store and e-com, really not quite as pronounced as they historically were but there are obviously some key categories that are pre-underpenetrated online. I would use mobile as an example, where we are continually working on evolving our mobile experience. But so much of what you need to do or want to do to transfer data and understand your phone is much more of a physical experience than it is an easy digital one. We tend to still over-index in some of what you would consider smaller cube, overseeing nice growth in some of the areas where people get more and more comfortable around large cubes. So, that the mix isn\u2019t quite as different as it used to be but there are definitely some underpenetrated areas like mobile that creates a difference in the product assortment.","In terms of profitability, and we\u2019ve talked about this before. Obviously, the biggest profitability difference between the two channels for us is around services and accessories, and a bit of a different profile online versus in-store. So, I don\u2019t consider that just natural product that\u2019s a bit of like the other things you need to complete your solutions. But, the teams have done a really exceptional job working on that customer experience in a very frictionless way online, but also letting people know what it is they need in addition to their product purchase, so just make the stuff work when they get home. And so, what\u2019s happened is while we mixed into the business and that does put some pressure on the margins, the teams have done a nice job improving the rates in the channel. And so kind of the mix rate at the end of the day is shaking out to be way less impactful than I think some others are seeing in the space. ","Scot Ciccarelli","So, Corie, is it fair to assume that it\u2019s some pressure but not as much as it had been, say 12 to 18 months ago, simply because the rate within e-commerce channel is improving?","Corie Barry","Yes, I think that\u2019s fair.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Dan Binder with Jefferies. ","Dan Binder","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question, and congratulations on a great quarter. My question was really two-fold. First, around investments. You broadly described the incremental investments that you\u2019re making in supply chain and I think shipping. I was wondering if you could just detail for us a little bit more what those things are specifically. And then, within the quarter, what was the main buckets for the $50 million in cost reductions?","Corie Barry","So, on the investment side of things, we\u2019re not going to put every detail on the table, because we think some of them are pretty strategic in nature. But in general, think about this as on the supply chain side, us continuing to evolve our supply chain infrastructure strategically to enable obviously faster shipping when the customer wants and expects it. And so, we\u2019re putting some work behind the scenes on how do we need to continue to evolve both our partnerships and just our infrastructure to enable speed and choice when the customer wants it. But because as much in CE, [ph] it\u2019s much about choice and making sure that you\u2019re there and you feel comfortable about your product, potentially sitting on your front porch, if you\u2019re not there to receive it.","On the cost reduction side, and the buckets that we\u2019re seeing there, we\u2019d hit on last time how we\u2019re really working hard to make this next round of cost reduction a little bit more about process and process improvements. And some of the places that we\u2019re actually seeing this last 50 million are around -- and they\u2019re actually some things that we\u2019ve talked about before, returning, replacements and damages and more things through -- particularly some of our recycling programs. We\u2019ve seen some nice improvements internationally from our business in Canada where they\u2019ve done some of the same work that we\u2019ve started here in the U.S. And we\u2019ve actually seen some other nice benefits from optimization in areas like marketing and some other areas where we\u2019re using some of this process to help pull out cost and at the same time allow us to reinvest.","Dan Binder","Okay, thanks. And just as a follow-up, you talked a little bit about trends in home theater and the industry being softer. I was wondering if you could just detail little bit for us what you did see in TV unit ASPs and how that compare to the industry numbers that you follow?","Corie Barry","Yes. So, like I said in the prepared remarks, we saw similar to Q1 performance across the industry. I think what changed a little bit is that we definitely, industry-wide, saw units down and ASPs up a bit. And for us, what we liked is again our positioning in the marketplace, as we\u2019re able to cater to a little bit more of that premium assortment and some of the more branded products and the higher end tiers. But the industry numbers that we saw were actually very similar to Q1, just a bit of a difference in composition as we saw a little bit more softness in units industry-wide and a little bit better ASPs.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Kate McShane with Citi Research.","Kate McShane","Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering with regards to your testing of the in-home advisor services. Have you talked at all about the comp lift to the stores in those areas where the tests were conducted?","Hubert Joly","Good morning, Kate. We\u2019ve not talked publicly about the list on the stores in the various pilots there have been different approaches in terms of the density of the in-home advisors. So, in some markets we had one in-home advisor per store; in other markets, it was one per several stores. What is very encouraging is that every incremental IHA we have is actually providing a great customer experience and then, [indiscernible] themselves very nicely, immediately and then over time. As we deploy this program next month in September, this will be available nationwide. We\u2019ll have a number of IHAs across the country and we\u2019ll talk about it next month. We then will pace ourselves to see how many we add over time. There is an internal debate at the companies how big is this going to be. The good thing about this is that individually they are profitable and then this is a case where supply creates demand. So, at this point, I\u2019m not going to give you today the elements to model this, but this is incrementally positive. And the big question is how many in the end will we have because the impact on the business is different if it is 250 in-home advisors nationwide versus 1,000 or more, and we\u2019ll know this only after ramping this up. This will be a gradual ramp up of the number of IHAs, in-home advisors over time.","The summary today is it\u2019s a great customer experience, very exciting job opportunities for the associates, because it\u2019s a professional sales career and we like the economics.","Kate McShane","Thank you. And I can ask one quick follow-up question with regards to the new relationship with Google and Alexa that you mentioned. I think you said that they would be Blue Shirts but will there be any employees from the vendors involved in that endeavor?","Hubert Joly","Kate, thank you. Yes, we\u2019re very excited about continuing to partner with some of the world\u2019s foremost tech companies and in particular in the smartphone area and in particular around the voice. In case of Google and Amazon, these are Best Buy associates; there is no vendor labor and there is both Blue Shirt -- dedicated Blue Shirts especially trained with demos in the stores. It\u2019s a good opportunity to really understand what you can do with these products, and then of course the Geek Squad able to install setup and support. So, great customer experience by Best Buy employees.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.","Brian Nagel","So, first question I had just with respect to the gross margin trend. So, would you speak -- despite the strong sales result, gross margins tick lower here, in the second quarter. So, I know Corie, I know you just said in your prepared remarks, but just if you could go over again what changed from the gross margin perspective going from earlier this year and into this quarter? And then, how should we think about that trajectory into the back half of the year?","Corie Barry","Yes. Thank you for the question. I think in terms of what happened in Q2, it actually was very much in line with what we expected. Ticked down a bit enterprise wide but flat domestically. And that was while we lapped just over 10 basis points of impact from the AIG profit sharing the year prior. If you look back at the prepared remarks, here a couple of things changed. One, the wearables category really performed well for us. And we\u2019re very pleased with that, but it has a bit of a lower margin profile and therefore the mix had an impact on the business. And in general, we had said, we expected some of the massive GP increases that we had been seeing over time, to start to moderate. And that\u2019s a little bit of what we saw. So, there wasn\u2019t -- I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as anything really unusual in the gross profit. And in terms of how we think about that going forward. Obviously, we\u2019re lapping even larger AIG profit sharings in Q3, but we\u2019d expect kind of the same general flattish type of margin performance, gross profit performance in Q3 as we saw in Q2 with kind of similar continuing product composition.","Brian Nagel","Got it. Just to be clear from a promotional standpoint in the sector; that was not a factor in Q2?","Corie Barry","I\u2019m sorry, could you repeat the first part of that? Sorry.","Brian Nagel","Sorry. Just to be clear, so from the standpoint of promotions within the sector, promotional activity, that was not a factor. So, the heightened promotions were not a factor in Q2?","Corie Barry","I would not characterize that as a driving factor of the overall profitability.","Brian Nagel","Got it. And then, my follow-up question, this is obviously a lot of moving parts here with the different products and the launches coming. But, as we look at the guidance you now have for the second half of the year, what\u2019s baked in there with respect to the potential in the iPhone 8, the TV category, some of your [indiscernible] particular driving categories for holiday season?","Corie Barry","So, I\u2019ll try to hit on it a couple of things. One, obviously, we\u2019re assuming there are phone launches, we\u2019re assuming there is a Note launch and that that phone is a viable phone for the back half. We\u2019re assuming there is an iPhone 8 launch and that is also a viable phone for the back half. And obviously, we have to kind of draw the line in the sand in terms of when we think those things are launching but we\u2019ve made assumptions based on the best information possible.","In terms of the TV category, we\u2019re assuming the industry performance continues on a similar trajectory that we\u2019ve been seeing. So, we baked that in. Obviously, again, the holiday season being a little trickier, we\u2019re doing the best we can to project both our own and our competitors\u2019 positioning. But, we\u2019re assuming that also continues. And then, I touched gaming little bit earlier, expecting potentially a little bit of moderation. And just remember, gaming becomes a smaller part of our business, percent of our business as we head into Q4; it\u2019s a highly competitive part of the environment. And so, again, we\u2019re trying to take our best account of where we think we\u2019ll be positioned, where our competitors will and we\u2019re pushing that forward also into the back half.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Given your comments about the operating margin expansion starting to crash [ph] and the fact that in 2Q, your SG&A was heavily influenced by increased incentive comp and higher variable costs. Looking out over the next couple of years, will your operating profit dollars just start to flow more consistently with your sales? And what\u2019s the risk that you\u2019ll increasingly need to deploy more investments in order to drive sales such that margins might even start to contract over time?","Hubert Joly","Yes. So, we\u2019ll talk about the strategy, and the best outlook we can give you next month. But at the highest level, consistent with what we\u2019ve said before, as we go into Best Buy 2020, as we assess the opportunity we have to increase the gap with competition, the opportunity we have to play to win, we feel that number one priority in this phase is to see how we can gradually accelerate our revenue growth. We\u2019ve laid out the economic equation we\u2019re trying to solve. We continue to be committed to efficiencies, so that we can fund investments. We do not see at this point, driving the profit margin rate, the operating income rate as a priority. We think that this is a time -- it would not be realistic in this environment to assert this.","We think that we\u2019re proud of the fact that operating income rate in fact has been increasing over the last little while and continues to increase this quarter. But we don\u2019t see it as a strategic priority to drive profit margin rate, we see it as a priority to increase the differentiation from a customer experience, drive the top-line growth, play-to-win in a time where I think the separation between winners and losers becomes increasingly clear. So, from a long-term perspective, that\u2019s how we are thinking. In the short-term, you\u2019ve seen us be very responsible. We\u2019re not going overboard where we\u2019re pacing ourselves. And when we see that things are going well, we tend to accelerate our investments. So, that\u2019s how we are thinking about it; more to come next month.","Michael Lasser","And my follow-up question is, can you frame the impact from the decline in gross profit margin rate for the mobile category? And is this decline happening because of the changing economic profile of the category and do you expect that that\u2019s going to continue?","Corie Barry","Yes. So, I think there are a lot of pieces that play in mobile. Some of it is absolutely, as you\u2019re alluding to, is just the evolution of the category of a more mature category, definitely with installment billing, people realize just how much their phone costs and in some cases are sweating assets or thinking about different ways to buy phones. You have phones that are also just offering forms and features that used to be supplied by accessories, things like submersibility in water or glass that is much less breakable. And so, I think you\u2019ve seen us talking about mobile actually as gross profit rate is attractive for a few quarter now and a lot of those different dynamics at play in the margin profile. That being said, it\u2019s still a fantastic category for us. And obviously, there is still a lot of consumer interest in it. And to what you\u2019ve been talking at, a lot of launches yet in front of us. And so, while the profit rates of the category have seen some pressure, as frankly you\u2019d expect for any category as it matures to this level, overarchingly we still really like the business.","Michael Lasser","And can I just follow up on that? As those new launches roll in, how is that going to impact the profitability of the category?","Corie Barry","In general, I would expect this to continue to be a category where we\u2019re going to see some profit rate pressure. And we\u2019ve actually baked that into the guidance that we gave you today. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go to next to David Schick with Consumer Edge Research.","Q - David Schick","I wanted to get your thoughts on smart home products and services. In aggregate, as you look at the customers you\u2019re helping in those parts of the store, are those the existing customers of Best Buy or are you bringing somebody new? Anything you could tell us about how merchandising changes and service addition changes are evolving the customer base would be very helpful. Thank you.","Hubert Joly","So, on the customer base, the Best Buy customer, our target customer, we\u2019ve talked about this, is a -- we call them the high touch tech fans. These are people who are passionate about technology and need a bit of help with us and that includes many of us. Incidentally, many of them are millennials. In fact, half of that target customer segment is millennials and we tend to do well with millennials. Our penetration of millennials is actually higher than some of the other demographics. So, the typical customer for the smart home, I don\u2019t think varies significantly from the rest of the store. One of the things we\u2019re excited about from the trend standpoint is the fact that the millennials are finally leaving their parents\u2019 home and investing in their new home. And of course because they are more digitally savvy, they tend to spend more. So that\u2019s one of the positive trends and opportunities that we can think about, which is also exciting as it -- stores with the merchandising solution and the partnerships, we\u2019ve talked about, provide a unique opportunity to get help, because there is a lot of device proliferation in that space and finding out what to buy, what is compatible, what works together, what use cases that\u2019s Best Buy is a great designation. In fact, I would assert the best destination in the country where you can get that advice. So, again, there is opportunity, typical customer, excited about the trends, in particular surrounding the millennials and a great destination for these customers.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Matt McClintock with Barclays.","Matt McClintock","Hi, yes. Good morning, everyone. I was wondering if we could focus on the computing segment. Two quarters in a row, it\u2019s driven or led comp store sales. And just looking forward and trying not to get into guidance for next year. But looking forward, could you talk about the broader trends that\u2019s driving that and the sustainability of those trends into next year and beyond? Thank you.","Hubert Joly","So, I\u2019m going to start and Corie can amplify it. One of the things that has been a key factor for us, and it\u2019s always harder to predict what\u2019s there happen, but to what that is driving the business is the fact that the computing category has seen meaningful product innovation in the last several quarters in large part driven by the great collaboration that our merchant teams have with the key vendors, in particular in the Windows environment. There was recently, I think maybe two weeks ago by the way sort of product reviews in the Wall Street Journal where the gentlemen highlighting the excitement about these new products, there\u2019s been the creation of a premium category for laptops in particular with features and functionalities that people love. This is a great example of innovation combined with a great shopping experience driving demand, and then us doing quite well in that context with the ability to provide help and service and advice to customers. So, to your point, yes, we\u2019re not going to go into guidance for next year. But, this is a great example of product innovation and vendor partnerships, and the great customer experience in the stores and online driving the revenue performance.","Matt McClintock","And then, if I could ask a follow-up on that, just as you transition the business model to more services, service-based retailing or however you\u2019re going to explain it to us at the analyst day. How should we think about that from a product category standpoint? I mean, are there some categories that just lend themselves naturally to providing more services than others, and could you maybe just preview or give us a little insight into how to think about that?","Hubert Joly","Yes, I think -- to be clear, from a revenue standpoint, we\u2019re going to continue to see the vast majority of our revenues coming from products. And in some cases, the service approach we offer actually produces no immediate service revenue. If I take the In-Home Advisor program which you could say is a kind of service or it\u2019s a consultative service, that\u2019s a free value proposition that does not therefore generate immediate service revenue, that generates product revenue and then service revenue in the form of installation and then support. But bear in mind that the vast majority of our revenue is going to continue to be products. Where we play really with these approaches is when there is complexity. So, we tend to do really well when we\u2019re dealing with complex systems, large cube, high touch solutions where if you need to design a smart home solution, if you need to design a music streaming solution throughout your home, as I was explaining, that tends to be a forte, either because of our in-home channel, particularly well positioned to do this or in the stores, the great place for discovery, support and service and advice.","So, at this point, I would leave it at this, but continued to focus on products and striving when -- it\u2019s a matter of helping customers and helping them imagine what\u2019s possible and then making it happen for them.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our final question from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Dan Wewer","Thanks. One of the benefits of your significant online market share growth is the ability to close some of the less productive retail stores. I believe your selling space is down about 0.7% year-over-year. What do you think is the minimum number of large format stores that Best Buy made in the U.S. to support the omni-channel strategy?","Hubert Joly","I think that our view of the store portfolio has been very consistent since we began. We have a great store footprint, great locations throughout the U.S.; the vast, vast majority of our stores are profitable. And we\u2019ve always said that we would have a gradual optimization of the store footprint. Instantly, when we grow online revenue, we don\u2019t see it as a great way to close stores, we\u2019re not excited about closing stores. In fact, our focus is on growing the Company across the various touch points. Some of the online growth is cannibalistic, some of it is not. And so, we\u2019re here to drive this. We\u2019ll provide -- Corie will provide the latest thinking on the store portfolio at the Investor Day but this is -- since the beginning, it\u2019s not being the store shrinking strategy this has been a customer focus, how can we help you to get a great customer experience strategy.","Corie Barry","And again, keep in mind, we always try to remind people so much of what we do online is enabled by the stores with 50% of it either picked up in or shipped from a store. And so, the goal at the end of the day is to make the store as productive as possible, not closing.","Dan Wewer","Just as a follow-up, there was interesting article in today\u2019s Wall Street Journal comparing your In-Home Advisor approach to Amazon. I was curious, what in your test, I believe you\u2019re in five markets now or headed in five markets, what triggers the customer making an appointment for an In-Home Advisor? Is it their visiting the store and then being made aware of the service or is it something that they\u2019re seeing online and then triggering the appointment?","Hubert Joly","Yes. So, today, we are in five markets; next month, we\u2019ll be in all major cities throughout the U.S. To your point, the way that people have learned about this service today other than listening to our investor calls has been through the in-store experience. So, typically, what will happen is that as the customer goes into the stores and having a conversation with an associate, the associates says or feels given what you are trying to accomplish might be easier, if we send somebody to your home to have a better conversation about, what\u2019s you\u2019re trying to accomplish and then what\u2019s possible. And then, there is a referral to the in-home associate or advisor that then goes to the home.","As we run this up, we will ramp up the awareness building activities. So, the customers will be made aware of this on our own vehicles of the sites and emails and any other vehicle we choose to use. We expect also that word of mouth is going to work very nicely. In the Orlando markets, there is one of the in-home advisors, Jessica has built a reputation for ourselves in one of the communities there, and neighbors talk about her and are queuing up to get her service. So, word of mouth is a great example. And then as the recurring lifelong relationships you build, this is a situation where supply creates demands and over time you are going to build this. So, we\u2019re going pace our way into this but that\u2019s where we are today.","Dan Wewer","Okay great thank you. ","Hubert Joly","Thank you so much and thank you all. In closing, of course we look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day on September 19th here in Minnesota, great time of the year to visit. We thank you for your continued support and interest. And of course we at Best Buy here are especially thankful to our employees across the U.S., Canada and Mexico that made these results possible and are working hard to build the New Blue. Thank you again and have a great day. See you soon.","Operator","And this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation.

","I will now turn the call over to Hubert.","Hubert Joly","Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with an overview of our fourth quarter results and full year results and will then discussed the status of Renew Blue transformation and our priority for fiscal 2016. Before turning the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary and our financial outlook. So first our financial results; In the fourth quarter our teams delivered positive comparable sales, improved profitability and continued progress in our Renew Blue transformation. This resulted in a 1.3% increase in revenue to $14.2 billion and a 23% increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS to $1.48 versus $1.20 last year primarily driven by growth in our domestic segment. A compelling merchandise assortment and strong multi-channel execution drove these better-than-expected results as we capitalized on the product cycles in large screen televisions and mobile phones. These two categories were the primary drivers of our year-over-year revenue growth, and more than offset weakness in the tablet category which was impacted by material industry declines.","Our value proposition of expert service and billable price resonating with customers whether they come to us in-store, online or both. We delivered to our customers a strong multi-channel experience and we were uniquely positioned to serve them to our national retail footprint, online experience, knowledgeable Blue shares and Geek Squad agents in our stores within a store. We also benefitted during the fourth quarter from our investments in inventory availability, mobile phone installment billing, and supply chain including faster store replenishment and online delivery, as well as more effective and relevant marketing. Altogether, these results reflect the successful delivery of our holiday plan. We said that we would execute a highly disciplined operating and promotional plan that would drive a better year-over-year financial outcome for our shareholders and these results reflect that.","On a full year basis we continue to make progress against the two main problems we have to solve that we outlines in November of 2012; number one, declining accounts and number two, declining operating margins.","In fiscal 2015, we stabilize comparable sales on a full year basis and delivered incremental non-GAAP SG&A reductions of approximately $420 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating income rate expansion of 80 basis points and 26% increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS to $2.60. We also ended the year with $3.9 billion in cash versus $2.6 billion last year. These results reflect accumulative progress since 2012 that we have made against our Renew Blue transformation initiatives. So to-date we have number one improved our NPS score by 450 basis points; number two we\u2019ve rolled out 71 Pacific Kitchen and Home and 34 Magnolia Design Center stores-within-a-store, in addition to our enhanced vendor experiences. Number three, we\u2019ve implemented ship-from-store across the whole chain driving significant growth for our business; number four, we\u2019ve increased domestic online penetrations from 7% to 9.8% of our revenue; number five, we\u2019ve gain share across multiple categories; number six, we\u2019ve delivered $1.02 billion in Renew Blue cost reductions exceeding our $1 billion target; number seven, we\u2019ve divested underperforming European and Chinese businesses and number eight, we\u2019ve intensively managed our capital resources and significantly strengthen balance sheet.","In light of this progress and as a demonstration of our commitment our shareholders, we were pleased to announce this morning our plan to return excess capital. This plan allows us to continue to invest in the growth of our business and preserves a strong balance sheet, it includes number one; special one-time dividend of $0.51 per share or approximately $180 million [related] to the net after tax proceeds from LCD-related legal settlement received in the last three fiscal years. Number two, a 21% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share and number three, the resumption of share repurchases with the intent to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over the next three years.","So before I turn to our plan for this year, I want to publicly thank our employees for the impact of their hard work. We have a very talented and dedicated set of leaders and employees at Best Buy and it is an honor to lead this group of amazing individuals and a privilege to work with each and every one of them.","Now as we look forward to fiscal 2016 and beyond, it is imperative that we continue to focus on driving comparable sales and improving operating margins while spending investments in our future. As we have previously shared, we are pursuing a strategy that is focus on delivering advice, service and convenience at competitive prices to our customers, within this strategy we\u2019re focused on driving a number of growth initiatives around key product categories, live events and services and to drive these initiatives we\u2019re pursuing and investing in the transformation of our key functions and processes. To provide more color on these initiatives which reflect complete execution against the 24 months road map that we were planning a year ago, I will now provide specific actions we intend to pursue in fiscal 2016.","So the first initiative of our roadmap is merchandising, our goal is to create a compelling assortment online and in the stores with a superior end-to-end customer experience that yield enhanced financial returns. In pursuit of that, we plan number one; to capitalize on the ultra-high definition TV cycle to best-in-class merchandising assortment in customer experience including opening approximately 20 additional Magnolia Design Center stores-within-a-store to end fiscal 2016 with 78. Number two, we plan to accelerate our expansion in growing categories with structural barriers to entry like large appliances and mobile phone, including opening approximately 50 additional Pacific Kitchen and Home stores-within-a-store to end fiscal 2016 with 177, as well as extending our installment bidding spending capability online; number three, we plan to grow our connected home and health and wearable businesses to an optimized assortment and improved multi-channel customer experience; number four, we plan to increase our branded exclusive and private label assortment; number five, we plan to expand our secondary market growth strategy to offer consumers better access to these types of products and improve our margin recovery on returns we placed in damaged products and number six, we plan to acquire strides behind our promotional and pricing strategies.","We will also, as part of this merchandizing trust expand our programs to capture customers at the time of key life events and build long-term relationships with them including our new mobile program and our wedding gift registry which we launched in February. The second initiative is marketing which provides of course crucial support for our merchandizing growth opportunities. In marketing we will accelerate our targeted marketing programs by leveraging a senior customer data base to expand personalization beyond email campaigns. We will expand the personalization of our targeted email campaigns by dynamic serving relevant landing pages when customers click through to our website. We will continue the evolution of our marketing spend from analog and mass to digital and personalized medium such as search, mobile devices and retargeting. And we will continue to increase the number of addressable emails in our customer data base.","The next initiative on our road map is online, our goal here is to serve our customers based on how where and when they want to be served and capture online shares. In pursuit of that goal we will continue to develop true omni-channel experiences including; number one, improving the online visibility of returns open box inventory; number two, extending our installment bidding selling capability online; number three, enhancing the online experience for appliance purchases; number four, expanding capability for life events like the wedding registry and wish list. And number five providing an integrated Geek Squad customer experience across channels and devices and driving increased attach rates.","We will also be continuing the transformation of our e-commerce technology platform and accelerating the transformation of our mobile customer expense which we will support for our new technology development center in Seattle. Similar to general industry trends our traffic for mobile phones is growing much faster than traditional desktop traffic and we're increasing our mobile investments accordingly. It is imperative that we engage mobile customers with improved and streamlined access to essential rich product information during the discovery, research and check out processes.","The next initiative in our roadmap is retail stores. In our retail stores we're building on the great momentum from our success in fiscal 2015 and we'll be driving increased sales effectiveness and favorable leverage from focus on the individual sales productivity of our associates. We will be enhancing our in-store customer experience from both an expert service and physical environment perspective including expanding product training for associates, and we will be driving growth by implementing market plans that are tailored to specific geographies.","The next initiative in our roadmap is services. In fiscal 2015 we significantly reduced legacy cost structure and improved services related NPS growth, we also lunched a lost and theft mobile phone insurance program and will complete technology support bundles.","Now despite these accomplishments revenue has been declining largely due to lower attach rates of traditional extended warranties and lower mobile revenue due to our success in decreasing claims severity and frequency which is an operational positive. So in fiscal 2016, we'll be focused on continuing to transform our traditional service offerings to better address customer needs, we will be integrating the Geek Squad customer experience into bestbuy.com to provide an enhanced service experience to our customers and to increase online attach rates. We'll be continuing to improve our delivery and installation experience and we'll be increasing the investment in marketing and selling our service offerings.","The next initiative in our roadmap is supply chain. Our goal in supply chain is to leverage our network and improve our customer experience with increased inventory availability improve speed to customer and improved home delivery and installation capability for a large [CUBE] Assortments. In pursuit of that goal we will unlock additional inventory for ship-from-store, we will continue to pursue cost efficiencies through technology enhancements including the replacement of our warehouse management system.","We will drive growth in large appliances and large TVs by leveraging new regional inventory capabilities launched in October and we will invest in improving our home delivery and installation services NPS. The last initiative on our roadmap is our cost structure. So with the $55 million in additional annualized cost reductions announced today, in the past few years we have delivered over $1 billion in North American Renew Blue cost reductions.","In fiscal 2016 we're launching Phase 2 of our Renew Blue cost reduction and gross profit optimization program with a target of approximately $400 million over three years including the remaining benefit of approximately $250 million from our previously discussed returns, replacements and damages opportunity. These savings because they are structural in nature are not expected to begin until the back half of fiscal 2016 and will be driven by streamline processes and operational efficiencies that will be primarily enabled to investments in systems. We expect however that this incremental savings would be significantly offset by the investment we need to make to fund our growth initiatives; in fiscal 2016 we expect these incremental investments to total approximately $100 million to $120 million, $0.17 to $0.21 in diluted EPS and [indiscernible] main bucket. One is the customer experience online and in our retail stores, two is information technology and three is marketing. We also expect to increase fiscal 2016\u2019s capital expenditures to approximately $650 million to $700 million from $550 million in fiscal 2015. ","So the strategy we just outlined is the foundation for our fiscal 2016 operating plan. And we are confident in our ability to execute against this as we have demonstrated this past year. But we will also be facing industry and economic pressure that we discussed last quarter in our holiday sales press release that we expect to impact our business including more rapidly declining average spending prices in key product categories, weak industry demand in certain product categories, declining demands and in price pressures from our extended warranties and increasingly competitive and costly cost in the service expectations like free and faster shipping. So to win against this back drop investing now is imperative and while these investment will put pressure on our fiscal 2016 operating income rate as Sharon will discussed, we believe they\u2019ll leverage our exceptional momentum and will allow us to build a differentiated customer experience and the foundation for long term success.","I will now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our fourth quarter financials and our financial outlook for the first half of fiscal 2016.","Sharon McCollam","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning everyone. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus our expectations we shared with you in our holiday sales release. From a top line perspective enterprise comparable sales growth of 1.3% excluding the 70 basis points impact of installment billing was slightly above our near 1% expectations. Our non-GAAP operating income rate expansion of 130 basis points was also above our 75 to 90 basis points expectations due to higher than expected vendor participation in our holiday promotional activity, combined these better than expected outcome equated to an incremental $0.10 of EPS. We also saw a positive $0.03 per diluted share of a non-recurring tax benefit which partially offset the previously communicated negative $0.10 impact from the reorganization of our European legal entities. I'll now talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year enterprise revenue increased 1.3% to 14.2 billion enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.28 to $1.48 primarily driven by a more structured and analytical approach to our promotional strategy better performance of our credit card agreement, the positive flow through our gross profit enhancement initiatives, the flow through of higher year over year revenue and the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plan which resulted in lower cost due to lower claim frequency. ","This favorable impact was partially offset however by the negative $0.07 per diluted share impact in income tax expense that I just discussed. In our domestic segment revenue increased 3.2% to 12.7 billion despite a 3.2% declining in the NPD-reported Consumer Electronics categories. Our revenue growth was driven by comparable sales growth of 2% excluding the estimated 80 basis points benefit associated with installment billing and a 68 million or 55 basis points improvement in the performance of our credit card agreement versus a negative 65 million or 50 basis points impact last year. Domestic online revenue on a comparable basis increased 9.7% to 1.7 billion primarily due to substantially improved inventory availability made possible by the chain-wide rollout of ship-from-store in January 2014. Higher conversion rates and increased traffic driven by greater investment in online marketing also contributed to our year over year growth. This growth, however, was substantially offset by material industry softness in tablets, a category with high online penetration, and a channel shift in mobile revenue that resulted from customer enthusiasm for installment billing plans which could only be sold in our retail stores. ","As a percentage of total domestic revenue online revenue increased 90 basis points to $13.5% versus 12.6% last year; versus last year's online growth this year's online comparable sales growth of 9% was lower for two primary reasons, first, we saw the expected 600 basis points of pressure from lapping last year gaming console introductions and our initial 400 store ship-from-store rollout. We also saw approximately 500 basis points of unexpected additional pressure from tablets and mobile for the regions that I just discussed. As all of these pressures however, are expected to continue into Q1 and the impact of gaming and our chain-wide rollout of ship-from-store will increase from 600 basis points of pressure in Q4 to a 1000 basis points in Q1, online growth in Q1 is expected to be in the mid-single-digit range. From a merchandising perspective during the fourth quarter, comparable sales growth in Televisions, mobile phones and computing was significantly offset by the material decline in tablets.","The growth in mobile phone was primarily driven by higher year-over-year selling prices. We also saw continued comparable sales declines in services in Q4. This decline of 11.4% was primarily driven by lower mobile repair revenue due to our success in decreasing claim frequency and lower attach rates. In our international segment, revenue did decline 12.4% to 1.5 billion due to a negative foreign currency impact of 750 basis points. A comparable sales decline of 4% due to industry declines in Canada and the loss of revenue from store closures in Canada. From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in mobile phones was more than offset by declines in tablets, gaming and digital imaging.","Turning now to gross profit, the enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rates for the fourth quarter was 21.3% versus 20.2% last year, an increase of a 110 basis points. The domestic gross profit rate increased 120 basis points to 21.2% versus 20% last year. This increase was primarily due to the more structured and analytical approach to our promotional strategy. The on-going improvements in supply chain efficiencies and higher margin recovery on returned, replace and damage products, a 40 basis points positive impact related to our credit card agreement as compared to a negative 40 basis point impact in Q4 of last year and the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans which resulted in lower cost due to lower claim frequency. These increases were partially offset by structural investment and price competitiveness particularly in accessory. The international gross profit rate was flat year-over-year at 21.7%.","Now turning to SG&A, enterprise level non-GAAP SG&A was 2.2 billion or 15.5% of revenue versus 15.7% last year, an increase of 9 million in dollars but a reduction of 20 basis points in rates. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was 1.9 billion of 15.3% of revenue versus 15.5% last year, an increase of 41 million. This dollar increase was primarily driven by higher incentive compensation and Renew Blue investment in customer phasing initiatives. These increases were partially offset by the realization of Renew Blue cost reduction initiatives and tighter expense management throughout the company. The 20 basis point rate improvement was driven by year-over-year sales leverage. International non-GAAP SG&A was 262 million or 17.3% of revenue versus 17% of revenue last year, a decline in dollars of 32 million. This dollar increase was primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign currency, lower expenses due to store closures in Canada and the realization of our Renew Blue cost reductions in Canada. The 30 basis point rate increase was driven by year-over-year sales deleverage.","Also as it relates to the international segment, we completed the sale of our Five Star business in China and continue to focus on the Renew Blue transformation in Canada. I would now like to talk about fiscal \u201916, in fiscal \u201916, we expect a financial impact of the investments of economic pressures that Hubert discussed earlier to begin in Q1 and continue throughout the year. From a top-line perspective, our current expectation is consistent with the outlook we provided in our holiday sales release. While we are optimistic about the potential of new product launches, our limited visibility due to timing and quantity keep us cautious. As such, our Q1 and Q2 expectation for enterprise revenue and comparable sales growth excluding the estimated impact of installment building continues to be in the range of flat to negative low single-digit. This change in trend versus Q4 is primarily driven by ongoing material declines in the tablet category, in addition to holiday momentum around high profile gift able products not continuing post-holiday.","We will also be [anniversarying] approximately 80 basis points of enterprise growth in the first-half of last year driven by the chain wide rollout of ship-from-store. From a non-GAAP operating income rate perspective, we are also reiterating our outlook for Q1 and Q2 as down approximately 30 basis points to 50 basis points, including lapping last year\u2019s Q1 15 basis point one-time benefit associated with the new credit card agreement. This decline reflects the economic and growth pressures that we just outlined, the investments we are making to drive our fiscal 2016 growth initiatives and our anticipated SG&A inflations. Additionally, we expect the Q1 and Q2 non-GAAP continuing operations effected income tax rate to be in the range of 39% to 40%. But despite these first half pressures we are in encouraged by the execution and momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter and are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for next year. While we remain cautious on the overall industry the strength of the Best Buy brands and our track record of improving our operational performance provide us with a strong confidence in our ability to deliver against the roadmap that we outlined today.","I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.","Greg Melich","Sharon could you give us a little more detail on the guidance, the 30 bps to 50 bps of margin pressure in the first half, how that breaks down between gross margin and SG&A? And then also what's taking CapEx up this year, what that's been spent on?","Sharon McCollam","Greg we expect the decline primarily to come from the SG&A line. We're making these investments as we've discussed last quarter and we expect those to begin in the first quarter -- we've actually already begun and those will continue obviously throughout this year. We will continue to be working on the disciplined approach that we're taking to our promotional strategies and continuing to also work on our Renew Blue cost reductions as it relates to the gross profit. But predominantly our pressures in 2016 are clearly coming from the SG&A line.","As we talk about the incremental investments that we're making, baring capability, competitively we're going to be more cautious this year about talking about specifically where we're putting them but when you think about the things that you Hubert outlined in quite a bit of detail we're investing in our categories where we see big barriers to entry such as appliances and in the mobile business. We're investing in our supply chain, we're investing behind our roll out of life events and gift registry, remember those are initiatives that will have an extended tail as far as revenue goes. So we're going to invest in the marketing and the capabilities upfront and then the revenues to flow at a later date. So again you end up with early on investments.","Well also as we talked about making some major investments in systems, we talked about a new warehouse management system. Of course we have our ongoing investments in online, Hubert talk about the integration of Geek Squad into our business as well as some of the initiatives we have around our services businesses which will also require from both capital and expense investments in 2016.","So those would be major buckets under which we will be investing, I will add one more which I know you all have seen the benefit of, Hubert talked about the adding of the packed sales and the Magnolia design stores within our stores. These have been very successful for us; we expect to continue to do that. The other thing you saw last year and certainly you saw us do it and you saw the customer response to it through the comp that went along with it. With the investments that we've made in our stores either the vendor investment in the physical presence of our stores or what we have done there, we're finding that there are ways for us to significantly enhance the customer experience through investment in the transformation of the footprint within the four walls of our stores. And we expect to continue to invest in that this year as well because like -- we're really very much seeing the customer react and respond to what we have done there.","Operator","We'll go next to Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Dan Binder","My questions were around the payback on these investments, this investment spending that you're doing. Maybe if you can give us a little bit of color on how you think about that payback in the back half of this year and into next?","Sharon McCollam","Dan this is Sharon, I'll take that. The payback on these investments is going to be back loaded the initial payback on some of these investments will happen in the back half of the year. The difference between the investments we've been making the last two years of Renew Blue and the investments that we're making now. These are much more structural and they will actually come incrementally. As an example some of the work that we're doing in the supply chain, we will roll out a portion this year, a portion next year and a portion after that. Returns replacements and damages is another one. We will create the capability online this year, then there are things that we will add to the system that we\u2019ll implement going into Q4 and that will go into next year and year after. So when we looked it\u2019s at 400 million that Hubert laid out we were very deliberate in how we talked about that because those are the areas where we are going to see improvement and cost reduction and margin enhancement. But they are going to be very gradual and incremental as they flow through. So that is how we see it and obviously we're not going be guiding it by quarter by year but basically over the next three years we expect to see these both not only driving the cost line but also driving the top line. Most of our investments right now and the once that I think are going be most substantial are actually going to be investments that are to drive top line growth. And so you're going see it both on the top line and coming through the operating income rate. ","Dan Binder","And if I could just a follow on the management change or departure today. Can you just give us a little color on what you're looking for in the next executive that will head up services, maybe a profile of what you're looking for and how you think you can counter the negative trends in that business?","Hubert Joly ","This is Hubert and thank you for your comment. Of course we won't comment on the departing individual, but before I answer your asked question, let me say a couple of things about services. Number one, I'm very proud of the work that our 20,000 Geek Squad agents do every day in our stores online or when they go into clients\u2019 homes to help install or support some of the toys that we sell to our customers. Number two, I'm very proud of the progress that we've made with our net promoter score in services in some of the new offers we introduced. Now clearly we also have a lot of work to do to continue to transformation I\u2019ve laid out, a number of priorities around the transformation of our traditional services offering developing the Geek Squad experience, online and in a multi-channel fashion improving delivery installation and increasing the investments in marketing and selling our services and more boldly speaking supporting our growth in integrated fashion as we go to market with a customer experience that leverages our unique capabilities which of course includes the Geek Squad.","So just in case anyone of you would like to apply for the job let me answer your question now around the profile we're looking for somebody -- almost a CEO for that business. This is a real business within our business, somebody who combines strong operational performance as well as a strong strategic and growth oriented approach somebody who is good with cost and customers, somebody who is good with technology and online as well as high touched experiences. And somebody who is going to help us improve what we have which is a great set of asset; but take you to the next levels. So of course we are launching -- we\u2019ve launched an external search. In the meantime services will report directly to me, we will have great help from several of my collages, but the fact that services will report directly to me is of course an indication of the strategic importance we see for services today and in our future strategy.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Gutman","First on the top line I guess if my math is right that the contribution to the comp or the top line from TV is somewhere in the mid-single digits. We realize that tablets are weak but laptops are helping, but I think you also appliances that are healthy. So I'm just trying to get a little more color on bridging the gap from where that contribution is coming from TV to how we get back to flat to negative low singles. Is it more slippage in healthy categories or do you see some of the declining categories getting a little weaker?","Sharon McCollam ","We see the tablet decline was the substantial and we need to make sure that it's in perspective. In Q4 we saw the tablet category down 30% approximately the NPD reported category down 30% and at any point in time Best Buy is going have a 20% plus share of that category. So it has a significant impact on our top line, has a lesser impact on our profitability's. As you know it's not one of our most profitable categories but certainly it drives a lot of traffic to our stores.","The other contributors from Q3 or Q4 to Q1 is what we called out which was the 80 basis points of growth that was driven last year by the 1400 store roll out of ship-from-store 80 basis points is substantial. And so that is another pressure because remember last year in Q4 we only rolled out all of the stores starting in January. So we only had 400 store shipping in the first two months of the fourth quarter and then we had 1400 shipping in fourth quarter. So the year over year comp for Q1 is much, much more difficult than it was in Q4. Another area and we're not going into extensive detail on, it highly competitive, is also the discussion we had in the Q3 conference call around a more disciplined promotional strategy, Hubert cleverly defined it as following the rat into the rat hole so to speak around the Back Friday holiday sort of timeframe. But there are other times during the year when you see similar behaviors and so there is a very rationalized approach and we\u2019ll continue to execute that, I am sure that you can see it flowing through in the gross profit rate. So that\u2019s another area, but certainly less impactful than the other two that I just described.","Simeon Gutman","And then one follow-up on the capital return, and congratulations for reaching -- getting back to the buyback. We could all do the math on sort of what the dollars are going to look like, $1 billion, you said 180 million from the special div, and I think the increased dividend itself is relatively minor. You will probably walk before you run on this capital return, but I mean there is still a lot of cash on the balance sheet. It looks like you're going to generate a lot of cash next year. I mean sitting from here it looks like there is still a lot of upside to that capital return plan. I mean is that fair, Sharon? And then how soon could you unlock some of that upside? ","Sharon McCollam","Sure, Simeon we continue to believe that having an extremely strong balance sheet is important to the transformation; we also believe that maintaining on our balance sheet flexibility in order to pursue possible growth strategy is important too. However, we do also -- as I told you guys we would, we do also believe there is a point where you're carrying too much cash, thus the reason for our return on capital plan. So, we feel that this is our first step as we go into our third year of the transformation as we talked about we have some additional investments to make this year and as we get through this year and we see how we progress of course this will be a conversation we have each year.","We obviously are committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders, I think -- I hope at least that today\u2019s announcement demonstrates that and we continue to believe that our approach is prudent at this point. So more to come, coming into next year, we got a year to deliver, let's just keep in mind we got a whole year to deliver here, but obviously today\u2019s announcement shows our first step.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Baker","So a couple of questions. One, can you talk about your store footprint? Do you have any store closures expected of the big boxes? And maybe looking at some of the stores you have closed over the last couple of years, anything you can talk about in terms of transfer rates or EBIT benefit from closing a store? Thanks.","Hubert Joly","Consistently in the last few years we\u2019ve said that we would gradually and continuously optimize our store footprint and every quarter you can see the numbers both in our mobile stores and in our big box stores, these are minor numbers at this point in time, we\u2019ve been very clear that we would not make big announcement because our priority has been in fact -- the biggest leverage for us has been to improve the performance of our stores through investments in the customer experience, the multi-channel approach and so forth. So it's been a good approach. In terms of retention, one of the things we\u2019re very excited about is our investments in our Athena customer database and our more personalized communications as we develop these -- continue to develop these capabilities, we\u2019ve made progress last year, we\u2019ve made more progress this year. This will be very important strategic weapon for us as we move forward, as we can talk to the individual customer. Closing stores when you don\u2019t have this capability is a waste of a lot of resource. So, I think we\u2019re seeing the continuation of what we\u2019ve been saying and what we\u2019ve been doing.","Mike Baker","Okay, thanks, helpful. If I could ask one more just to Sharon or maybe both of you, I think your operating profit dollars on a non-GAAP basis enterprise-wide for the full year, I think I calculated up 29%, it's a big number. Is that what you expected heading into the year? And I guess the question is what came in better than expected? Is it really all three of the big line items of sales, gross profit and SG&A or was it one more than another that really beat your plan? Thanks.","Sharon McCollam","Yes, so versus our original expectations for this year if you just go back to the beginning of the year as we\u2019ve been giving you an outlook each quarter. The place where the year really exceeded our expectation was on the gross profit line. In the first-half of the year, we had the tremendous SG&A savings, but then in the back half we made some investments. So while the SG&A was certainly a highlight and year-over-year certainly a huge driver of our year-over-year improvement, the place where we really made more progress than we expected was in our gross profit. Two drivers of that, one is the investments that we\u2019ve made, one came from some of the SG&A we invested of course which was in this pricing and promotional capability and some of the decisions that we made around that.","The other thing in Q4 that we would attribute our success to was a highly disciplined marketing plan to back up the merchandising, clearly if the merchandise assortment was very strong in Q4 and then that was of course supported by the marketing which was extremely targeted, focused and affected. We told you guys, that the year prior that this was an area we had to work on, there was great emphasis put in that area. But in the end the other place where we saw an exceptional outcome was merchandising, inventory, there was a lot of drama in Q4, [put aside] various things. One of the core competencies at Best Buy is inventory management. And obviously our positioning from a merchandising point of view with the vendors also contributed, there were some great products and Best Buy had the great products.","So it was a combination of a lot of things but when you look at the P&L and you want to put it down on a piece of paper, it was really the top line and the gross profit improvements that we've been able to drive.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from David Magee with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","David Magee","My first question has to do with just the commentary around making services more attractive to consumers, and I think probably that plays into a better warranty attachment rate in the future for the company. Could you just give a little more color about how that -- how you sort of see that playing out?","Hubert Joly","Services has really to say two major components. One is the extended warranties which is more an insurance business or an assurance business and two, services that help customers take advantage of -- implements these toys that we sell them. We see enormous opportunities there. When you step back, the technology that's available today is more complex mixture than it's ever been and there is a growing gap between what these technologies, these products can do and the understanding of customers about the possibilities also it's increasingly connected, think about it 15 years ago and that's a long time ago. In our homes we had a personal computer, maybe connected to a printer and a fax line with dial up service and then we had a CRT TV, some audio equipment.","Now everything is connected, we have multiple networks in your house and its complex and it's complex to implement, it's complex to support, its complex to take advantage of. So we see enormous opportunities to help customers in this area as part of our strategy to grow in the various categories we've talked about and we're uniquely positioned there. Because there is only so much you can -- I mean there is a lot we can do remotely and today we can troubleshoot your computer remotely using online tools. But there is a limit to this. And we have this gift which is we have 20,000 people, Geek Squad agents of the company and including those who get into people's homes and to support and set up a network and everything that goes around this, that's a very unique capability.","So I think that's going to be a core theme, so there is going to be work on making sure that the extended warranty and products specific services are highly competitive and are effectively marketed and promoted and sold. And then there is building, you can say this professional services offering instead of capabilities to help our customers.","David Magee","And as a quick follow up, the company's ability to sell return merchandise online after the holiday. Does that help narrow the profitability gap between online and retail? Is that meaningful?","Hubert Joly","Why it\u2019s an ingesting shift, right, because when these return products or this could be also end-of-life products, the margin on these products is actually lower by definition. And so if you sell them online as oppose to in the stores, it has an impact on the margin of the online activities which by the way means that in many ways the online channel and the store channel both from a revenue and a profit standpoint, increasingly become blurred. And so our focused first and foremost on improving as a whole, we pay attention to each of these channels but they are increasingly blurred from a customer experience and then at P&L standpoint.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.","Joe Feldman","Why don't you just give a little more color around the returns and damages and that opportunity there and the impact maybe that you have in the quarter, are you seeing an uptick in that? And I know it's been a focus but feels like there are defiantly ways that you can emphasize and improve that.","Sharon McCollam","Yes, if you take a look at the -- go back to the transcript and what we said. We did see benefit this year virtually in every quarter and in Q4 was our biggest quarter obviously, where we saw incremental return from that initiative at this point we said and within that 400 million over the next three years there is about 250 left out of returns, replacements and damages. So that\u2019s kind of an indication because that was potential impact of about $350 million.","We have made substantial progress in this area and we\u2019ve made about as much progress as we can make without measure structural changes to our system and our capabilities of being able to show that product in the online channel. So that\u2019s the structural investments that we're making this year in order to take that initiative to the next level. So you are seeing -- your recollection of things we\u2019ve said is absolutely correct and we expect to see more going into 2016. As you know we did bring up that product on the website it's harder to find then we would like it to be. Because of the way our impact and inventory systems comes together. So we're having to make do a lot of work there in order to make it easily searchable on this site and we believe that will be the next evolution of our benefits that we'll see from that initiatives.","Joe Feldman","And if could follow up with a -- you guys mention that from this more scientific promotional approach this holiday season, just was hoping to get a little more color on that. I recall last year you guys kind of went deeper then you had wanted to on promotions. But anything like were you leveraging the system? How was the approach different from year over year?","Hubert Joly","Yes Joe would say a couple of things, pricing and promotion of course is a science where tools and science and experience are really important. And last year we invested in teams and tools and capabilities that allowed us to have better information also I think that our team probably would use more wisdom as well -- it's a combination right to illustrate the point. In some cases you may have a particular competitor that has a certain product with limited quantities and a price set up to or promotion set up to drive traffic to their outlet.","In some cases it may make sense for us to match, in other case it may not make sense to match when we have much bigger quantities and they have very limited capabilities. So I would say the way we manage competitive reaction this year with the help of this additional science which is very helpful. So was very proud of our team there and its combined with a very strong assortment and marketing also give us more confidence to execute. Retail is really about execution and giving the ability of our teams to execute in an orderly fashion where I think a very important point of our holiday. So I hope these comments are helpful.","Joe Feldman","That was very helpful. Thank you guys and good luck with this quarter.","Hubert Joly","Thank you so much and in closing, earlier on the call I thanked our teams at Best Buy for delivering these great results and in closing I'd like to of course thank our shareholders for your support and the confidence you are placing in us. I hope that this morning we did good job of conveying our excitement about our Q4 results and about our opportunities and we look forward to continuing the dialogue and again thank you so very much for your confidence and your support. Have a great day. Thank you. ","Operator","That concludes today's conference call.

And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to begin today with an overview of our third quarter results, as well as an update on our Renew Blue priorities. Then I will turn the call over to Sharon to provide further details. And finally, she and I will share a few thoughts about holiday.","Our third quarter top line results make it clear that our focus on delivering our unique customer promises is starting to pay off. It is also clear that our efforts to control cost and to bring greater efficiency to our operations by improving our profitability. And while we remain mindful of the fact that we still have a long way to go, we are pleased with the progress of our Renew Blue transformation efforts.","Specifically, during the quarter, we delivered a Domestic comparable store sale increase of 1.7%, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of a better-than-expected $0.18. In addition, we continue to make substantial progress on our key Renew Blue priorities. This progress included, most notably, number one, driving the 15.1% increase in Domestic comparable online sales; number two, continuing to enhance our multi-channel customer experience with a nearly 400 basis point increase in our Net Promoter Score; three, completing this year's retail floor space optimization, including the deployment of vendor experiences; and four, eliminating an additional $115 million in annualized cost, bringing our total annualized cost reductions to $505 million toward our eventual target of $725 million.","Let me now provide more details on our key Renew Blue priorities. So first, to accelerate online growth, we're continuing to focus on those initiatives that are designed to drive increased traffic and improve customer experience and higher conversion. In Q3, these initiatives included the continued optimization of site navigation through an improved taxonomy, which is driving improved natural search results and making it easier for customers to find the products they're looking for.","Second, the narrowing of search results and browse pages with drop-down menus. Three is the implementation of a single-site sign-on capability, allowing loyalty program customers to see their My Best Buy points, reward certificates and other information directly on bestbuy.com instead of going to a separate website. Fourth, the enhancement of our buy online, pick up in-store experience by creating an easier process for customers to add service plans to their final purchase upon arrival in the store. And then five, a significant increase in the number of product reviews. In fact, we have already exceeded this year's goal of quadrupling the number of product reviews.","As we enter the holiday season, the superior multi-channel customer experience is what we're focused on. As such, our fourth quarter online initiatives include, number one, the introduction of new product buying guides; two, the expansion of product information across categories; three, the addition of new marketplace partners to increase our online-only product assortments; and four, the leveraging of over 400 ship-from-store stores and 2 new online shipping locations within our existing DCs.","Based on the early results from our ship-from-store pilots, we continue to believe that we will see the long-term benefits that we have previously shared, including improving our online conversion, more profitably selling returned and clearance inventory that is trapped in our stores, reducing markdown risk on product transitions and improving inventory management by increasing visibility to true multi-channel customer demands.","Our second Renew Blue priority for this year is to escalate the multi-channel customer experience. Now we use NPS or Net Promoter Score to measure not only the satisfaction of customers that buy but also the customers who don't. In the third quarter, our Net Promoter Score improved by nearly 400 basis points year-over-year. And while we know there's still much to do to provide a consistently great experience to our customers, we're seeing improvements in all of our customer-facing functions, including stores, online, services and customer care. And we're particularly pleased to see the improvements, the strong improvements, being driven by the service provided by our Blue Shirts and Geek Squad agents.","In addition, during the third quarter, we took another step to improve the customer experience by reinventing our Reward Zone loyalty program and replacing it with an enhanced program that we've branded My Best Buy. This program has been designed to deepen our relationship with our customers by going beyond points and developing personalized shopping experiences, exclusive services and financial rewards that are not available from other retailers.","The third Renew Blue priority is to increase revenue and gross profit per square foot to enhance floor space optimization and merchandising. During the third quarter, we continued our floor space optimization efforts, which included, number one, increasing space for growing and profitable categories like mobile phones, tablets and large and small appliances; number two, creating space to more effectively showcase fill-ins and open-box inventory; three, completing the rollout of 500 Windows Stores; four, redesigning space to support new gaming product launches; and five, adding expanded global displays in 750 large-format stores. These initiatives, of course, are in addition to running out the Samsung Experience Shops earlier this year. The customer feedback on all of our stores-within-a-store continues to be very positive.","The fourth Renew Blue priority for this year is to drive down cost of goods sold through supply chain efficiencies and reverse logistics. In the third quarter, we completed the online expansion of our final 2 of 8 distribution centers to improve the time and cost of online delivery. We expanded the existing online fulfillment capabilities in one additional distribution center, and we continue to reduce cost through competitive bidding and rate negotiations. We also implemented new retail store replenishment processes, which will allow us to shorten our inventory replenishment windows during this year's holiday season.","Reverse logistics was also a primary focus during the quarter. As we've discussed, customer returns, replacements and damages represent approximately 10% of our revenue and over $400 million a year in losses. In the third quarter, we took our first step to reduce these losses by creating space in our stores to more effectively showcase clearance and open-box inventory. In the first quarter, we plan to begin adding initial quantities of returns and open-box inventory to our online assortment. Today, only immaterial amounts of this inventory are available online, and adding it will be a gradual and incremental process due to system complexities and the time required to build our capability to assess the condition of the inventory prior to displaying it. By the end of next year, we expect to have made significant progress in creating greater consumer visibility to dispose of inventory.","So through these and other supply chain services and loyalty program-related cost initiatives this quarter, we have eliminated $100 million in cost of goods sold, bringing our total annualized cost reductions to $165 million towards our eventual target of $325 million.","Our fifth Renew Blue priority is to continue to gradually optimize our U.S. retail -- real estate portfolio. Occupancy cost reduction and retail capital allocation remain a key focus. As such, during the quarter, we continued to renegotiate our rent reductions on expiring leases and we closed 2 mobile and 4 Pacific Sales stand-alone stores. In our large-format U.S. stores, we did not close any stores this quarter, but we'll be closing 1 additional store at the end of the year. As you can see from our year-to-date results, our retail performance is improving and the financial economics of closing stores is becoming less compelling. Additionally, with the rollout of ship-from-store, we are now looking at our stores strategically in relation to our longer-term supply chain strategy as we strive to deliver inventory to our customers when and where they want to receive it.","Within our large-format U.S. stores, we're continuing with our rollout of 5 Magnolia Design Centers and 12 Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-the-stores this fiscal year. These concepts are providing a higher-end and higher-touch customer experience and are testing well in the pilot stores.","Our sixth Renew Blue priority is to further reduce SG&A cost. As we laid out at our Investor Meeting last November, we believe there is an opportunity to remove $400 million in SG&A from our North American business, and we're making substantial progress. Since our last earnings release, we've eliminated an additional $50 million in annualized SG&A cost, and this brings our annualized cost reduction to a total of $340 million towards our eventual target of $400 million.","Now beyond the U.S., we're also rolling out our Renew Blue priorities in our International business. While we are continuing to address ongoing top line challenges, we are pleased with the International cost reductions we have made to date.","I will now turn the call over to Sharon to cover more details on our third quarter financial performance.","Sharon L. McCollam","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Like Hubert, I'd like to reiterate how pleased we were with the strong operational execution that we saw in the third quarter. This is a capability that is fundamental to our transformation, and the progressively better outcomes that we are seeing each quarter are not only contributing to higher NPS scores but also to better-than-expected financial results.","The highlights of these results in the third quarter were as follows. Enterprise revenue declined 0.2% to $9.4 billion, primarily due to prior quarter store closings and continued softness in International. Non-GAAP diluted EPS, however, increased $0.14 to $0.18 versus $0.04 last year. This increase was primarily driven by Renew Blue cost savings, a short-term benefit from the transition of the new credit card agreement and strong expense management, partially offset by higher year-over-year investments in price competitiveness.","Domestic revenue increased 2.3% to $7.8 billion. This increase was primarily driven by comparable store sales growth of 1.7%. And if you exclude the impact of short-term disruptions during the quarter due to the floor space optimization and Windows Stores rollout, comparable store sales growth would have been approximately 2%. From a merchandising perspective, growth in mobile phones, appliances and notebooks was partially offset by expected declines in gaming, movies and digital imaging.","The online channel also delivered strong growth during the quarter as comparable sales increased over 15%. This increase was driven by the online initiatives that Hubert shared with you earlier, in addition to increased online marketing and a significantly higher number of online orders being placed in our retail stores. In addition, increased traffic, higher average order value and improved inventory availability contributed to these stronger-than-expected results. And if you include this quarter's online demand for new gaming console preorders, which were not shipped and will not be recognized as revenue until the fourth quarter, comparable online demand would have increased approximately 20%.","In International, we had a challenging quarter as revenue declined 11.3% to $1.5 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by a comparable store sales decline of 6.4%, of which almost 1\/3 was driven by mobile phone inventory constraints in Canada. Additionally, lost revenues from 35 previously closed stores, including 15 in Canada and 20 in China, and the negative impact of foreign currency impacted the comp. The balance of the comparable store sales decline was driven by lower industry demand for consumer electronics in Canada and the May 2013 expiration of government subsidies in China.","Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise gross profit rate for the third quarter was 23.2% versus 23.8% last year, a decline of 60 basis points. The Domestic gross profit rate was 23.6% versus 24.2% last year, also a decline of 60 basis points. This decline was primarily driven by increased product warranty costs in the mobile phone category, a lower mix of mobile phone service plans and a greater investment in price competitiveness. These impacts were partially offset, however, by a short-term transition benefit from the new credit card agreement with Citibank. In future quarters, as we discussed in Q2, the new agreement with Citibank will negatively impact the company's gross profit rate, as the economics are significantly less favorable than the expired agreement long term.","International gross profit rate was 21.2% versus 21.8% last year, again a decline of 60 basis points. This decline was primarily driven by increased promotional activity in Canada and an unfavorable product mix in Canada.","Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $2 billion or 21.8% of revenue versus 23.4% last year, a decline of over $150 million or 160 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.7 billion or 21.7% of revenue versus 23.5% of revenue last year, a decline of nearly $100 million or 180 basis points. This decline was primarily driven by the realization of our Renew Blue cost-reduction initiatives, tighter expense management throughout the company, lower store-labor-related expenses and executive transition costs last year that did not recur this year. These impacts were partially offset by Renew Blue investments in mobile advertising and the re-platforming of bestbuy.com.","International non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $333 million or 22% of revenues versus 22.7% of revenue last year, a decline of over $50 million or 70 basis points. This decline was primarily driven by Renew Blue cost reductions and tighter expense management in Canada and, to a lesser extent, the elimination of expenses associated with previously closed stores.","From a working capital perspective, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet during the quarter. Cash and cash equivalents increased $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion. This increase was primarily driven by the sale of Best Buy Europe and proactive working capital management. Receivables increased $98 million or 9.6% to $1.1 billion primarily due to the agreed-upon timing of payments related to the LCD litigation settlement that we discussed in Q2.","Merchandise inventories decreased $678 million or 8.9% to $7 billion primarily due to aggressive inventory management, including an ongoing reduction in our clearance and at-risk inventory. Accounts payable decreased $482 million or 6.8% to $6.6 billion primarily due to lower inventory and the timing of inventory purchases for the holiday season.","And now as we look forward to the fourth quarter, I would like to turn the call back over to Hubert to talk about our holiday strategy.","Hubert Joly","So thank you, Sharon.","Looking ahead to the holiday season and beyond, our strategy is to continue to drive our Renew Blue transformation. Our mission is to be the destination and authority for technology products and services. We are here to help our customers discover, choose, purchase, finance, activate, enjoy and eventually replace their technology products and solutions. We also help our vendor partners market their products by providing them the best showroom for technology products, both online and in our stores.","Now specifically for holiday, we have worked to enhance and deliver on our unique customer promises. First, we are offering highly competitive prices and compelling promotions, as we believe that price competitiveness is table stakes. Our price competitiveness is augmented by a number of things. One is up to 6% in rewards value with the use of My Best Buy credit card. Second, valuable trading promotions. Next is our Low Price Guarantee. And four is free shipping for online orders over $25.","We're also delivering a curated assortment of exciting new products, including 2 new gaming platforms, new mobile phones, new tablets. In fact, on new tablets, Best Buy is the only national retailer where you can touch, try and buy the top 5 brands of tablets. So new tablets, and then a number of branded exclusives only at Best Buy products and services for the holiday season.","Beyond assortment, we will be providing significantly enhanced manageable and impartial advice to our customers, including through the online channel with an improved taxonomy, a new search engine, new buying guides and expanded product informations, as I discussed earlier. In our stores, we've continued to invest in training and coaching and have begun the process of equipping our Blue Shirts with new tablet-based tools that allow them to access online resources to aid customers wherever they may be on the retail sales floor. And of course, through our strategic vendor partnerships, we are providing a renewed shopping experience with the presence of Apple, Samsung and Windows experts in our stores.","In addition, we've enhanced the multi-channel convenience of shopping at Best Buy by offering our customers the ability to shop when and where they want, including shopping online with either in-home delivery or in-store pickup options, offering expanded Black Friday hours opening at 6 p.m. Thanksgiving evening and remaining open until 10 p.m. on Black Friday, increasing the number of Black Friday doorbuster deal events and hosting a number of exclusive-access events for My Best Buy members.","In addition to offering customers the ability to shop when and where they want, we've also taken great steps to ensure maximum product availability for our customers through the leveraging of our ship-from-store capabilities and new online shipping locations.","Finally, our fifth promise is our ability to offer support for the life of the product, including in-store product setup, holiday hotline, delivery installation, technical advice and services provided by Geek Squad.","Altogether, I am excited about the focus and even the obsession our management team has on delighting our customers and on winning. This bodes well for the future steps in our journey to make Best Buy a company with which customers develop a deep and rich relationship.","Now I will now turn the call over back to Sharon to cover our outlook for the fourth quarter.","Sharon L. McCollam","Thank you. As Hubert said, we are encouraged by the progress we have made against our Renew Blue priorities and are optimistic about the strength of our holiday-specific merchandising, marketing and customer experience initiatives. We are also optimistic about the traffic generation and holiday electronics focus that the new big gaming launches will bring to our stores and our websites, albeit at low margins.","But as we enter the fourth quarter, we're also highly aware of the public statements that are being made by our competitors as it relates to their promotional plans for Black Friday and the fourth quarter. We know that we will be facing an increasingly promotional environment. As such, we want to give you color on our response to this competitive situation, and our perspectives on how these pressures could financially impact the fourth quarter.","First and foremost, we are committed to being competitive on price. As Hubert mentioned, it's table stakes in our transformation. So if our competition is, in fact, more promotional in the fourth quarter, we will be too, and that will have a negative impact on our gross margin. We are also committed to serving our customers when and where they want to be served. And in light of our competitors' decisions to open early for Black Friday, we too are opening our stores early. This requires increased promotional offers and an incremental investment in store payroll. But again, it's table stakes.","In addition, you will recall from last quarter's earnings release that we had already identified other P&L drivers that we expected to negatively impact our fourth quarter operating income rate, which we quantified at a negative 40 to 70 basis point impact to last year's fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income rate of 5.7%. This 40 to 70 basis point impact reflects the negative impact of ongoing pricing investments, the negative impact of our $150 million to $200 million in fiscal '14 incremental Renew Blue SG&A investments, the temporary negative impact of our mobile warranty cost and the negative impact of the economics of our new credit card agreement, all substantially offset by the positive impact of the $505 million in annualized Renew Blue cost savings. But now as a result of the additional holiday pressures we just discussed, we believe it's prudent to narrow this range to 60 to 70 basis points for the fourth quarter, made up of an estimated 80 to 90 basis point negative impact on gross margins and an estimated positive 10 to 20 basis point impact on SG&A.","But this 60 to 70 basis point impact only pertains to these specific fourth quarter P&L drivers and it's not intended to be interpreted as financial guidance on our overall perspective on the fourth quarter results. The reason we say this is that, over the last several quarters, above and beyond our Renew Blue cost savings, our core business performance has stabilized and our product mix and non-Renew Blue cost-containment initiatives have been stronger than expected. So assuming this level of performance continues, we do expect to be able to offset some or all of this impact.","As it relates to these P&L drivers for fiscal '15, the projections we laid out in last quarter's earnings release have not changed and are reiterated as follows: negative 60 to 90 basis points in Q1 fiscal '15, negative 70 to 100 basis points in Q2 of fiscal '15 and a negative 30 to 60 basis points in Q3 of fiscal '15.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I do want to get a little more into the Renew Blue strategy. We want to lob [ph] through how the costs are coming out. You can certainly see that in the leverage. Can you get more specific on how the top line improvement is coming around, particularly traffic sequentially, whether it's the store-within-a-store programs, the new TV merchandising. You mentioned mobile hurting from a margin perspective, but did that help from a top line perspective? Any detail on that would be great.","Hubert Joly","Greg, thank you for your question. I think you're asking for the driver of the growth in our comps in the U.S. It's really a combination of things. One is there's category growth. We've highlighted that's mobile, tablet. Appliances, I think you've seen, very significant, I think it's 25% year-over-year growth in appliances. So there's a good a pull from these categories, which is of course further helped by the floor space optimization initiatives, as well as the deployment of the vendor experiences. So we are very pleased that this is producing results. The other drivers of the total comp are, of course, online, the 15% is helpful. And in the stores, we're seeing better execution, frankly. The customer's feedback is very positive as it relates to the Blue Shirts. So we've seen movements, positive movements, in the close rates. The total traffic is up. Increasingly, I think the traffic is going to be difficult to interpret from the standpoint that the shopping experience really changes. People are starting their shopping experience online, which highlights the importance of our online strategy, and the number of visits to the stores naturally go down. And but I don't think it's really matters at the end. Our overall focus is on the overall top line and comps.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And if I could follow up on that, Hubert. The -- and so traffic, it's changing as the conversion rate goes up. If we measured it in terms of transactions, because maybe people are will be more likely to close but there's fewer people coming. Was that positive in the quarter, or was that still a challenge?","Hubert Joly","I think that we are seeing there's multiple drivers here. One element where we're seeing some positive trends is the average order value, in particular online as well as in the stores. For example, we've highlighted the ability to get Geek Squad protection on at the time of in-store pickup. We think that's a very positive element. Again, another driver of traffic, Greg, is, as you know, we are reducing the focus on the high-velocity music physical media products, and that's impacting traffic. As we move to, let's say, appliances, I think you and I would agree that the frequency by which we replace an oven, washing machine and so forth is less than a music CD. So we're sending -- we're seeing structural changes in -- that can impact the traffic in the short term. And the reason why I'm highlighting that is that I don't think it's a big issue. What matters from an economic standpoint, again, is the dollar value of the top line. So how it's constructed is changing, and as we move forward, we'll continue to deepen our understanding of that, but I'm not obsessing about these traffic drivers because they are all of these changes. And again in total, when you include online, traffic is significantly up. So the attraction of Best Buy vis-a-vis the customers is moving forward in the right direction. So I hope that helps in the understanding.","Sharon L. McCollam","And Greg, I might add one thing to all the information that Hubert provided as well. We are also on the online side. This quarter, we launched our new My Best Buy. And we are working, actually, very hard to use the website as a source of relationship building and information for our customers. And we are going to great ends to make that happen because we believe that customers coming to the site over and over gets them used to coming to our site. It brings it -- it makes it more of a destination. So Scott is working and the teams are working very hard to get that traffic to the site so that we can continue to interact with our customers. So you're going to see a big push here and continuing over the next several quarters as we make all these new changes to our website. We want to bring customers there. So of course, when you bring traffic that you're not intending per se to convert, you're going to affect that conversion rate in the online side.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","My question was regarding price competition. I'm just curious, as you have made price investments over the course of the first 3 quarters, if you're seeing anything in terms of competitive response and also the level at which customers are asking for a price match request against competitors.","Hubert Joly","Thank you, Dan. So clearly, we've established our strategy for pricing. Our strategy is to be price competitive, and we are continuing to invest -- will continue to invest in Q4 and in the first few quarters of fiscal '15 as we continue to optimize all of this. The primary driver we're using is the actual price that we set. The Low Price Guarantee, which is our price matching policy, which includes online, is a nice tool for the Blue Shirts to close the sale. From a frequency and cost standpoint, it's a relatively minor driver, but it's an effective tool to give the comfort to the customers that they're getting the right price. Competitive responses, it's hard for me to speak on behalf of our competitors. I don't want to say this, but I think both Sharon and I have said it: We're in this to win and we're in this to play to win, as opposed to not lose. So you're seeing a Best Buy that is back, and we're in there fighting. And there are some statements that have been made in the last several days by a number of competitors, and we're continuously monitoring the situation. And we're going to -- like we did last year, we're going to drive the outcome. We will not be shy about investing in winning the holiday season. I think the question about the reaction from the competitors, I think it'd be fair to -- for you to ask them. I don't want to comment on them, but hopefully, I'm giving you a sense of the spirit that is here at Best Buy.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of David Strasser with Janney Capital Markets.","David S. Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Can I talk to TV? I don't know if you gave what TV is specifically. Did you, were you able to comp positive for the quarter in the television category?","Hubert Joly","So David, thank you for your question. In TV, from a dollar standpoint, we were flat and which I think is a nice trend compared to the past. And TV remains a very important category for us. In terms of product innovation, I think the movement towards ultrahigh definition or 4K TV is going to be an interesting development for next year, less so probably for this year in terms of quantities and overall impact. But I think we love the fact that there is innovation, meaningful innovation for the customer. And then when prices are starting to go down for these new products, I think this has the potential to continue to drive life into this category.","David S. Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","When you look at sort of when -- VIZIO came in, I think, after the holiday last year. So you're having that this year on versus not having it last year. How much can that -- has that helped you from a market share standpoint, from a comp standpoint, adding sort of that price point into your mix?","Hubert Joly","I think that having the right assortment is a very important part of our strategy. Across the various categories, we have this amazing assortment. Video has been a very nice addition, from a competitive standpoint and from a value standpoint for customers. So I think that you're highlighting something that's meaningful.","David S. Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And just a last comment. So I guess one of the things that seemed to really step up this holiday season was the 1-hour guarantee from Walmart. To me, that's -- I haven't seen anything sort of that dramatic in a very long time sort of around the Black Friday weekend. And then they actually came out today also, and I'm just curious if this was included in your comments this morning, also about sort of trying to match Black Friday prices a week ahead of time. You've made obviously a very strong statement today about what the promotional environment is like. Do you think you're cautious enough, even as dramatic as it has been out there?","Hubert Joly","So obviously, David, we're watching the developments on a day-by-day basis. And I cannot comment on what I don't know because there may be new things happening in the next several weeks. I want to highlight that our promotional plans for Black Friday and power week, promotionally speaking, is very strong. The number of doorbuster deals, the quantities that we have available are very meaningful. So I don't want to comment specifically about Walmart's announcements from this morning. This is part of the day-to-day business. But this morning, certainly, Sharon and I wanted to give you, again, a flavor of our mindset. And we think it -- we need to be in the game. So that's what we're going to do. I would highlight that the plans we've prepared even before the Walmart announcement were very significant. Again, they were designed to win. So I think that's as much as we can say at this point.","David S. Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I figured as much. I just was figuring I just would ask because I was -- I've just been watching this and somewhat awe what they're saying.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","My question, I wanted to focus on sales. And you put up the Domestic comp of 1.7%, or 2% if you didn't have some of the disruption. Maybe a difficult question to answer, but if you look at that, the sales growth we saw here in the third quarter versus other quarters, how much do you think that improvement reflected internal initiatives as opposed to just a strength in the underlying environment for the consumer electronics space?","Hubert Joly","So your question is, how much of the 2% or 1.7% is driven by what we've done versus the environment.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Yes. Is there a way to parse that out?","Hubert Joly","Yes, I'm not sure I have a finite breakdown of this. I can share the spirit in which we're fighting this war. If you remember, a year or 2 ago, the message from this company was all about the headwinds and to explain the results. We never talk about the headwinds. We've said, starting in November of last year, that's this was the overall environment was a positive one. There's a lot of product innovation. In fact, for this holiday season, there's probably more product innovation that we've seen in a long time. And we're focused on the levers that we can control. Our market -- our overall market share, even though we are by far the leader in the space, is only in the mid teens. So we don't think it's illegal, immoral, unethical to grow market share. And so that's the focus. We are pleased with the environment. We know that there is uncertainty how the consumer feels with everything that's going on in the country and in the world, but we don't really focus that much on every -- our emphasis is on what we can control because, again, we're only 15% of the market. So what we do has more impact, we think, than the overall environment. That's our -- that's the mindset. I wish I could give you the detailed answer. It's hard because there's so many moving pieces. But that's the mindset.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","No, that's helpful. If I could just follow up, and I know it's very early in this next video gaming product cycle. We did have PlayStation 4 launch last week, and then Xbox -- the Xbox One will be launching shortly. Can you just describe? Again, I know it's early, but can you describe maybe the behavior of the customers coming in to buy those machines? Are you seeing additional purchases as they buy the machines? Or is it a one-off type event?","Hubert Joly","Well, this is a very exciting development. And of course, with my video games background from 10 or 15 years ago, I'm personally excited about it. I was, of course, in the stores Thursday night for the PS4 launch, and I'll do the same with the Xbox One launch. There is so much excitement on the part of these gamers. And so we think it's a very positive development, from a consumer standpoint. Gaming is still very much alive. The quantities, Sony has reported, right, to 1 million units shipped and which is much faster than the PS3. So that's very encouraging. We -- Best Buy tends to do well in hardware even though, as Sharon has highlighted, the margins are not as exciting as the volumes, but that is very good. And we'll get more inventory next week. We'll try -- we have the plan to keep some of that inventory for our best customers. We want to -- we'll have some of that going on. So very exciting developments from a top line perspective. And more broadly speaking, again, if you look across all of the categories, this is a holiday season where there is, really, life from an innovation standpoint. So all of the discussions about product cycles and so forth that I was hearing last year, I think that's there's a lot of great stuff developed by our vendor partners. And I think consumer electronics toys, if I can put it this way, are going to be exciting for shoppers this holiday season. And because of our strengths in that space and the improved customer experience, we think we're a very attractive place where to shop.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of David Schick with Stifel.","David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","In walking your stores of late, there's a lot of things going on. There was a Google representative talking about the Nexus products, Chromebooks, with a Google shirt. I believe, third party, however, but there to talk and explain things. And I -- and at least in the market where we were, this was a someone with a finite period of time that we're going to be doing this for the holidays. So how should we think about other stores-within-the-store -- and there was a buildout there, other stores-within-the-stores, other vendors coming to you to forge these partnerships, as we go into next year?","Hubert Joly","So thank you, David. Clearly, these vendor partnerships have been a major development for us this year. We had had Apple stores for a while in our stores, and we've added Samsung and Windows in a very meaningful way this year. Thank you for highlighting Google. For those of you, I hope there's very few, who've not seen our stores recently, there's 2, there's a meaningful table and a meaningful end cap. I think it's in 750 of our stores, with some staffing on the part of Google. Google's hardware business is obviously expanding and there is a lot of interesting product innovation. The Chromebook, Chromecast, Nexus tablet is very interesting. The customer feedback from all of these vendor experiences, as I said, is very positive. And strategically, I think what we've all seen is how meaningful Best Buy is as a platform for these vendor partners because we're the only place of scale where they can showcase the fruit of their billions of dollars of technology investment. And the ability of the customers to touch and feel these products across these ecosystems, if I can use this word, is very meaningful. So a lot of positive development. Excitement on the part of the vendors, look -- I think your question is, looking ahead, what's coming. The -- we don't have the vision of transforming the entire store in a collection of boutiques from these vendors. We have -- we use 3 criteria to decide whether we do additional stores-in-the-stores. Is it good for the customer? And by that, I mean, does it make sense to shop a vendor experience, as opposed to shop a category? Is it good for the vendor? And is it good for Best Buy? You can -- you probably have in mind a number of names that could make sense. If you have them in mind, probably assume that, there's discussions with all of them, but that doesn't mean they're going to bear fruit, right, because it needs to make sense, again, for the customer, the vendor and ourselves. But I think the basic idea is there, which is that, strategically, it's been very helpful from a customer standpoint, a vendor standpoint and, of course, for Best Buy. But more to come on that.","David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And just a quick follow-up with a cash balance. Any comment on the potential for share repurchase?","Sharon L. McCollam","I'd just reiterate what we said. We're going to get through at holiday season. We believe that going into this season with the strength of the balance sheet that we currently have is a huge competitive advantage for us and certainly something that we feel our vendors deserve. So when we get past this year, we'll start talking about what our plans are going into next year. But at this point, our perspective on continuing to keep a much stronger cash balance on the balance sheet versus the past continues intact.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Scot Ciccarelli. I actually had a follow-up regarding the vendor stores. Can you guys provide any details or color kind of around the economics, how we -- how should we think about the vendor stores in terms of how they're performing or expected to perform? And then just a housekeeping item: What was the impact of the credit card on the gross margin in the quarter, Sharon?","Hubert Joly","So let me start with the vendor stores, and then Sharon will take credit card. Scot, so each vendor store, of course, is going to be different. But generally speaking, Best Buy is not -- Best Buy's main activity is not philanthropy, so we are doing this because it makes sense from a financial standpoint. Generally speaking, there is more help provided from the vendor, as related to the cost of operating the stores-within-the-stores in terms of the either it could be the labor, the fixtures, the space, all of these things. There is a financial contribution, retail contributions. There is improved margins. It can be improved margins on the products. And then of course, importantly as well as sometimes or typically marketing support because these vendors can see their stores within Best Buy as their store, which it is, and therefore, directing traffic to Best Buy makes sense. I think you've seen some examples of that during the year. And of course, for us, as we think about the optimization of our economics in the floor space, we move the allocation of the floor space to growing profitable categories. And so mechanically, when you replace, let's say, physical music or reduce physical music and you have more phones and tablets, as examples, mechanically from a mix standpoint, you also have helped. So these are some of the drivers as we see that. The final one that I would add is that because we do this with the top vendors, of course, traffic, this is attractive for the customers, and that's the feedback we're getting. And again, what's unique about Best Buy and that makes it unique both for the customers and the vendor is the ability to touch and experience all of these ecosystems, right? So in the same store, you're going to be able to touch and feel an Apple product, a Samsung product, a Windows product. So that's also very meaningful, and it's helpful to our journey.","Sharon L. McCollam","Again, on the question regarding the quantification of the credit card, we haven't quantified it. Obviously, we have an agreement with Citibank and we can't be disclosing the terms. But I would say that, just by the fact that we've called it out, it is an offset and it's an important number. So we have never quantified anything less than 10 or 20 basis points. So you can take it from there and work with that.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just could you talk -- Hubert and Sharon, kind of you've talked a lot about what's working. Could you talk about some areas possibly where you feel that you've been a little slower, things are running a little bit behind, and what you're doing to deal with that, if you go all the way back to Renew Blue?","Hubert Joly","So your question is on what's not working. The way I would answer this is that, if you look at our glass, we can look at the half-full glass or part of the glass. Believe me, there is another part that's half-empty. And when I say half, that's because that's how the phrase comes in English, I think. And so then that leads me to the opportunities that we still have lying ahead. I think there's more efficiencies to be driven out. We're not stopping where we are, by any stretch of the imagination. And then I think, increasingly, we turn on the -- focus on the growth. I think our economics and economic engine really become interesting if we combine the power of efficiency with the power of more top line through our fixed cost base. And to get the growth, there's a number of governing thoughts here. It's all about the customer experience. Our key strategy in the context of price competitiveness is to drive the customer experience. You've heard us talk about the customer promises. Continuing to enhance and improve our delivery of our customer promises is going to be essential to our journey around the assortment and the selection, the advice, convenience, the service, the personalization. I think that, in terms of the growth engines, looking at the category strategies, how do we grow in a meaningful way in the key categories in which we are operating, and maybe some that are more longer-term growth potential, as this is a very dynamic space. I think that, from a channel perspective, online, are we happy where we are with online? We're happy with the progress, back to your point, but candidly, there's a lot of obsession on how to further drive this, drive the customer experience on the site in a very meaningful way. I think, how we address certain customer segments, think about millennials, think about buying occasions. As an example, we don't have a registry as a retailer. There's -- we're probably the only one who does not, and so on and so forth. So I think that we are very pleased and proud of our -- the progress we've made, but there's so much more to come. Again, from a cost standpoint. I could have highlighted returns, replacements and damages. This is -- we've talked about it. We've begun -- we've barely begun to take steps to address it. It's all in our future, the opportunity's all in our future for cost and revenue. So everything I said here is completely consistent with what we've been saying since November of last year, exactly a year ago, and we have to continue to drive this. So hopefully, this answers your question.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. Just a follow-up, and then I'll get off. The -- I was going to follow up on the customer return and damages area that you've highlighted in the past because, visiting some of your stores, we've seen in the corner, where I think you've had music in some stores, there's clearance, et cetera, I think it was called Etcetera [ph], is that something -- or is that part of the solution to the customer returns and damages? Are you planning to roll that out?","Sharon L. McCollam","We -- and actually, in all of our stores, we have created a more significant presence to show room the -- showcase the returned inventory. But the longer-term opportunity for us is, today, the majority of our online inventory is not visible in the online channel. So the returns, replacements and damages, open box, et cetera is not visible. And as a result of that, there are steps that have to be taken and systems changes that have to be made in order to make that possible because, today, if you take one SKU, for instance, let's take you've got one SKU and it's a computer, it's some sort of computer: each one that gets returned that's open box may have a different dynamic. One of them may not have the original cord, so we've had to replace a cord because the customer returned it in a different way. One might have a very small imperfection somewhere on the case, and you have to be able to describe that. Now we do that today. We have a site that you may or may not be highly familiar with called CowBoom. And as we go forward, the capability -- that's a small site. It was never really intended to handle the kind of volume that Best Buy creates from a returns point of view, but that type of capability is what we are building and looking for. And that -- when we can open up the open-box and return inventory to that channel, we believe that that's when we really reach scale. And that's why, in the prepared remarks that Hubert put out today, we went into further discussion on that because it's something we're very encouraged by.","Operator","And our final question comes from Anthony Chukumba with BB&T Capital Markets.","Anthony C. Chukumba - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I just had a question on the appliance business. You had such a strong comp there. And comps have sequentially accelerated now for several quarters in a row. And I was just wondering if you can give us a little color on what's driving that. I mean, is it the housing market? Is it adding small appliances? Is it better execution, or some sort of combination of all three? Just wondering to see if you can give a little color there.","Hubert Joly","Sure. Anthony, thank you for your questions. So the key drivers of our strong performance in Q3, of course, the housing market is -- I pull that back to my comment on focusing on our drivers. There's 4 main drivers of our performance in appliances in Q3. We've had -- we believe with -- promotions have been quite effective. We've added also appliance sales specialists in a number of our stores. This is a specialized area, so having more specialists is helpful. We've also expanded the small appliances category, which is a very exciting category where our market share is below 2%. So we can probably all agree that this is a growth opportunity. And then there is a positive impact of the Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store rollout and ramp-up. So these are the 4 drivers of performance with appliances, Anthony.","Operator","And I'll now turn the call back to management for closing comments.","Hubert Joly","Well, thank you so much. And as we end the call, of course, I'd like to take a moment to thank our leadership team, our associates and our vendor partners and, of course, their families for what they've done and what they will be doing to serve our customers and win during the holiday season. I also want to thank our shareholders for their ongoing support. And I want to wish all of them and all of you a very happy and joyful holiday season, which will not be complete without a trip or several trips to bestbuy.com or our stores. So I'll see you there.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"3470":["Best Buy Co., Inc.

Welcome to Best Buy\u2019s Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode, later we will conduct a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by 12 p.m. Eastern today. (Operator Instructions) The call will end at 9.50 am Eastern Time.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Bill Seymour, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Bill Seymour","Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our fiscal fourth quarter 2013 conference call. As usual, the media are participating in this call in a listen-only mode. Let me remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Best Buy may contain forward-looking statements regarding what we will expect, plan or intend to do in the upcoming year and beyond. It is important to keep in mind that any such statements remain subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management\u2019s expectations.","Please note that our reported results this morning include non-GAAP financial measures. These results should not be confused with the GAAP numbers we reported this morning in our earnings release or with the GAAP numbers we will report in our 10-K. For GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of our reported to adjusted results and guidance, please refer to the supplemental schedules in this morning\u2019s news release.","As a reminder, to assist you with our modeling, fiscal 2013 was a 53 week year versus 52 weeks in fiscal 2012. The extra week in fiscal 2013 was in the first quarter. The extra week of fiscal 2013 added approximately $700 million or 1.5% in revenue or $0.12 or 3% in non-GAAP EPS.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Hubert Joly, our President and CEO.","Hubert Joly","Well, good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I would like to begin today with an overview of our fourth quarter results and our priorities for fiscal 2014. Then, I will turn the call over to Sharon McCollam, our new Chief Administrative and Chief Financial Officer to provide further details.","But before we get started, I would like to officially introduce Sharon to all of you in our new role. As many of you know, Sharon joined us in early December. She came out of retirement after serving for many years as the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer at Williams-Sonoma. Since she joined us, we\u2019ve expanded her role and she is now leading our finance, IT, real estate, and supply chain operations. And of course, our in-depth expertise in these areas has made her an instantly powerful contributor to our transformation and work field that she is here. So welcome Sharon.","I would now like to talk about our better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter. On revenue growth of 0.2%, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.64. Adjusted free cash flow for the year reached $965 million as we aggressively reduced inventories and focused on working capital and cash flow management. We ended the year with $1.8 billion in cash. To deliver these results, renewed momentum in the domestic business more than offset continued softness in international.","Domestic comparable store sales increased 0.9% with an overall 10 basis point decline in the gross profit rate. Domestic online revenue increased 11% and so these better-than-expected results were driven by compelling assortment of new products in key growth categories, increased blue-shirt training, higher customer engagement in our retail stores, and impactful traffic generating marketing initiatives. It was a quarter that was driven, not given. And we are encouraged by the intensity collaboration and momentum that was generated by both our front line and corporate teams as we began to execute against our Renew Blue initiatives.","Now looking on to build on this momentum in fiscal 2014, we remain focused on the true problems we have to solve, stabilizing, and in improving our comparable store sales and increasing profitability, across our global businesses. We recognized however that 2014 is a year of transition, and that further investment will be required to advance our Renew Blue transformation.","To achieve this I\u2019d like to highlight six of our Renew Blue priorities that we will be pursuing in fiscal 2014, including number one, accelerating online growth; number two, escalating the multichannel customer experience; number three, increasing revenue and gross profit per square foot to enhance store space optimization and merchandising; number four, driving down cost of goods sold to supply chain efficiencies; number five, continuing to gradually optimize the U.S. real estate portfolio and number six further reducing our SG&A costs.","In addition, improving the performance of our international businesses will be another key priority. All of these priorities are currently underway and we expect each of them to deliver gradual and incremental operating improvement throughout the year. I\u2019d now like to provide additional color on each of these priorities.","To accelerate online growth, we intend to improve online traffic and conversion through a number of activities: number one, building a unified view of the customer across our various platforms, so it\u2019s dynamically generate online recommendations for product and shopping information based on customers need and preferences.","Number two, implementing a new search platform that helps customers find products more easily with increased relevance. Number three, creating product pages that have an integrated and consistent browsing experience across all devices. Number four, enabling a single seamless access to rewards on points management and redemption capabilities versus the current segregation between bestbuy.com and MyRewardZone.com. Number five, creating an easy process for customers to add additional products and services like warranty and geek squad support to their in-store pickup experience. And number six, increasing our product assortment in an interesting product information.","We expect to implement these changes by next holiday.","The second priority is to escalate the multichannel customer experience. In addition to the functionality improvements that we are making online, we\u2019ve introduced a new metric to track customer service levels known by many of you as Net Promoter Score or NPS. NPS will measure not only the satisfaction of customers that buy, but also the customers who don\u2019t. In November, at our Analyst Day, we discussed Best Buy\u2019s customer promises.","As a reminder, these promises include offering the customer the latest devices and services all in one place in partial and knowledgeable advice, competitive prices, the ability to shop when and where they want, and support for the life of their products.","To ensure that these promises are upheld, we\u2019ve defined key performance indicators that measure our progress on a monthly basis. And we are pleased to report that since November, our Net Promoter Score has increased by 200 basis points. We are seeing increased customer satisfaction pertaining to our sales associate, our service and price perception.","Looking ahead, we remain relentlessly focused on driving customer satisfaction to better install performance across our various channels, improve price perception through our low price guarantee, higher personalization of online offers and the reallocation of store labor hours to customers with paced in activity.","The first priority is to increase revenue and gross profit per square foot through enhanced store space optimization and merchandize. This year we will reduce space allocated to the negative growth and low margin CD and DVD categories and replace it with higher gross categories like mobile, appliances and accessories and to support these expanded categories, we will deepen the product assortment, increase Blue Shirts training and reprioritize marketing investments.","The first priority for this year is to drive down cost of good sold through supply chain efficiencies. Our first initiative here is to continue to develop multichannel capabilities as we continue to grow online business and to drive this, we will expand online fulfillment into all of our existing distribution centers and improve our allocations of inventory in order to get the inventory into the distribution center closest to the customer.","Additionally, we will be consolidating orders per parcel and refining order management to fill orders from optimal locations. All of these initiatives will result in improved service levels to the customer and reduced shipping cost. Another priority for supply chain will be to reduce expenses by driving transportation efficiencies. To achieve this we\u2019re significantly improving information sharing, collaboration and good planning with our carrier partners to send fuller trucks and reduce empty miles.","Lastly, we\u2019re reviewing our product movement to identify opportunities to alter product flows and transformation method to further reduce our expenses. Our fifth priority is to continue to gradually optimize our U.S. real estate portfolio. Occupancy cost reductions continue to be a key focus, and we make significant progress in fiscal 2013 in both the area of store closings and re-negotiated leases.","In fiscal \u201813, we permanently closed 49 large-format stores and expected to close an additional 5 to 10 large-format stores in fiscal 2014. Additionally, we have been very rigorous about capital allocations and have extended the timeframe by which we\u2019re measuring the performance of new prototype stores. This includes all formats including our Richfield prototype store, Magnolia and Pacific Sales, stores within-a-store and our Best Buy Mobile standalone stores.","They are, however, is small member of selected and opportunistic market who are planning to move forward with new stores including 12 new Best Buy Mobile stores, 10 Magnolia Design Center stores within the store and 18 to 25 Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store.","Our sixth priority is to further reduce SG&A cost, over time we believe there is an opportunity to remove $400 million in cost from the $4.2 billion in annual North America G&A expenses. Over the last several weeks, we have executed Phase I of these reductions totaling $150 million in annual savings, which included an initial head count reduction of approximately 400 people.","These savings are being driven by discontinuation of non-core activities; the take-out of management layers and various efficiency improvements, including the removal of organizational silos that have driven up costs and undermined accountability and decision making. In addition to this, $150 million cost take-out, we expect additional costs to be eliminated in the second quarter and later this year, we are continuing to systematically and aggressively challenge all elements of our SG&A cost structure in pursuit of a materially lower cost base.","We are planning to improve the performance of our international businesses, particularly in Canada and China. We have the same two problems to solve as we have in our domestic businesses; declining comparable store sales and declining operating margin. So as an example, in Canada and China, we have seen a significant decline in comps and operating income due to overall industry softness and increasingly competitive macro environment in an overweight cost structure.","To begin addressing these issues, in fiscal \u201813, we closed 50 stores in Canada and five in China. In addition, under the leadership of Shari Ballard, our EVP and President of International, we will be reading out renewed initiatives for our international businesses in fiscal 2014.","Collectively, all of these Renew Blue priorities are driving a commitment to action and accountability as our management team focuses on one Best Buy. To further this alignment, we have implemented a new management incentive program for all leaders that prioritizes the resolution of the two problems we have to solve, improving comp store sales and increasing profitability, this incentive scheme also prioritizes measurable improvements in the customer experience, the growth of our online business, and the achievements of further SG&A cost reductions. We believe that aligning the incentive program with the goals of Renew Blue was significantly elevated our success and drive enhanced shareholder value.","I will now turn the call over to Sharon to cover more details on Q4 and our outlook for fiscal 2014.","Sharon McCollam","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning. As Hubert said earlier in the call, our fourth quarter results did exceed our expectations and we are encouraged by what that said for our opportunities in 2014 and beyond, as we continue to make progress on our Renew Blue initiatives. The P&L highlights that drove these results were as follows; enterprise revenue increased 0.2% to $16.7 billion, primarily driven by a 0.9% comparable store sales increase in the Domestic segment, partially offset by a 6.6% comparable store sales decline in the international segment.","In the Domestic segment, total revenue declined 0.3% to $12.6 billion. But this decline was driven by the loss of revenues from 49 big box stores that were closed earlier in the year, but was substantially offset by the positive 0.9% comparable store sales increased previously discussed and incremental revenue from a 126 additional Best Buy mobile standalone stores.","It\u2019s important to note, however, that this fourth quarter\u2019s comparable store sales were benefited by an estimated 35 basis points due to a calendar shift in this year\u2019s pre-Super Bowl sales from Q1 of fiscal 2014 to Q4 of fiscal 2013.","Domestic online sales increased a 11% reaching a record $1.3 billion as momentum accelerated throughout the quarter. Highly effective traffic generating marketing initiatives drove these better-than-expected results.","From a merchandising perspective in the domestic segment, strong growth in mobile phone, tablets\/eReaders and appliances was partially offset by declines in gaming and digital imaging. In the international segment, total revenue increased 2% to $4.16 billion versus $4.09 billion last year. This increase was driven by the positive impact of changes in foreign currency rates, partially offset by the previously mentioned 6.6% decline in comparable store sales.","From a country perspective, positive comparable store sales in Europe were more than offset by double-digit declines in Canada and China. In Canada, overall industry softness drove this decline. In China, however, increased competition from e-commerce and year-over-year impact from expired government stimulus programs were the drivers.","Turning now to gross profit, the adjusted fourth quarter enterprise gross profit rate declined 60 basis points to 22.6%, including a 10 basis point decline in the domestic segment and 210 basis point decline in the international segment. In the domestic segment, the fourth quarter adjusted growth profit rate was 22.4% versus 22.5% last year. This 10 basis point decrease is a net impact of two business drivers.","The first, which represents a 40 basis point decrease as higher promotional activity principally in home theater that was partially offset by lower sales in gaming, which sells at a lower gross profit rate. The second is a 30 basis point benefit from a periodic profit sharing payment that was earned by the Company based on the long-term performance of the Company\u2019s externally managed extended service plan portfolio.","In the International segment, the fourth quarter gross capital rate was 23.4% versus 25.5% last year; this 210 basis points rate decline was primarily driven by a lower gross profit rate in Europe. In Europe, the decline was driven by a higher percentage of revenue coming from the wholesale channels and an unfavorable product mix in addition to greater promotional activity.","The International segment\u2019s gross profit rate was also negatively impacted by phone carrier and other periodic payments that were earned by the company in the prior year that did not recur in Q4 of fiscal year 2013.","Adjusted fourth quarter Enterprise SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased 100 basis points to 17.1% with 140 basis points increase in the Domestic segments and a 10 basis points decline in the International segment.","In the Domestic segment, adjusted SG&A expenses were $2.07 billion or 16.5% of revenue versus $1.9 billion, or 15.1% last year. This 140 basis points increase was primarily driven by increased investments in advertising and other direct selling costs to drive in-store and online revenue, a reversal of incentive compensation expense in the prior year that did not recur inQ4 fiscal 2013, and increase in field incentive compensation and executive retention and transition costs; and a year-over-year increase in legal-related reserves.","In the International segment, SG&A expenses were $791 million, or 19% of revenue versus $782 million, or 19.1% last year. This 10 basis points decrease was primarily driven by overall lower costs, partially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.","Adjusted free cash flow with $965 million for the year versus the most recently provided guidance of $500 million. This better than expected results was driven by three factors; an aggressive inventory reduction plan and an intense focus on working capital and cash flow management initiative that were implemented after the Company\u2019s last financial press release. A Higher than expected mix in the European business of inventory purchases for business-to-business sales activity that carry substantially longer payment terms. And the impact of better than expected fourth quarter earnings.","Before we move on to discussing next year, let me touch on the non-cash impairments and restructuring charges that were excluded from our non-GAAP earnings. First, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $822 million, primarily to reflect the write-off of goodwill for Canada and China, as recent economic and competitive pressures contributed to a worse than expected fourth quarter performance, and led to lower the long term outlook for both country. The same factors that resulted in the goodwill impairment also led to higher than normal non-restructuring non-cash asset impairments, which were included in the SG&A line and totaled $44 million including $9 million related to domestic segment asset impairments.","The Company also recorded restructuring charges totaling $203 million in Q4 of fiscal \u201813 primarily related to previously announced store closures in Canada and Europe, in addition to severance charges associated with Renew Blue SG&A cost reduction initiatives outlined previously. Of this $203 million approximately, $140 million is expected to be paid out in cash primarily over the next two years. For a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, please see the schedules in today\u2019s press release.","Now looking forward to fiscal 2014, Best Buy is at the beginning of a major transformation. As Hubert said, this year will be a transition year. A year in which we will be taking out cost as fast as we can, but also a year in which we will be simultaneously making substantial investments and Renew Blue initiatives that we believe will deliver significant long-term returns.","To support this initiatives we are expecting capital spending in fiscal year 2014 to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million and incremental SG&A investments to be in the range of $150 million to $200 million. These investments will be principally in the areas of online, mobile and the multichannel customer experience in addition to non-recurring cost associated with the in-sourcing of IT expected to be completed in fiscal 2014, and the re-platforming of bestbuy.com expected to be considered in fiscal year 2015.","These incremental SG&A investments, however, are expected to be substantially offset by our Renew Blue cost reduction initiatives, including the $150 million of Phase One reductions that were enacted over the last several weeks and the additional reductions that we are expecting to announce in the second quarter and later this year.","From a revenue and earnings perspective in fiscal 2014, we will not be providing financial guidance. Directionally, however, we do expect the first quarter to be under significant pressure due to; one, the absence of an additional week and the impact of this year\u2019s pre-Super Bowl sales shifting into Q4 versus Q1 of fiscal 2014, and which is an approximate impact of $0.14 combined in diluted earnings per share; number two, a less favorable product and services mix in the Domestic segments due to the timing of high velocity product launches that occurred in Q1 of fiscal 2013 that are not expected to recur in Q1 of fiscal 2014.","Number three, the first quarter carry-over effect of sales and marketing investments that were implemented in this fiscal year 2013 of greater investment in price competitiveness, including the impact of the company\u2019s recently launched price match program. And five, the timing and impact of capital and SG&A investments that are hitting the P&L today versus the timing of the realization of the benefits including the insourcing of IT and the replatforming of bestbuy.com.","But despite these first quarter financial pressures, the energy in the organization around the successful execution of our Renew Blue initiatives is still inspiring. Our fourth quarter results and the actions that we\u2019ve taken since then to begin rationalizing our infrastructure, have given the organization something that they have not had in a long time \u2013 pride in the outcome and a belief in what is possible. Our fourth quarter results have also affirmed what Hubert shared at the November Analyst Day and what I knew to be true when I joined the company.","Best Buy is the market leader in a highly fragmented and growing market. We have a powerful platform from which to deliver a superior multi-channel shopping and service experience to our customers. And while already the 11th largest e-commerce retailer in the U.S., Best Buy is underpenetrated from a market share perspective and early investment returns and the momentum we have seen in the channel validates the potential of this significant growth opportunity; and the runway to improve financial returns through increased online growth, enhanced retail execution, and extensive structural cost reductions is tremendous.","I will now turn the call back to Hubert.","Hubert Joly","Thank you so much, Sharon. And before we go to Q&A, I wanted to give a quick update on the process with our founder Dick Schulze. So yesterday was of course the deadline for Dick to make a qualified offer and no such offer was received. During the process, Dick introduced to the Company, several impressive private equity sponsors, we all expressed interest in an investment in Best Buy.","Now the costs of these investments however will determine to be excessive and dilutive to our existing shareholders. Therefore, the Company concluded to not accept these offers. Despite the significant amount of time that management has spent on this process, the organization has remained focused in our Renew Blue transformation and we will continue to do so, as we move forward for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.","So, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question comes from Kath McShane from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.","Katharine McShane \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Hi, thank you, good morning. My question is surrounding the price matching program that you\u2019re going to put in place or expect to be put in place that you did during holiday. And I wondered if you could consider some tranche surrounding holiday versus what we expected in this year. And if there were any earnings during holiday you learned?","Sharon McCollam","Hubert, would you like to take that question?","Hubert Joly","Yes and good morning, Keith. The line was not very good. I think your question pertains to price matching activities during the holidays and our strategy going forward. So this is a decision we made in October to make sure that we enhance our price competitiveness and fight the so called showrooming phenomenon. Blue Shirt teams in the field have been very credited about this program. The customers have been very engaged in this program and we believe that it has help improved our price perception during the program and so we\u2019ve been very credited about it.","In terms of impact on our margins, it was a big concern right out there in terms of the impact it would have. The impact has really been minimal, because in general terms actually our prices are quite competitive and as you know, we\u2019ve decided to move from the pilot to a policy. So the situation now is that we are matching both online and in the stores. We have actually expanded the price matching policy to cover up essentially all product categories including accessories and hardware, and so far there is very few exceptions to the policy.","The fact that we are going to make this a policy and make it permanent may increase the cost a little bit, so that\u2019s a factor that we have in mind. But we are Best Buy and we are determined to be the Best Buy for our customers and of course our value proposition to the customer is not just the price, it\u2019s all of the price customer promises and we like the response we are getting from customers.","Bill Seymour","Okay, next question please.","Operator","Thanks. Next question comes from Anthony Chukumba from BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Anthony C. Chukumba \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. So my question was on the free cash flow. Now you significantly reduced your guidance before the holiday sales results, and now you came out way we\u2019re better than that. I was just wondering, I know there was a color in the press release, but you can give us any additional color, because I know there was some concern that may be was because of vendors were cutting back terms, and I would just love just a little bit of additional color in terms of what you\u2019re able to do to almost double your free cash flow guidance? Thanks.","Sharon McCollam","Anthony this is Sharon and I\u2019ll take that question. In order to do that obviously, I just joined the Company when we release the previous cash flow guidance, and we had at the time I joined, we were discussing and the organization was already discussing actions to take as it relates to working capital management. So subsequent to that time, there were several things that we did that drove this, and the biggest of them and then there was one that is not driven, it is a result of the business change in Europe. So let me walk through that in a little more detail.","First of all, the inventory was ended lower than we anticipated, and a portion of that was the additional sales but in addition to that we did an entire study of our layer of our inventory that with very slow moving, and that was eligible for return-to-vendor. And so we had a full core cuts in the organization on taking this non-productive working capital and returning it to vendors. Now this is a process that when you think drove it you go from the store to a regional sensor from the regional center to the vendor the paperwork got to be intact and then you can legitimately deduct that account payables that you would owe to the vendors thus turning it into cash.","So who have guided a process that we had not historically executed and now of course, has become part of our baseline execution would have been probably a little bit premature, but the execution of this yielded well over $300 million of additional cash flow.","So we were thrilled with the execution of proxy organization that with (inaudible) and that was one driver. The next \u2013 the second driver is that if you recall from my prepared remarks in Europe, we talked about the fact that they had a significantly higher mix of post sales during the quarter.","And as part of this business to business sales effort activities being somewhat higher than anticipated, the payment terms at inventory purchases associated with the B2B business are substantially longer. So Europe delivered a substantial benefit international and general delivered, but it was all really came out of Europe and that brought in virtually \u2013 actually slightly more than the balance.","And then of course, because of our stronger performance, we did have some slightly higher receivables, which were the offset. So that is what drove in, it was pure operational execution. And then on top of that, Anthony, the smallest piece, but truly is aggressive tax management. We as a company have not necessarily have disciplines in place around that area and of course, going forward again we\u2019re building into our processes a much more thoughtful approach to cash management with all of our vendors, and I\u2019m not just talking about vendors associated with our inventory purchases, but our generally we do a lot of purchasing as you can tell from our SG&A initiative around traffic-generating to deal with product for resale. So that\u2019s another area that we\u2019ve gone after.","Hubert Joly","Sharon, do you want to touch on the vendor terms there was a question from Anthony about changing vendor terms or concern about this, which of course is not the case you wanted to maybe make that point.","Sharon McCollam","Yes. Anthony, we affirmed that in fiscal \u201813 there were no changes in vendor terms, I know that people, people were trying to get their head around this, and they are trying to understand it, but that had nothing to do with the $500 million. It all had to do with bringing the inventory in earlier, because of the calendar, and all of the things that we talked about in our last press release were exactly, how it came out. Had we not done this aggressive return of slow-moving inventory that has return capabilities with the vendors, this number would have been back into that range, if you take out the benefit from the shift in revenue in Europe to wholesale.","Anthony C. Chukumba \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Okay that\u2019s very helpful color. Good luck with fiscal year \u201814 and keep up the good work.","Sharon McCollam","Thank you, Anthony.","Hubert Joly","Next question please. Thank you Anthony.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Melich from ISI Group. Please go ahead with your question.","Gregory Melich \u2013 ISI Group, LLC","Hi thanks. Thanks to Hubert and Sharon, I have been busy there. On the domestic SG&A it was up 9% in the fourth quarter and you described it in dollar terms, it seems like some of it sort of just transitional and cycling some reversals from a year before, but a lot of it\u2019s on going as well, could you help us understand the balance how much of that 9% dollar growth, you think is on going as supposed to just the cycling of share?","Sharon McCollam","","Yes. Greg, your question kind of a little bit, but I think what your question is in the SG&A that we\u2019ve reported in the fourth quarter, it was up substantially or bit more than you might have anticipated and you wanted to know how much of that was going to continue into 2014. So I will answer that question and if that\u2019s not right, you can come back and ask and help me with that question.","As far as the changes and what we talked about in the press release is that, there was a credit last year that did not recur this year. We also in the fourth quarter has some legal reserves that we had recorded that of course, we don\u2019t have those frequently, so there was somethings that were unusual that way.","As I look at the SG&A, I perhaps would be more effective in answering this question by stepping back and just talking about SG&A and talking about our SG&A cost reduction initiatives. My early observations having been here just now a short time, but in total agreement would be there is that the SG&A infrastructure at Best Buy is too high.","There are some investments in the numbers that we are looking at in Q4 related to the Renew Blue field compensation plan that was put into place and there are investments right now in Q4 that are related to this IT transition. We are bringing \u2013 we\u2019re in-sourcing aspects of IT and doing other in-sourcing and we got double costs, those will not continue. But looking at the cost base just in general, it is not in anyway optimize and we have significant incremental opportunity, the $150 million was our first set at reducing the cost, and it is not all about headcount, a significant piece of this is going to come from non-payroll and benefit related reductions and it is going to come gradually and incrementally during the year.","So in Q1, we are hit really hard with this base of cost that was added early last year that we are not \u2013 we\u2019ll not be continuing in our cycle. We\u2019ve taken out a piece of it, we\u2019re going to take out another piece, and we are already prepared to announce additional reductions for Q2, which we\u2019ll talk more about in a few weeks or so from now or next release. And then we have additional reductions with the Cadence throughout the balance of the year.","So to summarize, I would say there is a piece of this that will continue, and then you\u2019ll see gradual and incremental reduction. Q1 is going to have a lot of pressures, Q2 still has pressure. We\u2019re going to have the charges associated, we\u2019ve taken the cost out, then Q3 and Q4, we are going to be slimmer and we will continue to take cost out going forward.","Gregory Melich \u2013 ISI Group, LLC","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Sharon McCollam","You\u2019re welcome.","Hubert Joly","Thanks, Greg. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Balter from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Thank you. First of all, just one clarification on the earlier question that was at some price matching, because when you go on your site, it doesn\u2019t mention matching online, but some of your Christmas output was matching online. So what\u2019s the policy now going forward?","Hubert Joly","So let me be very clear, price matching strategy applies both online and in the stores. We sit under the worth low price guarantees. Gary, and first of all, let me thank you for visiting our site. I hope you\u2019re buying.","Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Well, I didn\u2019t have the guarantee. So I couldn\u2019t buy in that just\u2026","Hubert Joly","So, would you like to tell me what\u2019s skew, would you like to hand over that?","Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Yeah, I will talk to you later.","Hubert Joly","We are very customer focused as you can see\u2026","Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","I could see.","Hubert Joly","The lower price guarantee is the word for the price match and you see it on the site and I\u2019ll double check right after this call myself so that because I\u2019m concerned about what you\u2019re saying, but there will be no doubt. The price matching is both online and you can get it online and in the stores and it covers of course our brick-and-mortar competitors as well as our online competitors.","Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Okay. And then just a question, could you talk about your progress on the website like you obviously laid it out as one in the priorities. Could you tell us like where you are in terms of progress on that and how long you see that taking in terms of getting to a site that you\u2019re comfortable with?","Hubert Joly","Yeah, thank you, Gary. And so this is going to be a dual process. One side of the process is to work with the existing sites and make gradual incremental progress. I\u2019ve mentioned the number of things we\u2019re going to be focused on and we\u2019ll be ready for next holiday and this will continue. So this deals were the interaction with the customers, it deals with search, it deals with assortments, it deals with integration. One of the surprises has been the fact that we have these multiple sites BestBuy.com, MyRewardsZone.com, GeekSquad.com that have not been integrated and so the customer experience talking about multichannel even multi websites it was not integrated. So we\u2019re addressing that with the existing infrastructure.","And then in parallel to this, we will have a project to reconstruct, to redevelop, a new platform, and as you would expect that takes longer. We expect this to probably take a couple of years roughly speaking, which is why of course, we don\u2019t want to wait a couple of years and we\u2019ll have this dual track. So keep shopping during the year expect next 30 days some wonderful enhancements and then continue coming back and providing us feedbacks.","Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","And just to calm you down or make you happy, I did supply a 55-inch Samsung TV just before the Super Bowl at your store, so I am spending money as Best Buy mentioned.","Hubert Joly","Gary, I couldn\u2019t be happier, and then actually looking at the site on my iPad, and you can see low price guarantee, it says well much prices on qualifying products CD sales and so forth. But the low price guarantee it\u2019s on the front page towards the left in the bottom third of the page.","Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Hubert Joly","Thank you.","Bill Seymour","Thanks Gary. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Chris M. Horvers \u2013 JPMorgan","Thanks and good morning. Holistically can you talk about the outlook for domestic gross margin as you look ahead, it seems like there was the only that one warranty item that was not sustainable. So do you think we\u2019ve reached the point, we\u2019ve got the smartphone mix issue behind us. We\u2019ve reached the stabilization and if not, what would be sort of puts and takes as you look ahead that could sway us from current levels?","Sharon McCollam","Chris, this is Sharon. I\u2019m going to take that question. I think that you have to take a look at 2013 the fiscal year and look at it by quarter. And what you saw throughout the year was that the more competitive environment playing out in the growth profit rates, so now we\u2019ve gotten into Q4 and what we believe is that we will continue, Q4 was a more promotional quarter especially in Europe, so when you\u2019re looking at the enterprise level, I am talking about the domestic business now.","When you look at Q4, we believe that coming off of that level you are going to start seeing stabilization in that margin and our hope would be to our supply chain and our cost efficiencies, and cost to good sold initiatives under Renew Blue, we can improve that. But this is going to be the challenge for Q1. It was throughout the year that we saw the competitive pricing environment escalate and up against Q1, we are going to have a talent in the gross margin because last year was so much strong. So that\u2019s how you should think about it going forward, but just to put that I am not giving guidance but as just pointed out for all of you so that you can model. Please take a look at that and you\u2019re going to see what I am talking about.","Hubert Joly","","Right, so we sort of look back in time and we think about what typically what 4Q margin looks like, that\u2019s were the basis that we build that of course basically.","Sharon McCollam","I think Q4 was because of the impact that we saw from Europe and some other things, I think it was a little bit lower but yes, you need to take a lot at how the year progressed and now we feel that we are in a place where we can start stabilizing and building.","Hubert Joly","And I want to come back one second on Gary\u2019s question about the price mix to be very precise, which is that the movement from the cyber space of our price mix into the permanent policy is much deferred, and so in the stores, from March 03 that you will see the new signage and so forth, but that\u2019s just a transitional and very precise points.","Hubert Joly","Okay, operator. This will be the last question. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our last question comes from Joe Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead with your question.","Joe Feldman \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the quarter. Wanted to also dig into the internet a little bit and the e-commerce sales, I was just curious the complexion of what you saw in the e-commerce relative to the stores in the past quarter and in terms of may be the types of products you are selling online, did you see any changes from prior quarters? Had you seen any change in profitability, or just and how you are thinking about the capital deployments going forward among that CapEx spending, how much is going towards e-commerce this year?","Sharon McCollam","Hubert, would you like to take that question on online?","Hubert Joly","Yes. Thank you very much, Joe. And I love your question, because online is always number one in our thoughts, that\u2019s a huge area of emphasis for us. So online first, we saw good growth in tablet phones and accessories during the quarter. Down the road, we\u2019ll sell to customers the way they want to buy and of course, simpler products will be sold probably primarily online and more complex products will be sold more in the stores, and of course, the customers will have the choice.","We\u2019re focused on growing online as well as expanding the profitability of online. We have the firm belief that at the end of the day, online stores should have the same level of profitability. So some of the emphasis going forward will have to do with increasing, improving the baskets online, including one thing I mentioned, which is the ability, the easier ability to buy our services online, as well as expanding the baskets through recommendation, so lots of opportunities there.","In terms of the investments, we expect we\u2019re saying, we\u2019re going to be very disciplined around the allocation of capital with a view to enhancing our return on invested capital. So we know what our priorities are and that makes it easier. So online is an area of emphasis from a CapEx standpoint, notably from an IT standpoints and we are focused on driving that.","We understand that both from a OpEx and CapEx standpoint, I think that we are going to have these investments in the two platforms, the existing platform, and the new platform will create a bit of a bump if you will, but we\u2019re determined to do the right thing provided that we keep this focus on return on invested capital.","Sharon McCollam","And Hubert, I might just add one more highlight on.com, for the fourth quarter, which is on top of that 11% growth. We also had a improvement in the gross profit rates. So despite the investments we made in the marketing and the price match, we did start seeing an improvement in the profitability in the gross profit in the online business, which of course, is also very encouraging as we start making these investments. So thank you.","Hubert Joly","And just before we conclude, I would like to and of course, share our excitements about the early momentum we are seeing here and thank you for your support. This is going to be a very exciting journey. We\u2019re going to have ongoing dialogues around this. We look forward to continuously updating you on our progress and are building momentum. So thank you for your support and continued interest.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today\u2019s Best Buy\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2013 earnings conference call.

The extra week is excluded from our comparable sales calculations.","I will now turn the call over to Hubert.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will begin today with a review of our fourth quarter and of our fiscal 2018 annual performance, and then provide a preview of our fiscal 2019 priorities as we continue to implement Best Buy 2020: Building The New Blue strategy. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and our financial outlook.","So, today we are reporting a fourth quarter Enterprise comparable sales growth of 9% and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.42, which is up 25% compared to last year. These are very strong and better-than-expected results. The strong comps are the results of a combination of factors. First, strong execution of our strategy combined with better product availability; second, a continued healthy consumer confidence and positive macro conditions; third, strength in the gaming category; and fourth, a favorable competitive environment, as we benefited from the exit or decline of certain competitors.","Let me elaborate. Customers are responding very positively to our Best Buy 2020 strategy. We are gaining market share and continuing to improve our Net Promoter Scores across the company in a material fashion. Specifically, during the quarter, we continued to demonstrate our ability to partner with vendors to commercialize new technology across a broad spectrum of products. This strength was supported by an effective 30-day promotional plan that customers found compelling.","In parallel to this, a key driver of our success is the mobilization of the company, particularly the associates on the front line, who are on a mission to enrich peoples' lives through technology. This comes to life in a very powerful way in our stores where I am impressed by the level of engagement and proficiency of our associates, their desire and ability to truly connect with customers, understand what they're trying to accomplish and then find a solution that will satisfy their needs.","We're also making progress online where we have continued to streamline the buying process, enabled faster and more efficient delivery, and further enhanced the buy online, pick up in store experience for our customers. Online comparable sales increased 18% in the fourth quarter and were 20% of our total domestic sales.","As I mentioned earlier, product availability was much better this year and was a factor in driving our strong growth. You may recall that last year, we had both product recalls and product availability constraints across multiple vendors and categories. This year, product availability was much better across the industry. And additionally, we deliberately invested in having more product in stock and available for customers.","From a profitability standpoint, we grew operating income dollars by 10% on revenue growth of 14%, which led to a 20-basis point decline in the operating income rate. Let me break this down for you by focusing on the Domestic segment, which makes over 90% of the Enterprise.","So, in the Domestic segment, we delivered a flat gross profit rate with SG&A expenses, while SG&A expenses grew slightly more than the revenue growth rate. This is due first to the increase in incentive compensation expenses for more than 85,000 of our store and corporate employees as a result of the very strong performance this year; and second, to the investment we have made in the business, partially offset by efficiencies and cost savings. At the EPS level, our Q4 non-GAAP EPS grew by 25%. This result was positively impacted by a lower tax rate due to both tax reform and other discrete items.","Turning to our full year results, our performance in fiscal 2018 was strong. We grew our comparable sales 5.6%, expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate by 20 basis points, and increased our non-GAAP EPS by 26%, which are a materially better result than what we expected when we began the year.","We returned $2.4 billion to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. We continued to improve our Net Promoter Scores and drive market share gains, proof that our strategy is resonating with customers. We reduced store employee turnover and increased overall employee engagement. And we made significant progress against key Best Buy 2020 initiatives.","For example, last September, we launched our new In-Home Advisor program nationally and significantly expanded our Total Tech Support pilot. We continued to upgrade the experience in the stores and online, and we began investing in the transformation of our supply chain and other key systems and capabilities necessary to enable our strategy. And so, I want to enthusiastically thank our associates for their great work in delivering these results. The level of energy and dedication to serving customers that I see across the company is very inspiring.","Now looking ahead, our focus is on the continued implementation of our Best Buy 2020 strategy. We continue to believe we have a material opportunity ahead of us to grow the company. We also know there continues to be real pressures from areas like wages, supply chain and channel shift. In that context, our mindset has not changed. We are playing to win and, of course, the strategy we outlined in September has not changed.","The purpose of our Best Buy 2020 strategy is to enrich lives through technology. As we outlined last September, we plan to fulfill our purpose and grow the company by expanding what we sell and evolving how we sell and building the key enablers that are needed, while continuing to take cost out.","Let me highlight a few of our fiscal 2019 priorities along these lines. First, in fiscal 2019, we will continue to ramp up our In-Home Advisor program as we add advisors and improve the related tools and systems that help them do their jobs. Second, we are planning a nationwide launch of our Total Tech Support program this coming spring.","As a reminder, Total Tech Support is a new Geek Squad offering we began testing last year. We provide support for all of the customers' technology, no matter where and when they bought it. We believe that customer support needs are often not limited to a specific product. The need now is to have all of their technology work together. This support is available to customers 24\/7 online, in-store and on the phone. The price of this service is $199 per year and includes discounts on other services like in-home services and extended warranty programs.","Third, we will continue to develop the proficiency of our associates and their ability to deeply understand and address customer needs. Fourth, we will continue to streamline the online buying process for our customers. Online shoppers need to be able to seamlessly navigate our site and quickly and intelligently narrow their product or service selection. For example, we will be further enhancing the search functionality with natural language capability, so customers can find what they need by simply typing in phrases like best laptop for students, quiet dishwasher or sturdy camera.","Fifth, from the multi-channel standpoint, building on our success with in-store pickup, we continue to test new and convenient ways for customers to get their orders. For example, we are piloting a new feature on our mobile app that allows customers to tell us when they are on their way to pick up their large TV or major appliance, so we can have it ready for them when they arrive and they won't have to wait at the store pickup counter for an associate to bring the product from the backroom. And we are also testing lockers and curbside pickup solutions.","In addition, we will continue to explore and invest in a range of digital solutions such as voice assistance across a variety of customer touch points as well as personalization initiatives. Now to successfully expand what we sell and evolve how we sell, we are investing in a range of enablers as we described in September across technology, stores, supply chain, new business initiatives and cost take-out projects.","For example, we are continuing the technology investments we began last year in Enterprise customer relationship management and knowledge management tools, expanding the usage from our In-Home Advisors to associates across our services organization and our call centers. This will help us build a more seamless, more effective experience for our customers and paves the way towards a more relationship-based approach to the customer experience we offer.","We're also building out a new services platform to help power our Total Tech Support offering and provide the ability for customers to get easy and quick access to our Geek Squad tech experts, including a new app with video chat capability.","In stores, we are building a number of digital tools that are designed to relieve customer pain points like streamlining the checkout for long, complex customer orders and significantly reducing processing times and, therefore, customer wait times for mobile phone transactions.","We will also continue to invest in specialty labor in areas such as appliances, In-Home Advisor and smart home. As it relates to our supply chain, we will continue the long-term strategic investments we started last year that are designed to expand our bandwidth for growth and speed.","Of course, our fiscal 2019 priorities also include initiatives that increase productivity to offset pressures and fund investments. Our current productivity target established in Q2 of fiscal 2018 is $600 million in additional annualized cost reductions and gross profit optimization to be completed by the end of fiscal 2021.","During the fourth quarter, we achieved approximately $135 million towards our new goal for a total thus far of $235 million. A significant portion of the $135 million flowed through the income statement in the fourth quarter with the largest portion being gross profit optimization, driven primarily by a material decrease in price erosion in our stores. This was achieved by making improvements to processes and systems that resulted in fewer price overrides in the stores, more accurate price matching and better return on clearance pricing.","Now as a part of our strategy to continuously optimize our business, yesterday we announced our intent to close our 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in the U.S. effective May 31. Let me say a few words about this. First, we are very grateful for the work our stand-alone stores associates have done over the last several years, and we will work hard to retain the maximum number of these employees as we value their expertise and as we have a range of opportunities for them within the company.","Why are we closing these stores? We began opening these stores more than a decade ago before the iPhone was even launched. Back then the mobile phone business was in a period of rapid growth and margins were high. Fast forward to 2018 and the mobile phone business has matured, margins have compressed and the cost of operations in our stand-alone stores is higher than in our big-box stores.","We're committed to and remain excited about the mobile phone category. We simply believe that it makes more sense for us to grow this category in our big-box stores and online. We are excited by the superior customer experience we're building there. The Mobile 2020 work we began last year makes it easier for a customer to research and compare plans and then purchase and set up a phone. In support of this goal, hundreds of our big-box stores now include dedicated vendor experiences associated with carriers and manufacturers like Apple, AT&T, Samsung, Sprint and Verizon and we're adding more of these this year.","So, in summary, we are operating in an opportunity rich environment driven by innovation and customer needs for help. We are the market share leader with unique opportunities to expand what we sell and evolve how we sell and build the companies that customers love. As we head into fiscal 2019, we are all highly motivated to continue to propel the company forward.","Corie will provide a more detailed outlook, but at a high level, we're expecting comparable sales to be flat to up 2%, which is on top of the 5.6% we delivered in fiscal 2018; an operating income rate of approximately 4.5%, which is flat to last year on a comparable 52-week basis; and non-GAAP EPS of $4.80 to $5, an increase of 9% to 13% or an increase of 14% to 18% compared to last year on a comparable 52-week basis.","As it relates to our target for fiscal 2021, while it would be premature to update our revenue and operating income targets for that year, we are increasing our EPS target for fiscal 2021 from the $4.35 to $5.00 range we provided in September to a $5.50 to $5.75 range as a result of tax reform.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Corie Barry, for more details on our Q4 performance and our fiscal 2019 guidance.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you, Hubert. Good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year and versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter, I would like to provide additional context on our GAAP versus non-GAAP results.","Enterprise GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.23 per share versus non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.42. The non-GAAP number excludes the following items related to tax reform. One, a one-time repatriation tax on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries; two, revaluation of our net deferred tax asset at the lower corporate statutory rate; three, the payment of appreciation bonuses primarily to our hourly store associates; and four, a charitable donation to the Best Buy Foundation. In addition, we also incurred the initial restructuring charges associated with our intent to close our remaining U.S. Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores.","Versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter, Enterprise revenue of $15.4 billion exceeded our expectations and was driven by higher-than-expected revenue in both our Domestic and International segments and nearly all product categories.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.42 also exceeded our expectations due to the lower non-GAAP tax rate and the flow-through of the higher revenue. A lower-than-expected tax rate provided a $0.29 per share benefit versus our expectations and was mainly the result of the resolution of the three tax items and a lower tax rate for the month of January due to tax reform changes.","While the gross profit rate and non-GAAP SG&A rate were in line with our original expectations, we did not gain incremental SG&A leverage with the higher sales due primarily to the incentive compensation for both our corporate and field employees exceeding expectations. I will provide additional details on this later in my remarks.","I will now talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 14% to $15.4 billion, which included approximately $760 million from the extra week. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased $0.49 or 25% to $2.42. This increase was primarily driven by an estimated $0.20 per share benefit from the extra week, a $0.15 per share benefit from the net share count change on a 52-week basis, a $0.10 per share benefit driven by the lower tax rate and the flow-through of the higher revenue, which was largely offset by the higher incentive compensation and the negative impact of approximately $0.03 per share from a lower periodic profit sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio versus last year.","In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 13.4% to $14 billion. This increase was primarily driven by a comparable sales increase of 9% and approximately $715 million of revenue from the extra week. These gains were partially offset by the loss of revenue from 18 large-format stores closed during the past year.","From a merchandising perspective, we generated comparable sales growth across most of our categories, with the largest drivers being mobile phones, gaming, appliances, smart homes, wearables and home theater. As it relates to mobile phones, the category was positively impacted by sales of the Samsung Note, which we were not able to sell last year due to a recall. Also as we mentioned on our call last quarter, we had approximately $100 million shift from Q3 into Q4 due to the later launch of the iPhone X.","Domestic online revenue of $2.8 billion was 20% of Domestic revenue and increased 17.9% on a comparable basis, primarily due to higher conversion rates and higher average order values. International revenue of $1.4 billion increased 20.3%. This increase was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 9.9% due to growth in both Canada and Mexico, approximately 580 basis points of positive foreign currency impact, and approximately $45 million of revenue from the extra week.","Turning now to gross profit, the Enterprise gross profit rate decreased 20 basis points to 22.3% due to a lower rate in Canada. The Domestic gross profit rate of 22.3% was flat to last year. The gross profit optimization that Hubert mentioned earlier helped offset pressure in the mobile phone category, the impact of mixing into certain lower-margin products and the approximate 15-basis point negative impact from the lower periodic profit sharing benefit.","The International gross profit rate decreased 220 basis points to 22.4%, primarily due to a lower year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada due to, one, lower sales in the higher-margin services category primarily driven by the launch of Canada's total tech support offer, a long-term recurring revenue model; two, a decrease margin rate in the home theater category; and three, an approximate 15-basis point negative impact from a lower periodic profit sharing benefit.","Turning to SG&A, Enterprise non-GAAP SG&A was $2.4 billion or 15.9% of revenue, which increased $299 million on a dollar basis and was flat from a rate perspective versus last year. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $2.2 billion or 15.8% of revenue versus $1.9 billion or 15.7% of revenue last year. The $276 million increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation, the impact of the extra week, investments, and higher variable costs due to increased revenue. These increases were partially offset by the flow-through of cost reductions.","I would like to spend a little more time on the higher incentive compensation expense due to the magnitude of the impact it had on our Q4 results. The higher expense was driven by both our retail and corporate plans, which used targeted performance metrics established at the beginning of the year.","As a reminder, we started the year with an annual guidance of approximately 1.5% revenue growth and low single-digit growth in non-GAAP operating income, both of which we significantly exceeded. Our corporate incentive expense aligns with annual performance goals and has accrued over the course of the year based on expected full year performance.","In Q4 of last year, due to the lower-than-expected performance, we both reversed expenses for certain metrics that had been accrued over the course of the year and did not accrue additional expense within the quarter for certain metrics. This year, we had the reverse effect, as certain metrics exceeded our previous expectations for the full year, which had a disproportionate negative impact on the fourth quarter, even though payment amounts were related to full year performance.","International non-GAAP SG&A was $223 million or 16.2% of revenue, an increase of $23 million. This increase was primarily driven by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and the extra week. The 130-basis point rate decrease was primarily driven by sales leverage.","From a cash flow perspective, we ended the fourth quarter in line with our expectations. On the balance sheet, our inventory was up 7%, our payables were down 2%, and our receivables balance was down 22%. Our owned inventory position and receivables would have been roughly flat if last year would have also included an extra week.","As it relates to capital allocation, our approach has not changed. Our strategy is to fund operations and investments in growth, including potential acquisitions, and then to return excess free cash flow over time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, while maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. We continue to target a non-GAAP dividend payout ratio between 35% and 45%.","In the context of our overall strategy, our improved performance and the savings brought about by tax reform, we have taken and plan to take the following measures that benefit employees, our community, the business and our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, for our employees, we paid one-time $1,000 bonuses to both full-time store associates and non-bonus eligible corporate employees and $500 to part-time store associates. We also made a $20 million charitable contribution to the Best Buy Foundation. Going forward, we are investing in the enablers necessary to propel our strategies. This includes both people and systems, and the related costs are reflected in our annual guidance.","For our people, we will continue to invest in specialty labor and plan to invest in improvements to our employee benefit programs. In support of our systems investments, we are raising our fiscal 2019 capital expenditure plan to $850 million to $900 million from the expectations we shared at Investor Day of $750 million to $850 million. This morning, we announced that we increased our dividend 32% and increased our share buyback plans for fiscal 2019 by $500 million to $1.5 billion.","I would now like to talk about our full year fiscal 2019 guidance which, as a reminder, has 52 weeks versus 53 weeks in fiscal 2018. We are expecting the following: Enterprise revenue in the range of $41 billion to $42 billion; Enterprise comparable sales of flat to up 2%; Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 4.5%, which is flat to fiscal 2018's rate on a 52-week basis despite the investments we are accelerating as a result of tax reform; Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $4.80 to $5.00, an increase of 9% to 13%. This represents an increase of 14% to 18% when compared to fiscal 2018 on a 52-week basis.","And finally, we are expecting a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 25%. I would like to call out a number of assumptions reflected in our annual guidance. Our investments, in particular, in specialty labor, supply chain and increased depreciation related to strategic capital investments and ongoing pressures in the business, including approximately $35 million of lower profit share revenue, will be partially offset by a combination of returns from new initiatives and ongoing cost reductions and efficiencies.","The increased investments in supply chain as well as higher transportation costs, in particular, are expected to add approximately 25 basis points of gross profit pressure each quarter to our Domestic business. The national rollout of our Total Tech Support offering in Q2 will pressure the gross profit rate of the Domestic business. This is due in part to recognizing the revenue over the term of the membership. On a full year basis, we expect the rollout to have a negative impact of approximately 15 to 20 basis points on our Domestic gross profit rate.","The Best Buy Mobile small-format store closures are estimated to negatively impact revenue by approximately $225 million with flat to slightly positive impact on operating income. And finally, our guidance reflects lower incentive compensation expense as we reset our performance targets to align with our fiscal 2019 expectations.","I would also like to talk specifically about our Q1 fiscal 2019 guidance. We are expecting the following: Enterprise revenue in the range of $8.65 billion to $8.75 billion; comparable sales growth of 1.5% to 2.5%; Domestic comparable sales growth of 1.5% to 2.5%; and International comparable sales growth of flat to 3%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.68 to $0.73, an increase of 13% to 22%; a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of 22% to 22.5%; and a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 290 million shares.","Please note that our Q1 guidance reflects the following impacts. We estimate that the negative impacts from calendar shift total approximately $100 million in revenue, with the biggest driver being the timing of Super Bowl, as related sales were pulled forward into the extra week in Q4 fiscal 2018 versus Q1 fiscal 2019.","As I just mentioned, increased investments in supply chain, as well as higher transportation costs are expected to add approximately 25 basis points of gross profit rate pressure. We will have approximately $8 million of lower Domestic gross profit due to lapping a legal settlement received last year. And we expect the International gross profit rate pressure we saw in Q4 to continue into the first quarter.","I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go ahead with our first question from Matt Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks so much, and congratulations on a terrific print. My first question and primary question relates to gross margin. You spoke about lower store price erosion as a driver of Domestic gross margin rate. Can you talk about what that means?","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Sure. Absolutely, Matt. So, when we're talking about erosion, what we're looking at, we kind of broke it up into three buckets actually when we talked about it. We talked about price overrides in the stores, more accurate price matching and better return on clearance pricing. Essentially, that is decisions that we make at the store level to move through inventory for various reasons, clearance obviously makes sense given the nature of clearance items.","But above and beyond that, the things like price overrides are decisions that are often made at the store level around price matching or competitive price matching, and we built in a lot more science behind the scenes, when and how to match and how to price that clearance merchandise, so that it moves as fast as you would like it to and you garner the most value out of it as possible. So, this is an excellent example of both corporate and our field employees working together to try and build both science and then processes in the field that help build these efficiencies. And it's a lot of what we've talked about before about these being these really cross-functional efforts to try to pull cost out.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, it sounds like this is more about execution than about the environment.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","You've got it. That's exactly the right way to frame it up.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And just a quick follow-up on sales, to the extent that you're guiding to a much more subdued comp performance in 2018 than you posted last year, which categories do you expect to be smaller contributors or be challenged by tough compares relative to 2017?","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","We've got a couple major things that are happening for sure. Remember, we benefited disproportionately this year from filling in the hole that was left by the lack of a Note device the year prior. We'll still have a little bit of that into this year, but only about a half a year of that, so there is just a hole there. Remember, we also had some of the real product storages last year in Q4 that we lapped this year. We aren't going to have that same lap next year. We had good product availability this year, which we specifically called out.","And the other thing we specifically called out was gaming and, in particular, the Switch which launched, as a reminder, last year in Q1. And so now this year we're going to be lapping that full gaming cycle. And so those were big drivers of growth that just by the nature of what they were, you'd expect to decelerate a bit as we head into the next year.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks so much, Corie.","Operator","And we'll go ahead with our next question from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning guys. Two questions. First, hopefully this is an easy one. With better hindsight, can you size the impact of the call-back on last year's product shortages?","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Yeah. I think last year we had talked about in Q4 about a $400 million figure that included primarily phones, but it was also activities around appliances with the recall and in general, shortages. And so this year, we're benefiting from anniversarying this. In addition to this, we deliberately invested in better product availability, better in-stock across our channels, so as to be able to meet customer demand. And so it's really the combination of the two factors that were quite helpful.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. So, still a good gauge in terms of $400 million. And then, I guess a bigger question, Hubert, like \u2013 but before this past year, I think you guys have kind of characterized your company and positioned your company as a premium dividend payer, throws off a lot of cash, gaining share in an industry that's kind of a flat to slow growth kind of market. But you guys just put up some of the best comp growth you've had in a very long time this past year. Does that reassess how you're thinking about the longer-term growth trajectory of this business?","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","So, I think what we are saying today is very consistent with what we said in September. We have an opportunity rich environment where there is increasing product innovation and the need for help on the part of the customers. And we think that we're uniquely positioned to take advantage of that and we're building all of the enablers to be able to capture these growth opportunities.","So, we've provided a fiscal 2021 outlook in terms of revenue and operating income rate, where certainly compared to Renew Blue, in Best Buy 2020, we'll have more focus on growth and building a moat for the company. So, we're becoming more of a growth-oriented company for sure. We're maintaining the premium dividend payer status. Initially, in the last one or two years, we said \u2013 we see these opportunities. We said initially you're not going to believe us, give us time to be able to build that and you're finding us on the way in this direction.","We're not updating today our fiscal 2021 revenue and operating income numbers because we think it's premature, it's really \u2013 we're four months after September, five months after September. We've upgraded the EPS target because of the benefit of tax reform. So, that's a material upgrade. But, yes, we're gradually evolving the status of the company with a very strong focus on playing to win, growing the company on the basis of a company that does extraordinary things for customers.","I want the customers \u2013 we went from customers that didn't like us, they now like us, I'd like them to love us, and we think that it positions us well from a growth standpoint. We're not changing the capital allocation strategy of premium dividend and return of capital (36:19) today based on the results of our performance. So, that's how I would summarize it, Scot.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go ahead with our next question from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Congratulations on a really nice quarter and year.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","I guess so my one question. Corie, thanks for all the detail on the SG&A. I just want to, so to say, probe further on the incentive compensation. The question I have there is, is there a way to break out, as we look at the results, the actual impact of the incentive compensation in the fourth quarter? And then as we look into 2018 or, I guess, even beyond, how should we think about, so to say, the leverage point in your model given the investments you're making? Or maybe said better, any \u2013 where could (37:19) upside to sales \u2013 to your sales plan actually make its way to the bottom line? Thanks.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Sure. So, I'll start with the first part of the one question. But let me take a step back here for a second on incentive comp metrics. These are about annual plans that we set at the beginning of the year. And we reminded you, at the beginning of the year, we set, essentially on a 52-week basis, flat top line, flat bottom line guidance. And we called out on Q3, we expected incentive comp to have a higher impact in Q4. And that was based on the performance we genuinely thought we could see for Q4 at that point.","As it relates specifically to the fourth quarter, there were three things that happened that had a disproportionate impact on Q4. First, and I talked about it, the fourth quarter didn't come in as planned last year, as I'm sure you remember, and so we reversed out expense that we had accrued already throughout the year.","Second, in the fourth quarter, many metrics came in higher than we'd been accruing for all year this year. Obviously, we outperformed in a lot of different ways. And that meant the fourth quarter expense included amounts that would have been accrued for in earlier quarters if we would have known the whole year was going to perform as well.","And then three, the fourth quarter just, in and of itself, was way better than expected. And so when you stack those four things up, the impact to the fourth quarter was just north of $100 million. But to put that in perspective, year-over-year our increase in incentive comp was about $130 million for the whole year. You can see the disproportionate impacts the accrual had on this fourth quarter.","That being said, I want to make sure I'm crystal clear that we're really excited to be able to sharing the performance with our associates, and that more than 85,000 people received some \u2013 or will receive some portion of this payout. So, I want to make sure that comes across very clearly.","To the extent of your second point on leverage and where the leverage point is, I think Hubert said it really well. When we set up for Investor Day, we said we're going to aim for top line growth and then we are going to do what we need to do to reinvest in the business and maintain that flattish operating income rate, but we're going to pick different points to accelerate some of our initiatives or launch some of our initiatives depending on kind of how that top line flows for us.","And so it's not as easy as the math of when exactly do you get leverage. It's a question of how quickly we can get legs under a multitude of the initiatives that we talked about from a strategic perspective and how can we deliver on that overall financial equation that we're driving for the growth and then the relative stability in operating income rates. Obviously, a little volatile quarter-to-quarter, but in general a progression toward flat to maybe up just a bit in that op income rate.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","And maybe if I pile on the basic belief we have. And I think it's very important from an investment thesis standpoint is that down the road, the space we are in is a space where there's going to be outsized return for the winners versus the losers. And this is a time to play to win and build \u2013 invest in our growth capabilities, build the moat so that we position ourselves for long-term success in a very significant fashion.","So, I think in the short term, the return we're providing to shareholders on the basis of the growth, the EPS growth, the return of capital we're excited about, I hope you share that perspective, and we are also positioning ourselves for long-term success again with the view that there is going to be an increasing difference between winners and losers, and we know what camp we want to be in.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Got it. Very helpful. Congratulations again. Thank you.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you, Brian.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser of UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So, if we roll back the clock, a year ago you were guiding to an implied comp of around flattish. You did north of a 5.6%. What did better from a product category side from the Switch to drive that performance? Or was it just you gained much more share than you were assuming at that point?","And how does that frame potential upside from a product category perspective for this year? And as part of that question, maybe you can talk about what do you think is more important for the business, product cycles or the overall health of consumer spending, because maybe some of the product cycles might fade this year, but the overall spending environment might pick up. Thank you.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you so much, Michael. I want to use this opportunity to convey a key thought. Yes, there's product cycles, and we love product innovation because we have this unique ability to commercialize new technology. What is driving the increased performance is not a particular \u2013 with the exception of gaming, which we always have ups and downs. It's not a particular product, it's in the context where consumer confidence is good. I think we estimate the overall market for technology products in calendar 2017 was flattish, so better than negative, but not overly positive. What's driving the result is, it's our strategy and our execution.","Our positioning as a company that can address customer needs and truly help them achieve what they're trying to do in their life and then provide the support along the way, the quality of the execution, the increasing gap in our \u2013 and uniqueness of what we do for customers is really what we think is driving the performance. And this is also what is positioning us.","From a product standpoint, yes, gaming was helpful. Equally important is, of course, in retail, you always have to look at what happened last year. So, last year, in the fourth quarter, we had the product availability issues. So, that is certainly boosting our Q4 and total year performance. And this won't happen \u2013 once you've anniversaried that, it doesn't happen again. But I want to convey that increasingly, we're trying to build this moat, and there will be new product introductions, but it's the strategic positioning that's really helpful.","Now underneath this, every year the booming products will evolve. So, this year we've had gaming. I think smart home has been helpful. Home appliances has been helpful, and some of these things will fluctuate and will ride these waves. But again, it's this emphasis on the uniqueness of the strategic positioning. Corie, any details you want to add?","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","The only thing that I would add is, if you went back and looked at the category drivers for each of the last four quarters, you would see that, of course, we've called out gaming and we've been very explicit. But under gaming, it has been a rotating mix of categories that we've gained share in and that are very reflective of our positioning.","Computing has come up multiple times. Home theater has come up. Smart home, as we brought those products to bear, and I think that just underlines what it is Hubert was saying that it's not just things spike when there's product launches. These have been categories that have been called out for quarter after quarter after quarter of excellent performance. And I think that underlies (44:41) the feeling and data and evidence that we have that the strategy is taking hold in terms of the shopping experience.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Okay?","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","Hi. It's Dan Binder. Thank you. My question was \u2013 congratulations by the way on a great quarter.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","My question was centered around the services business, the rollout, the pressure on gross margins and maybe a starting point, could you give us a sense of the International gross margin erosion? How much of that was from the services rollout specifically? And why, when you do it in the U.S., won't it be as significant as what we've been seeing in Canada? And finally, with the impact that you did give us, can you help us understand what you think the sales benefit is?","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","So, I'll start with answering your question from a customer standpoint, and then Corie will add color on a profit basis. So, what is exciting in what's happening here is the customer response to some of our initiatives. In-Home Advisor, I think, can be characterized as a service initiative, but recognizing there is no revenue attached to this. But this is a consultative approach in the home to help customers and address their needs where we really like how it's been framed. We like the customer response, and we'll gradually increase that. The benefit of this initiative is in product sales, unlocking demand and building relationships.","Total Tech Support is equally exciting. It complements in a way the upfront consultative approach In-Home Advisor with the ongoing support across all of the customers' portfolio. The fact that we've decided to roll this out in the spring in the U.S. is a clear sign.","Corie will go through the mechanics of some of the profitability. We see Total Tech Support, number one, as a service offering with its own P&L, but also as a part of the flywheel we're trying to build, building an end-to-end relationship with the customers, so we like the customer response on this one. From a profit standpoint, Corie?","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","All right, Dan. I'll do my best to parse this apart. Let me start with International. In the International business, the gross profit compression is about half services and about half other product things that we called out on the walk. And so it's not all, to be clear, the Total Tech Support offer.","I'm going to take one step back, Hubert talked about this a little bit. But remember, we rolled one version in Canada, and that is a monthly-pay version that has various attributes set up with it. We've tested a few different versions here in the U.S. in 200 stores, so a pretty wide breadth in our test. And ultimately, as we said in the prepared remarks, we're going to go with an annual plan that you pay for up front here in the U.S. So, it's a different plan, and we've seen just slightly different results here in the U.S. even than what we saw in Canada.","As to Hubert's point, we like the customer demand. We like the customer experience, and so all of that is hanging. The change in the model here is that it's a recurring revenue relationship model. So, you incur more expense up front, right, at the point that someone purchases is they often get value up front, but you're going to amortize and recognize that revenue over time. And so the first year, that creates a little bit of imbalance. But what we really like about it is that as people stay on the plan over time, it becomes much more accretive into the out-years.","And so to your question about revenue lift, it's not as much in year one because you have that amortization over time impact, but as you get out into the out-years, years two and three and we start to think about bringing the longer-term strategy to life, this becomes a nice accretive model over time. And it's why we want to start with what is it customers want. We hear they want support and then how do we build that model to give them that across all their devices over time.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","Thanks.","Operator","We'll go ahead with our next question from David Schick of Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead. David Schick, your line is open.","David A. Schick - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Hi there. Can you hear me okay?","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, David.","David A. Schick - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay, great. Thanks so much for the question. I want to go back to something Hubert just said about commercializing technology. And I realize in any quarter, there's discrete items, plus or minus. But the general lift, could you characterize what's going on as more about early adopters getting very involved in 4K and more TVs and smart home and services? Or is this the beginning of everybody else? I'm not sure which would lead to longer and better growth. It might be the same, the answer, but just to understand where we are in this wave as you sort of position for that.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you, David. Let me distinguish the market and then our growth. The market, in general, is driven by this overall technology innovation we're seeing. In our lives, technology is more and more pervasive. The number of items that are technology enabled in our homes keeps going up. Of course, early adopters play a role there. But the overall market as near as we can tell is really difficult to measure from a hardware standpoint. The overall market seems flattish.","What is happening in driving our revenue is actually not so much that, but what we do with it. So, it's the question of how do we take advantage of this. If I take the TV home theater segment, our teams have played a key role working with the vendors on the definition and then introduction of 4K technology. And I remember there was a debate one or two years ago about at some point, will Best Buy surrender market share to the mass channel. So, I'm going to paraphrase a famous politician, we will never surrender.","And what we are seeing is that because of the continued innovation and the way we are able to merchandise both online, in the stores, support customers, we're continuing to get market share. And so there can be a notion of these fast cycles and sometime it's true. The tablets went up quickly and then down. But if you take the TV category or the computing category or the smart home category, there's continuous innovation, so it's not an up and then down.","And then we are able to gradually gain share over time. We do have a focus from a customer standpoint on a segment, which we call the high-touch tech fans, so people who like technology and need help with us, good news is that's a lot of us, it's not just early adopters. And that's how we take advantage of this. So, I hope it helps because that's still \u2013 a core to the strategy we're pursuing is take advantage of the assets we have to help customers and expand our business on that basis.","David A. Schick - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And we will go ahead...","Mollie O'Brien - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","We'll go ahead with our next question from Greg Melich of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Thanks. I'd love to \u2013 first, congrats, a great quarter and executing is huge like that.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC","On the tax reform, my rough estimates here are that it's about $180 million, maybe $200 million a year savings from what your tax rate used to be to the 25%. And I just want to frame it, are we thinking about, say, roughly half of that now going with CapEx acceleration? And then given the flat guidance \u2013 given the top-line growth for margin, that maybe $50 million is going in some margin investment, given all the things you're doing. Is that a fair way to look at it when you think about how much of the tax gains you're keeping, so to speak, versus what's going back into the business or the income statement?","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you, Greg. I think your characterization of the annual tax savings is absolutely in the ballpark. In terms of how we are using that, we're not providing a breakdown. What is exciting, I think, is that we're able to have every one of our stakeholders benefit from this. So, clearly, we're investing in the employees of the company. We've talked about investments in additional benefits in specialty labor. We'll continue \u2013 skills and talent is key to our winning in this space, so we'll continue to invest in that. We're investing in the customer experience and all of the enablers and then, of course, the shareholders are benefiting as well.","What I particularly find exciting is that while we are clearly accelerating our investments, we are able to maintain, on a comparable basis, a flat OI rate. And so it was a lot of debate actually throughout the country of how much investments-related tax savings would actually deteriorate the operating income rate. In our case, we're able to accelerate the investments, do what we need and maintain the OI rate. How is that possible? Because of the efficiencies we're driving throughout the business and, of course, the return from these investments.","So, we're not providing a detailed breakdown. I think some of the estimates you had were correct. But what I want to highlight is that despite the acceleration of investments, we're maintaining a flat OI rate. We're not deteriorating the OI rate in this phase of accelerated investments.","Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Feldman of Telsey Group. Please go ahead.","Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Yeah. Hi, good morning guys, and again congratulations on the strong quarter.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Wanted to ask about the online business. I know it was another good quarter, but just compared to the annual growth rate, it did slow a little bit. And I was just wondering if it was just because of the big comparison. Or is there anything else you're seeing there? And I know you touched on a couple of the new ideas or initiatives in the online business. If you could maybe just dive into those a little bit more in detail, that'd be great.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Yeah. So, I'll start. The size of Q4 is massively larger in our online business. And just from a seasonality perspective, this is typically what you see in the seasonality of our online growth. The top-line growth number falls back just a bit. But in terms of the percent of the business, that 20% of the business, that percent of business has continued a pretty steady march quarter to quarter to quarter to quarter. So, there wasn't anything that changed. It's just a little bit of the seasonality of the business.","And what's really important and what we like to call out is that conversion was a key driver for us, which means it's not just pushing more traffic to the website that we love to do that, it is once the traffic is there the experience is so much meaningfully better that you're actually converting more customers. And that's why in the examples that we gave you around kind of the natural language search capability, that is \u2013 the last thing you want to do is bounce someone away from your website. And what do people do the minute they come to your website? They search and they search using whatever is in their heads. You search for a quiet dishwasher because that's what's important to you.","And while that seems really basic, being able to pick up on those natural language cues and then give you assorted list of answers that exactly address your concern, it seems very nuanced. It's a huge deal because the faster I can get someone at the end of the day to that product that they're looking for with the closest match to their natural language request, the more the likelihood they're actually going to flow through on that purchase. And so the examples we gave you are all about that \u2013 a real end-to-end customer experience through the website and taking away as much friction as possible when someone comes to visit us.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Let me quickly add two or three things. One, with this growth rate of 18%, we believe we're getting market share online. Number two, what matters to us and probably to our investors is the overall growth rate of the company. Number three, if you do the math, you would conclude that in Q4 and for the full year, on a four-wall basis, so excluding in-store pickup and ship from store, are (57:51) stores at a very nice comp both for the full year and in Q4.","Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","That's great. Thank you, guys. Good luck with this quarter.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And your final question will come from the line of Christopher Horvers of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, good morning and phenomenal quarter.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","In thinking I had two questions. So, as you think about the first quarter guide, I know Best Buy likes to be very conservative in terms of their outlook. But if I recall, there was strength more in the back half of the quarter on the Switch and I think the Galaxy and you're guiding to a pretty sharp deceleration on a one- and two-year basis. So, can you talk about that rationale? Are you seeing sharp slowdowns after a 9% in the fourth quarter?","And then as a follow-up, the gross margin benefit from the price erosion efforts at the store, that seems new. Is that something that will continue as you look out into the first three quarters of this year until we sort of lap it? Thank you.","Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Sure. So, I will try to handle those. In terms of the deceleration into Q1, you actually teed up very nicely, Chris. It was a volatile quarter last year, started quite slow, ended quite strong. And so we're thoughtful about that as we try to phase out the quarter. This is less about anything I'm seeing in this exact moment, and it's more about the things I called out in the script.","One is the flat-out timing, and we said it, you had $100 million of iPhone revenue that pushed into Q4. And then you also had $100 million associated with the Super Bowl shift that pushed into Q4. So, that means those were things that were disproportionately heavy in Q4 and then would have taken actually revenue out of in the Super Bowl shift example, Q1. So, those are just real and that's about $200 million between those two that isn't comparable between the two quarters.","The second is gaming, you called it out, you have to remember Switch launched last year in March. And so we are going to start lapping that and then obviously, you also called out the Galaxy which \u2013 always the timing of the launch is just a little bit different. So, those are the biggest thing \u2013 and then the last thing I would call out is that some of the general product availability issues we had in Q4 last year eased as we came into Q1.","And so you just don't have that same lap that you had in Q1. I would also make sure that I call out, we talked about some of the operating income rate pressures. If you adjust it for that Super Bowl shift and the legal settlement that we had, our operating income rate would be roughly flat year-over-year on that Q1 guide. And so I want to make sure I'm clear about that, that moving that Super Bowl week out of Q1 has a pretty large impact overall both revenue and operating income on the quarter.","To your second question on the price erosion, the store teams have been working on this for a while. We said that a disproportionate amount of that actually flowed through straight into Q4. We'll have a little bit going forward, but not nearly as much as I think some of the benefit that we saw out of the back part of last year.","Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.","Very good. I'm conscious of time. I want to thank all of you for your attention, your support and your kind words. It's true that this is an exciting time at the company. We see the opportunities ahead. I want to make sure I do a good job of giving credit to our associates who are delivering amazing performance for our customers. You guys rock. Have a good day.

I will begin today with a review of our second quarter performance and provide an update on our progress as we continue to implement Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue strategy. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and our outlook.","We are happy to report strong top and bottom line results for the second quarter that exceeded our expectations. We grew our Enterprise comparable sales by 6.2% and we delivered non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.91, which is up 32% compared to last year.","The top-line performance was broad-based with positive comparable sales across all channels, geographies and most product categories. Our strong revenue growth was helped by the favorable environment in which we operate and driven by how customers are responding to the unique and elevated experience we\u2019re building. We are particularly encouraged with the continued progress of our Net Promoter Scores and our continued market share gains.","We also saw our second quarter non-GAAP operating income rate expand by 20 basis points to 3.8%, this fits with our guidance for flat operating income rates for the year, driven by our ability to drive cost take out that helps offset investments and pressures in the business. So, I want to thank all of our associates across the Company for their hard work in delivering these great results.","So, we\u2019re pleased with the strength of our financial performance. We\u2019re also excited about the progress we\u2019re making as we execute our Best Buy 2020 strategy which entails expanding what we sell and evolving how we sell.","Let me provide a few highlights, starting with our acquisition of GreatCall. Earlier this month, we announced our intent to acquire GreatCall, a leading connected health services provider for aging consumers. GreatCall offers easy to use mobile products and connected devices tailored for seniors. These are combined with a range of services including a simple one touch connection to U.S. based specially-trained agents who can connect the user to family caregivers, provide concierge services and dispatch emergency personnel.","Our acquisition of GreatCall is exciting for five reasons. First, it is right in line with our strategy. Our purpose as a Company is service to enrich lives through technology by addressing key human needs. One of these needs we highlighted during our Investor Day meeting last September is health and wellness, the space we\u2019ve decided to expand into with a focus on aging consumers and how technology can help them live a more independent life.","Second reason, the health market is an exciting space, especially as it relates to seniors. There are approximately 50 million people over the age of 65, a number expected to grow by more than 50% within the next 20 years. Helping this fast-growing population live longer in their homes, provide significant benefits not only for seniors and their families, but also for payers and providers.","Third reason, we\u2019re acquiring a great company. GreatCall is a profitable, growing, recurring revenue business that already has more than 900,000 paying subscribers and more than $300 million in annual revenue. They have an established expertise in serving the aging population and their caregivers and they have a strong management team and a culture that is well aligned with Best Buy\u2019s.","Fourth reason, we see significant value-creation opportunities, driving an attractive return on investment. The combination of their products, services, and expertise with Best Buy assets, including our merchandising, marketing, sales and service capabilities, provides the opportunity to both scale their existing consumer business and pursue commercial opportunities with payers and providers.","Finally, we believe this acquisition can be a beachhead for Best Buy in the health space, providing the entry point to more growth opportunities.","We expect to close this transaction by the end of the third quarter. We anticipate the impact on our non-GAAP earnings to be neutral this year and next year as we invest in the business and accretive to earnings by our fiscal \u201821.","The second highlight of the quarter is the rollout of our new Total Tech Support program. We launched the program nationally at the end of May and we\u2019re pleased with the initial results. Our retail teams are very engaged and excited about the program. And customer sign-ups are in line with our expectations. From a financial standpoint, the impact of the rollout on our domestic gross profit was in line with the expectation we shared last quarter.","As a reminder, for $199 per year Total Tech Support members get unlimited Geek Squad support online via chat, in-stores in the palm of their hands with the new Best Buy home app. All their technology is covered, no matter where or when they bought it, as we believe that support should not be limited to a specific product and that the customer need is to have all their technology work together. Members also receive free internet security software and discounts on in-home services and purchases of annual Geek Squad protection and AppleCare service plans. We are working on additional capabilities as we continue to advance the program. And we believe our current rollout is just the beginnings in terms of the benefits we will offer members over time. I think, you\u2019ll all be happy to know that you will be able to purchase A Total Tech Support membership as a gift for someone else this holiday season, which is something customers have been asking us for.","A third highlight of the quarter is the launch of the first Fire TV Edition smart TV that\u2019s part of our product development partnership with Amazon. This partnership is a great example of how we are leveraging our expertise and unique merchandising, marketing and sales assets to help leading technology companies commercialize their new products. As a reminder, the TVs are available only in Best Buy stores on bestbuy.com and on Amazon.com through Best Buy as a third-party seller. We\u2019re planning to launch additional models in September and October.","A fourth highlight of the quarter has been the rollout of our new brand rallying cry: Let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s possible. The rollout included training sessions or brand rallies across the Company including our stores. Each store dedicated significant time on a Saturday in June to immerse all store associates in the new rallying cry. The rallying cry and the related guiding behaviors which are Be Human, Make It Real, and Think About Tomorrow, are resonating strongly with our associates and are a source of inspiration for all of us.","In line with this, the fifth highlight of the quarter is the continuing progress of the proficiency of our associates and of the quality of our execution across channels that is driving enhanced Net Promoter Scores and revenue growth. The level of knowledge of our sales associates and their focus on addressing the needs of our customers in a helpful and inspiring fashion is exciting to watch. In fact, I\u2019m pleased to announce that according to the JD Power 2018 Appliance Retailer Satisfaction Study, Best Buy ranked highest in customer satisfaction amongst appliance retailers for the second year in a row.","Another highlight of the quarter is the continued expansion of our In-Home Advisor program. Based on the strength of demand, we\u2019ve increased the number of advisors from 300 in September last year at the beginning of nationwide launch to more than 430 at the end of the second quarter. As a reminder, our In-Home Advisors provides free in-home consultations to help customers address their needs across our full range of products and services. The goal of the program is that the initial consultation is the beginning of a deeper and more relationship-based experience with Best Buy over the long term. Like our Total Tech Support offer, we are early in the journey and expect the program to continue to improve and mature as our advisors are in their roles longer and master with our sophisticated skills, and as we further enhance the sophistications of the tools and systems that help them do their job.","In addition, we\u2019re continuing to use technology to improve and streamline the online buying experience for our customers and to bring together the advantages of our various channels in a way that is intuitive to customers.","As a result, based on the data we have, we believe we are continuing to gain market share online. And while are of course focused on continuing to drive online revenue, we are more and more focused on how to build deeper relationships and drive total revenue from customers. We are pleased with our overall revenue growth and the progress we are making on continuing to improve the customer experience across all the ways our customers want to engage with us. For example, to further improve the buy online pickup in store experience, our mobile app home screen will display the order ID barcode when an online order is ready for pickup in a store, reducing the amount of time the customer has to spend at the pickup counter. Another example is related to improving the research process. Customers perform research in stores by scanning product tags and getting information and reviews. However, they often lose track of products discounts once they leave the store. And so, we\u2019ve added a feature called scan history to the Best Buy app to retain customer\u2019s product scan and scan to compare history so that they can reference it and continue research after leaving the store.","So, as we implement our Best Buy 2020 strategy and in support of expanding we sell and evolving how we sell as I just outlined, we\u2019re continuing to invest in a range of enablers across technology, people and supply chain. Specifically, we\u2019re continuing to invest in areas such as specialty labor, enterprise customer relationship management, knowledge management capabilities, and our new service platform.","In the supply chain area, we are investing to increase capacity, further increase speed of delivery and drive efficiency. As an example of this, we recently opened a new distribution center in Compton, California. Compared to the old center we were leasing in Chino, California, the new distribution center is wholesale to consumers with 50 million consumers within 50 miles. This center has significantly more capacity for our growing large cube categories like large appliances and large TVs. And as a result, we\u2019ve seen significant improvements in our productivity and home delivery Net Promoter Scores. We\u2019re also using a section of this 600,000 square foot facility to build out a completely new automated system that will facilitated faster and more efficient online order delivery to the local metro area as well as the whole West Coast.","To help offset our investments and pressures in the business, we continue our long-standing diligence on increasing productivity and decreasing cost. Our current target established in Q2 of last fiscal year is $600 million in additional annualized cost reductions and gross profit optimization to be completed by the end of fiscal \u201821. During the second quarter, we achieved approximately $70 million in additional annualized reductions, bringing the cumulative total to $375 million towards our goal.","So, looking ahead. As a result of the strong performance in the first half of year and our updated expectations for the back half, we are raising our full year sales and earnings guidance. We now expect fiscal 2019 comparable sales growth of 3.5% to 4.5% versus our original guidance of flat to 2% and we are raising our expectations for our non-GAAP diluted EPS to a range of $4.95 to $5.10 versus our original guidance of $4.80 to $5. We continue to expect an approximately flat non-GAAP operating income rate of 4.5% for the year. Corie will provide further details on our outlook for the full year and Q3.","You\u2019ll note that the profile of the next two quarters is not completely linear as we\u2019re expecting an operating income rate decline in Q3 followed by an increase in Q4 to result in an approximately flat rate for the year. Typical to the past several years, we remain focused on managing the business for long-term success rather than ensuring the straight line quarterly margin performance.","In conclusion, we are very excited about the opportunities in front of us, enriching lives with technology and providing services and solutions that solve real customer needs and build deeper customer relationships and the related value-creation opportunities that this entails. So, I want to reiterate how much I appreciate the leadership, passion, talent, ingenuity and hard work of our associates across the Company. You are making it all possible.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our CFO, Corie Barry for more details on our Q2 performance and our fiscal 2019 guidance.","Corie Barry","Good morning, everyone.","Before I talk about our second quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter.","On Enterprise revenue of $9.4 billion, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.91, both of which exceeded our expectations. We saw better than expected top-line results across multiple categories, with home theater, gaming, health and wearables and mobile phones being the largest drivers. Our gross profit rate was in line with our expectations, whereas our SG&A rate was favorable due to the higher revenue combined with slightly lower than expected spend.","I will now talk about our second quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 4.9% to $9.4 billion, primarily due to the comparable sales increase of 6.2%. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.22 or 32% to $0.91. This increase was primarily driven by an $0.08 per share benefit driven by a lower non-GAAP effective income tax rate and $0.08 per share benefit from the net share count change and the flow through of higher revenue.","Our comparable sales growth of 6.2% included a 150 basis-point benefit from the calendar shift. As we discussed last quarter, our reported comparable sales are computed on like-for-like fiscal week and are not shifted to more closely aligned calendar week following last year\u2019s 53-week year. For the remainder of the year, in Q3, we expect the calendar shift to have a negative impact of approximately 70 basis points on our reported comparable sales and in Q4 we expect a positive impact of approximately 50 basis points.","In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 4.4% to $8.6 billion. This increase was primarily driven by a comparable sales increase of 6%, partially offset by the loss of revenue from 292 Best Buy Mobile and 17 large-format store closures in the past year. From a merchandising perspective, the largest comparable sales growth drivers were home theater, computing, appliances, gaming, mobile phones and smart home. These drivers were partially offset by declines in our digital imaging and tablet category.","Domestic online revenue of $1.21 billion was 14% of domestic revenue compared to 13.2% last year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 10.1% on top of 31.2% growth in the second quarter of last year, primarily driven by higher conversion and increased traffic.","Let me take a minute to provide a couple of additional points on this topic. As Hubert said, we are pleased with our overall revenue growth and the progress we are making on improving the customer experience. We believe based on the most recent data we have, we are continuing to gain market share online. Regarding our online comp specifically, I would add that the consumer electronics category is a more mature online category than several other retail categories, with customer buying patterns moving online earlier than most.","As many of you know, we have been focused on our multi-channel capabilities and have been investing heavily for several years. For example, we have been offering our customers the option to buy online and pickup in store for more than 10 years, and all our stores have been shipping product to fulfill online orders since the beginning of 2014. In the last five years, we have doubled our online sales and on an annual basis, they are now approximately 15% of our total domestic sales.","Now, back to our Q2 sales results. In our International segment, revenue increased 10.8% to $740 million. This was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 7.6%, driven by both Canada and Mexico, incremental revenue associated with six new large-format store openings in Mexico over the past year, and approximately 60 basis points of positive foreign currency impact.","Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise gross profit rate decreased 30 basis points to 23.8%. The Domestic gross profit rate was 23.8% versus 24% last year. The rate decline of approximately 20 basis points was driven primarily by higher supply chain costs from both, investments and higher transportation expense as well as the national rollout of our Total Tech Support offer. Both of these were in line with the expectations we shared last quarter of approximately 25 basis points of pressure each. These pressures were partially offset by higher overall product margin rate, which included the benefit of our gross profit optimization initiative.","From a category perspective, increases in the smart home and appliance categories were partially offset by rate pressure in mobile phones and computing. The international non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 200 basis points to 23.1%, primarily due to a lower year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada, driven by lower rates in the home theater and mobile phone categories.","Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise SG&A was $1.88 billion or 20% of revenue, which increased $47 million but decreased approximately 50 basis points versus last year. Domestic SG&A was $1.71 billion or 19.8% of revenue versus $1.67 billion or 28.2% of revenue last year. The $43 million increase was primarily due to growth investments, which include specialty labor, higher depreciation expense, and higher variable costs due to increased revenue. These increases were partially offset by cost reductions and lower incentive compensation.","The specialty labor investments include additional dedicated labor in areas such as In-Home Advisor, appliances, and smart home. In addition, it also includes the impact of competitive wage and benefit investments we have made in relation to rising wage rates across the retail industry.","As we\u2019ve stated in prior quarters and on our investor day, increasing wage rates are an ongoing pressure in our business that we are balancing with a combination of returns from a new initiative and ongoing cost reductions and efficiencies.","International SG&A was $165 million or 22.3% of revenue, versus $161 million or 24.1% of revenue last year. The $4 million increase was primarily due to increased variable costs associated with higher revenue and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates.","On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate decreased to 25.4% from 32.6% last year. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate, as a result of tax reform.","From a cash flow perspective, we ended the second quarter in line with our expectations. We returned approximately $500 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.","As it relates to our acquisition of GreatCall, we plan to use existing cash for the $800 million purchase. The acquisition of GreatCall is not expected to impact our previously communicated plan to spend $1.5 billion on share repurchases this fiscal year.","I would not like to talk about our annual and Q3 guidance. As Hubert mentioned, we are raising our full year guidance for revenue and EPS to reflect the outperformance in the first half of the year and our expectations for the back half. For the full year, we are now expecting the following: Enterprise revenue in the range of $42.3 billion to $43.7 billion; Enterprise comparable sales increase of 3.5% to 4.5%; non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 4.5%, which is flat to fiscal 2018\u2019s rate on a 52-week basis; non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $4.95 to $5.10, an increase of 12% to 15%, this represents an increase of 17% to 21% when compared to fiscal 2018 on a 52-week basis; a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 24.5% and capital expenditures of approximately $850 million.","There are assumptions in our annual guidance that I would like to remind you of. We continue to expect the Best Buy Mobile small-format store closures to negatively impact revenue by approximately $225 million, with flat to slightly positive impact on our operating income. Our investments, in particular in specialty labor, supply chain, and increased depreciation related to strategic capital investments and ongoing pressures in the business, including approximately $40 million of lower profit share revenue in the fourth quarter will be partially offset by a combination of returns from new initiatives and ongoing cost reductions and efficiency. Specifically, the higher supply chain costs from increased investments and higher transportation expense are expected to pressure the domestic gross profit rate by approximately 25 basis points. The national rollout of Total Tech Support is expected to pressure the domestic gross profit rate by approximately 15 to 20 basis points. Also, our guidance reflects lower annual incentive compensation expense in the fourth quarter as at the beginning of the year we reset our performance target to align with our 2019 expectations.","Finally, our guidance does not reflect any impact from the GreatCall acquisition, as we are pending close of the deal. As Hubert stated earlier, we expect the impact of the acquisition to be neutral to our non-GAAP earnings in fiscal 2019. As Hubert also mentioned earlier, the quarterly composition in terms of year-over-year operating income rate performance is not linear and we expect more pressure on our operating income rate in Q3 than the other quarters in the year. I would note that this is consistent with how we saw the composition of the quarter\u2019s unfolding at the beginning of the year.","Our Q3 outlook is as follows: Enterprise revenue in the range of $9.4 billion to $9.5 billion; comparable sales growth of 2.5% to 3.5%; Domestic comparable sales growth of 2.5% to 3.5%; International comparable sales growth of 2% to 4%; non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.79 to $0.84; a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 25%; and our diluted weighted average share count of approximately 281 million shares.","A few additional comments specific to our third quarter guidance. As I mentioned earlier, the calendar shift is estimated to negatively impact Q3 domestic comparable sales by approximately 70 basis points. We expect to see our gross profit rate pressured due to the following. One, approximately 30 basis points of gross profit pressure from supply chain, including increased investments as well as higher transportation costs; two, approximately 20 basis points from the rollout of Total Tech Support as we incur costs as members tend to repeat services and discounts immediately when they join the program while we recognize the related revenue equally over 12 months; and three, while we experienced these pressures in Q2 as well, we partially offset them with better year-over-year merchandise margins including the impact of gross profit optimization initiative. As we knew in plan [ph] for when we entered the year, we are lapping a unique collection of benefits that occurred in Q3 of last year and thus do not expect as much merchandise margin expansion in Q3 of this year.","We expect the SG&A dollar growth rate to be in the low single digits. This is largely due to higher investments, particularly higher depreciation expense and specialty labor including investments in competitive wages and benefits. In addition, due to timing of incentive compensation accruals last year, we expect to see slightly higher incentive compensation costs in Q3 before the material year-over-year decline expected in Q4.","Finally, due to the calendar shift this year, which results in Q3 ending a week closer to the holiday season, we expect to end the third quarter with an inventory balance increase of approximately 18% compared to the third quarter of last year. On a like-for-like calendar basis, our Q3 ending inventory balance is expected to be up just slightly compared to last year.","I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question Michael Lasser from UBS.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot of for taking my question.","Hubert Joly","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Lasser","What the slope of growth in services going to look like from here? Should we expect that that particular comp rate should accelerate? And as that becomes a bigger piece of the business, how is that going to affect the gross margin over time?","Corie Barry","Yes. I\u2019ll start and then Hubert can add. And you were cutting out a little bit, but I think what you were looking for was the slope of the growth on services and how that could potentially impact the margin profile. Obviously pleased with the growth that we saw and reported in Q2. But most of that growth transparently is still coming from our more traditional warranty business. Obviously, we\u2019re starting to see revenue flow from the Total Tech Support offer, but that is as we\u2019ve talked about, amortized over 12 months, so takes a little bit longer to ramp.","We were excited about the trajectory of the business and believe especially as we get deeper into the growth trajectory of Total Tech Support that will help add some of that ongoing growth to the topline and the stability of the business. And so, we\u2019re not going to guide services in particular. But at the end of the day we like, and the subscriptions are right inline where we thought we would be at this point and they\u2019re going to start to add value, particularly as consumers still see value in the existing warranty portfolio that we offer in the business.","To your point on the margins specifically, as we delve deeper into and have more of that recurring relationship with our customers, that is certainly not harmful on a margin basis over time, but what\u2019s more important to us genuinely transparently is making sure that we\u2019re serving the customers and we\u2019re developing that longer term, stickier relationship with them. That\u2019s really what we\u2019re most focused on at this point.","Hubert Joly","Yes. I was going to comment on that -- the Best Buy 2020 strategy, as strong solutions and services orientation, but it is not always translated into service revenue. And a clear example of that is the In-Home Advisor program. As I said on the call and as you know, the first visit is free and then and it results in sale into products and some services revenue. The broader orientation is really focusing all of our activities on the customer needs and building the relationship with the customer. The biggest opportunity is in the expansion of our share of wallet of our existing and prospective customers, which is still today around 25%, 26%, as we discussed at our Investor Day. So, while we report and track services revenue, the strategy is much bigger than this particular line in revenue breakdown.","Michael Lasser","And Hubert, I have one more question for you. Given the healthy results that the vast [ph] merchant achieved in the consumer electronics category this quarter, is this the point in the cycle where there is going to be a handoff from the specialty channel to the mass channel? And if not, why is this time different?","Hubert Joly","So, again, you\u2019re cutting a little bit in and out. I think you were asking about whether we intend to have a handoff of our business to the mass channel. The clear answer is absolutely not. We noted, like everyone else, the strong results of number of other retailers including in the category. Bear in mind that everybody\u2019s business is different in terms of mix. So, depending on their category and the quarter, the headline number can be high. But, we note that we continue to gain market share across all of the categories that we compete in. And there is absolutely no intension to have a handoff. We are polite and sort of nice, but not to this point. We think that we are building an elevated and unique customer experience. If your customer that is excited about technology and is looking for help and support and a relationship, we are building something that\u2019s very, very special. And we feel it\u2019s working. So, I know in the past, there has been this idea that once technology matures, it goes to the mass channel and then we have to move on. That\u2019s not at all what we are seeing; that\u2019s not at all the intention. And we\u2019re very excited about the opportunities we have to build a very unique customer experience and deep sticky customer relationships.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matt Fassler","Thanks a lot and good morning. I\u2019d like a little more color on the comments you made on online and the maturation of online. Obviously, there is lots of nuance I\u2019m sure within that. Are there categories that are still growing at a rapid rate online? And is there ongoing innovation that you think could reignite elements of the categories you think about your e-commerce opportunity here?","Hubert Joly","Thank you, Matt. To be clear, we continue to very excited by online and all of the digital capabilities we\u2019re building for our customers. When I see how we\u2019ve evolved over the last 5 or 6 years, customer experience on the site and the app, the delivery, all of this, we look at things and I say, oh my God, our teams are really doing some great things. What we are referring to is a number of things. One is, as you will all appreciate, consumer electronics was one of the first categories that started to move online, and so the overall penetration is higher than in other categories. In fact, in our business, online is about 15% of our business. So, we\u2019ve doubled the business, we\u2019ve gone from $3 billion six years ago to now $6 billion.","You\u2019ll also note that we\u2019ve been a pioneer. I mean, we\u2019ve been doing in-store pickup for more than 10 years and we started ship from store in 2014. So, with our teams, we continue to be investing in the shopping experience, but the angle is shifting a bit and is in line with our Best Buy 2020 strategy, which is to build a broader customer relationship with our customers across all the touch points to use technology to improve the experience whether it\u2019s in research, whether it\u2019s in the shopping, whether it\u2019s in services with our Geek Squad, we\u2019re able to remotely help you with the support of your product.","So, on a category-by-category basis, there is some products when there is a hot game console that tends to fly off the shelf. It\u2019s really a well-known product and commodity. When it\u2019s a more complex buying experience, then the customers will appreciate having conversation, seeing the experience -- experiencing the products in the stores and so and so forth. So, I think yes, it\u2019s maturing, we\u2019ll continue to invest but it\u2019s a broader approach in the category. Corie, anything you\u2019d like to add, no? Okay. ","Matt Fassler","If there is an opportunity for a very brief follow-up within that context, the entertainment software business reaccelerated having declined in Q1 and outperformed the chain against the very tough compare. Any specific drivers of that category\u2019s bounce back?","Corie Barry","Yes. So, what we saw, there was some -- a little bit unexpected strength in gaming and a couple of facets on that. One, as we talked about before, we tend to over index on gaming consoles. And that is where we saw some particular strength across consoles. And secondarily, as we mentioned last quarter, we continue to see strength in some of the accessories and peripherals as games like and social games, in particular like Fortnite take off, there are accessories that tend to make that a more compelling gaming experience. And so, we saw a little bit better results even than we expected in that category.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning, guys. Can you please talk about your latest thoughts on the potential impact of tariffs and specifically how you view the price elasticity in the categories where you see risk?","Hubert Joly","So, there\u2019s been a number of waves tariff increases over the last several months, starting with select appliances, and then the $36 billion with China followed by another $14 billion with China at the rate of 25%. Those results in our guidance reflect the impact of these tariffs. Not surprisingly, when there is a price increase, there is an impact. And in that context, while we -- I\u2019m going to say, [indiscernible] the administration is doing some very important international trade goals, and these are difficult negotiations. We\u2019ve been in dialogue with them on how to minimize the impact on consumers, and you\u2019ve seen that in the $50 billion, the 36 plus 14, there is less consumer electronics products than originally contemplated. So, I think specifically it\u2019s been reported that the tariffs have had some impact on appliances during the first half of the year. It\u2019s not completely easy to measure, because a lot of the appliance purchases -- the stress situation where your fridge is broken, it\u2019s not a discretionary decision, which is why we\u2019re going to continue to be in close dialogue with the administration as we look ahead to minimize the disruption on the U.S. consumer and the U.S. economy.","Scot Ciccarelli","Are there specific areas in terms of price elasticity where to the degree that there is price increases that you\u2019re kind of forced to pass on where you don\u2019t think you can make it up in the velocity?","Hubert Joly","Yes. Specifically, the impact is going to be tightly linked to the gross profit margin rates on the products. When gross profit rate is very low, then -- let\u2019s say 25% -- let\u2019s say gross profit rate is 20% on that particular product, 25% increase in the tariff is going to essentially result in a 20% price increase. There are material members. On the other hand, anytime our gross profit rate is materially higher, so let\u2019s say 50%, then the impact, if we pass everything along is cut in half. And so, that\u2019s a key differentiator. Of course, it\u2019s also related to the ability of our vendors to observe the tariffs, and of course we are having negotiations, or over time, usually not in the short term but over time, to diversify the supply base. So, it\u2019s a complex undertaking. Of course, we are very much following this and ongoing dialogue continues as we want to be sensitive, and I know the administration is as well, to the impact on the American families, workers, schools, small businesses and so forth.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Chris Horvers","Thanks. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about the home theater strength that you saw in the quarter? Maybe parse out the share that you\u2019re seeing the there, unit growth versus ASP, and whether or not the Amazon partnership sort of lifted that comp as a result of Prime Day and the launch of the product?","Corie Barry","So, good morning, Chris. What we did see and what we like is very strong market growth, and leading to very strong consumer interest in the category. So, that is one of the most exciting things. Obviously, per what we can see in NPV, TVs were up double-digit growth in Q2. So, that is excellent. Also, similar to the industry and what we could see in the industry, units were up, while ASPs were down. We are lapping some pretty significant share gains from TVs last year. And we saw just a little bit of share decline, but honestly on the size of the industry strength, we saw very minimal and in fact less than we saw in Q1. So, we like the positioning, we\u2019re excited that the consumer is adopting it. And we\u2019ve always said, we\u2019d expect that our share gains moderate over time. We also said we wouldn\u2019t expect them to drop off a cliff and to completely off the business to Hubert\u2019s point. And so, we like that the consumer is excited, we like the amount of volume that we\u2019re seeing in the category and we very much like our positioning within it.","Chris Horvers","Understood. And then\u2026","Corie Barry","I\u2019m sorry, the part of your question. Let me make sure I hit on, you asked specifically about Amazon. Obviously, we\u2019re not going to comment on specific skews. But partnerships like this and the idea of interesting technology evolution continuing in categories like this, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s actually more important because I think this idea that we can showcase these technologies in unique way that no one else can, that\u2019s what\u2019s the real differentiator here. So, while I\u2019m not going to give you exactly what those skews delivered, certainly we like the idea being able to showcase this technology that no one else really can.","Chris Horvers","Understood. And then, help us think about the fourth quarter. It looks like your implied comp for the fourth quarter, based on the rates is sort of flattish, I think at the high end. So, can you just reflect back and talk about what last year what you thought was sort of one time in shift versus what you really think the underlying business will look like in the fourth quarter ex those shifts? ","Corie Barry","Yes. So, based on the comp deltas that we\u2019re seeing, and remember we have the 53rd week in Q4, so it gets a little tricky. The guide would imply a comp of basically flat to up 3%, somewhere in that range for Q4. And so, within that as we\u2019re lapping what we saw last year. Remember, last year we specifically called out some incredible strength in gaming, particularly due to the switch which we knew we would be comping against this year. And last year, we were comping against some of the product availability issues from the year prior, so two years ago. Those are the pieces that we\u2019ve factored out. And instead what we\u2019re looking at is we head into Q4 this year is some of that continued strength in those very four categories, smart home, computing, home theater, appliances, the places that we feel very strong about our positioning with the consumer and what we bring to the table.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Zack Fadem Wells Fargo.","Zack Fadem","To clarify on the tariffs on appliance prices in the quarter, it looks the category was up 10% in the U.S. but could you speak to the impact of pricing here versus unit sales? And with higher prices, have you seen any signs that demand could be softening or perhaps behavior is changing in favor of trade down in the category, anything like that?","Hubert Joly","We\u2019re of course very pleased to report, I think it\u2019s the 31 consecutive quarter of positive comps in appliances. We believe that the low double digits comparable reporting represents another market share gain in the category. It is true that in certain sub-segments, longer in particular, this is where you\u2019ve seen the price increase. And so, -- but it\u2019s -- appliance -- it\u2019s about a quarter maybe of the total category, so it\u2019s not the end of the world.","In terms of macro factors which is your question with what\u2019s happening in the housing and so forth, appliances are driven by new housing but also renovations and moves and so forth. So, we\u2019re watching the sector, but we\u2019re also watching the fact that as we discussed in previous quarters there is a significant change in the competitive landscape and significant tailwind from the competitive situation. And so, we believe revenue growth is principally driven by the continued strength in the category because it\u2019s fluctuate -- positive category. And the market share gains which themselves are driven by the competitive situation and the continued improvements we\u2019ve made in proficiency, the specialty labor investments we\u2019ve made, the supply chain investments we\u2019ve made and so forth. So, we continue to be upbeat and positive around this category as we move forward. We have talked about in addition to this, during Investor Day, about the favorable demographic aspects with the millennials finally leaving their parent\u2019s house and which leads them have to invest in all of the shiny objects we sell in our stores appliances and others as well. We continue to monitor this, but this is what we see at this point.","Zack Fadem","Thanks, Hubert. That\u2019s helpful. And with the national Total Tech rollout, could you speak to how your initial customer adoption trends compare to your test markets? And for the pilot markets where you\u2019ve now been there for more than a year, could you also comment on what you\u2019re seeing on the renewal rates there, and if you\u2019re seeing any easing of the initial gross margin pressure? Thanks. ","Hubert Joly","So, the sales activities are very consistent with the pilots in the U.S., even though of course during the pilots, we had a whole range of options, we were testing, but at the highest level, it\u2019s very consistent. In terms of the renewal rate, the pilot is not truly indicative at this point, because we did not have credit card on file as an option when we were initially piloting and we rolled this out as part of the national expansion. So, we\u2019re going to have to wait for longer to have the read of that. And I think as I said in the prepared remarks, the impact on gross profit is very much in line with the expectations we had indicated when we launched this. And the situation is different from that we have seen in Canada.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. ","Greg Melich","Hi, thanks. I have really one follow-up question and then one will little longer term. So, the longer term one I would say is about the cash flow. I think, Corie, you mentioned cash will be used for the acquisition. As you\u2019re thinking about next year, now that we\u2019re -- lots changes since the Analyst Day, how much cash do you want to run the business and how you\u2019re thinking about the dividend versus buyback structure and leverage ratio going into next year?","Corie Barry","Yes. So, obviously, I\u2019m not going guide at this point an exact cash balance. But, it\u2019s clear that we\u2019ve been working that cash balance down here over the last couple of years, in particular with some of the more aggressive buybacks and dividends. We\u2019re not going to guide next year at this point. We\u2019ll do that as we head in. But you can see that and especially us using cash on hand as well as for the acquisition of GreatCall that we continue to work that down to a place that we feel is not just suitable to run the business but suitable to help us in any large kinds of unexpected risk. And we\u2019ll continue to work that down. As it relates to our capital allocation strategy, we\u2019ve stayed very consistent with that, not just at Investor Day but prior to that where we\u2019ve said priority one is to invest in the business, whether that\u2019s in a form of the capital we\u2019re using internally or whether that\u2019s in the form of an acquisition like GreatCall. After that, the next priority being a premium dividend payer for our shareholders, and then finally returning excess cash through share repurchases. And that remains our strategy going forward. And we\u2019ll provide more clarity on exactly what that means for next year as we head in.","Greg Melich","Got it. And then, the follow-up is just to understand the comp a little better, the make-up of it, there has been a lot of talk of pricing and tariffs et cetera. Could you help us understand, of that 6% comp, how much would have been ticket growth as opposed to number of transactions, just maybe a mix or a balance of it?","Corie Barry","So, in the comps -- let me just take a big step back, broadly across our channels, what we saw was actually increases in traffic, increases in our transactions and increases in our close rate or our conversion if you think about it that way. So, when we meld all our channels together, and that\u2019s what\u2019s most important to us, that\u2019s what we saw across everything. And that\u2019s been a relatively consistent as we\u2019ve had last few quarters here. In terms specifically of tariffs, the super minimal at this point is you\u2019re basically talking about laundry where they\u2019ve been impacted or a few smaller categories. So, it\u2019s a tiny little slice; that is not going to be the driver at this point. More so, what we\u2019re excited about is that the underlying drivers across the channel have remained pretty consistent with good traffic, good conversion and therefore very nice transaction growth.","Operator","And our next question comes from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets.","Anthony Chukumba","Good morning and congrats on another very strong quarter against a very tough comparison. ","Hubert Joly","Thank you.","Anthony Chukumba","I wanted to just quickly touch based on the GreatCall acquisition. You mentioned some of the different opportunities to scale the business and engrave the business. I guess, I was wondering about Assured Living from two perspectives. One, how did your experience with Assured Living sort of informed the GreatCall acquisition? In other words, I would have seen that maybe you\u2019re happy with the results of the Assured Living and that\u2019s why you started to do the GreatCall acquisition. And then, two, how are you planning to integrate, if at all GreatCall with Assured Living? Thank you.","Hubert Joly","Let me start with the second part. We will be initially running GreatCall as a separate entity because it is a different business. We will be -- and we\u2019ve studied -- we have a number of, as you would expect, integration task forces, pursuing targeted value creation opportunities, in particular related to selling the existing products, like Jitterbug phones more aggressively, if I can put it this way, it\u2019s been in our stores for a long way but we both GreatCall and Best Buy teams feel, there is more that we can do there. So, it\u2019s going to be a separate business with targeted points of integration, targeted value creation opportunities.","Most of GreatCall\u2019s business today in these consumer products. They have a small but promising business that\u2019s another good Assured Living. And across both Assured Living and GreatCall, we believe we have a -- there is an exciting opportunity in this idea of monitoring the behaviors in health of seniors in their homes with potentially very significant benefit of course for the aging seniors, their caregivers as well as the payers and providers. Today, in both cases, this is a small business. We think the potential is material, which rests in part on the ability to demonstrate the solution as a material benefit, as I indicated. And we\u2019re going to be working together to see we go after this market. So, think in this area, small parallel tracks with a big opportunity down the road. ","Anthony Chukumba","Got it. And so, just one, not even a related follow-up question but just more of a comment. I\u2019m really glad to hear about Minnesota [indiscernible] but you\u2019re not going to give away all your market share to the mass market. So, good to hear.","Hubert Joly","How is that coming from a Frenchman who\u2019s been in Minnesota for 10 years, I\u2019m learning still the local practices.","Operator","And our next question comes from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America. ","Curtis Nagle","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, I just wanted to follow up a little on the growth in the home theater. So, as commented, it was a nice pickup, particularly in units. I guess, what\u2019s driving it? Is it interest in OLED, or HDR, continued trade up or something else that\u2019s caused the pickup?","Corie Barry","Yes. I think you\u2019ve got a couple of things going on. And we\u2019ve been talking about them for a while. I think speed of adoption has increased. And so, it\u2019s a combination of larger screen sizes, so the idea of more fits in the home and you have the very nice form factor that\u2019s coming with new TVs. And then secondarily, those being coupled with higher technologies, 4K, HDR, particularly in those spaces incredibly available now. And I think those two combined with price points now that have come down to a range that feels like more and more people are ready for adoption here. I think you just hit a bit of the sweet spot between those things. And again, it\u2019s part of why we said we feel uniquely well positioned, because when those become some of the important pieces, being able to see it and be able to really have a line of sight to how this will look in my home and exactly what technology I\u2019m buying is pretty important. But I think you just have this real sweet spot now between lot more size for the money, a great technology that fits behind it, things more 4K, HDR kind of technologies and at a price point that makes sense for my budget.","Curtis Nagle","Okay. That makes sense. And then, just a quick follow-up. Forgive me, if you gave this out already. But, what\u2019s the expectation for the free cash flow for the year?","Corie Barry","We haven\u2019t guided free cash flow specifically. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re kind of just updating you each quarter they come. But where we are now right now is exactly where we had expected to be at this point in the year.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our last question from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Keith","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Good quarter, guys. One, to just dig into the In-Home Advisor a little bit. You clearly ramped that up. Could you give us an update, if that\u2019s starting to move the needle on the same store sales, now that you\u2019re annualizing that rollout? And as a follow on, are there any categories where IHA is over-indexing to that that would might be able to see some of the outperformance working?","Corie Barry","Yes. Peter, we -- as you said, we continue to expand our IHA program and have done that as we said we always would, in line with the demand that we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace. Obviously, we\u2019re not going to give out exactly about the revenue associated with IHAs. But, you can be rest assured that it was both part of how we guided and part of over-achingly where we\u2019re seeing strength in the business.","In terms of categories where we tend to see strength, as we talked about before, home theater is a very nice lead into things that you want to do in your homes. But, we\u2019ve also seen some nice strength in what I\u2019ll call, broadly, smart home and networking, this idea that somebody can come in and help me figure out how these things work together, as well as a better foray into some of the appliance space where I can actually have someone physically help me walk through. And one of the hardest things about appliances is to figure out how to measure them. And so, when you have someone who is there to help you with what\u2019s to have, what\u2019s not, what exactly am I trying to get in the space, we\u2019ve also found that to be helpful. So, those -- as you would expect, those tend to be the leading categories. And now, we\u2019re just starting to get our arms around and building on a great feel for yet is as you use those as kind of your foray or your first run categories than what do you see over time in some of those more secondary categories. And we\u2019re still, like I said, learning in that space, but we like that. It\u2019s stretching across the home into a few of the different rooms and capabilities.","Hubert Joly","Very good. As we conclude this call, I want to thank you for your continued interest in your work on Company. And of course we have immense appreciation for the Best Buy teams across the business for what they do for customers and for our shareholders every day. You all have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"3581":["Best Buy Co.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 1:00 P.M. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions].","I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Mollie O'Brien","Thank you and good morning everyone. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our Chairman and CEO; and Corie Barry, our CFO.","During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful, can be found in this morning's earning release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com.","Some of the statements we'll make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial conditions, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.","Please refer to the company's current earnings release and our most recent 10-K for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.","As a reminder, the fourth quarter we are reporting today includes 13 weeks compared to last year's 14 week quarter. We estimate the extra week last year was approximately $760 million in revenue and approximately $0.20 of non-GAAP diluted EPS. Last year's extra week is excluded from our comparable sales calculations.","I will now turn the call over to Hubert.","Hubert Joly","Good morning everyone. And thank you for joining us. I will begin today with a review of our fourth quarter and our fiscal 2019 annual performance, will provide an update on our progress as we implement our Best Buy 2020, building the New Blue strategy. And I will discuss our priorities for fiscal 2020. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and our financial outlook.","But first, we are very proud of the financial results we've just delivered. In the fourth quarter we grew our Enterprise comparable sales by 3%, which is on top of 9% last year. We also expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate by 30 basis points and delivered non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.72, which is up 23% compared to last year excluding the extra week on a reported basis. Including last year's extra week, our non-GAAP EPS was up 12%.","On a full year basis, we grew our Enterprise comparable sales by 4.8% on top of 5.6% in fiscal 2018. This is the best two year stacked comparable sales in 14 years. We expanded our operating income rate approximately 10 basis points and grew our non-GAAP EPS by 26% on a 52 week comparable basis.","I note that with the annual revenue of $42.9 billion and non-GAAP operating income of $2 billion we just delivered, we essentially met our fiscal 2021 target provided at our Investor Day in 2017, two years earlier than we said we would.","From a capital allocation standpoint, we returned $2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And our non-GAAP return on invested capital now stands at 25.8% indicating that our formula of investments in our future, revenue growth and cost takeout is producing very attractive returns.","In addition to these strong financial results, during fiscal 2019, we also made significant progress implementing our Best Buy 2020 strategy to enrich lives through technology and further develop our competitive differentiation.","Let me provide some highlights starting with our customers. Our customers are noticing the improved experience we provide them as they interact with us digitally, in stores or in their homes. For the year, our Net Promoter Score increased more than 300 basis points and our brand love with our core customer segment also rose more than 300 basis points. We saw our customers increasingly interact with us across all of our channels, driving revenue growth in our stores, online and in our in-home channel. I note in particular that 22% of the domestic business in Q4 came through the online channel.","Our success with our customers is driven by the enthusiasm and the talent of our employees. Our employee engagement scores remain remarkably high, and we further reduced turnover rates in our stores to new record lows.","Strategically, we've made progress in expanding what we do for our customers and how we interact with them. Here are a handful of examples. The first example is the launch of our Total Tech Support program. Having a service that provides members unlimited Geek Squad support for all their technology no matter where or when they brought it is a compelling and unique value proposition for our members. We continue to be pleased with the customer enrollment and ended the year with more than 1 million members.","Another example is the expansion of our In-Home Advisor program. During fiscal 2019, we expanded the program from 300 to approximately 530 advisors and provided more than 175,000 free in-home consultations to customers across the nation. The revenue per order that we generate from these interactions continues to be much higher than in the store and online and it tends to have a higher gross profit rate as well due to the basket and higher attach rate of paid services.","Both employees and customers love it, the Net Promoter Score is high and the advisor employee turnover is low.","In health, we acquired a leading connected health services provider for aging consumers GreatCall and took a tangible step forward in our strategy to have seniors live longer in their homes with the help of technology. Since we acquired the company in October, the integration has been seamless and the value creation opportunities we envision have begun to materialize.","During fiscal 2019, we continued to elevate the customer experience around product fulfillment, enabled by the advancement of our supply chain transformation, for small products through a combination of initiatives including expanded partnerships and automation. We continue to improve our speed of delivery to customers and expanded next day and same day delivery options.","We now offer same day delivery on thousands of items in 40 metro areas and next day in 60 metro areas. And of course customers also have the option to pick up their products in our stores within one hour of placing their order.","For large products like appliances and TVs we expanded our distribution center capacity and brought locations closer to customers, which is driving significant improvements in the quality of our delivery and installation service.","In parallel to the customer experience work, we continued to drive efficiencies and reduced costs in order to fund investments and offset pressures. During fiscal 2019, we achieved $265 million in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies, bringing the cumulative total to $500 million since Q2 fiscal 2018. This is towards our fiscal 2021 goal of $600 million and since the launch of Renew Blue in 2012 we have now taken $1.9 billion of cost out.","In addition to these accomplishments, we're very proud of our progress in advancing our corporate social responsibility and sustainability efforts. In fact, we were just named number one on Barron's annual 100 Most Sustainable Companies list.","So in summary, we're very pleased with the results we are producing as we implement our Best Buy 2020 strategy and I so appreciate the hard work of our associates as well as our partners in driving these terrific results. And I want to recognize them publicly here.","So as we look forward, we are excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Before I say more about these, let me say a few words about the economic environment. There has been much discussion about the economy. I would note that the latest Bloomberg composite forecast which aggregates the basket of economic forecast, calls for consumer spending to increase 2.7% in 2019, which is similar to 2018 levels and another 2.1% in 2020. So on this basis we expect to continue to operate in a positive consumer environment in 2019.","Now beyond this, what drives our performance is primarily two factors, technology innovation and the relevance of our strategy and quality of our execution. In this context, we are excited by the opportunities related to technology innovation that has the potential to drive customer demand over the next several years. This kind of increases expanded penetration of existing technology, introduction of new technology in existing categories, and expansion of consumer technologies in new areas. Notably in existing categories like Home Theater, we see opportunities relating to increasing he penetration of large screen sizes 4K and OLED, and from the introduction of new technologies such as 8K.","In mobile, we see new technology innovation in areas like wireless power, security and accessibility. We're also excited to watch as foldable phones emerge over the next several months and of course we'll be actively participating in the rise of 5G, which has a potential to unlock very interesting used cases over the next several years.","In computing, the interest in gaming continues to accelerate and the performance necessary for this is driving innovation across both hardware and accessories.","We also see significant opportunities in Smart Home technology. Notably the US retail market size of Internet of things connected hardware is forecasted to triple by 2025. This growth is buoyed by products like Smart Home connected cameras, which according to a recent report from consulting firm Activate are expected to grow from 18% penetration of US homes in 2018 to more than 50% penetration by 2022.","We also believe that digital health is an exciting area with enormous opportunities from the use of technology to help customers with their health, fitness, sleep et cetera across multiple age groups from babies to seniors. As an illustration of the opportunity, the number of digital health exhibitors at the Consumer Electronics Show in January was up almost 25% versus last year. The next reason we're excited about the opportunities ahead of us is we believe the purpose driving our strategy is extremely relevant.","Our purpose is to enrich lives through technology by addressing key customer needs in areas such as entertainment, productivity, communications, food, security, and health and wellness. We are encouraged by the first steps we have taken in this direction and see the potential from expanding this focus to build deeper lasting customer relationships. In parallel to this, we continue to be excited by the potential for further cost reduction opportunities that can help us fund the investments in our strategy and offset pressures in the business.","Finally, I am particularly excited by the power of our incredibly talented people, who are engaged, customer-oriented and driven by our purpose and strategy. As you know, we've recently realigned senior roles, responsibilities and resources to better align with the strategy and we can already see this has a potential to accelerate our pace.","Altogether, this gives us the sense that now is the time to play offense to play to win and to accelerate our transformation both from a customer and revenue standpoint and from an efficiency standpoint.","So with this as a backdrop, let me talk about our priorities for fiscal 2020. At the highest level, our priorities to continue to transform the company in support of our purpose to enrich lives through technology by bringing to market solutions that solve real customer needs and by building customer relationships. As such, we will continue to expand what we do for customers.","So as it relates to Total Tech Support, we plan to grow the member base and improve the experience by adding new capabilities around self-service and proactive support. We will continue to expand our health business by scaling both the GreatCall consumer devices and services and the commercial monitoring service with a focus on the senior population.","As children of aging parents, many of us would appreciate the potential power of our health monitoring service that enables seniors to live longer in their homes, while reducing related healthcare costs. We're currently in pilots with a number of managed care organizations. And over time, we believe this could become a material growth opportunity for us.","Now we're not the only company who is interested in the digital health space but we believe our unique focus that combines our technology solution, our talent and our ability to go to people's homes, gives us a unique advantage.","In support of our strategy, we'll continue to work with our vendor partners in new and expanded ways that leverage our unique capabilities to meet the needs of our customers. For example, we\u2019ve partnered with several vendors to create offers for our Total Tech Support members and many partners are engaged and in line to train, support and create solutions for our In-Home Advisors.","In parallel, we will continue to evolve the way we interact with our customers. In the home channel, we will continue to expand our In-Home Advisor program including adding advisors and investing in tools to maximize their productivity. Our In-Home Advisor program is just one of the ways that we deliver experiences in the home today. And so we are developing a holistic home channel strategy to leverage all of the ways we currently interact with customers in the home to create meaningful relationships and further differentiate Best Buy.","From a digital standpoint, we'll continue to innovate and design multi-channel experiences that serve customer needs across our website, app and other channels in ways that continue to improve the experience across online and physical shopping. We will continue with our supply chain transformation, including using technology, automation and process improvements to expand fulfillment options, increase delivery speed and improve delivery and installation. And we will continue to enhance both the proficiency of our associates and optimize the way they work in order to get stronger to drive stronger customer relationships and fulfill our customers' unique needs.","In addition, as has been our brand over the last several years, we will keep driving cost reductions and efficiencies throughout the business. We've been on a run rate of more than $250 million in annualized reductions for the past two years. And we're not planning to slow down.","So in conclusion, we are energized by our results, our momentum and our opportunities as we implement our Best Buy 2020 strategy. As we look at our fiscal 2020 guidance specifically we\u2019re expecting comparable sales growth of 0.5% to 2.5%. This growth expectation is of course on top of the best two year stack in 14 years and reflects factors such as the anticipated cyclical slowdown of the console gaming category and the continued maturation of the mobile phone category. We are again planning to hold our operating rate -- operating income rate constant reflecting our focus on balancing investments in our strategy, processing the business and efficiencies.","We like the continued rate of technology innovation and the capabilities technology can bring to people's lives. We like our opportunity to offer customers a more consultative approach to truly address their needs, provide them an increasing range of services and solutions, expand our relationship with them and become a bigger part of their lives. And we particularly like the opportunities we have in the connected house space following the acquisition of GreatCall.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Corie for more details on our Q4 performance and our fiscal 2020 guidance.","Corie Barry ","Good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. On Enterprise revenue of $14.8 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.72. The EPS result exceeded our expectations and our revenue performance was at the high end of our guidance range.","From a product category standpoint, we saw better than expected comparable sales results in our wearable and gaming categories and lower than expected sales in mobile phones. Our operating income rate exceeded our expectations, primarily due to strong expense management.","I will now talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year. As Mollie stated, this year's fourth quarter included 13 weeks, which compares to last year's 14 week quarter. We estimate the extra week last year was approximately $760 million in revenue and approximately $0.20 of non-GAAP diluted EPS.","Enterprise comparable sales increased 3%. Revenue decreased 3.7% to $14.8 billion, primarily driven by the lapping of last year's extra week. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.30 or 12% to $2.72. This increase was primarily driven by: higher operating income, a $0.22 per share benefit from the net share count change and an $0.08 per share benefit driven by a lower non-GAAP effective income tax rate. These items were partially offset by non-GAAP diluted EPS of approximately $0.20 from the extra week last year.","As we expected and shared with you last quarter, our comparable sales growth of 3% included a positive 50 basis point impact from the calendar shift. As a reminder, our reported comparable sales are computed on like-for-like fiscal weeks and are not shifted to more closely aligned calendar weeks following last year's 53 week year.","In our Domestic segment, comparable sales increased 3% and revenue decreased 3.5% to $13.5 billion. This revenue decrease was primarily driven by lapping of last year's extra week and the loss of revenue from 257 Best Buy Mobile and 12 large format store closures in the past year. Partially offsetting these declines were the 3% comparable sales gains and revenue from GreatCall, which was acquired in our fiscal third quarter.","From a merchandising perspective, the largest comparable sales growth drivers were wearables, appliances, which include both major and small appliances, Smart Home and gaming. These drivers were partially offset by declines in our mobile phone category.","Domestic online revenue of $2.96 billion was 21.9% of domestic revenue compared to 20% last year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 9.3% on top of 17.9% growth in the fourth quarter of last year, primarily driven by higher conversion and increased traffic.","In our International segment, comparable sales increased 2.5% and revenue decreased 5.2% to $1.3 billion. The increase was primarily due to the lapping of last year's extra week, and approximately 470 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. The comparable sales increase was driven by both Canada and Mexico.","Turning now to gross profit, the Enterprise gross profit rate decreased 10 basis points to 22.2%. The Domestic gross profit rate was 22.1% versus 22.3% last year. The 20 basis point decline was driven primarily by an approximate 30 basis point negative impact from a lower periodic profit sharing benefit from the company\u2019s services plan portfolio and an approximately 30 basis point negative impact from higher supply chain costs, including both investments and higher transportation costs.","The impact of the profit share was worse than expected, and the higher supply chain costs were in line with expectations. These pressures were partially offset by: One, the impact of GreatCall\u2019s higher gross profit rate; Two, an improved gross profit rate in the services category, which included a refinement in the revenue recognition of the company's Total Tech Support offer; And three, improved products margin rate, which included the benefit of gross profit optimization initiatives.","Regarding the revenue recognition refinement, we now have sufficient history of member utilization of the program to move from recognizing revenue on a straight line basis over the membership contract to recognizing revenue on a usage basis, therefore, better matching the fulfillment cost with the revenue. This refinement of revenue recognition impacted new contracts created during our fiscal fourth quarter. This accelerated both revenue and gross profit recognition compared to our previous revenue recognition timing. This revenue recognition refinement was contemplated in the guidance we provided last quarter but the actual impact was slightly more favorable than we had estimated in our initial usage analysis.","The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 50 basis points to 22.9%, primarily due to a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada, which was driven by improved gross profit rates in several product categories and increased revenue in the higher margin rate services category. These improvements were partially offset by an approximate 30 basis point negative impact from a lower periodic profit sharing benefit and gross profit rate pressure in the mobile phone category.","Now turning to SG&A, Enterprise non-GAAP SG&A was $2.29 billion or 15.5% of revenue, which decreased $150 million and 40 basis points to last year as a percentage of revenue.","Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $2.08 billion, or 15.4% of revenue versus $2.22 billion or 15.8% of revenue last year. The $134 million decrease was primarily due to the lapping of last year\u2019s extra week and cost reduction. There were a number of other largely offsetting items as lower expenses associated with incentive compensation and stronger expense management were offset by: growth investments, which include specialty labor and higher depreciation expense; GreatCall operating expenses; and higher variable costs associated with increased revenue.","International non-GAAP SG&A was $207 million or 15.9% of revenue versus $223 million or 16.2% of revenue last year. The $16 million decrease was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and lapping the extra week last year, which were partially offset by higher payroll and incentive-related expenses in Canada and the impact of new stores opened in Mexico in the past year.","On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate decreased to 24.6% from 27% last year. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction in the US statutory corporate tax rate as a result of tax reform, partially offset by a larger benefit from the resolution of discrete tax matters in the prior year.","As a reminder, the lower statutory tax rate became effective on January 1st, and was applied to our full quarter this year compared to approximately one month in last year's comparable quarter.","From a cash flow perspective, we ended the year with a 4% higher inventory balance compared to last year, whereas our accounts payable increased 8%. The lower owned inventory position was primarily due to the timing of inventory receipts over the holiday season. In fiscal 2020, we will adopt a new standard for lease accounting. We anticipate the new standard will materially increase our assets and liabilities, but we expect it will have an immaterial impact on our net earnings.","As it relates to capital allocation, our approach has not changed. Our strategy is to fund operations and investments in growth, including potential acquisitions, and then to return excess free cash flow over time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, while maintaining investment grade credit metrics. We continue to target a non-GAAP dividend payout ratio between 35% and 45%.","This morning, we announced that we increased our quarterly dividend 11% to $0.50 per share, and provided an outlook for share repurchases of $750 million to $1 billion in fiscal 2020. We also announced that the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $3 billion, [replacing] the existing authorization from February 2017.","I would now like to talk about our full year fiscal 2020 financial guidance. Enterprise revenue in the range of $42.9 billion to $43.9 billion; Enterprise comparable sales up 0.5% to 2.5%; Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 4.6%, which is flat to fiscal '19\u2019s rate; Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.45 to $5.65; a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 24.5%; and capital expenditures in the range of $850 million to $900 million.","I would like to call out a number of assumptions reflected in our annual guidance. Our investments, in particular in specialty labor, technology and increased depreciation related to strategic capital investments and ongoing pressures in the business will be partially offset by a combination of returns from new initiatives and ongoing cost reductions and efficiencies.","Although there may be variations between quarters, our outlook for the full year assumes gross profit as a percent of revenue will be approximately flat to fiscal 2019 as continued investments in supply chain and higher transportation costs are offset by the higher margin rate of GreatCall.","SG&A dollars are expected to grow as a percentage in the low single-digits and be approximately flat as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2019. The increased expenses of GreatCall and continued investments in technology and wages are expected to be partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense as we reset our performance targets to align with our fiscal 2020 expectations.","As it relates to US tariffs on imports of certain products from China, we told you last quarter that we estimate a $200 billion lift that went into effect in September touches only about 7%, or around $2.3 billion of our total cost of goods sold. Our fiscal 2020 outlook assumes that the tariff stay at the current rate of 10%.","I would also like to talk specifically about Q1, where we are expecting the following: Enterprise revenue in the range of $9.05 billion to$9.15 billion; Enterprise comparable sales growth of flat to 1%; Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.83 to $0.88; a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 22.5%; and a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 272 million shares.","Finally, as Hubert referenced, we have essentially met our previous revenue and operating income target for fiscal 2021, two years early. We plan to host an Investor Day during our fiscal third quarter, where we will provide an update on the progress of our strategy and share more details on our mid-range financial goals.","I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ma'am. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin ","So I think, first of all, great results and I think probably played better than people thought. But as we look at the outlook, one of the things that we've struggled with a lot with Best Buy is just how do we grow the business and look at the growth of the business going forward? I mean, obviously, the guidance is fairly de minimis growth on the EBIT line. How should we look at it, over a more multi-year period driving comps over a longer term? And what's that level? I mean, can we think of it as a 2% to 3% comp grow or is that still hard to do?","Corie Barry","Thank you for the question and also the compliment on the results. The longer term outlook, if you go back to the Investor Day that we had in the fall of 2017, we put an outlook out there that said we believe strongly we have the ability to grow in that low-single-digits range with flattish operating income at least in the mid-term with that point going through fiscal 2021. We delivered a bit ahead of that the last couple years. Obviously the guide over the next year is right in line with that. And given the environment as Hubert talked about the amount of excitement we have about technology, the execution and just how strongly we feel our strategy is positioned well with our customers, we feel like that line of thinking is appropriate as we look out at least through that 2021 range. And then obviously we'll update you more as we have our Investor Day in Q3 on how we're thinking about any longer term after that.","But I think you've seen our guides consistent with that point of view and we don't see anything in front of us that changes our belief in that trajectory.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Keith","Corie, I just want to dig into the margin guidance, so I can appreciate you guys want to stick to the flat EBIT margin year-on-year. However, going into this year, I was thinking you had some easier compares because the Total Tech Support launch was about 15 to 20 basis points of pressure, which was like in my clawback. So can you just walk us through that EBIT margin outlook in the face of these easy compares, what some of the offsets are?","Corie Barry","Yes, you bet. So one of the things that we wanted to make sure we landed as well, we had hit the financial goals that we laid out when we had our Investor Day in the fall of 2017. I think all of us would say we still have room to grow in terms of our strategic goals, meaning bringing to life some of those customer solutions that Hubert talked about, and really finding ways to improve those relationships with our customers. And we started down that road with offerings like the IHA experience, TTS as an example and even just the early interactions we have and offerings we have with GreatCall.","That being said, we still feel strongly we have a long way to go to make those really stickier and more repetitive relationship-based offerings with our customers. And so there are additional investments which we had always pondered since we talked with you all at Investor Day that we knew we would need to make over time. And while Total Tech Support was kind of one part of that in launching that last year, there are continued investments and things like supply chain. We specifically called out specialty labor in our stores and we also specifically called out a continued technology build that will help us enable some of the strategies and bring those to life.","And so, the reason that we laid out a longer kind of mid-term view in 2017 is because we knew this would be a multi-year journey of investments and while Total Tech Support represented one type of those, there will continue to be additional investments as we go into future. Now, obviously, we're offsetting a number of those with the continued cost reduction. But we're trying to find that balance between making sure we actually -- and Hubert said it, continue to actually accelerate our investments because we like what we're seeing in a way that's going to create those differentiated customer experiences. And so you\u2019ll see those continuing into FY '20 in a way that we think we'll develop better experiences for our customers.","Hubert Joly","In other words, Peter, this is a choice. We could decide to slow down the investments and increase the operating income rate. We believe the best way for us to create long-term value for our shareholders is to continue to play to win, invest in our future, because we think the reward, the medium-term, long-term rewards of building this unique differentiation, these relationships, these solutions, is very exciting. And so that's why we're managing the business this way.","Peter Keith","Okay. But can't argue with the returns you're getting thus far. I may bend the rules a little bit here. I just want to stick on that Total Tech Support. The comp in the services segment, nearly 14% was as high as I can remember. I'm curious if that was due to the change in the revenue recognition policy. And just as we play that forward, should those services kind of run at a above average rate for the next couple of quarters as a result of the change?","Corie Barry","Yes, about half of the growth that we saw in that services comp was due to the refinement in the revenue recognition policy. And you're going to continue to see that into the next couple of quarters, while we roll that out over the last few year's straight line. So that will continue to be -- but the good news is with there being half still sitting under that is a good healthy growth in that services business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Dan Wewer","Thanks. Just looking to see if you could comment a bit further on the changes in the Total Tech Support offer. And then also with respect to the accounting change, Corie, you talked about the impact the next few quarters, will it benefit all of 2020 EBIT rate as it did in the fourth quarter?","Corie Barry","So I'll start with the last question. It won't be the entire year because obviously we're going to lap the change necessarily when we get to Q4, so you'll see some of it as you run the early part of the year but you'll ultimately lap the change. Your first question was to expand a little bit on the change and exactly why we refined the methodology.","Basically, we have sufficient history now. We've had the program long enough. We ran full rollout last year around May. And once we have the sufficient history it was much easier for us to actually match the revenue with the actual usage, because we had enough history for us to know that customers were using it a bit more upfront than ratably over the life of the contract, which is how we were initially recognizing it.","And so that means you pull a bit more of the revenue to match more precisely with the fulfillment cost early in the life of the contract versus ratably over the contract. We'll keep watching the usage and make sure we're continuing to match the revenue with the usage. Because the truth is, all the things the team is working on is to make sure people are using it more consistently over the life of the contract. And so I think you'll see us continue to tweak the offering and tweak what do those customers get in a way that will help us drive more consistent usage throughout the life of the contract, but for now we're -- really it\u2019s just a matching principle making sure that the revenue is in line with the fulfillment cost.","Dan Wewer","If the customers are front-loading the usage of Total Tech Support, is there a risk that data renewal rate could drop more than you would expect, because they're probably not using Total Tech Support in maybe months 10, 11 and 12?","Dan Wewer","I was going to say, Dan, the renewal rates are in line with our expectations. In my prepared remarks, I did comment on the fact that we were going to continue to invest in the development of the customer experience, in order precisely to build these stickier customer relationships. So I've talked about more self service capabilities, also more proactive support. So for example, to proactively tell you that your firmware needs to be upgraded or that maybe you have opportunities to clean up your computer to get back to that speed that you had initially, or maybe advice around parental control and security, so self service proactive.","And also in my prepared remarks I talked about how we are expanding the vendor partnerships in new ways, getting into more of these service areas. And so, you'll see us continue to innovate, because one of our -- precisely one of our goals is to expand these customer relationships and measures that\u2019s stickier over time. So again, in line with expectations, but opportunity to continue to evolve our customer relationships.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets.","Anthony Chukumba","So I just wanted to kind of take a step back because I was little looking through my notes. When we had this call a year ago, you're coming off of your best year in quite some time. You did that 9% comp in the fourth quarter of 2017. That was your best comp I believe in 13 years. And you got it to $4.80 to $5 a share on EPS and a zero to 2% comp for the full year. You did $5.32 in EPS and a 4.8% comp. And that was with flowing iPhone sales that was with Amazon carry more Apple products. So I'm just trying to understand like clearly there's a lot that broke right in 2018. I would just love your comments just in terms of what went right in 2018 that maybe you weren't expecting or are you just being very conservative when you guided to the $4.80 to $5 and the zero to 2% comp.","Corie Barry","There were a couple of things that we actually talked about at the start of the year that broke rights here rising. One, we've talked about our belief that the gaming cycle might actually slow a bit heading into last year and we were very clear. That tends to be a more cyclical business after having such great switch results. What we didn't have line of visibility to was a phenomenon that would become fortnight in particular and the social gaming side of things, because that carries not only the switch as a console, but listed all those in gaming. It listed computing gaming, it listed peripherals or the headphones and the things that are used in gaming, it listed all of those. And that genuinely was something that we didn't see in front of us being quite as strong as it turned out to be for the year. And that was a material change versus our original expectations.","If you look at the rest of the business and I think Hubert talked about this a little bit, when you're talking about what is it that makes us excited about where we are, I also think there was an execution element around the strategy that continued to be early on a little bit of what our initial expectations were at the start of the year. Obviously a good consumer environment health, but on the back of a good consumer environment and clear interest in technology, our execution and our ability to deliver on that more relationship-based experience in our stores, in homes, online, I think actually genuinely performed even better than necessarily going into the year and when you have a better consumer environment then necessarily you imagine -- and you put on top of that even better execution and better acceleration of the strategy. I think you also just end up accelerating the results in a way you didn't necessarily expect at the beginning of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser","Can you break down your outlook, your comp outlook for 2020 in terms of what you expect the consumer electronics market to grow at and what you think your share gains are going to be in the year ahead? Also, you rolled out a new leasing program, lease to own, how much have you factored into your guidance that, that will contribute in the year ahead?","Corie Barry","So let's start with the first question around kind of what we're thinking through the industry. The last couple years, the industry depending on the quarter obviously there's ebbs and flows, but you've seen flat up slightly across the industry. And remember, this is a broader definition of the industry, not just NPD, you have to think about things like gaming and phones and appliances and the Apple products. You've definitely seen flash up a little bit. As Hubert informed in some of his opening remarks, we don't see anything in front of us as the trajectory of the industry massively changes. And so we're expecting that same kind of ranges of maybe it's flattish, maybe up a little bit or something in that realm would make sense given the guide that we're seeing. Therefore, share gains is anywhere from maintaining the share that we have today to maybe slight share gains over the year.","In terms of the leasing program, we have -- we were testing an expanded leasing program in a couple of markets. We were pleased with the results that we've been seeing and therefore are now going to expand the number of stores with our leasing solution. I think what we like about it is it actually opens up the opportunity for customers who might not otherwise be able to have credit or otherwise be able to have access to the kind of products that we sell. It opens up access to that product at a whole new customer base for us. That is included in the guide that we gave you and so you can assume that we\u2019ve factored that in.","But most importantly we like that we can potentially open up the experiences that we offer to a whole customer base that might not otherwise have the chance to purchase the set of products that we sell.","Michael Lasser","If I could just sneak one last question in. We're getting the question, what was the contribution from the accounting change around Total Tech Support in the fourth quarter?","Corie Barry","So remember, not an accounting change. It is a refinement of how we're recognizing the revenue just to be very clear. We haven't called out exactly what the amount is, but I would think about it as roughly enough to kind of offset the impact that we saw or about half the impact that we saw from our warranty program. So the downside of the warranty, about half of that was offset by the upside from the refinement of the revenue recognition on Total Tech Support.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","So can you help us understand how you're thinking about the impact of Apple's expanded distribution on a 1P basis to Amazon and Costco, obviously, they're incredibly important partner of yours. And just trying to think about the potential dilutive impact of their expanded distribution on your business?","Hubert Joly","Yes. Thank you, Scot. So we reported in Q4 comps that were at the top end of our range of 3% and that reflected or that included the impact of the expanded distribution of Apple. So we feel good about this. What I would say is that when we work with our key vendor partners, we work to make sure that the customer experience we offer is very unique and really meets the customer expectations. And frankly, in the case of Apple in particular we're very proud, the experience we provide both in our stores in our -- we have 900 Apple Stores within our stores. We have 3,000 Apple experts in our stores. We've also expanded our relationship with them around services. We probably are the largest reseller of Apple Care. And we provide Apple service in some of our stores.","And frankly, as is the case with our key vendor partner, we'll continue to innovate and move the relationship forward in ways that are in line with the goals of that vendor partner and advance the customer experience. So we live in a world, where we get to compete with some of the world's foremost companies. You've named a couple and there's a few others and that makes our sport stimulating. And so these kinds of move forwards are encouragement to keep moving because some experience forward so that we offer a unique customer experience and we drive innovation and experiences for our customers.","Scot Ciccarelli","Just to be clear it looks like mobile phones actually declined in the quarter. Is the expectation as we kind of roll through calendar '19, mobile is in kind of a perpetual decline situation or was this kind of like the initial impact and you guys expect to your share and obviously failed in mobile to continue to ramp?","Corie Barry","So just to be clear, I\u2019d separate the mobile discussion a little bit from the expanded distribution discussion. Mobile, what we're seeing in mobile is a different question. I think you've seen lots -- written in a lot in the public, about just in general a maturation of the mobile cycle, the replacement cycles extending for people who are buying mobile phones and general softness. We actually don't feel like this was as much a question of share loss associated with any kinds of distribution changes. This is more just a question of broadly how often are people buying what are now pretty trendy phones and replacing them. And we've taken that -- and we said it specifically in our prepared remarks, we've taken some of that expectation and pushed it forward into our guide for next year. And by the way, we've been pretty consistent on our expectations for the mobile business over the last couple of years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Horvers with JP Morgan.","Christopher Horvers","I wanted to follow up on the operating margin question which I -- clearly a focal point out there. So Corie can you share what the operating margin expanded on a 52 versus 52 week basis, presumably if it was up 30 in against the 53 week or the 14 week, it would have been up something higher than that. So the question on '19 is basically so are investments accelerating because it doesn't sound like the expense opportunity is slowing or is the level of comp perhaps the difference? So if you did a 3% comp in 19, like you did in 4Q, would you actually see operating margin expansion?","Corie Barry","So for the year, if I were to adjust, FY19 versus FY18 on a 52 to 52 week basis, we have 10 basis points of operating income rate expansion. If you remember at the beginning year, we had guided flat on a 52 week basis, which would have been the 4.5%. We had 10 basis points of operating income rate expansion. And that was on a pretty significantly higher top-line than we expected, obviously, almost the 5% comp on the top-line. And so I think as you look into next year, obviously we gave you the range and we believe that will lead to a flattish operating income rate. I wouldn't say the investments have accelerated, I think it goes back to the original conversation we were having, which is we continue to make targeted investments in the places that we told you in the fall of '17 that will help us accelerate our progress on our initiatives.","They are different really in pace than we had expected at the beginning. And we feel pretty comfortable that we actually like the pacing in they are in line with what we had thought at the time that we gave the original guidance. And so to your question, yes, if you massively outperform the top-line, obviously we may come back to you with a different economic equation. But from what we see in front of us, I feel pretty comfortable about what we're showing. It takes into account both the cost reductions we see in front of us and the investment profile.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. And then -- and as a follow up, there's a lot of noise out there around tax refunds. Can you remind us a few years ago, when they were delayed, did that actually impact your business and is there anything that you're seeing in the business now with tax refund dollars being lower year-over-year such that, are you expecting some catch-up in the latter part of the quarter?","Corie Barry","So it was two years ago we actually specifically commented, as to exact time, I remember the call distinctly, on there being a slowdown in the quantity of tax returns. In that year what we saw was actually most of that did come back to us and most of it back in Q1 as the quantity of tax returns evened out throughout the quarter.","We're feeling a little bit of softness right now due to what has very clearly publicly been both a quantity of tax returns being down but also the amount for return right now is down. And what we're keeping an eye on is not as much even just the quantity question but also the amount for return and how that ultimately will impact our business over the quarter. The good news is at the end of the day, people will see reductions in their tax rates meaning their take home pay throughout the year no matter what the amount of the return is in and of itself. So it kind of becomes a timing question throughout the year. But we're definitely watching and have incorporated some of those thoughts into the Q1 guide.","Operator","Our next question comes from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Curtis Nagle","So just want to focus a little bit more on the lease to own program, I guess how much is it is in the guide? And then B, just I guess more of a theoretical question. Why did you choose to roll it out, I know you guys said that it's helping. But -- and I know in terms of credit risk you're probably not going to bear any, but inherently it is a lower quality business and process is arguably less sustainable given that these are customers who typically can\u2019t qualify credit or typically lower income. So I guess do you see any risk to that?","Corie Barry","So first of all, obviously, we're not going to comment on the exact amount that's included in the guide. But we've included some amounts in the guide. We specifically did test this in a couple of markets. And I think what's important here is that this genuinely is a whole new tranche of customers that would not be able to purchase products with us. The agreements that we have, we don't bear the risk over the longer term of the agreement. And so it is -- I think it makes a ton of sense for us.","That being said, I think it makes even more sense for the customers. At the end of the day, what we want to do is be able to serve the widest lots of customers we can and give them access to the type of products that we sell. And these are customers who likely would not qualify for the credit offering that we have. And therefore this gives them an option to be able to actually qualify for some type of agreement with Best Buy and then be able to pay that off over time.","And so I think we feel pretty passionately, so there is actually opens the doors to a whole new -- I mean think about it, sometimes this isn't just people who have bad credit, this is people who in some cases just have no credit. And this is the start for them to be able to build a credit portfolio and actually will lead to a much more robust credit portfolio over time. And history has shown up very, very, very few to the less than 1% range of these customers go delinquent on their agreements. And so this is actually a very nice offering and in fact I think helps a lot the population create credit when they might not otherwise have some.","Hubert Joly","So this is the customer acquisition play with catching people early on in their credit history and with a view to build relationships over time. So this is actually consistent with our overall strategy of helping customers, we are going to help more customers and allow them to neutralize with technology with a view of a relationship over time. This is not a deviation from the strategy. So we're excited about it, it makes sense from a customer standpoint and obviously from a financial standpoint as well.","Curtis Nagle","And just really quick on the buyback, it looks like guidance is lower than what you did for this year, is that just some conservatism? It does look like your cash flow probably would support more. So I'm just curious how to think about that?","Corie Barry","Obviously behind the scenes we're always taking a look at the cash flow making sure we feel like we have a minimum level of cash that makes sense and would support us through a number of different scenarios. We clearly spent almost $1 billion last year on our GreatCall acquisition and so very in line with our capital allocation strategy. We've always said, we're first going to invest in the business either to fund operations or through acquisition. Second, premium dividend payer. And then third with that access and by access we mean above and beyond whatever that minimum balance is we feel we need, we will then return that to shareholders and so that's in essence not that we did this year and we'll keep revisiting that every single year depending on the cash flow that we generate, that this seem like the right amount given what has historically been our capital positioning.","Operator","Thank you. We have time for one final question. And last question comes from Matt McClintock with Barclays.","Matt McClintock","I was wondering Hubert two questions real quick. The first one is just you talk about the customer relationship extensively on this call and creating that relationship with In-Home Advisors. And I was wondering now that the program has been out for well over a year, what efforts have you made in terms of monetizing the tale of that relationship throughout the year? Have you had some success there?","Hubert Joly","Yes, I think we're still at the beginning of our journey to build ongoing customer relationships. The -- I think In-Home Advisor provides us opportunity, I think we're still learning, kind of setting up scale, it\u2019s interesting as a retailer, certainly, we've been -- and we\u2019ve said this before we've been focused on transactions and selling products. So moving towards selling solutions and building relationships. This journey is at the beginning and we're learning, I think we're seeing, we're very excited by the results. But building that's institutional capability is something that will take time. As an illustration that involves modifying or adding a new focus on new key performance indicators. As a retailer, you would focus on transactions, growth rates, basket and so forth. As a customer relationship focused retailer, you're going to be focused in a local market, that how many households are there. How many of them are Best Buy customers with whom we have a relationship, what\u2019s my share of wallet. Just by saying these things, I think you can feel the magnitude of the change we're operating and that relates to the investments we're making, the training, the tools and so forth. And which is at the beginning of that journey which personally for me is a side of excitement because you can see the upside and we have captured any meaningful part of the upside from there. So very early on in the innings of that journey.","Matt McClintock","Thanks for that. And then if I could squeeze one more in, just in terms of mobile, you brought up 5G and you brought up the foldable phone. Could you talk about how that could revitalize the category overall and potentially be a game changer, meaning it seems like with the ASPs of the foldable phone, you might be looking at something similar to historically how tablets impacted your business overall?","Hubert Joly","And with us on the call we have Mike Mohan our Chief Operating Officer for the US business. And Mike is going to take that question and then we'll just wrap.","Mike Mohan","Thanks for the question, Matt. It's an exciting time to see what's happening in technology. Clearly, we have talked about the increasing price of all mobile devices. And so all of this new technology is going to have a fairly limited appeal from an acquisition standpoint, but an extremely high level of interest from consumer, what it can do for them, and how does it solve used cases. So what we're most excited about is showcasing the technology, inviting customers into our stores, onto our site, and even having some of the products in our In-Home Advisor when you go visit people so we can show people what we can do.","And I think it positions us in a very unique place to show how technology will continue help enrich people's lives and I think that's probably the best way to put our excitement in this area. We will always lean forward on something that will help customers solve a problem and I think they would expect us to take a leadership position here.","Hubert Joly","I just want to say thank you Mike. And in closing, I want to again show my hats-off appreciation for the work and talent and passion of all of our associates across all functions in the business. You guys are amazing. And I want to thank you for joining our call and your interest in Best Buy. And we look forward to continue to update you as we continue to move forward. So you have a great day.

And by making that information public, the board kept a promise to resolve this matter openly and with full transparency for shareholders, for employees and for our customers.","The board also announced that Dick Schulze will be stepping down as Chairman, effective at the Annual Meeting in June. Let me take a moment to acknowledge Dick and what he means to this great organization. He built Best Buy, with hard work and vision, into a $50 billion company with nearly 170,000 employees across the world. And I'm determined to honor his legacy and what he created. In his new role as Chairman Emeritus, his institutional knowledge will be invaluable.","I believe the company is responding well to these changes. I want to assure everyone that I'm focused on running the business, and I'm developing a plan for the future. It is my belief that Best Buy is a highly undervalued asset, with an excellent opportunity to improve returns.","I'll let Jim cover the first quarter review in greater depth. Overall, results are within our expectations, and we are maintaining our guidance for the year. Now for the balance of my time today, I'm going to cover 2 main topics: first, my observations after 6 weeks in my new role; and second, the things I'll be focused on over the next few months.","Let me start with some macro trends that we see in the market today. We are operating in an economy without boundaries, one that has been transformed by the digital revolution and is more open and transparent than ever before. Neither consumers nor companies are defined by the roles and limitations that seemed so clear just a decade or so ago. Armed with information and choice, consumers shop differently today. The annual rate of growth of e-commerce transactions is far outstripping traditional retail sales. Consumers have needs and preferences that are new and changing rapidly. Today, they need virtual products and services as much, if not more, than they need hardware. And businesses are under pressure to respond to those changes; to connect with consumers, whether they are online or in the store; and to meet these new needs and preferences.","The changes have created risks and dislocations. Some businesses have not survived, but those changes have also opened the door to new efficiencies and opportunities. We certainly have seen those forces at work in the market for digital products, where competition for the attention of consumers is strong and growing stronger. This new generation of consumers is empowered, educated and social. They have many options when browsing for tablets, smartphones and other devices that connect us. And they have a fast-growing need and appetite for services and accessories, both tangible and virtual, that help consumers take full ownership of their technology.","Not that long ago, Best Buy was the authority in this market. Our stores wowed consumers. They were places where innovation met convenience with a broad assortment of products and knowledgeable people who knew how to make things work. Best Buy provided a unique customer experience that gave us a clear edge over competitors. Not anymore. Today's marketplace is different. From my perspective, it is a marketplace we weren't prepared for. Best Buy's customer experience is no longer unique as it once was, and it is no longer a distinct competitive advantage.","To be sure, Best Buy still has numerous advantages. We have good, hard-working people. The company has a global footprint and deep relationships with vendors. We are the market leader in consumer electronics, and we still have ambition and pride. So make no mistake: we will reclaim that place of authority. We will reclaim that unique experience with customers. I believe an essential part of moving this company forward is acknowledging the truth about where we are. Best Buy is not performing up to its past standards. We need to change substantially. We need to change who we are and what we do and how we relate to customers and shareholders.","After 6 weeks on the job, I would say Best Buy is in a turnaround. This assessment reflects the reality of the moment. It does not mean we are in any danger of going out of business. It does mean that bold actions are required. Tough decisions will be made. We must take a fresh look at our investments and the entire business, and I can assure you there will be no sacred cows. As we look to the next few months, we are committed to implementing the strategic priorities laid out at the end of the fourth quarter. But for a company in turnaround, those priorities are just the first phase of the changes to come.","I am working with the senior leadership team to create a long-term plan that recognizes that our marketplace is no longer defined by distinct boundaries. That plan will provide a path for sustained, profitable returns in the years ahead and position Best Buy to compete in a much broader marketplace, a marketplace that covers everything from innovative home entertainment systems and appliances to the virtual products and services needed to tap the full potential of mobile devices. That plan will help us connect with many more customers than we do today and build much deeper relationships with them. We'll expect to lay out the details in a few months.","Let me say, as a starting point, that I envision a Best Buy that is more relevant, more intelligent and more nimble. These are the guiding concepts that are shaping our turnaround plan. First, to compete in a broader market, Best Buy must become more relevant to consumers, seriously relevant. We cannot be seen just as a hardware company. We must be relevant in the much larger and constantly evolving market of services that is driven by technology innovation and broader customer needs. And we must begin building those deeper relationships with customers. We must meet people where they are and not expect them to come to us. That means we must have a world-class e-commerce capability. We are continuing to build a first-rate team to help Best Buy meet that need, and I expect to have more to say about that real soon.","A big part of becoming more relevant begins with our people. Best Buy has always been a people-based company. We need to build on that. We need to develop and support our people even more. We need to provide training to bolster our expertise in technology and keep us at the forefront of new products and trends. We need to raise the bar for everyone, from the Blue Shirts to Geek Squad to those at the very top of the company, including myself.","As a team, we need to make technology work for people. That means solving their problems and educating them on what's really possible. Right now, we aren't even close to good enough. We have the financial strength to make these investments, and I intend to see that we do. Better trained, better equipped team members are essential to the success of our plan to compete in broader markets. They are essential to connecting with more customers and building deeper relationships with them.","The strength of our employee base sets Best Buy apart from its competitors. A great example of where we are already asserting relevance can be seen in the new store model we are in the process of unveiling. We expect the Blue Shirts and Geek Squad agents who will staff those stores will speak with authority about technology. Their mandate will be to shift the customer expectation from repair, our traditional Geek Squad offering, to one of relationship.","Another example is the new program we just launched to provide millions of AARP members access to Geek Squad services. It's a comprehensive subscription model that supports AARP members with their personal technology through access to Geek Squad agents by phone, online and in-store. I can't think of a better positioned company to offer this type of end-to-end solution, which delivers significant value for customers by meeting 100% of their needs. These are just a couple of examples of where we are moving to improve the customer experience, improvements that move us from a transactions-based experience to a solutions-based experience.","Second, Best Buy must become more intelligent and more strategic about using data, coupled with technology, to build long-term relationships with customers. Before I joined Best Buy, I worked at a company that was adept at using data to drive business decisions and shape customer relationships. At Best Buy, we need to do the same.","A good example of what I envision is the way our Best Buy Mobile team stays connected with customers. Best Buy Mobile uses technology and information about their needs to ensure they come back to Best Buy for follow-up assistance and upgrades. We will do more of this. Much more. And dive much deeper. I'm talking about using analytical tools to improve business processes and inventory management, as well as predict consumer behavior.","We have a wealth of information at our fingertips. We have to use it to figure out what our customers want, not just today, but what they will want tomorrow. As a solutions-based organization, we must offer a personal experience to our customer. We must anticipate the needs of our customer and meet them, not partially as happens all too often today at Best Buy, but fully.","And last, Best Buy must become more nimble. We have to adapt to the new realities of the marketplace. That means being faster, more efficient and more productive. We have to anticipate changes, not just react to them, and lead the way with innovative products and services. We need to focus on being better, not just bigger. We will rightsize the company to better meet customers wherever they want, whenever they want, in the neighborhood store or online with a strengthened e-commerce capability that opens markets at home and abroad.","My goal is to continue to shrink the company's physical footprint and substantially reduce our cost structure. Total square footage will go down as we make decisions about the best use of space and resources. But as we assess opportunities, our total storefronts may stay the same or even grow somewhat, though with a smaller and more focused presence. We've had success with this model in some of our pilot markets, where we've been able to drive up revenue per square foot while reducing operating costs. That is the path forward. Best Buy needs to be more focused and lean. Our intention is to grow returns from existing assets and invest in those assets to deliver outsized returns.","Another part of being nimble is making sure that we use our size to our full advantage. Best Buy operates around the world. But big is only better if we use our size to improve efficiency and productivity across all aspects of the company, inside and out. Big is only better if we use our size to be the very best at what we do. And yes, that includes making sure our customers truly get the best buy when they come to us.","So let me be clear. What I've outlined here is not a strategy. It is the foundation upon which we will build that long-term strategy. We do not have all the answers today, and I know that is going to be frustrating for some as it is for me. We will come out with the specifics later this summer. We plan to deliver a multiyear blueprint designed to succeed in a marketplace where boundaries have disappeared and where competition for consumer attention is fierce, but where Best Buy also has opportunities to excel. It is essential that we invest in our core strengths and that we become more relevant, intelligent and nimble. Doing so will make us stronger and better able to adapt to change. Doing so will make sure Best Buy is never caught flat-footed again by a marketplace that is evolving rapidly and will continue to do so.","We have a lot of work to do. One part of that is rebuilding relationships with investors. That is an important priority and one I will personally address. As we move forward, Best Buy will focus on improving margins and continuing to return cash back to shareholders. And we are moving from a big-box store growth model to a return on investment orientation, as is appropriate for a retailer at our stage. I know there are skeptics out there. I see the share price. But I don't see the company through the same lens. I see the reality of the moment and I am realistic about the challenges. But I also see the opportunity, and I am confident we will prove the skeptics wrong.","I will now turn it over to Jim.","James L. Muehlbauer","Thanks, Mike. I want to begin today by quickly highlighting the actions we took in Q1 on several of the strategic priorities we discussed on our last call. As Mike said, these are just first steps in a series of changes to come. We have begun the process to improve our U.S. store portfolio and dramatically reduce our big box square footage through the closure of 41 underperforming stores of the total of 50 planned for the year; starting the construction process for our new store formats in the Twin Cities and San Antonio test markets, which emphasize connections, services and an improved customer experience with many locations adding Pacific Kitchen and home and Magnolia Design Centers stores within a store; and the continued build out of our small-box Best Buy Mobile stand-alone store network with 43 additional openings in Q1.","We executed cost reductions in our corporate and support areas consistent with the $800 million cost reduction plan. We also notified our best customers, Reward Zone Silver members, of the enhanced benefits we will now provide them, including free expedited shipping, 60-day price matching and returns, and a free home visit by our Geek Squad to help them get the most from their technology. In short, we are aggressively executing our plan to improve the business.","Given that we just spoke with you at the end of March on our fourth quarter call, there are not material changes in the key business trends we discussed at that time. Our Q1 results finished in line with our expectations, and we remain on track to deliver our annual plan.","Let's review some of the key drivers in the quarter and briefly discuss our current view of the balance of the year. From a revenue and comp sales perspective, the first quarter finished in line with what we had indicated in the Q4 call. The Domestic segment comp sales in Q1 included very strong growth from tablets, led by the successful launch of the new iPad, mobile phones, eReaders and appliances. This growth was more than offset by industry-wide weakness in categories including notebooks, gaming, digital imaging and televisions. When compared to the comp sales results reported in Q4 of down 2.2%, the Domestic business comps of down 3.7% were impacted primarily by lower notebook comps and eReaders growth slowing to mid-double digits rather than low triple-digit growth. Online sales continue to delivered growth during Q1, increasing 20%, led by the extra week, traffic growth and an increase in conversion rate.","Q1 sales in the International segment were weak and weighed much more on the enterprise comp sales than they did in Q4. Before getting into the details, let me step back a bit and say a few things about our International business. We have taken dramatic steps to improve returns from our International segment the last few years. Our International portfolio has several businesses which offer a great deal of opportunity. International had a very difficult Q1, but we believe this will be the weakest quarter of the year. Given some of the macro trends around the world, we anticipated this performance and included these trends in our annual guidance. Importantly, we expect to see improved results from our International segment for the balance of the year.","Now on to some of the details for International. As we discussed in the Q4 call, Five Star experienced a significant decline in comps in Q1. Comp sales were down 28%. The weakness was driven by the expiration of government-sponsored programs in China for appliances and other products at the end of calendar 2011 and a general slowdown in the economy. Appliances represent a significant part of the sales mix of Five Star. The lower sales results at Five Star were in line with what other CE competitors experienced in China in the first quarter. We expect comps in China to improve as the year progresses. This is due to the accelerating growth of mobile phones, strengthening appliance sales and improved Golden Week performance.","In Canada, a high single-digit comp decline was a result of similar trends as we've seen in the U.S., while growth in tablets and mobile phones had less of a positive impact on total comps. In Europe, our sales were negatively impacted by 2 major factors. In the U.K., our largest market, growth in the sale of postpaid phones were offset by a very weak prepaid phone market. The weakness in prepaid was driven by regulatory changes and lower consumer demand in a very difficult macro environment. Our business in France, Spain and other European markets also faced lower consumer demand and a much more challenging competitive environment.","Turning to gross margins for the quarter. In the Domestic segment, gross profit dollars increased 4%, including the extra week, while the rate declined 30 basis points. The rate decline was driven by a more favorable mix from strength in mobile phones and lower gaming sales, which was more than offset by lower volume of computer repairs and the continued shift in service revenue from onetime transactions to ongoing tech support memberships. The rate pressure related to the shift to tech support memberships is the same effect we experienced last year and should begin to abate in Q2 since the program launched in late Q1 of last year.","The International segment rate decline of 180 basis points resulted from lower gross margins in our Europe business, driven by postpaid phones, which experienced a more competitive pricing environment given the macro challenges, and increased mix of lower margin smartphones.","SG&A spending in Q1 increased 2%. Excluding the extra week that occurred during the first quarter, total company SG&A spending was down versus the prior year, driven by our cost reduction initiatives and lower volume-related costs and advertising. Our SG&A spending and cost reduction programs are on track with our plans for the year. One item to be aware of, as you look at our year-over-year SG&A spending at the Domestic and International segment level, is the elimination of the Best Buy Mobile profit share payment in FY '13. In the past, while this payment did not impact total company SG&A, it did result in an increase to Domestic SG&A and a decrease to International SG&A. This is worth noting as you look at the year-over-year segment result in FY '13.","The Best Buy Mobile payment in Q1 of last year was $29 million. When excluding the impact of the Mobile profit-share payment from last year's International operating income for a more accurate comparison, the year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income of $126 million becomes $97 million. To recap, this decline in International operating income was primarily a function of the following: lower connections and margin pressure from an exceptionally difficult macro and competitive environment in Europe; weak sales in Five Star due to the expiration of government-sponsored programs; and to a lesser extent, lower revenue in Canada.","Looking forward to the balance of the year, we are maintaining our annual guidance. Comparable store sales are expected to modestly improve as the year progresses, primarily from stronger product launches in mobile phones; improved notebook sales, fueled by the introduction of Windows 8 and Apple's new operating system later in the year; and improvements expected in Five Star. As the year progresses, we continue to expect improved year-over-year gross profit rate performance, driven by growth in connections and services, continued execution of our cost reduction initiatives and the eased year-over-year comparisons for postpaid phones in Europe.","Consistent with our plan, our full year SG&A, including the 53rd week and a more normalized incentive compensation, is expected to grow approximately 3%. Excluding the extra week and the normalized incentive compensation, full year spending is expected to be down about 1%. Importantly, we continue to plan for $750 million to $1 billion of share repurchases throughout fiscal 2013.","To wrap up, we are intensely focused on dramatically improving our performance during this turnaround period. During Q1, we began to take action on the initiatives we laid out for the year and delivered our Q1 plan. Most importantly, as Mike stated at the beginning of the call, we are creating a new long-term plan designed to make Best Buy more relevant with customers and position the company for sustained, profitable returns for shareholders in the years ahead.","Thank you and, operator, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Mike, welcome to the hot seat, I guess. 2 quick questions for you. How do you prioritize some of the near-term challenges facing the company such as heavy executive turnover, along with longer-term uncertainties such as price competition, transparency and uncertain product cycles?","George Mikan","Well, thank you, Michael. And first, let me say thanks, everyone. Good morning. It's a pleasure to finally get the opportunity to speak with all of you and I'm looking forward to sharing our short-term plans with you and our long-term plan as we move the company forward. Michael, I appreciate the question. I'm going to try to focus on -- hopefully, I'll answer your question by focusing on what we're prioritizing today over the short term. And then I'll talk a little bit about the long-term plan as a follow on. Our short-term priorities as we face our challenges, they're instructed by the time period that we're in. As I stated, we're in a turnaround. We're making tough decisions. We need to take bold actions. We're evaluating the strength and weaknesses of the business with an eyes-wide-open mentality. And as I said, there'll be no sacred cows. We're looking at investments that have been made, investments that will need to be made, and we're going to focus on those areas with the highest returns. We're prioritizing activities and initiatives and focusing on the need to haves, as opposed to the nice to haves. And last, we're looking for further areas to improve our cost structure, both over the short term, in the immediate term, as well as over the long term. So that's first. Second, frankly, we're focused on running the business, on delivering on our fiscal year '13 plan, executing on the major initiatives that we rolled out in March as a Phase I. Third, as I described earlier, we're building a long-term plan and what I'll call a blueprint for Best Buy to succeed in the evolving and ever-changing marketplace. And then last, and I think this talks a little bit about executive changes. We're looking to bring in new talent with fresh perspectives for those new areas and change initiatives that we're facing today, coupled with promoting from within. So those are the areas that we're, Michael, we're focused on today in terms of short-term priorities to deal with the challenges that we face. I recognize that's somewhat broad, but there's a lot going on. With respect to the long-term plan and balancing the different challenges over the long run, frankly, I don't want to get ahead of ourselves today. I know that's going to be frustrating for some, that we should have more specific plans, but we're building out the plan to address those challenges and we're looking forward to presenting those to you later this summer.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That make sense. Let me just add one quick follow-up. You come to the role with limited direct retail experience. So how does that influence your approach to the job?","George Mikan","That's a great question and I appreciate it. Let me start by saying this. I'll concede the retail experience, the limited retail experience that I have, but we've got deep knowledge and capabilities with retail experience and, frankly, I'd say we have some of the best retail minds in the world. So I'm proud of that and I'm going to leverage that and tap into that as much as needed. I think there are other things that I can bring to the organization. One is just a clear, unbiased approach to evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the business. A change -- and embrace changing mentality. A focus on priorities and a return -- investment returns mentality. A knowledge of a service -- building and growing a service enterprise. Leveraging data to instruct, improve business performance, as well as predict consumer behavior. Those are all the types of expenses that I have that I think I can bring to help move this company forward. But it's coupled with the team that we have and it will also be enhanced by others that we bring into the organization that are very relevant with the, I'll call it, the modern Best Buy for tomorrow.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","First, maybe a question for Jim. Jim, it was helpful when you were able to take the International segment operating results and kind of give us a pro forma for the Mobile. Do you think could do the same thing for Domestic and maybe pro forma it both for the Mobile and for the extra week and what Domestic performance might have looked like on kind of an apples-to-apples basis versus a 13-week Mobile reporting period last year?","James L. Muehlbauer","Yes. Sure, Colin. I'll be happy to. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the profit-sharing payment for Best Buy Mobile in Q1 of last year was roughly $29 million. So from a Domestic standpoint, our Domestic results benefited in Q1 this year by roughly the equivalent amount. Similar to what we reported at the end of Q4 on the 53rd week, as you saw in our notes, we have the new fiscal year, which we incorporate the month of February once again. So it's the same 53rd-week impact that we saw in Q4. It just falls now, obviously, in our Q1, which has a bigger magnitude given the size of the quarter. But in general, if I look at what the impact of that week is, I'd call that $0.10 to $0.11 of EPS in Q1 of this year that's driven by that extra week in Q1.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a second quick math question and then one for Mike. Five Star, can you comment at all about what the margins and the profitability of that business look like with the negative 28% comp?","James L. Muehlbauer","Yes. Well, overall, from a macro standpoint, as we said before, that business is profitable. I mean, we're in a very luxurious position as a global retailer to have a business in China that drives profit and has that type of runway from a consumer standpoint ahead of it. So certainly, when you run a negative 28 comp in the business in an individual quarter is not -- it's not going to be an attractive outcome from a bottom line standpoint. But as we look at the balance of the year, we're still on track to deliver annual plan within Five Star and we're anticipating continued profit growth in that business. And that's with the addition of the 40 to 50 new Five Star stores we're opening this year, which obviously incur some onetime costs get those up and running. So certainly not being able to leverage the business given that 28 comp in Q1, it doesn't change our view for the year on growing that profitable and important part of our International portfolio.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then finally, just, Mike, listening to your comments, it certainly sounds like you've got a great or at least an emerging vision for the business and a lot of passion and energy around making some changes. Can you address the dichotomy of Best Buy having announced this morning naming a search firm for the CEO and what you think the outcome of that might be and what kind of characteristics the company is looking for in a CEO?","George Mikan","I think it's best that I leave it up to the board and the search committee to speak to those areas and, unfortunately, they're not on the phone to speak to that, although there's been a fair amount of press. I would just say this, that I think anyone sitting in this chair would feel privileged. This is a great organization. I love the opportunities that are in front of us. I'm sure there will be a lot of candidates with great skills that could bring value to this organization. And I think the most important thing is that we find the best leader possible to lead this organization into the next phase. And I'm confident that this Board of Directors will accomplish that and they'll speak more to it and offer more information as time goes on to keep the market in check with that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My question also revolves around the leadership transition and I guess there are 2 changes, one interim, one permanent, in the 2 most important governance roles in the organization. So perhaps -- well, I know the strategy for now is intact. If you could talk about how your take on the business and maybe your style differs from Brian's? And also, I know Dick will continue to play a very important role with the organization, albeit no longer as Chairman, and perhaps what impact that transition might have on the company's strategic priorities and execution.","James L. Muehlbauer","Matt, it's Jim. I don't know that I caught the first part of that question. Mike is certainly prepared to talk about kind of the difference in approach going forward. But could you just restate the first part of that question for us?","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sorry about that. The beginning was that there is a change in 2 of the top roles of the organization, both CEO and Chairman, one interim and one presumably permanent. And the question was for Mike to differentiate his approach and perhaps style from that of Brian. And also to talk about perhaps the impact of Dick's moving off from Chairman, though he will continue to play an important role, perhaps as the board moves on with new leadership, what impact that might have on the company's strategic priorities.","George Mikan","Well, Matt, thanks for the question. I'll try to answer it as best I can. Let me start with the last part, with Dick and his future role as founder and Chairman Emeritus. As I said, Dick's knowledge of building this company and understanding how retail works and, frankly, transforming retail over the years and the intelligence of understanding the consumer and where the consumer is going and how to better relate to the consumer is invaluable to this organization. So I expect that, that will be leveraged and play a role, as I said, in the legacy of Dick over the years -- over many years to come. So I'll start with that. With respect to, I guess, comparing my style versus Brian's style, I'm not sure that I'm interested in getting into comparing to Brian per se other than to say some philosophical beliefs that I have. And I think a lot of them you would have heard that on the phone or in my earlier remarks. I focus on returns. I'm a return on investment capital individual. I know that we need to rightsize the organization, so I'm very much focused on productivity. I keep score. I'm a metrics-based individual. You'll see that in the earnings release. There are some key metrics that lay out front that are very meaningful to me as we evolve over time. And then last, my style is to take action, to take an informed point of view or get an informed point of view and take action, make decisions. So I embrace change. And those are kind of some of the philosophies or at least the way I prefer to operate and what I stand for. And I'll leave Brian's style to what Brian's style is.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A bit of a more granular question about the 2 market tests. As we all know, sales retention is critical given that any lost sales impacts leverages of fixed overhead cost, so perhaps you could spend some time talking about what the minimum sales retention needs to be out of the stores that you're closing for it to be profitable at the total company EBIT line, including fixed overhead and supply chain. And more specifically, how does total real estate costs -- how are they expected to change in the 2 test markets given the big box you're closing and the small box that you're adding?","James L. Muehlbauer","Yes. Chris, it's Jim. Thank you for the question. As we look at those 2 test markets, one of the things that we're doing in rolling those out is that we're planning on closing the stores in those test markets, Chris, after we finish a majority of the remodeling activities that we have in the other stores in those markets. So that as customers have new opportunities to experience our new pilot store formats, when we close those stores, they're going to a better rendering of our Best Buy business model. So we don't have detailed results yet from the closures in those specific markets. But to your question specifically, as we look at -- for instance in the Minneapolis market, we're planning through this test roughly to reduce square footage, from a big-box standpoint, 18% to 20%. So as we look at the customer transfer that's required there, we think based on the geography and the density in the Minneapolis and St. Paul market, we have an opportunity to actually get quite a high level of customer retention, which makes the economics work very, very well. I think as we learn how that process works and we learn what customer behavior is, we'll have a more informed view with how that might play out in different markets. But in general, we do not need a massive shift in customer transfer to make the economics work in our model overall. And it's going to depend store by store, which is why we specifically wanted to put whole-market tests out there, supported with a differentiated business model from the past, supported with whole-market advertising. It's really bringing those all together at once, with the differentiated customer experience, where we think we're going to get the maximum learnings.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So is 30% not high? Is 50% not high? Like, what do you need to retain? And is the cost per foot of big-box versus small-box store on the rent side about the same?","James L. Muehlbauer","No. The cost per square foot on a big-box store, obviously, is much cheaper than the small-box stores given the fact that the small-box stores basically sit in line in malls. We would be thrilled to have customer retention rates in excess of 30%. We believe our number's in excess of 30%, but that's why we're running the test: to see what it actually is.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Perfect. And then one follow-up question for Mike. So perhaps asked a different way, does the interim status impact your ability to make big strategic structural changes to the plan? Or maybe any conversations that you've had with the board around that topic would be appreciated.","George Mikan","I don't think so. The board, when asked to take this role on, the board authorized this management team, including myself, to take action. We don't have a day to waste, and we're going to take action. We're building a plan that will be presented to the board and ultimately brought to the marketplace, as I said, later this summer. But in the meanwhile, we're going to take action and I have no question in my mind that I'm empowered as CEO on an interim basis to make those calls and make those decisions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. One is there's no commentary on vendors and maybe it's too early to talk about it. But obviously, one of the issues that's going on is the vendors tend to distribute a little bit widely and there's been talk about this UPP pricing. Do you have any thoughts about your relationships to vendors and how you get them to play ball and stop the so-called showroom-ing aspect that's hurting Best Buy so much at this stage?","George Mikan","Well, I do. We speak a lot about our relationships with our vendors. And I think I mentioned that we believe we got strong relationships with our vendors. We have market-leading positions in most of the relevant categories in the marketplace. And we're building leading positions in other areas. So our relationships with vendors is critical, as you know, and we value them greatly. I think I'd ask Mike Vitelli to speak a little bit more on some of the specifics.","Michael A. Vitelli","Gary, it's Mike Vitelli. And as you asked this question, from the last time we were on, I would tell you that we're actually seeing an increase in vendors using unilateral pricing policies, directly related to them trying to get a strong return on the R&D investments they make in bringing out improved product performance and functionality. And we think, with our combination of stores, employees, demonstrations and our website, there's no better retail position than us to help explain those benefits, show customers what they can get out of their technology and deliver returns for both our vendors and for us as we bring these products forward.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then a more strategic question, Mike, for you. You were on the board and -- because what you spoke about today, which was like music to many of our ears, the people that have been trying to be supportive of the story and think that there's an opportunity, but you've been on the board and it seems -- we felt, many of us, that nothing was moving in the right -- or was moving too slowly in the right direction. And today, we heard like, \"Hey, we're going to go forward\", which is great. But what was the hang-ups, like, given you were on the board, given other people on the board probably saw the same thing, why did it take the change of leadership for this to start, for us to start hearing what we're hearing today? Why didn't the board get more impact -- have more impact previously?","George Mikan","Gary, I appreciate the question and without getting into the weeds or really looking backwards, I'm really choosing to look forward on where to move the organization. And I know the board is behind the moves that we're making in the short term here and we're starting the conversation around the long-term plans. And I'm excited about the future opportunities and I think we've got the full support of the board. And like I said, we'll be coming out with a plan that is more descriptive and specific in the months ahead. I just don't like to get ahead of ourselves right now and I hope you can appreciate that.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mike Barker (sic) [Mike Baker] with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I assume that's Mike Baker at Deutsche Bank. So following up on Gary's -- I think it was Gary's question about the unilateral pricing policy. So we are starting to see, as we do our price survey, some of your pricing match Amazon's for both Samsung and Sony. What are you seeing in terms of customer response to that? Are you seeing -- I guess, the question, are you seeing an improvement in your TV sales, both in units and dollars? We know it was down, but can you compare the decline in TVs versus previous quarters? And is there a positive margin implication from the UPP as well?","Michael A. Vitelli","Mike, it's Mike Vitelli again. We are seeing -- our plan in television is in line with what we expected when we talked about earlier in the year. Units are up. ASPs are down, particularly in some of the smaller screen sizes. But the large screen sizes are growing and prices are, if you will, a bit more stable there. But it's right in line with what we expected, but it's very early. A lot of the new products are just being set. This is a time for -- we actually get to watch and see what's going to happen and set ourselves up more towards the second half. So it's a good time to be watching that.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And so I think in the past, you've given some color on total TV sales: down mid-single digits, down low-single digits, et cetera. Is that something that you're willing to share this quarter and in the previous quarter?","Michael A. Vitelli","So the plan that we set for the year, because we kind of look at television on an annual basis, is that the overall revenue of the industry is going to be flat to slightly down, with units increasing and ASPs in different screen sizes changing a bit. But that's been consistent with how things are for the last several years. I would say, and we said this on the last call, that television industry for this year is very similar to what it was last year, which is a growing unit base, relatively modest price reductions and kind of a stable, flat overall revenue in the industry.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Well, then if I could just follow up on that, I guess, why would you not assume that it looks better this year than last year with this UPP? And again, one last thing, if you could slide in there, is the margin implication of that as well.","Michael A. Vitelli","And, Mike, I would tell you, we'll see. What I'll tell you is what we put in our plan, was that kind of modest flatness and stability versus last year. If it improves, that would be terrific.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Mike, I guess the question is, as you assess the overall organization, and you've only been in the seat for -- I know it hasn't been that long. When you think about this company's cost structure, how would you characterize the cost side of the business? Is it relatively lean? Is it bloated in your opinion, given kind of where you are in your phase of maturity, et cetera?","George Mikan","From my standpoint, it's high. I think there are a lot of opportunities to improve productivity and efficiency, and that's an area that we're very much focused on. Some of it is being instructed by the test pilots that we've run, that Jim was speaking to earlier. And some of it is, just looking at the metrics, that we think we can do better. And so as I stated earlier, we're going to be -- we're going to look to substantially reduce our cost structure.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","But given the fact that you operate in the industry that you do and there's constant changes and you have to keep the stores fresh, et cetera, is this a scenario where we could see something like what we've seen in maybe home improvement or some areas where you've taken these big, mature organizations and you significantly downsize the cost structure? Or is this something where you'll never get to that degree just because of the changes that are needed constantly to be implemented throughout the stores?","James L. Muehlbauer","There's 2 elements to that, Scot. There's certainly investing in our most productive stores that drive good foot traffic, high sales per square foot, and being more efficient in those, while actually taking square footage out of less productive stores that, overall, provides us a lower cost structure or actually a better customer experience in those markets. So the levers that we're pulling to take cost out are meant in one part to support better productivity in our better performing stores to drive more top line sales per square foot and more margin per square foot. So I think the lower cost structure comes from 2 elements. It comes from being more productive in our better stores, selling more. It also comes for transferring SG&A from our less productive stores. And part of the tests that we're doing in San Antonio and Minneapolis are really to emphasize both of those at the same time. So to Mike's point, we've announced a multiyear $800 million cost takeout program with an included items that are not only in SG&A, but certainly some of our costs that show up in margin, whether its transportation and other types of activities. We view those as a good start. There are more opportunities to come. And as we grow the top line in the business, we want to make sure that we're putting the same pressure on the cost structure, because the operating margins we have today in the business aren't nearly sufficient to drive the type of performance that we need for shareholders and aren't reflective of the opportunity we see in the marketplace for the Best Buy model.","George Mikan","It's Mike again. I wouldn't stop at just the store portfolio and what have you, although that's a material part of our cost structure and one that we're very much focused on and we will take action on. But there's also a lot of other areas that we're going to continue to go deeper in. We're in a turnaround. We're going to make tough decisions. The nice to haves aren't going to be in our plan. And we're going to be focused on need to haves. We're going to prioritize how we do our jobs during the day and what activities we're doing and things like that, discretionary spend and the like. All of that is being deeply scrutinized and we're going to take actions on those in the mode of the time period that we're in, and that's a turnaround.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Alan Rifkin with Barclays.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mike, are the many actions that you've laid out able to be implemented before an official CEO is named? And do you think that the 6 to 9 months that you folks have said it may take you to name an official CEO maybe may delay the implementation of some of these actions?","George Mikan","Well, let me try to answer it this way, Alan. What we've described today is a blueprint for success. We're assessing the marketplace and taking a realistic stance as to where we are and how we operate in the more, I'll call it, evolved marketplace. And we're building a plan that is instructed by people that run this business every day, also bringing in other people with different experiences like Stephen Gillett and myself, that are going to bring new perspectives and we're going to put together a blueprint that we think is going to be designed for success. And that blueprint, in my view, again, one person's perspective, could be taken by any leader and built upon. I'm sure there'll be someone, if it were someone different in this chair at some point that may have differences in view, but the core of it, I suspect, will be one that will be executed upon. And I believe that a lot of the decisions leading up to that will be made and will be at least put in place to be made by the permanent leader at that point in time. So I'd call it a blueprint and one that we think we can build on over time.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And one follow-up, if I may. You said that, obviously, you seek to continue to return cash back to shareholders. Given the likely capital-intensive nature of engineering this plan, are you still committed to buying back stock and possibly raising the dividend over the short term as this plan is laid out? Or is there a greater desire to preserve capital?","George Mikan","I -- from -- in terms of buying our shares back, we continue to -- we're going to continue to target buying the amount that we said, $750 million to $1 billion this year. And with respect to the dividend, as we get our strategy put in place, we'll revisit that and come to the marketplace with our plans at that point in time.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Bill Seymour, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Bill Seymour","Good morning and thank you for joining us on our Fiscal Third Quarter 2013 Conference Call. We have 2 speakers today: Hubert Joly, our President and CEO; and Jim Muehlbauer, our CFO, who is continuing in his role until December 10, when Sharon McCollam will join Best Buy. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take Q&A.","A few items before we get started. As usual, the media are participating in this call in a listen-only mode. Let me remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Best Buy may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.  Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations.","Please note that our reported results this morning including non-GAAP financial measures. These results should not be confused with the GAAP numbers we reported this morning in our earnings release or with the GAAP numbers we will report in our 10-Q. For GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of our reported to adjusted results and guidance, please refer to the supplemental schedules in this morning's news release.","And one other housekeeping item. We plan to announce holiday revenue results for the 9 weeks ending January 5, 2013, for fiscal November and December on January 11, 2013.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Hubert.","Hubert Joly","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. And thanks to all of you for joining the call and to those who attended our Analyst Day last week. And for those of you that were not able to attend, please note that the webcast is available on our website.","On that day, we shared a candid assessment of Best Buy. We highlighted Best Buy's strengths and underscored its performance has been unsatisfactory in a number of areas over the last 3 years. We also unveiled Renew Blue, a set of priorities to begin reinvigorating the company's performance and rejuvenating Best Buy.","Today, we are reporting our third quarter financial results.  In line with trends experienced over the last 3 years, Best Buy's financial performance during the quarter was clearly unsatisfactory. The results we're reporting today only strengthens our sense of urgency and purpose.","Now there were some positive developments during the quarter. We did well in a number of product categories, including mobile phones, appliances and tablets and eReaders. We had positive comps in these categories. We also grew market share year-over-year in these product categories, as well as in notebooks. In addition, our online channel continue to grow at over 10% year-over-year.","However, our overall performance was not satisfactory. Now some of it can be attributed to the effect of product transitions, especially related to the Windows 8 launch and the launch of several new smartphones and tablets. These product transitions have had a negative impact on sales and margins in the quarter as customers delayed their purchases in anticipation of new products to be introduced.","At the same time, we also had a number of items that impacted our bottom line, including investments in front-line training and compensation, as well as executive transition expenses.  So we do not believe that the rate of decline that Best Buy experienced in the third quarter can be extrapolated in anyway.","Now let me be clear, we are determined to turn around the performance of the company. And on November 13, we outlined the priorities that we are focused on to turn around and transform our Domestic business including, number one, reinvigorating and rejuvenating the customer experience by putting the customer at the center of what we do, addressing their needs and providing superior value to them. This means both improving our execution, as well as working on reinventing the business. And number two, increasing our return on invested capital with an unrelenting focus on revenue growth, efficiency and disciplined capital allocation.","Our view is that we have ample opportunities to improve ROIC by improving the operational performance of our business and capturing key market opportunities in our space. We are confident that we can enhance the return on our existing assets by increasing the revenue they produce and taking out unnecessary or unproductive costs.","In the short term, of course, we are also focused on making the holiday season successful. We know that 3\/4 of Americans intend to give customer electronics -- excuse me, consumer electronics as a gift for the holidays. Tens of millions will be coming to us online and into our stores between now and the end of the season, and we are ready for them. There's a range of exciting new products to buy at Best Buy, including Windows 8 and other new computing products, new phones, new tablets, new game releases and a new gaming platform, the Wii U. We are also expecting to see a positive impact for this holiday from significantly ramped up Blue Shirt training, the introduction of variable bonus pay for performance for full-time sales associates, as well as our holiday Price Match strategy.","I have been with Best Buy for 11 weeks, and I am excited by the opportunity to turn around and transform Best Buy and solve the 2 problems we highlighted last week: negative comps and declining margins. I am pleased with the progress we've made in the last few weeks in setting a clear direction, building the team at the top and mobilizing our organization around our priorities. I know that this will be a high growth, and I look forward to successfully tackling our challenges and our opportunities. And in doing so, our team will be guided by the investment thesis we shared with you last week.","Number one, Best Buy is the market leader in a growing fragmented market; number two, we have a unique platform to deliver a multichannel shopping and customer experience; number three, Best Buy has significant operational opportunities to enhance returns with improved retail execution and cost-reduction opportunities; number four, Best Buy has the opportunity to rejuvenate the customer experience in the company, as the preferred authority and destination for technology products and services; number five, Best Buy has the ability to stabilize and then improve its comps and its operating margin with a strong cash flow generation; and six, Best Buy has a results focus management team committed to delivering improved performance.","Thank you very much for your attention and your support as we to move forward. I will now turn it over to Jim.","James L. Muehlbauer","Thank you, and good morning. As Hubert stated, results in the third quarter were unsatisfactory, highlighted by the significant decline in operating income in both the Domestic and International segments. The largest portion of the decline was driven by a lower gross margin rate of 160 basis points. I'll cover the key drivers behind the lower rate in both Domestic and International. Importantly, we do not expect Q4 operating income to decline at rates experienced in Q3.","Looking now at some of the Q3 details, starting with Domestic. The third quarter Domestic segment revenue decline was driven by a comp sales decline of 4% and the impact of previously announced store closures. Domestic online sales, however, totaled $431 million and grew 10%, led primarily by traffic growth. Areas that had strong comp growth were mobile phones, which had a comp of 32%, benefiting from the launch of several new smartphones. There were also continued growth in comp growth -- in comp sales and appliances and in combined tablets and eReader products. This growth was offset by comp sales declines in notebooks, gaming, digital imaging and TVs. We believe tablet and notebook revenues were materially impacted by consumers delaying purchases ahead of the key product launches Hubert spoke about.","Domestic gross margin was down 100 basis points. Similar to the second quarter of fiscal 2013, the rate decline was primarily due to 3 factors. The largest impact was in mobile phones, where we sold a larger mix of higher price point smartphones, which resulted in strong comp sales and solid gross profit dollar growth, although at a lower overall rate than the previous year. Second, televisions. In TVs, we experienced a less favorable product mix into smaller screen sizes, which carry lower margins and a lower basket. Lastly, gross margins were impacted by the impact of product transitions ahead of key new launches.","Domestic SG&A was up 1%. This increase was due to increased training and higher compensation costs for sales associates, as well as executive transition costs. Excluding these factors and the impact from the absence of the Best Buy Mobile profit-share payment in Q3, Domestic SG&A expense was approximately flat compared to the prior year.","The specific actions related to the sales associates were increased investments in training and the introduction of higher performance-based bonus compensation. As we discussed at Analyst Day, areas like Best Buy Mobile have shown that better trained and properly incented salespeople drive better results. We have taken these principles and spread it to other parts of the store.","Moving on to the International segment. Q3 comparable store sales in International declined 5.2%. Europe recorded positive comps in the quarter, but this was offset by continued comp declines in Canada and Five Star in China. The International gross profit rate declined 280 basis points in Q3, which was predominantly attributable to Europe, driven by increased sales mix of lower-margin wholesale business and a price competitive environment for mobile phones, coupled with a mix into more expensive handsets.","International SG&A was up 7%. Last year, the Best Buy Mobile profit sharing was a credit to the International SG&A. When you exclude the impact of the Best Buy Mobile profit share payment, International SG&A expenses were flat compared to the prior period.","As we look forward into Q4, let me highlight a few items from our comments this morning. First, Hubert covered some of the significant product introductions in key categories for the holidays that we're excited about, including phones, tablets, Windows 8 and gaming, products that were either significantly constrained or not yet launched in Q3. These products are all a big part of our business. And second, we expect to see a positive impact from the additional training we have put in place for our Blue Shirts and from the holiday Price Match strategy.","Let me also make a quick comment on the increase in inventory for Q3. The inventory increase was primarily driven by the Domestic business and 2 items in particular. First, inventory levels across key product categories increased related to the new product introductions that we have spoken about today. And second -- and the second factor is related to the timing of the cut off of the quarter. The end of the third quarter this year is actually one week closer to Thanksgiving than the end of the third quarter last year. When we are preparing our business for Black Friday, that one week makes a significant difference in our inventory levels.","Overall, given these factors, we believe the inventory levels are appropriately positioned in advance of the start of the holiday selling season. We expect to generate free cash flow in the range of $850 million to $1.05 billion for fiscal 2013. As noted in the release, our revised estimate of free cash flow is below our previously communicated range. The reduction is driven by lower profit expectations, including Q3 performance and the related potential impact on owned inventory at year end. The current and previous free cash flow range also includes approximately $100 million in restricted cash movement related to working capital items.","For comparison purposes, let me also remind you that the year-to-date free cash flow for fiscal 2013 is significantly lower than the same period last year, primarily due to the improvements in working capital during the first half of fiscal 2012. As you may recall, we experienced several large working capital items at the end of fiscal 2011, which significantly benefited cash flow in early fiscal 2012. Wrapping up my comments on cash -- on the cash items, we finished the quarter with over $300 million in cash and 0 drawn on our $2.5 billion revolver.","As this will be my final earnings call as Best Buy CFO, I would like to quickly say thank you to the many shareholders and analysts I've had the opportunity to work closely with over the years. I enjoyed and always appreciated your questions and candid insights about Best Buy during our many conversations over the last 10 years. And I wish each of you and the entire Best Buy team much success in the future.","With that, let me hand it back to Hubert.","Hubert Joly","Thank you very much, Jim. And before we turn the call over to the operator, Alicia, for Q&A, I wanted to take a moment to wish all of you a happy holiday. I want to thank you for your support and your work following our company. I hope your Thanksgiving is spent in the company of friends and family, and I hope, for a few minutes, on BestBuy.com.","I also want to thank all of our employees, especially the Blue Shirts and Geek Squad agents in our stores, our dot-com team, our merchants, our marketing teams, our associates in our distribution centers, in our call centers and in our war room.  All of them have worked really hard to get ready for the holidays. The work of our team this holiday season is critical to our efforts. And I know we can all count on our team members to deliver an amazing customer experience to the millions of shoppers who will visit us. And I look forward to seeing as many Best Buy shoppers and employees in our stores, Thursday night and Friday morning.","So thank you, everyone, and now we will turn it over to Alicia, the operator, for the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You mentioned how you don't expect the operating income rate to decline at the same pace in the fourth quarter as it did in the third quarter. Can you talk about, maybe more specifically, what changes in the fourth quarter versus third quarter, whether it's Domestic sales, International sales, Domestic gross margin, International gross margin? And then on the PC category, it sounds like you're increasingly positive about Windows 8. Can you talk about the performance of PCs before and after the launch of Windows 8?","James L. Muehlbauer","Yes, Chris, it's Jim. Thank you very much for the question. Looking at the fourth quarter in comparison to what we've seen so far this year, if you recall, all year long, we've been talking about product launches that we expect to be back-end loaded towards the holidays. And certainly, as the performance that we've seen and others in the marketplace have seen in advance of the computing launches and phone launches so far this year has had an impact on dampering sales. So now that we have those products in our stores, we expect certainly more momentum behind those things. So that is one of the key attributes that we've been looking at all year from a sales trend performance. The other element that's rated that sales trend performance impacts our gross margins. In preparation for moving inventory in advance of those new product releases, we took actions in Q3 to make sure that our inventories were in clean position, and that we were all set with the new products. So we expect benefits in that in the gross margin line. We also have talked historically about one of the key elements that's driving our margin rate down in Q3 and Q4 is the lapping of the smartphone mix in our Best Buy Mobile business. We're actually going to anniversary that in Q4, so we'll have an easier comparison from a margin rate perspective in mobile phones in Q4. So the combination of new products, less transition costs and easier comparisons from a lapping standpoint in mobile phones are all factors that we're looking at as we think about whether that the run rate is going to continue or not, and which is why we're confident in saying, it will not in Q4, Chris.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And so just as a follow up, do you think -- will Windows 8 cause a positive inflection in comps or in the PC category?","James L. Muehlbauer","I'm not going to comment on specific products within the PC category. But given the trends, certainly, in Q3, in computing, in general, consumers are going to have a great opportunity to look at not only the Windows 8 products but the other new computing products out there and also the array of tablets and eReaders. And I'll let Mike Vitelli comment further on some of the specifics.","Michael A. Vitelli","Chris, this is Mike Vitelli. A couple of things I want to say. We put a tremendous amount of training and emphasis on the Windows 8 launch. And one of the things that we are excited about is that we have 45 exclusive models to Best Buy in Windows 8, in which 25 of those have touch screen, which is one of the key attributes of that. So with the training, the product launch, the emphasis that the industry is putting on and the effort that we're putting on, it's something we feel good about going into the fourth quarter.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just following up on the gross margin outlook, 2 other questions. First, how are you thinking about the holiday price match in terms of impacting gross margin in Q4? And secondly, the International business, the gross margin performance there was very difficult, obviously, related to mobile mix in Europe, primarily. Would you expect that to continue going forward as well?","Michael A. Vitelli","Colin, this is Mike Vitelli. We're very early in the Price Match process for the holiday season. We feel good about it from a couple of vantage points. And what I mean by that is our Blue Shirts are very positive about this and very empowered about this by giving them the ability to match prices in areas where they have seen, and we've been showing that we've been competitive and relatively close, particularly in the hardware category. So we're moving into the fourth competitive quarter with that empowerment, engagement and the ability for our Blue Shirts to make the decision in the moment to take care of our customers.","James L. Muehlbauer","And Colin, the second part of your question related to International. Our margins in International have been challenged all year long, as we noted in our comments, predominantly driven by the European business. We do expect the margin to get a little bit better in Europe in Q4, as once again, we're anniversarying some of the effects of the pricing changes we made last year. But I would tell you they're not going to be demonstrably different in International, as we look at the fourth quarter based on our current outlook.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And Jim, while I've got you, just back on the Price Match. And what kind of a margin impact do you think that will have? And I understand that you expected to drive incremental sales, and hence, gross profit dollars. But just in terms of a rate impact, what should we be thinking about?","James L. Muehlbauer","Colin, we're not going to go through the specific expectations of that in our rate for a couple of reasons. One is we've had the Price Match out there a relatively short period of time. We feel really good about the prices that we have in place, along our key product categories. And as always, during the holiday selling season, especially during Black Friday, we feel very comfortable about the competitiveness of our prices, in general. So how that actually plays out into later December, we'll need to see, but we've tried to consider various scenarios in our outcome. And certainly, we look forward to the increased benefit and the confidence that our Blue Shirts get from knowing that they're going be able to offer the customers the best price in the marketplace and the benefits that come along with that for our model.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Daniel Binder with Jefferies & Company.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","It's Dan Binder. My question was around working capital.  You made a few comments in your formal remarks. I was wondering if you can just give us a little more color on what you're expecting provided you hit your sales plan, what the fourth quarter end will look like from an inventory and owned inventory standpoint?","James L. Muehlbauer","Yes, one of the elements that we -- that I talked about in my comments related to our cash flow guidance change is really impacted by the 2 things I mentioned. One is lower level of expected profits in the quarter. But also as you know, forecasting cash flow at year end, especially after the peak holiday season is impacted materially based on where owned inventory positions. So what I was trying to highlight is that if you just take the change in our cash flow guidance, and if you attributed that whole change to our change in the view of what the profitability is for the year, you'd be wrong in making that assessment. You really have to break it up in 2 pieces. Part of it is lower profit expectation and a part of it is just different assumptions around owned inventory. We'll no more, obviously, as the quarter progresses but depending upon what actual sales are, when we see the trends, we're going to pull all the levers we can to adjust inventory up or down appropriately. But just as we snapped the line at the end of the fiscal year, given the fact that we order a lot of the product in advance of the holiday season, we may have purchased -- we may have paid for that inventory by that time we get to quarter end, so our year-end balance could be a little different. We'll recover that in Q1 as we kind of reset those inventory positions and accounts payable positions with the vendors. So we just made sure that we've included a little bit of cushion and estimate in our cash flow forecast for different outcomes around owned inventory. Nothing's changing in the structure of the working capital in the business. It would just be a year-end timing item.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And do your vendors remain flexible this particular season, given the challenges that you're up against?","James L. Muehlbauer","Yes, I'll let Mike Vitelli comment further, but we've not seen any material change in the way that our vendors are approaching our inventory patent or our historical agreements around how we buy inventory at this time of year. We certainly get them benefits around seasonal dating, and that hasn't changed.","Michael A. Vitelli","So Daniel, what Jim said has said is correct. We have not seen any changes there. The thing that's changed over the last several years, I would think, for the industry as a whole is that the inventory that's produced for this period of time is the inventory that's produced for this period of time. There isn't a lot of inventory in the channel from here to all the production paths. So everybody's banking on the success of a forecast in this set period. In a sense, it's harder to increase inventories.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Let me add my best of luck to you, Jim. In -- on this mark that you're leaving, can you help us understand as you reflect on the Domestic segment over the last couple years, the business is on pace to have a gross margin rate decline, probably during that time of 130 to 150 basis points depending on where the year ends up. Can you bucket what has contributed to that rate decline over the last 2 years between the mix shift to less profitable vendors, the Amazon or online competition effect and other factors? And then I have a quick follow-up.","James L. Muehlbauer","I don't know if we have enough time in the time we have left on the call to go through all of that. But just from an overview standpoint, looking at the gross margins, Michael, over the last couple years in the Domestic business, clearly, the biggest factor that always impacts our margin rate in the business is the mix of the products that are selling, given the wide differences in their profitability. So historically, in periods where we've mixed more into computing-type products, obviously, our margins have come down. The way we've always looked at the business though is that our model needs to be able to sell what customers have an interest in, and what we're focused on is growing gross margin dollars. So looking at the rate is interesting and understanding the business, but what's important, are we staying relevant with customers and are we growing dollars over time. Over the last several years, key factors that have impacted the businesses, certainly, from a benefit standpoint, we've mixed much more heavily into mobile phone products over the last 3 years, which has been a good rate and a good dollar story for us, in general. The price competition and the mix of smaller screen sizes in televisions has certainly been a drag on the business the last several years. And the growth in lower-margin computing products, given the phenomenal success of notebooks, eReaders and tablets has certainly come with great dollar benefits but at lower margin rates, in general. So those factors, coupled with a larger portion of the business moving online, and basically being hardware-only type sales in the portfolio, I think putting all those together those would pretty much outline kind of the key drivers over the last 2 or 3 years.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Then one for Hubert. Given the performance of the International business, and along with what seems to be your focus on the Domestic segment, does this increase your sense of urgency to perhaps rationalize the portfolio and make some moves and changes such that if you are successful in your transformation initiative, the benefits will shine through in the P&L?","Hubert Joly","Yes, Michael, thank you for your question. So as we discussed last week, Domestic is 75% of the business, so it received the bulk of certainly my attention in my first 10 or 11 weeks. We see today the continued decline of the performance in the International business, so that part of our business requires attention as well. I think the sense of urgency is evenly spread between Domestic and International because those require a great deal of attention. But there is a sense of urgency and purpose in driving ROIC across the entire portfolio. And as relates to International, we'll find the right path to get this done. So no further comments today, but certainly, great sense of urgency and purpose in pursuing that.","Operator","The next question is from the line of David Gober with Morgan Stanley.","David Gober - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just my question, as we look at the same-store sales in the Domestic business, the 2 categories that showed some sequential slowdown were, obviously, the computing and mobile business that you talked about it in length, and also the services business. Just wondering if you could give some color on what's going on there, given the high level of profitability and the potential impact on gross margins related to that category?","James L. Muehlbauer","Yes, so the primary impact on the services business, really, driven by 2 parts. From a sequential standpoint, the decline in services comps was really tied to the unit volume that we were selling in our computing business. So when our computing volume was down, we have less of an opportunity to attach those service products overall. Also, as we mix into smaller screen sizes on televisions, our opportunity to attach an install with our services business declines. While those items are declining, we still see positive impact and growth from our tech support offerings, providing customers. So we know there's a value proposition there that resonates with customers. And given the expectation that we have in Q4 around our computing business, we would also expect our comparable store sales in services to benefit as our computing business grows in the fourth quarter and going forward. So a little bit of that is tied just to the driver units within our computing business in Q3, David.","David Gober - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got you. That's helpful. And I guess you mentioned within that the TV migration to smaller screen sizes. I know you've talked about that a little bit in last year's fourth quarter and in some other periods. But just curious if you could give us any sort of expectations for the fourth quarter. It's a little bit surprising, given the decline in ASPs, that we are seeing such a drastic shift to smaller screen sizes. Any sense if you expect that to continue in the fourth quarter? And maybe any sense of why you think that's happening?","Michael A. Vitelli","David, this is Mike Vitelli. And as you pointed out, the trend, particularly that we've seen, as consumers go into lower entry points, I would call that the 32-inch category and below in the first 3 quarters has been high or higher percentage than we've seen in growth over previous years in units. A lot of emphasis and a lot of the activity, you see it in some of our promotions going on right now that'll be going through the remainder of the fiscal year, are emphasizing as the industry is overall of larger screen sizes. So we think there'll be a bit of a -- hopefully, a shift in that period in those -- in that screen size that'll change the ASPs in the fourth quarter.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Mike, this might be a question for you. You discussed the new product lineup in phones and tablets, and that could help benefit the fourth quarter sales. But it looks like these changes are more evolutionary rather than revolutionary within those product categories. And then further, how do we reconcile the comment that smartphone and tablet sales could benefit during 4Q against the comments that we're going to be anniversarying the ramp in smartphones to lower smartphone gross margins a year ago. Looks to me like if smartphones were to kick in again in 4Q that would actually pressure gross margin rate?","Michael A. Vitelli","Well, first, to answer your last -- the last part of your question first. All smartphone mix to the company is a positive from a rate side. What we were talking about in the third quarter is, if you will, intra-phone category rate change, because you sell different mix of phones within phones. But in all cases, those are positive overall to the company from a rate point of view. Your other question, I think is yes, there are increases in all those areas but the growth rates that are in smartphones, that are in tablets, that are in eReaders and the launch of a new operating system like Windows 8 are all positive drivers into those categories. And they've all turned into significant gift-giving categories, whether they be phones, tablets, eReaders. And now people looking to upgrade and change their Window systems into Windows 8, we think are all positive drivers for those categories.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then, Hubert, one question for you. I know last week's meeting we focused exclusively on the Domestic turnaround strategy. But in looking at the year-to-date results, the operating loss in Europe is almost long [ph] as much as it has domestically. Is there a turnaround plan to -- for your International business?","Hubert Joly","Dan, the -- I think the numbers we're disclosing pertain to International as a whole. And so, of course, there's multiple countries in there; each situation is different. Under the leadership of Sharon, we have initiatives in each of the countries. Europe has its own plan. Mexico is a different story. It's growing very nicely. They've just had a very positive weekend. Canada is actually closer to the U.S. situation. And then China is going through its own transformation. So there is a set of initiatives today in each of these geographies. I don't think we've really wrapped it yet in an overall, let's say, renewable plan, so there's more to come on that. But it's not that they're winding their watches in International.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Scot Ciccarelli. My question is back to the Price Match concept, and 2 questions really. First of all, what percentage of your mix is actually covered by the Price Match? I know you've outlined the categories, but what percentage of the mix is it, when you kind of look at it on a SKU basis or sales basis? Whatever the right way to look at it is. That's number one. Number two, maybe I'm just being a little slower than normal here, but what is the expected incremental impact on gross margin for the fourth quarter as the Price Match program gets implemented? I mean, there has to be some sort of plan, I would assume?","Michael A. Vitelli","Scot, this is Mike Vitelli. The first part of your question, the categories, the major hardware categories we named are a significant portion of all our hardware, televisions, computing, appliances. So we're probably in the well above 50% to 60% range of the categories that are covered here. And as we've been saying, in doing that analysis and looking at our competitive price points in those areas is why we were able to feel confident moving on with the price strategy, because we believe we were competitive in those categories. So that's how we move forward with those. And as Jim mentioned earlier, we're in the early phases of that. And how -- and where all the different Price Matches come and where the promotional activity occurred in the next 2 months will start to let us know that. But in doing price matching, which has been -- price matching in and of itself has not been new for us. It's price matching named online competitors as well, which is the thing that we've announced. In some cases, that was occurring in some markets. And some salespeople were doing that on their own initiative in their earlier phases, so that was what drove us to do this is that we saw it happening, we did it back in Chicago, we saw it happen there, and saw the impacts there were positive on revenue and margin dollars. And now we are implementing that across the board, we'll watch it as it rolls out. The biggest thing I would have in everybody's minds, and a few of us has mentioned it is the positivity and empowerment that a Blue Shirt has when they're able to do that. It encourages engagement with the customer versus, gee, what's going to happen now. That is more material than it sounds, is that Blue Shirts now are confident at having 2 customers with confidence in the ability that they can make the right decision in a moment.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So the expectation is potential negative impact on gross margin rate, but more gross profit dollars because the Blue Shirt's more empowered and can improve the close rate?","Michael A. Vitelli","That's a set of outcomes that you can come up with that conclusion. You could do a variable where it doesn't change rates in any material way, which is actually what we saw in one of our key market tests. So there's a variety of things that can happen. None of them were done during holiday. So this will be the first time that we'll see that in that environment.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I want to speak for a moment about the mobile business more broadly. As you've comped up 30% in smartphones, given the moving pieces in ASPs, and in particular, in gross margin presumably as you mix to iPhones, are the earnings in Best Buy Mobile still growing along with that revenue increase?","James L. Muehlbauer","Yes, Matt, they are.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And if you could just give us a sense on sort of the magnitude of the change in profitability associated with that shift. And also to, I guess, to sort of repeat perhaps what was Scot's question, smartphones and the shift to iPhones presumably, while you're cycling the initial hit, is sort of a megatrend with some legs to it. So are you saying that once you cycle that initial hit in last year's fourth quarter, this should be -- this should not be a drag on the margin, or just a lesser drag on the margin?","James L. Muehlbauer","Yes, I think a lesser drag on the margin. What I'm calling out specifically in explaining what we expect to change in the run rate, in the margins that we've seen so far this year from Best Buy Mobile to what we see in Q4. That fact that we're going to anniversary a similar sales mix from the previous year is going to be a big change year-over-year. As the business mixes more into smartphones, key thing to remember, and I think most on the call are aware of this, the profitability in the smartphone is primarily driven by the bounty we receive from the carrier and from the attachment of accessories in services that go with it. The price point of the smartphone is almost irrelevant in the calculation, because it's a heavily subsidized product. So when you're looking at a gross margin rate, the higher the value of the smartphone, we're still getting the same level of bounty and same attachment at the end of the day. So what we really focus on is kind of the gross margin dollars available per connection and per attachment. So a little bit of the business is, in looking at the margin rate, really depends on what the sales price and the sales mix is within the mobile phone business. So I hope that answers your question, Matt. But clearly, the profitability in the mobile business continues increases. Selling more smartphones in the mix is a good thing for the model at the end of the day because they have better attachments, they buy more services overall in the portfolio. And quite frankly, that's what customers are interested in. So we're interested in selling products, obviously, that have high customer interest and drive profitability for the portfolio.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Alan Rifkin with Barclays Capital.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You folks cited higher training as one of the reasons for the SG&A deleverage. I was wondering if you can maybe provide a little bit more color on that line item. What are the early results thus far of the training program? And in total dollars, will that program take on a greater proportion of SG&A in Q4 relative to Q3? And then I do have a follow-up.","Michael A. Vitelli","This is Mike Vitelli. The training dollars are -- the way we talk about that, there is travel and actual out of the store time that's in there. And we did a substantial amount of that training in the third quarter. So relative from one quarter to the other, there's way more of it in the third quarter, as we're trying to ensure that everyone is prepared heading into the fourth quarter that we're in right now. So there's much, much more of it there. As far as its payback, the investment was made -- the investment thesis was made, what we saw in mobile is that employees that are engaged and trained are confident. They come back from training confident. They're coming back from that training with the knowledge of how to engage with customers, how to give customers what they need, and they're now empowered with the Price Match. So we think that we're going to see positive results with our employee engagement, with our customer satisfaction, and those will start to show up in the fourth quarter.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then a follow-up, if I may. Jim, you cited the calendar shift as the predominant reason why the ending inventory Q3 versus Q3 was up significantly. Excluding that shift, are inventories at the level where you would like them? And then lastly, for Hubert, there's no doubt that, obviously, the cash flow numbers compared to the your last forecast have come down very materially. As we calculate it, it looks like the dividend is costing you about $225 million a year. Would you be able to state whether or not you are committed to continuing to pay the dividend as it stands today?","James L. Muehlbauer","I'm sorry, the first part of the question?","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The first part of the question, Jim, was even pulling out the calendar shift, inventory levels were high, where are your inventories x the one-week calendar shift?","James L. Muehlbauer","Yes, thanks, Alan. So the inventory levels, as I mentioned really, driven by one week closer to the holiday. That was the primary reason for it. Another reason that I didn't mention specifically in my comments, because it was third and less significant was last year, at this time, we also had constrained inventories, especially in some of the DI  in the computing products, given that the floods in Thailand, so that was a little bit of a factor as well. The reality for the inventory that we have on high end today, in light of the holiday season we have in front of us, we're going to turn through that inventory and take receipts. So we feel really good about what we have on hand today in light of what we see in front of us in November and December. The real decisions around levels of inventory will be based on what we see after November and after we see the first couple of weeks of December. So looking at the balances today doesn't give me any concern at all from what we have from an inventory perspective.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Hubert, any comment.","Hubert Joly","Yes, thank you, Alan, for your questions. Your question is -- given the decline in the cash flow is whether we are committed to continuing the dividend. We've not made any decision one way or the other on that. What we'll be doing, of course, is assessing future cash flow and investments, in particular going into fiscal 2014, which will be a year of transition. But at this point in time, there is no intention to suspend the dividend. But, of course, we want to carefully look at this. Be assured that our focus as we discussed last week is on increasing the return on our investment capital, and that the use of capital will be a prudent one. So I would love to give you a definitive answer today, Alan, but I -- until we've made an actual decision on that, I will refrain from making commitment. But don't read anything negative into this at this point.","Operator","The last question is from the line of Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I'm going ask, your TV shares,  you said thought you gained share in notebooks, what about  TVs? And I guess related to that, the unilateral pricing policy has been in place for a while, which is essentially a price match program. And so I'm wondering if -- how that has worked for you guys? And if you one can -- if one can infer anything as relates to the Price Match? I remember when we visited you guys, one of the ideas was that the employees would be more confident in selling the TVs, because they know that you couldn't go elsewhere and get a lower price. I'm wondering if that's something that can be used as an example for the Price Match?","Michael A. Vitelli","It's Mike Vitelli. So the first part, when we look at the share of television, year-to-date through what we have, it's relatively stable. I would call it flat through August. And August is the latest period that we have. NPD is changing the members in the -- of their overall panel and POS data. So they are going to produce some new data shortly that we anxiously waiting for, but that's where we've been on TVs for the year. On unilateral pricing, obviously, not all vendors do it. They don't it on every product in their line, but where it exists, it's successful in what it's attempting to do, which is to stabilize pricing of that particular SKU at that particularly price point. So to your point, it makes the ability to price match on a unilateral product relatively easy, because everyone's by direction selling at the same price. But it's a mix of the total business. It's not -- I wouldn't call it a predominant part of the television business today.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But are you seeing better sales trends or better gross profit dollar trends on the TVs, the Samsung and Sony, larger TVs that are on the UPP?","Michael A. Vitelli","What you see is you see price stability and you see margin stability.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Do they necessarily sell any better?","Michael A. Vitelli","It all depends on the price that's set. So if the competitor set that -- historically, the difference with unilateral pricing is historically, a retail we would independently decide how they wanted a unit to throttle and would change their price accordingly. In unilateral pricing, that's the manufacturer's decision.","Hubert Joly","Thank you, Mike. And in closing, I would like to do 2 things, one is on behalf of all of us at the company, and I was very pleased to hear many of you on the call, thank Jim for the 10 years he spent at Best Buy. His loyal service to the company, the support he's given over the years to the company, and to me personally in the last few weeks. Between now and the end of the fiscal year, Jim will be working with Sharon, as Sharon comes on board on December 10, ensuring a smooth transition. And beyond the thanks, I think all of us wish you, Jim, well for the future. So thank you for that.","The second thing I'd like to do is, again, as a head sales person of the company is encourage everybody to shop at Best Buy between now and Christmas. And as you shop there, please give us feedback on your experience, both the good and the bad as we're focused on driving the customer experience now. So look forward to your purchases and your feedback.  With that, thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call. You may now disconnect.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.","In today's earnings release and conference call, we refer to consumer electronics industry trends. The consumer electronics industry as defined and tracked by the NPD Group includes TVs, desktop and notebook computers, tablets not including Kindle, digital imaging and other categories. Sales of these products represent approximately 65% of our domestic revenue. It does not include mobile phones, appliances, services, gaming, movies or music.","I will now turn the call over to Hubert.","Hubert Joly","Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. I will begin today with our third quarter results and an overview of the progress we are continuing to make against our priorities. I will then provide highlights of our holiday plans before turning the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook.","First, our Q3 results. In summary, we've delivered another quarter of domestic comparable sales growth and operating income expansion. At the enterprise level, on revenue of $8.8 billion, we increased our non-GAAP operating income rate by 40 basis points to 2.8% and our non-GAAP diluted EPS by $0.07 to $0.41, an increase of 21%.","In the domestic business, our comparable sales, excluding the impact of installment billing increased 0.5%. This increase was the result of growth in computing, major appliances, health and wearables and large screen televisions, partially offset by declines in tablets, mobile phones, digital imaging and services.","Online comparable sales increased 18% as our new mobile site and enhanced dot-com capabilities continue to drive higher conversion rates and increased traffic. I'll note that during Q3, industry sales in the NPD tracked categories were down 4.3%.","In the international business, we continued to see the ongoing revenue impacts of the Canadian brand consolidation store closures, foreign currency and softness in the Canadian economy and consumer electronics industry. However, the stronger product mix and a more effective promotional strategy have resulted in better than expected profitability.","I would now like to discuss our progress on our key priorities starting with merchandising. In appliances, we've completed our planned rollout of Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store for the year adding 59 stores for a total of 176.","We also rolled out 225 Samsung Open House appliance experiences, and with 20 consecutive quarters of growth in appliances, we believe the investments we're making in this business are helping us win in the market. Furthermore, the appliance delivery and installation investments we have made this year are also driving significant improvements in our net promoter scores.","In home theater, with our 630 Samsung and 380 Sony stores-within-a-stores and our 78 Magnolia Design Centers, we have continued to expand our industry leading experience for customers to discover, learn about and enjoy home theater technology, especially 4K TVs. This is a significant competitive advantage for us as 4K unit sales are expected to materially increase in the fourth quarter.","In computing, we rolled out more than 150 additional Windows stores in the quarter - in the third quarter and now have over 800. We also updated more than 130 of our Apple stores-within-a-store and now have 500 latest generation Apple stores-within-a-store.","In mobile phones, we added 225 Verizon and 225 AT&T stores-within-a-store. These shops feature highly trained specialists who provide access to the carriers products and services and the ability to learn about a wide set of connected or smart devices.","Additionally in mobile, we've added the ability for customers to buy installment billing plans online for Sprint. At this time, we are the only retailer who can offer these types of plans, both online and in-store for AT&T, Sprint and Verizon.","Turning to digital. Our investments continue to drive results as illustrated by the 18% increase in domestic online sales. In the third quarter, we provided free 2 day shipping to a significantly increased number of our online customers. We further benefited from the visibility and searchability of open box and clearance inventory.","We expanded online-only flash sales. We introduced Blue Assist, a new feature in our highly rated mobile app, which allows customers to simply shake their device to get live help with products and orders through chat, call, e-mail or through scheduling of Blue Shirt in-store.","And we also launched a dedicated Windows 10 online experience that showcases the functionalities of Windows 10, offers customer training and highlights new Windows 10 devices. In addition right after the end of the quarter, we launched the Best Buy app for iPad.","Turning to marketing. Our marketing campaigns helped drive a strong back-to-school performance. In the third quarter, we continued to shift our focus to social media campaigns that impact Millennials. We continued to increase the number of addressable e-mails, and we continued to improve the customer click-through rates to our website to enhance targeted marketing programs enabled by our Athena customer database.","In services, as we discussed last quarter, we began increasing our investments to support the expanded role we are expecting services to play in our Renew Blue transformation. The first of these investments was the September 13 launch of our new Geek Squad services in computing and tablets. We also began selling AppleCare and piloting our new Apple authorized service provider capabilities in more than 60 stores.","Like AppleCare, our new Geek Squad services are much more than extended warranties. They include providing 24\/7 support to our customers and helping them take advantage of their technology products. We believe this focus will result in higher NPS scores and increased attach rates over time.","Initially, however, we are expecting the price investments related to these rollouts to have an approximately $40 million or 25 basis points negative gross profit rate impact in the fourth quarter.","Turning now to cost. To date this year, we've eliminated a total of $110 million in annualized cost as part of our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization program, which has a goal of $400 million over three years.","These savings will continue to be offset, however, by the incremental SG&A investment in our future growth initiatives, which have totaled approximately $85 million so far this year, of which $20 million was in the third quarter.","We do, however, now expect the SG&A investment to reach only $100 million this year versus the $120 million we discussed last quarter, due to reducing the SG&A investment plan to partially fund the $40 million investment in services pricing that I just discussed.","Let me now turn to holiday. We are excited by what we are offering and delivering to our customers during this holiday shopping season. First, we have created an expansive assortment of amazing technology products, especially in 4K TVs, health and wearables, appliances, connected or smart devices, drones and many other giftable items. These products will be offered at very attractive prices to our customers throughout the holiday season.","Second, we have built some terrific new capabilities since last year, including number one, a range of new digital capabilities especially Blue Assist that I described earlier. Number two, an additional 1,100 stores-within-a-store, which come on top of the over 3,700 we had a year ago.","Number three, the increasing expertise and proficiency of our salespeople, number four, our enhanced multi-channel delivery capabilities illustrated by faster shipping, which is enabled by ship-from-store and a better in-store pick-up experience.","Number five, the optimization of our supply chain to enable earlier store replenishments and higher order fill rates. And number six, a range of services offered to our customers including free Geek Squad setup on top tech gifts and the ability for customers to give a gift of a Geek Squad agent's time.","Also from a marketing perspective, we believe we are entering the quarter with a high performing mid-year campaign, a significantly greater social media presence and more refined personalization capabilities for our investments in our Athena database.","We of course, recognize that we are up against a strong performance in the fourth quarter of last year and that the NPD industry declines that we saw in the third quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year, may continue throughout this year's fourth quarter.","We've also made incremental investments in services pricing and SG&A that are putting pressure on our fourth quarter earnings outlook, which Sharon will discuss in more detail in a moment.","Now, one thing we are certain about is our team's ability to execute exceptionally well throughout the holiday. We are going into the holiday clearer on our priorities and our plans and with a better trained, engaged and most importantly highly determined team.","I am grateful for what they've accomplished so far this year and extremely proud of their capabilities and passion to win. I know that they are ready to deliver an outstanding performance this holiday.","I'll now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our third quarter financials and our fourth quarter outlook.","Sharon McCollam","Thank you, Hubert. Good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter results versus last year, I'd like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter.","Enterprise revenue of $8.8 billion was in line with expectations. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 2.8% exceeded our expectations, due to a domestic $0.04 periodic profit sharing benefit from our externally managed service plan portfolio and better than expected profitability in our international business.","Additionally, our non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 37.1% versus our expectations of 39% to 40%, resulting in an additional $0.01 of EPS versus expectations.","I will now talk about our third-quarter results versus last year. Again, enterprise revenue of $8.8 billion decreased 2.4%, driven primarily by the Canadian brand consolidation, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and softness in the Canadian economy.","Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.07 or 21% to $0.41. This increase was primarily driven by a stronger year-over-year performance in the domestic business and the $0.04 periodic profit sharing benefit that I just discussed.","These increases were partially offset by a $0.02 negative impact of the Canadian brand consolidation and the lapping of a prior year inventory related legal settlement of $0.02 that did not recur this year.","In our domestic segment, revenue increased 1.2% to $8.1 billion. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 0.5%, excluding the benefit from installment billing, an estimated 30 basis-point benefit associated with installment billing and a 30 basis-point benefit from the periodic profit sharing benefit.","Our domestic comparable online revenue increased 18.3% driven by increased traffic and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total domestic revenue, online revenue increased 130 basis points to 8.8% versus 7.5% last year.","From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in computing, major appliances, health and wearables and large screen televisions was partially offset by declines in tablets, mobile phones, digital imaging and services.","In services, comparable revenue declined 11.1%, almost entirely due to lower repair revenues and to a much lesser extent declining attach rates of our traditional warranty plans.","As we explained last quarter, the reduced frequency and severity of claims on our extended warranties has had the impact of reducing our repair revenue. While at face value this appears negative, it is actually financially beneficial because this repair revenue produces very little profit and it is contributing to the positive performance of the externally managed portfolio.","Additionally in Q3, as Hubert discussed, we increased our investment in services pricing as we expand and improve our price competitiveness in this category, particularly in computing and tablets. The impact of this price investment is expected to continue into the fourth quarter and throughout next year of course.","As we are discussing services, I'd like to take a moment to provide more insight into the periodic profit sharing benefits we are receiving from our externally managed extended service plan portfolio, as they have positively impacted our gross profit rate and earnings the last two quarters and we are expecting a positive 55 basis-point impact in Q4.","These periodic benefits have been driven by substantial changes we have made to our insured warranty plans from both a plan design and cost-to-fulfill perspective. The portfolio has also seen an overall industry reduction in frequency of claims. All of these positive loss drivers have resulted in an overall lower than expected cost of our extended service plans and we contractually share in that out performance.","As these periodic benefits are based on actual claims history of the externally managed portfolio, however, it is difficult to estimate any future potential impact, but we do not currently expect to see the same level of periodic profit sharing benefits in fiscal '17.","Now, I will continue with our Q3 results. In our international segment, revenue declined 29.9% to $729 million, due to the loss of revenue associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation, a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 1,350 basis points and ongoing softness in the Canadian economy and consumer electronics industry overall.","Turning now to gross profit. The enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 90 basis points to 23.9%. The domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 110 basis points to 24.1%.","This increase was primarily due to: the positive impact of changes in mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower cost due to lower claims frequency and severity, which we will begin lapping in Q4, an increased mix of higher margin, large screen televisions, a positive mix benefit from significantly decreased revenue in the lower margin tablet category, a greater portion of vendor funding being recorded as an offset to cost of goods sold rather than SG&A, and a 20 basis point impact from the periodic profit sharing benefit. These increases were partially offset by the lapping of the 15 basis-point prior year inventory related legal settlement I just discussed.","The international non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 20 basis points to 22.4%. While both Canada and Mexico had higher year-over-year gross profit rates, a higher mix of sales from our Mexico business, which carries a lower gross profit rate, drove the 20 basis-point international rate decline.","Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.9 billion or 21.1% of revenue, an increase of $4 million or 50 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.7 billion or 20.9% of revenue, an increase of $67 million or 60 basis points.","This increase was primarily driven by a greater portion of our vendor funding being recorded as an offset to cost of goods sold rather than SG&A, investments in future growth initiatives and higher incentive compensation. This was partially offset by the flow-through of our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reductions.","International non-GAAP SG&A was $171 million or 23.5% of revenue, a decrease of $63 million, but a rate increase of 100 basis points. This dollar increase was primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange rates and the elimination of expenses associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation. The 100 basis point increase is driven by the year-over-year sales deleverage.","As it relates to the Canadian brand consolidation, we incurred a better than expected negative impact of $0.02 of non-GAAP diluted EPS in the third quarter. This was the result of the more effective promotional strategy, partially offset by a weaker than expected Canadian economy and consumer electronics market and from a lesser extent lower cost from our decision to transform only a limited number of stores this year.","As such, we are narrowing our estimated EPS impact of the consolidation this year to a range of negative $0.10 to $0.12 versus our previous estimate of negative $0.10 to $0.17. This expectation is broken down as follows.","The negative $0.04 that we've incurred in the first nine months of this year and a negative $0.06 to $0.08 in Q4. Ultimately when our consolidation initiatives are complete, we are expecting our Canadian business to be a more vibrant and profitable business, with profitability being defined as both higher operating income dollars and a higher operating income rate.","From a balance sheet perspective in the third quarter we returned over $140 million in cash to our shareholders, $64 million through share repurchases and $79 million in regular dividends, bringing our year-to-date total cash returned to over $800 million. Also during the quarter, Fitch returned our debt rating to investment grade.","I would now like to talk about our financial outlook. As Hubert said earlier, we are excited about our holiday plans and new capabilities and confident in our ability to execute our plan.","This gives us a positive outlook on our domestic performance versus the industry. However, the 4.3% decline we saw in the NPD reported categories got progressively worse throughout the quarter, which adds a level of caution to our outlook.","With that, our year-over-year non-GAAP outlook for Q4 fiscal '16 is as follows, in the domestic business, we are expecting near flat revenue, assuming industry declines in the NPD reported categories are in line with Q3 at approximately negative 4%, and that the timing of the Super Bowl shift results in approximately 40 basis points of sales moving out of Q4, into Q1, fiscal '17, and a non-GAAP operating income rate decline of 20 to 35 basis points driven by gross profit rate pressure and higher SG&A.","The gross profit rate pressure is primarily driven by a 25 basis-point investment in services pricing, higher distribution costs associated with our growth in the online channel and the appliance and large screen television categories and product mix and product cycle pressures.","Largely offsetting these gross profit pressures is the expected 55 basis-point periodic profit sharing benefit from our externally managed extended service plan portfolio. The higher SG&A is due to our investment in growth initiatives, partially offset by cost savings.","In the international business, due to the ongoing impacts of the Canadian brand consolidation, foreign currency fluctuations and of softness in the Canadian market, we are expecting an international revenue decline of approximately 30% and an international non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of positive 2% to 3%.","With these expectations, our enterprise-level outlook is as follows, a negative low single-digit revenue growth rate, and a non-GAAP operating income rate decline of 25 to 45 basis points.","From a tax rate perspective, we expect the non-GAAP effective income tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 37% versus 34.2% last year, which is expected to result in a negative $0.04 to $0.06 year-over-year in Q4 '16.","I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Seth Sigman [Credit Suisse]","Seth Sigman","Thanks very much. Hey, guys.","Hubert Joly","Good morning.","Seth Sigman","So a question on the fourth-quarter outlook. So it sounds like the expectation is that the industry's going to be similar to Q3 overall. But you did note that the business got progressively worse throughout the quarter.","So it would seem to imply that trends will improve throughout Q4. I mean, how should we be thinking about the drivers of that overall?","Hubert Joly","The drivers of forecasting the industry will come to forecasting in a hit driven business which we're very clear about is what we control. And as we said, we are extremely well positioned to deliver. Clearly, we've been gaining market share. And so that gives us enormous confidence.","Exactly what's going to be the demand during the quarter, you've seen a lot of volatility across retail categories in the last few months. So we've noted these facts. We want to be transparent with our shareholders. Our forecast reflects everything we know at this point and you see us determined to, irrespective of what's going to happen in the market, there's so much we control and what we've put in place, the capabilities we have allow us to win. So we're in this to win this.","And so I'm afraid that it's hard to directly answer your question about exactly what the demand is going to be, but we've tried our best today to give you as much transparency as possible around the categories.","I would say there's a lot of excitement in a number of product categories, TVs, the demand for 4K TVs and our customer experience in this category is a great example of was we can accomplish. Appliances is less of a giftable item maybe, but our momentum continues to be strong in the market in that category continues to be very strong.","There's a lot of excitement in both \u2013 in wearables, connected devices. I'm planning to buy a drone myself, so if you want to join me. But there is this recent trend we saw at the end of the quarter that we wanted to highlight for our investors in the spirit of transparency.","Sharon McCollam","And Seth, this is Sharon. I'll just add to that, that we believe there was another dynamic in October which is pent-up demand with people waiting to anticipate Black Friday deals. Because Black Friday as we all know has turned into black November and we believe that has a particularly stronger impact on the consumer electronics category than other categories.","So even going from the last weeks of October to the first week of November, we just got that data off the press. We actually saw a significant improvement from the last weeks of October and the first week of November. So again, that was in our backdrop and in our purview when we were looking at our Q4 outlook.","Seth Sigman","Okay. That's very helpful. So to follow up, thinking about the promotional outlook and whether that's going to be a driver in the fourth quarter here. You talked a lot about the price investments you are making in services.","Maybe looking beyond services, you've made a lot of price investments over the last few years that have helped drive market share.","How do you feel about your pricing in kind of the rest of the business today and do you think there is a need to be more aggressive through this holiday period?","Hubert Joly","Seth, we feel very good about our pricing, all right, outside of services, we've made these investments over time in hardware and accessories. I think if you follow - if you have time to follow some of the blogs around the Black Friday deals, in particular in the TV category which is the hot category, my sense is that the widespread sentiment is that we have the best deals for holiday in TVs.","So we feel really good about our price positioning, which is what I highlighted in my prepared remarks. We have not only an amazing assortment, amazing prices and we have the quantity for consumers.","It\u2019s one thing to have an item at a price that looks great, but if you have five of those and then you're done, not particularly compelling. We have -we're going to have deep inventory making the products available to the customers.","Seth Sigman","Thanks so much and good luck in the holiday.","Hubert Joly","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Matthew Fassler [Goldman Sachs & Company]","Matthew Fassler","Thanks a lot and good morning.","Hubert Joly","Good morning, Matthew.","Matthew Fassler","And thanks a lot, Sharon, for that last point on the quarter to date trends. But I want to focus for a moment on the NPD trends that you saw over the course of Q3. Can you talk about where the erosion took place? Was it broad based or was it category focused?","And then along with that, I know the phone market is not included in the NPD data. I also know that wireless shifted from a sales driver for you in Q2 to a category that declined in Q3.","So any color you can give us on the outlook for phones, product wise and otherwise would be terrific?","Sharon McCollam","Yes, Matt. On the NPD, I know this will sound like a strange statement. But the good news is it actually was across all the categories. We like that because that's what really led us to our premise, especially in October, around the pent-up demand, because it really isn't product specific. It was sort of categorically specific.","So that was in our minds, again, another data point which you just says the customer was looking forward to Black Friday. Remember, the first Black Friday deals were released in the first week of November by some retailers. Second week, we released 8 deals. So that we'll just follow through on that.","And October was the most notable month during the three month period. As you pointed out, there are categories that are outside of that, appliances is another category that is actually outside of NPD. And with that we saw exceptional growth again this quarter and we are so encouraged by the work that we're doing on the appliance side.","In the mobile category, we did see I believe, we believe the industry grew, knowing what the industry did for mobile is very difficult. But we do believe if you look just at units that there was growth.","But for us at Best Buy, this shift of the iPhone launch by a week was not helpful. So we will see. But as you know from our remarks this morning, mobile was not our strongest category. It was one of our down categories.","Matthew Fassler","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Nagel [Oppenheimer & Co.]","Brian Nagel","Hi, good morning.","Hubert Joly","Good morning.","Sharon McCollam","Good morning.","Brian Nagel","I'm going to try to phrase this in a question, but it's probably going to come across more as a comment that we can just opine upon. It's a follow-up to, I guess, the prior two questions, as well.","But as I look at the results today, I just see a real disconnect between what seemed to be actually a decent Q3, and even in some of the qualitative commentary you're making about the third quarter and then into the holiday. And then the guidance that we put out there, most importantly, the implied earnings decline that's implied in that guidance.","So I guess what I'm wondering is, is there some type of X factor here? Is there an air of conservatism as you head into the holiday, which is -- I get. Is it a stepped-up investment cycle the next few months? What's actually happening here?","Sharon McCollam","So I would say two things. Hubert mentioned it in his prepared remarks and I mentioned it in my own. With NPD down 4, which was a significant change versus Q2, we believe that going into Q4 we should enter the quarter and enter the outlook that we provided today with the appropriate industry backdrop.","So to your question about did we go into this with a lens around what the environment feels like, we did. When you look at other retailers that have come out in the last 2 weeks, we have seen what you've seen which is a smattering of good news and not so good news.","And several of the areas where the retailers tend to be catering to the higher end consumers and have a less broad customer base, they seem to have had a slightly more impact full outlook for the fourth quarter.","So we've tried to balance that between the two, and - but without question, we are coming into this with that as our backdrop. So is that helpful?","Brian Nagel","No, it's very helpful, Sharon. It's very helpful. I guess to drill down, with respect to price promotions and having followed consumer electronics now for a very long time, that's typically the biggest hurdle, if you will, competitive price promotions as we head into the holidays.","It doesn't seem, again, in all the points you've laid out, it's kind of what frames your guidance. It doesn't seem as though that you're expecting an overly aggressive promotional holiday as of now. Is that correct?","Hubert Joly","I think we expect something as usual, in general terms. Let me add a couple of comments to what Sharon was saying and to your question. The trend we're seeing is that we are outperforming the industry and based on our value proposition and great execution.","You saw that in Q3. You've seen what other retailers have reported as relates to consumer electronics. You've seen our results and you've seen - you've heard our confidence getting into Q4, in terms of our ability to win and execute some of the investments we're making and some uncertainty around the market and I think you'll see us transparent on that.","Regarding the price \u2013 the proportionality, we don't see anything unusual for this quarter. In fact, if anything, it's possible that given some of the industry trends and the difficulty of competing in consumer electronics, some retailers and we have commented on that last quarter, are less enthusiastic about this category.","The potential flip side that you could see of course again in the spirit of transparency, if the market is bad you can always have the risk of people wanting to liquidate their inventory, but that's not the ongoing assumption and we think we're competitively priced and we think we're going to win.","Brian Nagel","Got it. That's very helpful. I appreciate all the color.","Hubert Joly","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Peter Keith [Piper Jaffray]","Peter Keith","Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted just to ask about the growth investments that you are making, $100 million for this year. It clearly looks like these are working and it's allowing you to take share.","How should we think about this on a go forward basis, is this something now that we should expect to maybe $100 million per year next year and going forward?","Sharon McCollam","No. Yes, we are going to continue to make investments. But as we look to fiscal '17 and we start to see benefits coming from other initiatives that we are currently working on, what our anticipation is in fiscal '17 is that the growth investments are going to be offset with cost reductions and other eliminations of waste inefficiency in the company.","Peter Keith","So just to understand, would that be a net neutral impact or do you think with the Renew Blue cost reductions which seem to be pretty comparable to the growth investments this year that looking forward the cost reductions would outpace the growth investments?","Sharon McCollam","I think that next year we will definitely offset the investments and then what we recover out of the Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reductions, we will see some upside, but a large portion of the savings next year again will be offset with the investments.","Peter Keith","Okay. Very good. And I just wanted to pivot quickly to mobile. And it seems the industry is changing to more broad-based installment billing platform. And I wondered to get your take on how that might change your competitive positioning. Does that change your ability to take share, and what might it do to the frequency of upgrades in your view?","Hubert Joly","Yes, we are excited about the shift to installment billing. We are as a retailer, we are very well positioned to offer these plans, both online and in the stores, again, the only one to offer that from the three retailers. So another thing that's going to be helpful to us is these carrier stores within the stores that will continue to improve the experience for the customers.","The churn in the industry is very low. So most of the customers are interested in having a very tight connection to the carrier and the degree of expertise in our stores, the dedication to individual carriers, the access, the complete access to the carrier\u2019s products and services, systems and so forth is going to be very helpful.","And then beyond mobile, as the business shifts towards connected and smart devices, one of the great assets we have that we've talked about in the past is our ability to connect other devices and win in that next wave of technology innovation.","So as the business transitions, we're evolving the business model and we're excited about the opportunities.","Peter Keith","Okay. Thank you very much. Good luck this holiday.","Hubert Joly","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Lasser [UBS Investment Bank]","Michael Lasser","Good morning. And thanks for taking my question. So your guidance implies that you're going to sustain this rate of out performance versus the industry of about 400 to 500 basis points. How long do you think you can maintain that gap with the sector?","Hubert Joly","Thank you, Michael, for your question and highlighting by how much we are beating competition or winning in the marketplace. We think we have a long runway. If you average market share as cross all of the categories in which we compete, it's around 15%. Now, of course it varies by product categories and types of customers.","But our share of wallet of existing customers is not that high. So jokingly I tell our teams, as long as we're below 90% market share we have a long runway, as you can appreciate, we love that.","Clearly we have a lot of runway to continue to grow. And then of course, we're going to play where the puck is going. Industry and our business is characterized by waves of technology and planning where the next waves are is something that Best Buy is very good at. And as the business moves to connected devices, the Internet of Things, we're extremely well positioned to win these waves. So we see - in the short term we see no limits to our ability to grow that - continue to grow that.","Michael Lasser","That's helpful. My follow-up question is Hubert, the fourth quarter in the consumer electronics space is a little different than the first three quarters of the year. The first three quarters of the year you have to be price competitive against other players who are trafficking in electronics. In the fourth quarter, in the holiday, you're competing against other product categories for wallet share.","So I think everyone appreciates that your prices on consumer electronics for the Black Friday ad are competitive. But how do you think about the cross-price elasticity of demand. So if sweaters are going to be 75% off, perhaps that will look more compelling to a consumer over the next couple of months versus buying a TV that may not have as much of a discount.","And if we see that shape up, will you have to get progressively more promotional as we get closer to Christmas, especially in light of what looks like pretty heavy inventory positions, given that your inventory outpaced your sales by a few hundred basis points. Wal-Mart and Target talked about their weakness in consumer electronics. And so arguably the industry's heading into this holiday with a pretty heavy inventory position?","Hubert Joly","Thank you, Michael. There is indeed a risk that I mentioned, that we talked about, which is if the industry is soft then there's this risk of people being desperate and liquidating their inventory. We don't think that's the main thesis at this point in time.","But going back to the fight against the sweaters, our teams completely understand that. I mean, I'm very proud of our team, and which is one of the reasons why we vote early and often. We start our marketing campaigns early in the season.","You've seen us in fact before the end of October starting to talk to customers, because we want to be front-end center. I think that in the apparel category I think you've seen a lot of softness, frankly, with somehow the products in that category don\u2019t seem to be resonating that well with consumers.","In many ways in the consumer market, in consumer electronics in particular, great supply creates demand. And I think the products we have, the assortment, the customer experience can be extremely exciting. If you gave me time I could try to sell each one of you on the call some great products. But I'm not sure Sharon will let me do that.","So we understand it's a broader battle. We understand the game is different and we play it slightly differently than in the rest of the year, focusing on product, product availability, being price competitive and being very convenient with delivery.","Our free two day delivery capabilities are very significant. So you can feel how excited and good we feel about this fight. Bring them over, we're ready.","Sharon McCollam","And if you take a look, I'll just add to that, when you look at the outside of Best Buy industry data points about what people believe is going to be big sellers for holiday, even NPD put out a holiday outlook and within that one of the top categories that they expected was around video games and tech type items.","In addition to that, they thought that one of the biggest sellers this holiday, big drivers of holiday is going to be big screen TVs where we continue to have such substantial share and as you guys know, probably the best assortment in all of retail.","So we are so prepared to take advantage of those as Hubert pointed out and we discussed in the prepared remarks. Our inventories are in probably the best position that we've ever entered fourth quarter in recent history and we feel very confident in our ability to execute that.","And reminder that it's hard to execute, when you are going into these categories that carry such large scheme, you really need capabilities in that area, I know \u2013 and so whether you're selling it through the stores or selling it online, you need very strong capabilities.","Not every one is going to come out of the chute really great at this. So I think there are a list of competitive advantages, but there are numerous external data points that you can research that are saying that this is going to be a very strong category this holiday.","Michael Lasser","Understood. Thanks so much and have a good holiday.","Hubert Joly","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Anthony Chukumba [BB&T Capital Markets]","Anthony Chukumba","Good morning. And thanks for taking my question. Actually had a little bit of a different question, specifically on I guess capital allocation. You bought back over $300 million of common stock in Q2 and then you only bought back $64 million in Q3 and your stock price is pretty depressed throughout the quarter.","So I guess I was just wondering first off, why the sequential decline in terms of share repurchases in Q3 versus Q2 and also what your thoughts are going forward? Thanks.","Sharon McCollam","Thank you, Anthony. We will continue. As you know, we've got $1 billion authorization out there's as you pointed out. We bought over $300 million in Q3 and then the - in Q2 and then the additional in Q3.","We do expect to continue to purchase our shares under that program, and we see our stock currently just like you do, as a value.","Hubert Joly","All in.","Anthony Chukumba","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to David Magee [SunTrust Robinson Humphrey]","David Magee","Yes. Hi, everybody. Good morning.","Hubert Joly","Good morning, Dave.","David Magee","I just had two questions. One being with regard to the NPD data, what do you think is driving that number lower of late? And then my second question is, I'm curious whether you think it's the weather or is it the Texas impact or some combination?","Then my second question has to do with the service investment and price, and what your plans might be to communicate those to customers? Thank you.","Hubert Joly","So as relates to NPD, the change in trajectory \u2013 so you have two parts in your question. One is why was Q3 lower than Q2 in a sense, from a trend standpoint and what has happened during the quarter. The first thing I think we all have to recognize is the nature of this industry is to have some volatility, right, because it's so hit driven, product innovation driven, and so forth.","I think we also have to remember that Q2 was relatively better compared to previous trends, so we saw a difference. The most significant in a sense is the change in trajectory within the quarter that was quite significant.","What exactly drove the change in trajectory was \u2013 there is two aspects. One, it was broad based, but then there is some product specific elements. I think it's a widespread elements that's widely known is the decline \u2013 the sharp declines of tablets. It is - this is a category in which we have a very large market share of course. It impacts us. But from an industry standpoint there was a significant decline in that.","Now since then, there is been new product introductions that we can all be very familiar with. Does the weather plays a role, I think the apparel players would have spoken about this. Our science is not sophisticated enough, the people in particular in Minnesota like to go to their lake rather than shopping, don't think so, okay. So that's the color I would give.","Looking ahead, again to the extent that there is amazing great products and so forth, number one it can help the industry and certainly will help us and we'll take advantage of it.","I would like to ask you David to repeat your question around service, because I'm not sure I fully understand it. Do you mind repeating it because I want to do a great job of answering your question?","David Magee","Sure, Hubert. And thank you for that answer. My second question has to do with just the price investments you're making on service. I know that's a big part of the future there in terms of developing that business further.","I'm curious what the plans would be in terms of getting consumers aware of Geek Squad and perhaps lower pricing and improving that awareness?","Hubert Joly","Yes, thank you for that question. So let's clarify first what we've done, what the impact is and what we have still ahead of us around that. So what we've done is we've redefined the service offering, with the Geek Squad services for computing and tablet we launched that on September 13 with Geek Squad Protect & Support Plus, and we also launched AppleCare ramping up our Apple product service provider capabilities.","So we've changed the offering, moving away from sure warranties to something that is helpful to customers and we've materially lowered the price. I think that this is something we've been consistent in wanting to be price competitive.","Our field stores are very excited about this. The service offering is very exciting. We've seen initial pickup in the attach rate. We're very excited about that. We also know that perceptions change slowly and like our previous investments.","We do expect that it's going to take time before it picks up fully. We don't expect in this category to completely offset, to have elasticity completely offset the price investments, but we do expect to make progress.","The actions we are taking to help the customers be aware of that is the training and the proficiency of our blue shirts and of course the Geek Squad agents. We are also investing on the site. And I think that in the quarters ahead we'll see continued progress.","More broadly, because this is just one small first step in our services strategy, and if you step back, what we've said is that services is actually playing - will play a bigger role than just being a revenue and profit center. Services for us can be a part of the value proposition.","So if you're going to buy a big TV, if it's going do be above 55 or 60 inches, you want somebody to deliver it and install it for you and do it really well and of course we have unique capabilities. We also see services being a growth driver.","So when we have somebody coming to your house, who understand your needs and build a solution for you, we are not going to charge for the in-home visit, but this is - this has the ability to drive business and we see it today with our Magnolia Design Centers and thus know where it's coming from.","And then as we continue to innovate our services and evolve the positioning of the brand you're going to see it appear more and more in our various marketing vehicles. Its true today a little bit on the site.","It's true in the circular in our \u2013 in the stores, with everything we've done and that's going to be consistent in the last 3 years of our transformation is gradual and incremental. We've started that journey and you're going to see us continue moving forward in that direction. So more to come.","David Magee","Thank you for that.","Operator","We'll go to our last question from Greg Melich [ISI Group]","Greg Melich","Great. Thanks. I had two questions. Hopefully one that's more for Sharon, another one more for Hubert. Sharon, I want to understand the gross margin impact that you were calling out on services, pricing and how we should think about it vis-\u00e0-vis the periodic profit share.","If I get this right, that goes from 20 bps in the third quarter to 50 bps in the fourth quarter of help and we should think of service as like a 20, 25 bps offset to pricing. Is that - am I thinking about that right?","Sharon McCollam","Yes, that's right. When you take a look at Q4, Greg, let me try to reconcile it for you. Last year in Q4 we earned $1.48. The Canadian brand consolidation is costing us about $0.06 to $0.08 and then in addition to that, the tax rate last year at 34.5 going up to the current rate is going to of cost us about 0 $0.05 to $0.06.","So if you just go back and you take those up against last year, that really puts last year's EPS at about $1.35 on a comparable basis to what we have this year.","Greg Melich","Got it.","Sharon McCollam","Then when you go into the outlook I gave you, we talked about the fact that we've got the 25 basis point investment in services pricing. So that's going to come off the gross profit rate. We have the higher distribution cost associated with growth in the online channel and then the appliance and large screen TVs, large tube costs will hit us in Q4. Of course, we're going to have the revenue as well. And then there is some product mix issues that we are expecting to hit us in Q4.","And then all of those down sides will be offset by the 55 basis point profit sharing benefit. So when you're really thinking about this outlook, when you get down to the EPS range that you got when you take the enterprise level reduction on the OI rate, quite frankly it's starting to look a lot like last year and maybe even on the high end a little bit better.","Greg Melich","And the 55, how much of that is catch-up, and effectively where at the end of the year you're truing up, that they are just, you know, the warranties does not costing as much or is this an ongoing type number?","Sharon McCollam","Yes. So it is always, the way this periodic payment works, it is always a settling up of prior reserves. And the settlement is usually only done once a year. If you go back in history, some years we had one, some years we didn't.","But we have made such substantial changes in the programs. Best Buy has taken action. We put deductibles in on the phone repair, which we were the only ones in the industry historically that didn't have one, you recall that.","We had some plans that were multi-year plans. We have had repair reductions where we're doing the repairs. We are sourcing parts differently. There are all kinds of changes that we have made in the last couple of years, Greg, that operationally are driving this.","In addition, at the same time that we were making operational improvement around the fulfillment of claims associated with the extended warranties, from an industry point of view and this is really a quality, vendor quality point of view, the devices have been extremely durable and we have not seen the frequency of claims. So the combination of those are driving that.","Now, I can tell you that in fiscal '17 in the prepared remarks we said we do not know what this will be and we do not believe it will be as high as it is this year. There will be next year it will come in Q4, there will be some level, our gut tells us, you never know for sure, but we believe there will be a periodic payment next year.","This year I think \u2013 we think it is unusually high. In addition, there is the premiums we pay. Every time we sell a new warranty there will be premiums that we pay to the insurer to take on that liability.","And because of these factors our premiums went down in the back half of this year. They will continue into next year and then on top of that we will see another likely premium adjustment downward next year.","So we can talk more about it in the one-on-one call if you'd like further color, so that I can get to your second question. But\u2026","Greg Melich","That's very helpful. I did want to ask a bigger picture one that I think is important. Hubert, on your prepared comments you mentioned all the store within a store programs, the Samsung Open Houses, the new Apple stores. Could you give us some metrics as to how that's really helping drive the business a bigger ASPs and conversion.","If we think about it over the last two or three years, have we moved from 10% to 25% of sales that are store within a store or one of these type programs or how can we kind of frame that or how do you think about it?","Hubert Joly","Yes. Thank you for your question. It's been such an important part of our journey. For me, the most important driver, impact of these stores within the stores has manifested itself in our market share gains. The customer experience we provide is massively better and improved. The experience of the customers has changed dramatically.","And so we're seeing more expertise, better experience resulting in market share gains and we see that in all of the categories and clearly the vendors see that as well because they've continue to look at that.","Now, it's an ongoing process. Looking ahead, we'll want to make sure that a key factor for our profitability is profit per square feet, per square foot. And so as we look ahead with our various vendors and the various parts of our stores, we'll want to continue to optimize that, so that we win with the customers.","Certainly we want to win for our vendors, but we also want to win for us and drive - continue to drive great outcomes. When you are in our stores and of course every store is different, but there is some stores where these stores within the stores with the addition of the Pacific Kitchen & Home and within our design centers, today occupy a large part of the store, so they are big part of our winning with customers.","Greg Melich","That's great. Have a happy Thanksgiving. Good luck.","Hubert Joly","Thank you so much, Greg.","Hubert Joly","So in summary, we feel great quarter in Q3. We \u2013 the combination of online revenue growth and margin expansion in Q3 in the environment that we are all familiar with it is a great outcome. Hopefully you felt our excitement for Q4.","Hopefully you felt that we tried to provide as much color as possible on the outlook and we'll see you either in stores or online. Remember to shake your phone with the app to get access to our agents and blue shirts. And thank you for your continued support in the company. Have a great day, great holiday everyone.","Operator","That does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation."],"3640":["Best Buy Co., Inc.

Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our Chairman and CEO; and Sharon McCollam, our CAO and CFO.","This morning's conference call must be considered in conjunction with the earnings press release we issued this morning.

These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to facilitate meaningful year-over-year comparisons, which should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, and should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures for the period.

The consumer electronics industry, as defined and tracked by the NPD Group, includes TVs, desktop and notebook computers, tablets, not including Kindle, digital imaging and other categories. Sales of these products represent approximately 65% of our Domestic revenue. It does not include mobile phones, appliances, services, gaming, Apple Watch, movies and music.","Final housekeeping item before I turn the call over to Hubert, beginning in January fiscal 2017 we will no longer issue an interim holiday press release due to the increasing significance of the month of January for overall fourth quarter financial results.","I will now turn the call over to Hubert.","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with a real fourth quarter and annual performance and then provide an overview of the next phase of our Renew Blue strategy. I will then turn the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook.","From a financial perspective, in the fourth quarter we delivered Enterprise revenue of $13.62 billion, improved our non-GAAP operating rate by 10 basis points to 5.9% and delivered a better than expected non-GAAP EPS of $1.53 versus $1.48 last year.","In our Domestic business, we exceeded our bottom line expectations due to a well executed holiday plan, a disciplined promotional strategy, better recovery on returns and clearance products and strong expense management.","While Domestic revenue declined 1.5%, it was against a backdrop where the NPD-reported categories were down 5.1%.","Strong performance in health & wearables, home theater and appliances was more than offset by softness in the mobile phone category and continued declines in tablets. In addition, we continued to drive significant growth in the online channel with e-commerce revenue increasing nearly 14% to 15.6% of total Domestic revenue.","In the International business, our performance was better than expected on the top and bottom lines. While revenue declined 26.2% due to the expected impacts of foreign currency and store closures in Canada, revenue retention from the brand consolidation continued to exceed our expectations. This high retention in addition to a more effective promotional strategy drove a 30 basis point increase in the International non-GAAP operating income rate to 4.7%.","On a full-year basis, fiscal 2016 marks the second year in a row we increased our Domestic revenue and expanded our operating margin. We also continued to make significant progress against our Renew Blue strategy.","So during the year, we continued to gain share in appliances in nearly all of our traditional consumer-electronics categories, we grew Domestic online revenue 13% to over $4 billion or 11% of total Domestic revenue. We increased our Net Promoter Score by over 300 basis points. We continued to improve our employee engagement scores and decreased employee turnover. We deepened our partnerships with the top tech companies in the world. We delivered $150 million against our $400 million Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization programs. We consolidated brands and embarked on a significant transformation in Canada including the closure of 68 stores. And finally, in one year we returned $1.5 billion in cash to shareholders including $1 billion in share repurchases, which was originally planned to be completed over three years. This performance is the direct result of the execution of our Renew Blue strategy and the hard work, dedication and customer focus on the part of all of our associates. I am proud to recognize them publicly this morning.","Turning to fiscal 2017, we are entering the next phase of our Renew Blue strategy. Our purpose, from the customer's standpoint, is to build a company that does a unique job of helping customers learn about and enjoy the latest technologies. As we begin this next phase, in fiscal 2017 we will execute against the following priorities. Number one, build on our strong industry position and multichannel capabilities to drive the existing business; number two, drive cost reduction and efficiencies; and number three, advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation.","So our first priority is to build on our strong industry position and multichannel capabilities to drive the existing business. More specifically, we will implement a number of initiatives across merchandising, marketing, digital, stores, services and supply chain. For example, in home theater, we will build on the superior customer experience we've created in partnership with our key vendors and leverage the strength of our market-leading share in 4K and large-screen televisions.","We will also add five Magnolia Design Center stores within a store, bringing our total to 84 by year-end. In appliances, we expect to continue to grow our market share by adding an incremental 27 Pacific Kitchen & Home stores within a store bringing our total to 203 at year-end, and by leveraging the new vendor appliance experiences that were launched in Q3 of last year. Additionally, we expect to see incremental growth from our enhanced delivery and installation offerings which are driving higher conversion and material improvements in NPS, Net Promoter Score.","In connected home, we will continue to increase our assortment in emerging categories including security, lighting and video monitoring, expand our in-store presentation and leverage our leading position in routers and networking equipment, which form the backbone of the connected home.","In mobile phones, we will capitalize on the customer experience investments we implemented late last year, with an expectation to drive increased conversion as well as reduced wait time for our customers. Our strategy is to be an advocate for every phone order by offering the best deal on plans and devices, impartial advice and clarity and efficiency in what can be a complex process.","In the very short term we believe high smartphone penetration combined with low consumer demand for current product offerings is depressing the category. Over the course of the year, we believe that more compelling phone launches can fuel renewed growth in the category.","From an online standpoint, we will continue to build out new digital capabilities, prioritizing the customer shopping experience on phone and tablet devices. Examples of recent advances include the successful Q4 launch of BlueAssist which allows customers to simply shake their device to get live help with products and orders through chat, call and email. Another example is Touch ID login, including our latest mobile app updates and of course, our recently launched Geek Squad app.","In our retail stores, we will continue to drive increased sales proficiency and further leverage our service capabilities. In fiscal 2016, our Blue Shirts and Geek Squad Agents contributed significantly to our NPS and market share gains and we believe there continues to be significant further opportunity to take this competitive advantage to the next level. And then finally, in our International business we remain focused on our Canadian transformation, we will continue to invest in our stores and online channel to improve the customer experience and financial performance.","Our second priority for fiscal 2017 is to reduce cost and drive efficiencies throughout the business. Reducing cost is essential for us to be able to fund our investment, build our resilience to product cycles and increase our profitability over time. Furthermore, based on current economic factors and softness in the consumer electronics industry, it is essential that we be proactive on the cost reduction front. The key elements of our approach to achieving this is to simplify our business processes to simultaneously improve the customer experience and drive cost out.","As an example, we have a project focused on reducing the amount of open box appliances we take into our stores by addressing root cause issues. This project has the potential to not only improve the customer experience, but also to drive material savings through lower markdowns, lower transportation cost and better use of labor in our stores and distribution centers.","More broadly, we aspire to achieve world-class operational levels of performance defined in terms of quality, service and cost. This focus has to be a way of life, especially given our margin structure and the volatility of our industry.","Last year, we announced a specific cost reduction and gross profit optimization program called Renew Blue Phase 2 with a goal of $400 million over three years on top of the $1 billion we eliminate as part of Phase 1. Against that goal, in fiscal 2016 we achieved $150 million, leaving us with $250 million. In light of our increased focus on cost and productivity, we believe there are incremental savings that can be achieved above and beyond our current goal which we will update you on as we progress.","Partially offsetting these savings will be our expected future investments in the areas of labor expertise, services pricing and key growth initiatives which I will discuss in a moment. In fiscal 2016, these investments totaled approximately $100 million and we expect a similar level in fiscal 2017 which, to be clear, will be funded by our cost savings.","Our third priority is to advance key initiatives to more deeply transform Best Buy in order to drive future growth and differentiation. While there may be short-term pressures, we continue to believe we operate in an opportunity-rich environment, the advent of the Internet of Things is providing a new technology way that is making Best Buy's operating model increasingly relevant to customers. We are investing to be the leading technology expert, who makes it easy to learn about and confidently enjoy the best tech.","In this context, we believe we have ongoing growth opportunities around key product categories as well as from increasing share of wallet with existing customers and acquiring new customers within our target segments who are those of us passionate about technology and need help with it.","Capturing these opportunities will require that we do the following: Number one, develop and bring to market curated, solution driven merchandise to solve key customer problems, in particular in new growth areas. Number two, ensure we have an inspirational and educational sales approach across all sales channels that helps customers understand the value that technology can create for them. Number three, help customers unleash what's possible from their technologies and number four, provide customers with ongoing convenient post purchase support. Inherent in all of this is the desire to build a stronger ongoing relationship with our customers.","Now, our services capabilities and Geek Squad are key building blocks of this strategy. We understand that we've discussed service related opportunities many times in the past. And while it is not visible in our services top-line results today, we are in fact making progress to bring these opportunities to life. To do so, we've had to spend time in the last two years fixing many aspects of our traditional warranty and repair businesses. We've also had to adjust our pricing in warranty business.","We are seeing the results of our efforts through substantial increases in Net Promoter Scores, higher total customer interactions, and from a financial point of view, the periodic profit sharing payments we earned this year. We are also beginning to see improved attach rates as we enter fiscal 2017. Building on this, we will continue our work to improve the customer experience and enhance our service offering and capabilities in support of our mission to help customers learn about and enjoy the latest tech. While we are energized by the potential of this opportunity, the work necessary to capture takes time. Thus fiscal 2017 will be another year of gradual and incremental improvement with more meaningful results expected in fiscal 2018.","Now, before I turn the call over to Sharon, I'd like to provide some thoughts about our fiscal 2017 outlook and return of capital plan. So in summary, Best Buy is a specialty retailer that excels in an industry characterized by product innovation cycles. We are undeterred by this fact as we believe there will always be technology innovation. And our imperative is that in these cycles, we continue to deliver superior execution against what is in our control, recognizing that the cycles rarely align at any point in time.","In fiscal 2017, we are focused on continuing to build on our foundation to both drive and capitalize on these technology cycles. And further, we are focused on building the key initiatives that we discussed today that we believe will result in stickier relationship with our customers, provide profitable revenue even during down cycles and continue to create long term shareholder value.","Over time, as the fruit of these key initiatives materialize, we expect to accelerate our revenue and operating income growth by taking advantage of opportunities provided by ongoing technology innovation and the need customers have for help. In the short term, we will be characterized by our strong cash flow generating capabilities and our intent to regularly return excess free cash flow to shareholders.","From a financial outlook perspective for fiscal 2017, based on current industry dynamics and how we see the various product cycles playing out in our Domestic business, we are expecting revenue declines in the first half followed by growth in the back half. We also expect that our strong execution and operational capabilities will allow us to continue to gain market share. In this context, we are targeting flat Domestic revenue for the full year due to continued growth in appliances, connected home and home theater in particular, but recognize that being flat will be challenging without a strong mobile cycle and improvements in the NPD-reported categories overall.","Despite the soft top-line environment, we will target flattish operating income including the lapping of the significant periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio that we earned in fiscal 2016. A key element to achieve this will be the delivery of our cost reduction and gross profit optimization initiatives. In addition, we intend to reward our shareholders by being a premium dividend payer and increasing our earnings per share through ongoing share repurchases.","I would now like to talk about our fiscal 2017 return of capital plan. After three consecutive years of strong cash flow generation and the Renew Blue, we believe that now is an ideal time to provide a view of our long-term capital allocation strategy. This strategy is based on our strong cash position today and our ongoing confidence in our future cash flow generation. At the core of this strategy is our intent to first fund our operations and gross investments including potential acquisitions and then to return the remaining excess free cash flow to our shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining investment-grade credit metrics.","This strategy targets the return of excess free cash flow to shareholders through a 35% to 45% non-GAAP dividend payout ratio and regular share repurchases with a minimum annual expectation of offsetting dilution from equity compensation. So in line with this strategy, our fiscal 2017 return of capital plan includes, number one, a 22% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share. Number two, the intent to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over the next two years. And number three, a special dividend of $0.45 per share or approximately $145 million. This is in addition to the $1.5 billion in cash we returned to shareholders in fiscal 2016.","I will now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our fourth quarter financials and our Q1 fiscal 2017 guidance.","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you in our holiday sales release. Enterprise revenue of $13.6 billion was in line with expectations. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 5.9%, however, exceeded our expectations due to better-than-expected profitability in both our Domestic and International businesses driven by a more effective, disciplined promotional strategy, better recovery on returned and clearance products and an approximate $0.02 of additional EPS from the periodic profit sharing benefit from our externally-managed extended service plan portfolio. Additionally, our non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 34% resulting in an incremental $0.02 of EPS versus expectations.","I will now talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue declined 4.1% to $13.6 billion primarily due to a 1.8% comparable sales decline in the Domestic business, a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 140 basis points, and the negative impact of Canadian store closures. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.05 or 3% to $1.53. This increase was primarily driven by the service periodic profit-sharing benefit of $0.19 and a share repurchase benefit of $0.06. These benefits were partially offset by Domestic revenue declines in the mobile phone, tablet and digital imaging categories and the expected $0.03 negative impact from the Canadian brand consolidation.","In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 1.5% to $12.5 billion this decline was primarily driven by a comparable sales decline of 1.8%, excluding the estimated 10 basis point benefit associated with installment billing and the loss of revenue from 13 large-format and 17 small-format Best Buy mobile store closures. These declines were partially offset by the 10 basis point benefit associated with installment billing and the approximate 80 basis point services periodic profit-sharing benefit, which is not included in our comparable sales calculation.","From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in health & wearables, home theater and major appliances was more than offset by significant declines in mobile phones, tablets, digital imaging and services. In services, comparable revenue declined 11.9% due to investments in services pricing and the ongoing reduction of repair revenue driven by lower frequency and severity of claims on extended warranties.","In our International segment, revenue declined 26.2% to $1.1 billion, due to a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 1,350 basis points, the loss of revenue associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation and ongoing softness in the Canadian economy and consumer electronics industry.","Turning now to gross profit, the Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 30 basis points to 21.6%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 40 basis points to 21.6%. This increase was primarily due to a 65 basis point impact from the services periodic profit-sharing benefit and improved rates in the mobile and computing categories, primarily due to a more disciplined promotional strategy.","These increases were partially offset by an increased mix of lower margin wearable devices, a decreased mix of higher-margin digital imaging products, a lower rate in televisions driven by a decline in average selling prices and higher distribution costs, and our investments in services pricing.","The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 10 basis points to 21.8%. This increase was primarily driven by higher year-over-year gross profit rate in both Canada and Mexico, due to a more disciplined promotional strategy.","Now, turning to SG&A, Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $2.1 billion or 15.7% of revenue, a decrease of $68 million, but an increase of 20 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.95 billion or 15.6% of revenue, and was nearly flat in dollars year-over-year as investments in future growth initiatives and lower vendor funding being recorded as an offset to SG&A were offset by the flow of Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reductions and lower incentive compensation.","From a rate perspective, non-GAAP SG&A increased 30 basis points, primarily driven by year-over-year sales deleverage. International non-GAAP SG&A was $192 million or 17.2% of revenue, a decrease of $70 million or 10 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by the elimination of expenses associated with the Canadian brand consolidation and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates.","Specific to the Canadian brand consolidation, we incurred non-GAAP diluted EPS impact of negative $0.03 in the fourth quarter and negative $0.07 for fiscal 2016. These impacts were lower than expected due to higher sales retention from closed stores, a more disciplined promotional strategy and our decision to transform only a limited number of stores this year in order to pilot results.","In Q1 of fiscal 2017, Canada will still be lapping 68 of its store closures last year and facing ongoing foreign-currency and Canadian economic headwinds. As such, in Q1, we expect International revenue to decline 15% to 20%.","Beginning in the second quarter, and through the balance of the year, while currency and economic headwinds will continue to be a challenge, in constant currency, the International business is expected to be near flat on both the top and bottom line. From a cash flow perspective, on a full year basis, capital expenditures totaled $649 million and we returned $1.5 billion in cash to our shareholders.","In working capital, our decision to bring holiday inventory in early as well as the Super Bowl moving into Q1 fiscal 2017 resulted in us holding inventory longer and having to settle accounts payable prior to year-end. This created a timing issue which resulted in our ratio of accounts payable to inventory being lower at year-end than last year. As we look forward to next year, capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million and the accounts payable to inventory ratio is expected to increase.","I would now like to talk about our Q1 financial guidance. In the Domestic business, we believe that the softness that we saw in the NPD-tracked categories and mobile phones will continue into Q1. We also believe that in the International business revenue will be down the approximate 15% to 20% due to the ongoing impacts of foreign currency and the Canadian brand consolidation, which was not executed until late March of 2015.","With that backdrop, we are expecting Enterprise revenue in the range of $8.25 billion to $8.35 billion and Enterprise comparable sales in the range of negative 1% to negative 2%, primarily driven by continued softness in the mobile and tablet categories. Our non-GAAP effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 39% to 39.5% and our Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.35, assuming a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 326 million.","I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you We'll first go to Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","My questions today focus on the return of capital plan that you outlined, just two questions around that. One, can you explain to us the thinking behind the special dividend versus just increasing the regular dividend or doing more share buyback with that cash? And could you remind us how you are thinking about possible acquisitions and how that can enhance Best Buy over the long term?","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Absolutely, Kate. On the special dividend, very similar to last year, we had these legal settlements that are \u2013 from prior years and they're substantial, you see them when you look at the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. And last year, we returned that through the special dividend to our shareholders. In addition to that we had asset disposals, one was the sale of Europe last year and then we had some small entities that we sold this year, and as those were assets that were part of the existing core base of our business, we think giving that cash back to our existing shareholders makes sense and it's an elegant way to get cash back to our shareholders.","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","And Kate to your question about acquisitions, we do mention acquisitions in the press release and I mentioned them in my prepared remarks, so in answer to your question, the framework is as follows, we have a clear mission which is to do this unique job of helping customers learn about and enjoy technology. Acquisitions would be helpful inasmuch as they bring us capabilities to accelerate our transformation in this direction, that's the first criteria. And of course, the second important criteria, as you would appreciate, is that they'd be financially accretive over time. So that's the backdrop of that nothing eminent, but we thought it was appropriate to share that with you this morning.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Next we will go to Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. From an execution standpoint, it seems that you're doing everything you should and you don't have a lot of control over these cycles, but I did want to focus a little bit on the cycles for a minute and get your view on things like virtual reality, what's in the pipe for mobile that you think is going to turn that business around? Can we get another year out of TV and where do you think connected home starts to hit a sweet spot?","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. So talking about the future in this industry is always interesting. Let me try to be as helpful as possible. As we look ahead, in particular, fiscal 2017, the areas where we see key growth opportunities for us, around appliances where we, as you know, we had multiple quarters, multiple years now of growth and that's going to continue to be driven by the housing recovery. Second is connected objects, so one of the connect \u2013 the Internet of Things, connected home and then of course there is the continued TV cycle.","The specific categories you talk about, so in particular order, virtual reality, we're very excited, we have this promotion if anybody is interested in buying the Galaxy S7. You can preorder now at Best Buy and you get a free virtual-reality gear and then some additional memory, so great value. Clearly (31:45), this is an interesting category. I think it will still be small this year. It may help in the computing category with higher-end computers because you're going to need that computing power, but from a financial standpoint, it's going to be limited. Mobile, I think I'm going to stick to my prepared remarks. It's going to be a function of new products, revising the category. And I'm not going to make any forward-looking statement on that particular point.","TVs, of course, we've been very excited and performing really well with 4K and large screen TVs. Our share has been increasing. Of course, like any cycle, this is not going to continue forever, so it's not going to be as strong going forward as it has been from a growth rate standpoint.","Connected home, I think, is an exciting category. Increasingly, it's not just about the security cameras or the smart locks and so forth. Everything in your home is connected, at least in my home. Your smart TVs is connected, your music, your streaming, your home office is connected, gaming is connected, and of course getting into security, home automation, energy management. And the complexity of this, think about this with the control layer, the security layer, the net working layer, the access layer provides a lot of complexity. And so the continued innovation and the complexity creates a big opportunity for us.","So we're seeing growth. I've made comments about the fact that we are increasing the assortments, the presentation. And we are building on our strengths in routers and networking. So we'll see continued growth in that growth space of connected objects and the Internet of Things.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","And, Sharon, if I could just one follow up on Canada. I think you said operating income flat year-over-year. With the expenses related to the store closings, I thought there was supposed to be a year-over-year swing this year that would be positive. I was wondering if you could just add a little color to that flat operating profit outlook?","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Absolutely. First, there's two things. One is the impact of foreign currency which has been substantial. Remember that that averages into the cost of inventory over time. And as that has been prolonged, that will affect them from a gross profit standpoint. In addition to that, the Canadian economy also has been pretty soft, and we are playing that into our outlook and making sure that we've accounted for what we think is happening there right now. But we could not be more pleased with the consolidation, the retention rate, the execution that has happened up there.","Also lastly, there will also be some additional investments next year, but remember, we're saying we're offsetting our investments as a company. But there will be some investments in these new pilot stores that we are working on. And there's disruption when we're approaching that. So that will be another aspect of it. We're not going to be announcing every quarter a impact of the Canadian brand consolidation and the stores. We're going to treat it pretty much as business as usual. But there is significant investment and it is why the CapEx next year is going up just slightly because that will be higher in Canada.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Two questions, one just on the cost savings versus offset. So you saved about $150 million this year. Did you tell us what the investments were? And then what I'm getting at is then over the next two years, you've quantified $250 million in savings, but $200 million in offsets. So over the course of the three years, that $400 million in savings, how much of that should we expect to flow to the bottom line?","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","So Mike, thank you for your question. An important consideration thinking about fiscal 2017 is the fact we are lapping the periodic payment related to our service portfolio. So that's a meaningful thing. So achieving flattish operating income rate domestically is made possible by these cost savings and this renewed focus. But the general principle, is we are offsetting all of our investments with cost savings and then we are able to lap this periodic payment.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So sort of a net neutral over the three years, it sounds like? If I could ask one more question, just in terms of your stores in the U.S., it looks like you closed about 10 of the big box stores in the U.S., I think about 10 in the quarter, 13 for the year. How should we think about that going forward? I know you don't announce store closures specifically, but should we expect that to continue to come down? And as part of that question, what do the leases look like in terms of expiration? I think 2016 was a heavy year for expirations, can you confirm that?","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, every year here on out is a big year for expirations. We have well over 100 expirations coming into fiscal 2016. And Michael, we will continue to do what we have been doing, which is methodically rationalize the real estate portfolio. The diligence around the renewals is substantial, if we are renewing. Also you can see it in the lease disclosure every year that the term that we're committing to with these leases is shorter, and we will continue to do that to maintain flexibility in the portfolio. But rest assured that we will continue to rationalize as we deem it appropriate.","The great news is that the stores that remain in our portfolio, they are performing. The key for us is improving and increasing our retention rates in the U.S. Unlike Canada where the stores were literally in the same parking lot, a mile away, 3 miles away, in the U.S. we never built our portfolio that way. So you can't immediately extract these really strong results from Canada and assume that if we did that in the U.S. it would look exactly the same.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So what are the expected transfer rates in the U.S. or the experience in the 13 or so stores you closed this year?","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","We haven't given that publicly and we don't know yet, obviously, because many of those stores closed October 1, so you won't know until you've cycled the full year. And we don't actually have, as you know over the last several years we closed about 49 stores, prior to Hubert and I joining the company and we've only had a small number of stores since that time that have actually closed. So from a retention point of view, we're looking at something in the low to mid-30%s and in some of these stores you would need higher retention rates than that in order to justify the store closures.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Now we will go to Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. First on a follow up on the Super Bowl shift, in retrospect now that you've lapped it, can you talk about how much the Super Bowl hurt the fourth-quarter comps and what the lateral benefit is expected to the first quarter?","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Chris, we quantified the impact of the Super Bowl and obviously, the Super Bowl did move. The one thing to keep in mind, just about February, is we had substantial store closures this year as a result of the weather situation, so that put a little bit of an offset to that. But we were very \u2013 we gave you the estimate and we continue to believe that that is what it played out to be.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Understood. And follow up on the prior question about the cycles in the back half outlook, how are you thinking about TV, the TV category as the year progresses from the sales and gross profit dollar perspective? And are you expecting tablets to see any sort of a rebound in the back half as you think about the revenue recovery in the back half?","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Chris, good morning. The further out you go and the more specific the questions are, the harder it is to predict. I shared in my prepared remarks our view that in aggregate for the year, we can be flattish from a top and bottom-line standpoint, in the U.S., there's going to be a lot of moving pieces. TVs, the cycle has been very strong, we've performed extremely well. We expect to continue to perform and do a great job for our customers. We don't expect the growth rates to remain the same, so this is going to slow down.","Tablets, I think it's anybody's guess. I think one of the vendors has made forward-looking comments about tablets, I don't know that I have anything to add to this. So we thought it was helpful and this is the first time we're actually doing this to provide a full year perspective, so taking a bit of a risk here and it's a portfolio view right, and then things will move within that. That's probably the best I can tell you this morning.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Thanks very much.","Operator","We'll now go to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. First, you're targeting flattish operating income next year, you mentioned the CapEx a little bit elevated, is the flattish operating income, notwithstanding that CapEx, is that a reasonable proxy for direction of free cash or are there other items on working capital that will go in your favor?","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","I believe that from a working capital point of view, as I mentioned, this accounts payable to inventory ratio this year was extremely low because of the decisions and the shift of the Super Bowl. Now, next year the Super Bowl will continue to be around the same time, but obviously we'll be lapping that so that won't change, but on the other side of our business we do expect to be increasing that accounts payable to inventory ratio by year-end. So I expect to see a little bit of benefit coming from that.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then a follow up on the services investment, can you tell us how much of the sales pressure is now self-induced because of lower prices versus the change in units or attach rate? And can you remind us, is there any additional benefit from the profit sharing in 2016?","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So several questions, the services revenue decline, there's a piece which we've called nonproductive revenue which is driven by the lower frequency and cost severity related to the claims. As it relates to the productive revenue which is the one that we care about, the trend is starting to evolve because we have the price investment and we have quantified it for you in Q4, and that's going to, of course, carry over into this fiscal year and it is partially offset by the \u2013 we're seeing the beginning of an increase in the attach rate. We never expected the attach rates to fully offset the price investment. This is an area frankly where the elasticity is much lower than on the key hardware categories, but we thought it was the right thing to do from a customer standpoint as we looked ahead.","As it relates to the periodic payment from the warranty portfolio, last year was an exceptional year. And we've disclosed every quarter the amounts. It was driven by, again, the improved performance of our service portfolio, so nothing to be shy about around that. But this was an exceptional year because it was multiple \u2013 it was twice the amount. Now, looking ahead in this fiscal year, we'll get some continued improvement in that business as the improved operational performance, severity and frequency will carry over not so much in the form of periodic payment, but in the form of lower cost charged to the portfolio. Not nearly close to the amount of fiscal 2016, but some portion. Now, what's exciting for us is that we get to lap the partly exceptional payment last year and we're able to do this through the increased focus on cost and efficiency.","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","And Simeon, I'll just add that Hubert also, in his prepared remarks, mentioned that as we got towards the Q4, the pricing was in place, et cetera, we did start seeing some uptick in our attach rates in the services business, which was the foundation of the investment in the services pricing and the launch of AppleCare, et cetera. So on that side of it, we are pleased with how that is playing out for us from a strategic point of view.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. Good luck.","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. I think, one of the things you talked about as a benefit for this past holiday season was the expectation for improved in-stock levels given the prior year's launch of ship from store. Can you help quantify what the comp impact was that you think you experienced from the improved inventory levels? And related to that, are there opportunities to further improve in stock or are you where you want to be at this stage?","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks for the questions, Scot. Yes, there is no question that we improved our in stock levels, and what is terrific is that our customers noticed it. This was an area where we received recognition in our Net Promoter Score from our customers. Now, in order to do that, you heard me just mention this accounts payable to inventory ratio. We did bring our inventories in earlier and customers are shopping earlier and earlier, so that in retrospect has turned out to be an excellent decision for us.","In addition to that, we have had a significant focus on restocking in our stores and have made some operational changes in our stores for down stocking. That also paid dividends to us during the fourth quarter. In addition, on ship from store, we continue to believe that strategically ship from store will go down in our history at Best Buy as one of the most important and strategic decisions that we made because it is allowing us to utilize both our online and our retail inventories to serve the online customer. And it has obviously \u2013 you've seen the strength of our online growth, that business now is over $4 billion. And what ship from store is allowing us to do is be able to on a consistent basis make marketing promises to customers about speed of delivery. So to your question on, we said we were going to do this, was there a positive outcome \u2013 clearly there was a balance sheet investment as it related to that accounts payable to inventory ratio. The answer is yes, we did it, it worked and we're very pleased with it and we will continue to make additional changes where we believe it's necessary, but Hubert and I in no way believe that we have solved our in-stock issue.","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, in my prepared remarks more broadly, going beyond (48:40) inventory and in stock, we believe that operationally, from sales proficiency in particular, we have the opportunity to continue to drive increased performance in our stores and, of course, in our online channel as well, we are not finished. That's really \u2013 fits with the first priority I laid out, we have multiple opportunities there, we are very clear about them.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I think that all makes sense? Is there any way to quantify what the comp impact was, Sharon?","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","That is really difficult to do, particularly at retail. If I could get that exact number, I would love to have it too Scot, but it's really difficult to calculate, so no, I'm not ready to put a number out there to say it drove x basis points of comp, but what I can tell you is that conversion both in the retail stores and in the online channel was a driver. We had the softness in mobile and we know that, but we would've been positive without that. And conversion was a significant contributor to those results and obviously, that is one of the hardest things to move and we feel very good about how we've driven the business.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got you. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","And now we will go to Joseph Feldman with Telsey Group.","Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask something a little broader maybe about the consumer. And just kind of what you're seeing from the consumer, or from your market research and studies and surveys of the consumer. Are you seeing any changes, I guess, within categories of what consumers are buying? Is there any change in appetite for services? I mean, I know what the service sales rates are, but I guess I'm trying to get at, like has there been a demand change, more broadly speaking, and within economic, kind of, classification like high or low income?","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, the U.S. consumer, we could spend the next 30 minutes on that. We are pleased with the mind and the spirit of the U.S. consumer, certainly compared to many other geographies outside of the U.S. Demand is there, you see it when you see the growth in appliances, continued growth in appliances, that is a very strong wave. In our category, I think we all have to bear in mind that demand is driven by supply, so when there's great, exciting innovation you get that. Because most of what we sell is not the basic Maslovian need on the part of our customer. So this is an industry where great supply creates demand, and we're excited about the technology waves that are coming above and beyond the softness that has existed in phones.","From a services standpoint, I would say two things. One is, there's clear demand for help on the part of the customer. Now, the customer, all of us don't always want to pay for service and we will provide and we're providing service today in order to generate more demand, so when we have Magnolia system designers coming to your home that's going to generate demand, but their visit is free and we're happy to come to your home, everybody on the call, we'll come to you. Tech support, however, above and beyond the self-help is something that customers are happy to pay for and we are seeing increased demand in this area. So the summary is that we believe we have an opportunity-rich environment and that the key trends are made for Best Buy, based on these technology waves and the need that customers have for help.","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","And Joe, I'll just add that from a metric point of view, what can you see, the average order value at Best Buy, again when you look at what contributed to the outcome of Q4, we saw that again increased. So, again, the high-end consumer, I believe there is a lot of noise around the high-end consumer which we of course cater to here at Best Buy and the data that's what the metrics would tell you about that consumer, obviously conversion was up and average order value, both retail and online.","Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","That's great. Thanks guys, and I'll let somebody else go next. Thanks.","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Chukumba with BB&T Capital Markets.","Anthony Chinonye Chukumba - BB&T Capital Markets","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just circle back on the shop-in-shops, obviously you've had some of those for quite some time now and so I wanted to get an update just in terms of how they're performing versus the rest of the house? And then just any indication if you think that there might be additional shop-in-shops to come? Thank you","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning Anthony. The shop-in-shop with the \u2013 so there's two types of shop-in-shop, there's the vendors, the vendor's shop-in-shop and then there's the Magnolia Design Centers and Pacific. In general, these enhanced customer experiences have been a key element of our transformation because it has allowed us to renovate our stores, increase the customer experience, provide more expertise to our customers. And we're very excited about this.","Increasingly, it's difficult to measure because as many of you visit our stores, the shop-in-shop are in many, many of our stores, so it's really hard to measure scientifically with great precision, however, when you see increased market share there is no doubt and as an example, increased market share in 4K, in high-end TVs or in appliances, there's no doubt that this has been a key driver of our performance.","Looking ahead, there's no doubt that in terms of physical shop-in-shop, there's less to be done, right because we have high penetration of these shop-in-shops. So I think that looking ahead, we have the opportunity to partner, in some cases, more deeply with the vendors, in particular, in how we deliver this promise of making it easy to learn about and enjoy the technologies. So around help and service and classes, I think there is a deeper integration opportunities with the vendors and we're excited about that as well.","Anthony Chinonye Chukumba - BB&T Capital Markets","That's helpful. Thank you.","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And our final question will come from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse.","Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks, guys. Good morning. I was wondering if you could help us understand the complexion of that remaining $250 million of Renew Blue savings that you are attacking? And I realize it's early, but any examples of the incremental opportunities that you alluded to earlier and the timing of that?","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","From a identification standpoint, we have a robust list of actions that we are going against. And we believe that we will be revealing those over time to you. We've put the $400 million out there and obviously, you know that we don't communicate anything that we don't have the exact execution plan behind it to you guys. So as we start developing those plans and they become more crystallized, we will definitely be communicating that. What we wanted to make sure that you guys took away from today's call is that that $400 million is the bottom of what we believe is possible and that with these additional opportunities, that we've been identifying in the back half of this year, that we continue to believe that there is substantially more opportunity there.","So we'll keep you posted as we go, let's get the $400 million delivered as well and then we can talk about more, but there's no doubt that based on some of the looking we're doing \u2013 and you guys, these are very structural and they're going to come through the product flow and how it comes through Best Buy, it's going to come through our return process, especially on large cube inventory there is so much opportunity there. There's recovery on inventory that is returned, it's how we handle the movement across the United States of some of our larger cube inventory. This comes in many forms. The great news is it comes in many forms. And there is no lap of opportunity and I'm going to take one more minute just to lay a backdrop for why is there this much opportunity at Best Buy.","The reason we have these opportunities is because if you think about the growth years for Best Buy, they were opening 50 stores a year and adding $1 billion to $2 billion a year of incremental revenue. And during that time, when you have that kind of growth, trying to keep pace with all of the operational excellence that goes behind that, what you end up doing is creating a large number of triage processes, meaning that well, we don't have the systems to do this, so we're going to create this workaround and it will work. And then the workaround gets bigger and bigger and bigger as the company continued to grow. But just about the time they get ready to fix it, they just added another 50 stores and another $2 billion worth of revenue and of course that was the focus back then.","Now that the company has reached such scale, these opportunities, these workarounds have become very costly and thus the opportunity that we have to take them out, but leave it to understand that they are structural and a lot of change has to happen and that's why you don't just throw them out there on a list and say yeah, I totally am going to be communicating that, we need to give you guys clarity to the roadmap.","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","So maybe it's the time, a few words of closing remarks. First of all, of course we were pleased this morning to share some of our good news about earnings and our plans to return capital to shareholders. Hopefully, you feel that we're quite excited about opportunities going forward, and proud of our execution capabilities. So I certainly want to again thank our associates who are behind this execution capability, and thank you for your continued support. So all of us here wish you a terrific day.

[Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Mollie O'Brien","Thank you, and good morning, everyone.","Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; Matt Bilunas, our CFO; and Mike Mohan, our President and COO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning\u2019s earnings release, which is available on our website investors.bestbuy.com.","Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial conditions, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the Company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.","Please refer to the Company\u2019s current earnings release and our most recent 10-K for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.","I will now turn the call over to Corie.","Corie Barry","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.","Today, we reported $9.54 billion in revenue, expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate by 20 basis points, and delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.08, which was up 19% compared to the second quarter of last year. Our comparable sales growth of 1.6% was on top of a very strong 6.2% last year and within our guidance range for the quarter. The international segment comparable sales declined 1.9%, driven primarily by continued soft macroeconomic conditions in Canada.","Our domestic segment comparable sales were up 1.9% as we continue to drive the customer experience across online, stores and home. From a product category standpoint, the comparable sales were buoyed by strength in appliances, tablets and headphones, personally offset by declines in gaming and home theater.","The Q2 profitability was better than expected, primarily driven by strong expense management. This points to the culture we have built around driving cost reduction and efficiencies to help fund investments and offset pressures.","Before, I talk about the progress we have made on our Building the New Blue strategy and our continued excitement about our strategic opportunities, I would like to address the latest development on the topic of tariff. As you know, since our last earnings call, the administration finalized the products on List 4 and the timing of their implementation. We were a very active participant in the official comment process, and we are pleased, the administration decided to delay the effective date of many of the products on the List until December 15th. We believe this will mitigate some of the impact of higher prices for American consumers during the holiday season. So, List 4 tariffs are at a 15% level and have two effective dates.","The first effective date is September 1st, and the most notable affected categories relative to Best Buy are televisions, smart watches and headphones. The second effective date is December 15th and the most notable categories relative to Best Buy are computing, mobile phones and gaming consoles.","Given the trends, many of our vendors are in the process of migrating their manufacturing out of China. Our merchants are also addressing this new contest, with a view to minimize costs and risks while continuing to offer exciting technology products and solutions to our customers. As a result, while there will be some short-term volatility, we expect to adapt to this new environment.","Let me say a few words about the updated annual fiscal \u201820 guidance we are providing today, and that Matt will expand on later in the call. On the topline, we narrowed the revenue range; on bottom-line, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance range. This reflects the continued momentum of our strategic initiatives. It also includes our best estimate of the impact from the List 4 tariffs and the most recent announcement regarding List 3 moving to a 30% rate, net of the actions we are taking to mitigate their impact, including bringing in products ahead of the tariff implementation, decisions around vendor and SKU assortment, promotional and pricing strategies, sourcing changes and other strategies employed in partnership with our vendors.","As others have noted, it is difficult to factor in the uncertainty related to overall customer buying behavior. It is hard to predict how at the macro level consumers will react to higher prices resulting from tariffs. As you would imagine, the general overall volatility in the financial markets adds a level of caution to our outlook.","This is a rapidly evolving situation and our teams are doing an excellent job adapting on a daily basis. As we have said before, we are supportive of free and fair trade between the U.S. and China, and appreciate the delay on many products. And we\u2019re actively engaged in mitigation efforts to minimize the impact on consumers and our business.","The tariffs do not change our excitement about our strategic opportunities, however. And I would now like to talk about the progress we are making on our Building the New Blue strategy. An example of our growing commitment to health, during Q2, we launched a new collection of connected fitness products from some of the world\u2019s most innovative exercise companies, including Hydrow, ProForm, Hyperice and NordicTrack. This new assortment includes a range of connected bikes and rowing machines and recovery system loved by many pro athletes. The collection is available now on bestbuy.com with a new dedicated fitness space coming to more than 100 stores by the end of the year. Our store employees and In-Home Advisors will receive special training to help customers discover, understand and purchase the equipment, whether in a store or in their home. And Best Buy and Geek Squad will manage delivery and installation.","Meanwhile, we continue to make progress both in terms of scaling the GreatCall consumer devices and services, and advancing our commercial monitoring service with a focus on aging seniors.","Last quarter, we updated you on our acquisition of a senior focused health services company called Critical Signal Technologies or CST, to help more quickly scale the commercial monitoring business. Earlier this month, we acquired the predictive healthcare technology business of BioSensics, including the hiring of the Company\u2019s data science and engineering team based in Watertown, Massachusetts. These talented employees drive innovation through wearable sensor technology that addresses some of the biggest challenges faced by the aging population, such as falls. These tuck-in acquisitions together with GreatCall, complement our existing capabilities like Geek Squad and In-Home Advisors to better help seniors live longer in their homes, help reduce their healthcare costs, and bring greater peace of mind for their families and caregivers. We look forward to spending more time on our health strategy at our Investor update next month.","Speaking of Geek Squad, during Q2, we continued to expand our Total Tech Support program, which provides members unlimited Geek Squad support for all their technology, no matter where or when they bought it. We grew the member base at a steady rate while executing on our roadmap to continually improve the customer experience.","Additionally, Best Buy is now fully certified chain-wide as an Apple authorized service provider, becoming the nation\u2019s largest physical destination for Apple authorized repair services, including same day iPhone repairs. Nearly 10,000 of our Geek Squad agents have completed training for all Apple device repairs. And all of our nearly 1,000 stores are equipped with Apple authorized repair tools and parts. As you would imagine, consumers can schedule their repair by going to bestbuy.com, but what you might not know is that they can also go to Apple\u2019s own website to schedule a repair at Best Buy.","More than 200 Best Buy stores across the U.S. have been Apple authorized service providers since 2017 and have enjoyed strong customer satisfaction scores. So, we are pleased to expand that partnership with Apple to provide even more consumers with convenient access to safe and reliable repairs. And it drives traffic. Almost 40% of these Apple repair customers are either new to Best Buy or reengaged Best Buy customers. This is another great example of something we can do with our vendor partners that others cannot.","In addition to tech services, we provide our customers with a number of financing options that help them acquire the products they need and also create stickiness over time with our brand. For example, sales transacted on our Best Buy credit card were 25% of total sales last year, and that number is growing. We always offer customers our branded credit card first. However, there are people who may not be interested in getting a credit card or are unable to qualify for it because of low credit scores, or in many cases, simply no credit history. And that\u2019s where our new lease-to-own program comes in.","Throughout the second quarter, we continued to see customers use lease-to-own to acquire products across a wide variety of categories, with the largest being computing. We also continued to see a significant number of customers take advantage of the 90-day purchase option, which consists of an additional payment plus the retail price.","Later this quarter, we expect to launch lease-to-own in nine more states, including California and New York, which will complete our full 45-state rollout. We believe that this program will build over time as our associates continue to get up to speed on the offer, consumer awareness if it grows and as we enhance the customer experience, both in our stores and online.","As we continue to implement these important customer-facing initiatives, we\u2019re also taking steps to evolve our retail model. In Q2, we made strategic changes to our field operations, to accelerate growth, and to create a more seamless customer experience across all channels. We did this because we know that customers interact with us across all channels, but at times, it can be confusing or repetitive for them to navigate Best Buy as we were organized.","At the same time, as we look at our penetration by geographic market, we see that it varies wildly, yet our tools and structure have been one size fits all for our local markets. So, we have reengineered retail in a way that puts the customer at the center and empowers the local leaders to serve their customers in ways that best suit them and take advantage of local opportunities. We have put single leaders in a position to be accountable for stores, services, supply chain and home propositions in their market.","We believe these changes will simplify processes and allow us to seize growth opportunities within individual markets. It will also create an environment for our employees to grow and allow our teams to collaborate more effectively and efficiently in service of our customers.","One of the opportunities we continue to be the most excited about is home where we continue to increase the number of In-Home Advisors to meet consumer demand, and expect to be at around 700 advisors at year-end.","With the changes we made to our operating model, there is more local leadership support to deepen the advisors development, customer expertise and performance. And we are focused on a seamless customer experience in the home, no matter how it\u2019s delivered.","We also continue to focus on developing digital innovation and marketing strategies to drive engagement with our customers. For example, for back-to-school, we are integrating influencers and YouTube into our advertising in an interactive way. Also this year, we have increased our use of digital videos that feature real life Best Buy associates, providing authentic tech insights. These videos celebrate the passion, expertise and knowledge of our people, highlighting the role they play as inspiring friends for our customers. This is driving increased trust among viewers, and the highest unique viewers and watch times we\u2019ve seen across our YouTube channel.","From a digital innovation standpoint, starting with the Samsung Note 10 launch, bestbuy.com launched the ability for customers to trade in their old phone to purchase a new one, something that was previously only available in physical stores. Since we have expanded this to a multichannel capability, a customer can put the full traded value of their previous phone towards the purchase of a new device instantly, thus improving the customer experience regardless of the channel.","To improve the home theater shopping experience in the app, we launched augmented reality capabilities that can help customers select the right TV. This new capability allows customers to place three dimensional virtual TVs that are correctly scaled to size on a wall or table. This feature is driving higher customer confidence in choosing the right screen size and as a result, higher conversion, and we expect to also reduce returns. Supply chain is also an area where we have strong momentum. Since our last earnings call, we have automated three additional distribution centers across the country. And we will go live with another automated facility prior to the holiday season.","We also relocated one of our local distribution centers to a larger facility to support our growth in major appliances. These changes support our strategy to offer enhanced speed of delivery to customers. As we have shared previously, we offer same-day delivery on thousands of items in 40 metro areas. And while same-day delivery is an important offer, we have found that our customers really value two things: They want free delivery and many want to be able to get it the next day.","We offer next day delivery for thousands of products in 64 metro areas that reach 80% of Best Buy customers. This is free for orders over $35 and does not require a membership fee. Of course, you all know that we also provide our customers the extremely convenient option to pick up their products at one of our nearly 1,000 stores. What you may not realize is that we promise their items to be ready within one hour of placing their order and on average, those orders are ready within just 40 minutes. We also continue to drive efficiencies and reduce costs in order to fund investments and help offset pressures.","During the second quarter, we achieved $155 million in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies, bringing the cumulative total to $730 million since Q2 fiscal 2018. This is toward our fiscal 2021 goal of $600 million. So, we\u2019ve not only exceeded our goal, we did it over a year early. We have now successfully delivered on three considerable cost reduction targets in the last seven years, totaling more than $2 billion. We plan to provide a new long-term cost reduction and efficiency target at our Investor Update next month.","In summary, we are pleased to report strong results for the first half of the year. And we\u2019re excited about the long-term opportunities ahead of us as we continue to make great progress on our Building the New Blue strategy. I want to thank our associates across the Company for their hard work and dedication every day to help deliver on our purpose to enrich lives through technology.","At Best Buy, we strive to be a purposeful, value-driven human organization. With that in mind, we are very proud of the recognition we have received in recent months for being a top employer. We ranked number seven on Forbes list of America\u2019s best employers for women and for the first time earned a spot on the Indeed\u2019s list of the 50 top-rated workplaces. We were also named a best place to work for disability inclusion. And we are changing the world together as noted by Fortune magazine, which recently included us on its Change the World List. This list recognizes companies for using their business strategy and operations to make a positive human, social or environmental impact. All of these awards underscore our mission, which is to build a purposeful company that does good things for the world and great things for all our stakeholders.","Now, before I turn the call over to him, I would first like to say a few words about our new CFO, Matt Bilunas. For obvious reasons, the search for a new CFO was a personal one. First, I was picking the person to take my old job and run a functioning and team I know and love. And second, any CEO will tell you that a strong finance partner is critical to their personal success and the success of the Company they lead. I worked closely with Matt for more than a decade. I trust him and I\u2019m completely confident that his experience, skills and commitment to the Company\u2019s continued growth make him the perfect choice for this role.","I will now turn the call over to Matt.","Matt Bilunas","Thanks, Corie. Good morning, and hello, everyone.","It\u2019s a huge honor to be given the opportunity to help lead this Company forward as CFO. We have made tremendous progress in how we enrich people\u2019s lives through technology, and I am confident we will continue to build even deeper relationships with our customers as we serve them online, in stores and in their homes.","During my 13 years at Best Buy, I\u2019ve had the benefit of being in the field, working with the international team, and leading financial planning and analysis teams during the turnaround effort. Now, I\u2019m excited to lead our world class finance organization, which has been instrumental to our success here at Best Buy.","Now, on to Q2 financial details. Let me begin by talking about our results versus expectations we shared with you last quarter. On enterprise revenue of $9.54 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.08. EPS results exceeded our expectations and our revenue performance was near the midpoint of our guidance range. Our operating income rate exceeded our expectations, primarily due to strong expense management. A lower effective tax rate also provided a benefit of approximately $0.02 versus our earnings per share guidance.","I will now talk about our second quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 1.7% to $9.54 billion, primarily due to the comparable sales increase of 1.6%. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.17, or 19% to $1.08. This increase was driven by one, increased operating income dollars from both the higher operating income rate and higher revenue; two, a $0.05 per share benefit from the net share count change; and three, a $0.04 per share benefit from a lower effective tax rate.","In our domestic segment, revenue increased 2.1% to $8.82 billion. This increase was driven by a comparable sales increase of 1.9% and revenue from GreatCall, which was acquired in October 2018, partially offset by the loss of revenue from 13 format store closure -- large format store closures in the past year.","From a merchandising perspective, the largest comparable sales growth drivers were appliances, which includes both majors and small appliances, tablets and headphones. These drivers were partially offset by declines in our gaming and home theater categories.","In addition, comparable sales in the services category increased 10.7% versus last year. Part of the growth was due to the refinement of revenue recognition for our Total Tech Support offer. In Q4 fiscal 2019, we refined the revenue recognition for a Total Tech Support offer because we had sufficient history of member utilization to move from recognizing revenue on a straight line basis over the membership contract to recognizing revenue on a usage basis, therefore better matching the fulfillment costs with revenue.","This results in more of the annual fee being recognized upfront as the customer usage of the program is heaviest when they first become members. This refinement of revenue recognition impacts new contracts created since the start of our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter on a prospective basis.","Domestic online revenue of $1.42 billion was 16.1% of domestic revenue, up from 14% last year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 17.3% on top of 10.1% growth in the second quarter of last year, which was primarily driven by higher average order values and increased traffic.","In our international segment, revenue decreased 3.4% to $715 million. This was primarily driven by a comparable sales decline of 1.9% and approximately 120 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. The comparable sales decline was driven by Canada and was partially offset by comparable sales in Mexico.","Turning now to gross profit. The enterprise gross profit rate increased 10 basis points to 23.9%. The domestic gross profit rate was 24% versus 23.8% last year. The 20 basis-point increase was primarily driven by the impact of GreatCall\u2019s higher gross profit rate, which was partially offset by higher supply chain costs.","International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 70 basis points to 23.8%, primarily due to a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada, which was driven by higher margin from the services category.","Now, turning to SG&A. Enterprise non-GAAP SG&A was $1.9 billion, or 19.9% of revenue, which increased $24 million and decreased 10 basis points to last year as a percentage of revenue. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.74 billion or 19.7% of revenue versus 19.8% of revenue last year.","SG&A dollars increased $23 million due to GreatCall\u2019s operating expenses and higher advertising expense, which was partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense versus last year.","International SG&A was $166 million, or 23.2% of revenue versus $165 million or 22.3% of revenue last year. The $1 million increase included an impairment charge for discontinued technology in Canada, which was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.","During the quarter, we recorded $48 million of restructuring charges, the majority of which was driven by a retail operating model change as Corie mentioned earlier. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate of 22.8%, compared to 25.4% last year. The favorability versus last year was primarily driven by a larger tax benefit related to stock-based compensation and a favorable resolution of certain tax matters.","During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of CST, which was funded with approximately $125 million of existing cash. The acquisition of CST is not expected to have a material impact on our revenue or non-GAAP operating income this fiscal year.","We returned a total of $363 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $230 million and dividends of $133 million. Our regular quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share was an increase of 11% compared to prior year. As we previously announced, we still intend to spend between $750 million and $1 billion on share repurchases in fiscal 2020. Finally, we now expect the capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $750 million to $800 million.","Lastly, I will discuss our outlook. Our outlook reflects the strong earnings performance in the first half of the year, as well as our best estimate of the tariff impacts and consumer buying behaviors in a very fluid environment.","To be clear, the guidance we are providing today incorporates the estimated impact of the List 4 tariffs that Corie described and also includes our assumptions related to List 3 moving from a 25% to a 30% tariff rate. Specifically, for the full year, we now expect enterprise revenue in the range of $43.1 billion to $43.6 billion and enterprise comparable sales growth of 0.7% to 1.7%.","As a reminder, this top-line growth expectation is on top of the best two-year stack in 14 years and reflects factor such as the anticipated cyclical slowdown of the traditional console gaming category and the continued maturation of the mobile phone category. We expect our enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate to be flat to slightly up to fiscal 2019\u2019s rate of 4.6%, reflecting our continued focus on balancing investments in our strategy, pressures in the business and efficiencies.","We expect our non-GAAP effective income tax rate to be approximately 24% and our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range with the $5.60 to $5.75, which compares to our previous guidance $5.45 to $5.65.","I would like to share a few of the assumptions reflected in our annual guidance. Consistent with the outlook we provided at the beginning of the year, we expect both gross profit and SG&A dollars to be approximately flat to last year as a percentage of revenue for the full year. As a reminder, we have also shared there would be variations between the quarters.","Our guidance today implies a higher year-over-year operating income rate in Q3 and a lower operating income rate in Q4. A lower year-over-year operating rate in Q4 was assumed in the original guidance we provided at the start of the year and now also includes the tariff changes we have discussed today.","For the third quarter specifically, we are expecting the following: Enterprise revenue in the range of $9.65 billion to $9.75 billion; enterprise comparable sales growth of 0.5% to 1.5%; non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1 to $1.05; non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 26.5%l and the diluted weighted average share count of approximately 267 million shares.","I would like to provide additional items of color for Q3. We expect our Q3 gross profit rate to expand versus last year. We expect the gross profit rate expansion to be higher than the year-over-year increase we reported in Q2. We also expect our SG&A dollars to grow as a percentage in the very low single digits. At this time, we do not expect the recent tariff announcements to have much of an impact on our Q3 performance.","I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question today comes from Katie McShane of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Kate McShane","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations, Corie and Matt. I wanted just to ask about the supply chain costs that were noted in the gross margin discussion. Could you go into any more detail about what drove that during the quarter?","Corie Barry","Yes. So, there\u2019s a couple of things that sit under that. And they\u2019ve been pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter. First, the first piece that is just overarchingly a little bit more spend, especially when it comes to some of our large cube and the growth that we\u2019ve seen, frankly, online where we\u2019ve been investing in speed. The second part of that is more the strategic side of the investments that we started talking about at our Investor Day two years ago. And we\u2019ve been putting some capital into, especially as it relates to things we talked about today, around automating some of those metro ecommerce centers, and around investing in some of the incremental facilities that we need in order to support the large cube growth that we\u2019ve seen. So, you\u2019ve got a little bit of both things, both just systemically the higher volumes, and then secondarily, the more strategic investments, hence the reason we talked about those continuing throughout the rest of the year here.","Kate McShane","Okay, great. And if I could just ask one follow-up about your guidance and the narrowing of the range on the top line. Could you talk about what\u2019s a little bit better than expected on the low end of that, and is the lowering of the top line exclusively tariff related?","Matt Bilunas","Yes. Thanks for the question. So, for guidance purposes, I think what we\u2019re looking at for the rest of this year, one of the things that sequentially changes from the first part this year is a little bit more of a drag from the gaming category that we saw in the first part of the year. So, gaming was quite bit stronger in Q3 and Q4 of last year. And so, we are seeing a bit of -- a bit more weighted impact from that business being expected to be down a little bit more in the back half of this year. That\u2019s the biggest sequential probably change going forward as we look towards the back half of the year.","Corie Barry","And to answer the other part of your question, Kate. The tariff impact is built in there; it is not exclusively related to the tariff impact. This is just taking into account some of the trends that Matt\u2019s talking about as well as some of our estimates around the impact of tariff.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Keith of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Peter Keith","I did want to follow up on the tariff question. So, you provided a lot of good detail. But, I guess, I wanted to understand the approach that you\u2019re thinking about for pricing, because presumably, there may not be that many price increases in calendar year \u201819, but there could be a lot more to come in 2020. So, maybe strategically, do you think that a fair share of items will see price increases? And how do you think about the sort of the portfolio approach to managing through that?","Corie Barry","Yes. This is the most difficult place for us to make projections. I think, you understand better than anyone, and there\u2019s a bit of art and a bit of science to estimating this. And we don\u2019t exactly have a precedence for the quantity of moving pieces that we have in place right now. There\u2019s a few things we\u2019re trying to take into account here. So, first, you know this is -- there\u2019s a lot of changes still going on in terms of what exactly is on the List, when they\u2019re implemented and at what rate. And there\u2019s even some public comments around potentially some vendors being exempted. And so, we\u2019re watching that but there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s moving there.","Second, as we\u2019ve already seen, we believe many vendors are going to continue to migrate their manufacturing out of China. And so, we think the total prospect of business that\u2019s impacted is going to be materially less, even just next year, because you\u2019re seeing those supply chains already start to move.","And then, third, the impacted -- what we think is really impacted in our business is actually substantially less than the overarching quantity that is affected by tariffs, meaning our teams are doing really excellent work. We talked about it in prepared remakes, with mitigating strategies to help offset some of the impacts here. And so, the piece that\u2019s impacted is actually substantially smaller than the overall affected quantity of SKUs. And so, we\u2019re working to understand what that looks like into next year. But, to get precise around exactly where it\u2019s going to result in price increases, where the promotional environment will land because we\u2019re only going to stay price competitive, and how that actually shows up next year, it\u2019s going to still take us some work from here.","Peter Keith","And then, separately, maybe looking out to next year and contemplating some near-term headwinds around gaming and mobile. I was hoping you could talk about some of the technology innovations that you see evolving over the next one to two years, and thinking specifically around 5G, 8K TVs, and potentially a new console cycle. If you have any thoughts on how that may impact your business?","Mike Mohan","Peter, it\u2019s Mike. Thanks for the question. It might be a little too early to give you specifics on those categories. But we\u2019re excited about all of them. And I think about what Corie talked about and how we\u2019ve realigned our field structure to support our markets. And that gives us an opportunity, as technology needs to be either showcased in the store environment or actually in people\u2019s homes to leverage more resources and be able to have Best Buy partner with whomever it may be in this case with 5G; it\u2019s our carrier to show what the technology can do well beyond what it would do on a phone like it is today. We\u2019re quite excited about where the evolution in TVs is going because it plays into where Best Buy is historically done best showcasing technology and making sure we can get product to customers\u2019 homes. And while gaming is a drag this year, every time we\u2019ve had a new console cycle, our ability to get products in consumers\u2019 hands in a way that matters to them and support them with solutions, and now in this case with Total Tech Support has us quite excited. But, we\u2019ll probably give a bit more color on those technologies as we get into our fiscal \u201821 guide.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Horvers","So, I wanted to follow up on the guidance question a little bit more. So, just to think about it, you beat about $0.27 year-to-date, guided up 3Q about $0.08 and raised the year $0.10 to $0.15. So, it seems like you\u2019re lowering the fourth quarter, I guess implied versus the Street by $0.20 to $0.25. Is that accurate? And I know you talked about the gaming headwinds and the tariff. But, maybe you could talk, maybe break that down a little bit more. Was the gaming headwind that you\u2019re now assuming, presumably most acute to 4Q, sort of how much do you assume comp might benefit from an AUR perspective as prices go up? And then, on the margin line, gaming being worse, I would think would be better from a gross margin perspective. But, obviously you have the tariffs. So, I know, it\u2019s a very specific question, but really trying to understand how you thought about the fourth quarter update?","Corie Barry","Yes. I\u2019ll start, and then Matt can follow. What I\u2019m saying, first of all, is, the general cadence of the year is flowing exactly how we expected it. And so, that\u2019s good. And I think your estimate on that 20% -- or $0.20 plus, taking it down is on the high side. Because we saw early in the year, there would be some pressure to Q4. Matt will go into that a little bit. But, what I think overarchingly, what I would say is, it\u2019s less of a takedown than that. And it\u2019s more of what we were talking about before, us just trying to do our best to estimate what we think -- with all the mitigation strategies, what we think some of the implications might be in Q4, which we said on the call is a bit of a moving target. Matt, maybe you can provide some more color on what we see going into the year.","Matt Bilunas","Absolutely. So, Q4 lower rate is largely being driven by number of items we contemplated in the original guidance. It\u2019s primarily result of lower gross profit rate, compared to last year. And there are a number of factors that are driving that. But first, it might be helpful to point out, for the last three quarters, we\u2019ve been seeing some sources of expansion that will lap in Q4 this year. The first one is the revenue recognition refinement to Total Tech Support offer last Q4. That\u2019s been expanding our margins a little bit since Q4 last year.","The second is the acquisition of GreatCall, which we completed October last year, and we cycle that in Q4 of this year. So, that won\u2019t be a source of expansion. And on top of that, what we\u2019re seeing is slightly lower product margin rates in Q4. We\u2019re giving the teams a little bit of flexibility. It\u2019s important for them to have some to navigate through the holiday period. So, product rates are down a little bit in Q4. The second source of a little bit more pressure that we contemplated already was the services category. We\u2019re seeing -- we know we have a reduced profit share in Q4, because we had one last Q4. The other is in the area of supply, delivery and install where we\u2019re seeing a higher volume of large product that requires a little more install costs and delivery costs. And lastly, we knew that supply chain costs would continue to be a drag year-on-year in Q4. They\u2019re a little more of a drag in Q4 than they are going to be in Q3.","Again, all of those things were contemplated as we went into the guidance at the beginning of the year. The one thing we did add was the expectation of the tariff impact, which Corie mentioned. So, that would be the new thing that we put in. But, we knew most of that pressure was coming when we started the year.","Chris Horvers","And then, as a follow-up, the gross margin in Canada was very strong here in the third quarter, and presumably this is the maturation of the services model in that market, which I believe was ahead of the U.S. So, what does this tell us about the gross margin tailwinds that you might see as you get into 2020 in the domestic business, given that I think it is lagging from a rollout perspective?","Corie Barry","So, first, I want to reinforce what you said, which is definitely we\u2019re seeing Canada lap now a few years of having their version of what we call Total Tech Support. But their version is quite different. So, I want to be clear about that. They -- and we\u2019ve talked about this before. They started with different models than we have. In their case, most often, it\u2019s an offer that includes a warranty proposition with it, but also has support across the business. It\u2019s offered a little bit differently by category. So, I wouldn\u2019t say exactly what they\u2019re seeing is going to be perfectly replicated in the U.S. because we\u2019re looking at more of a pure support offer. But, at the same, time, we like what we\u2019re seeing there. We\u2019re trying to learn from what they\u2019re doing in Canada, and at the same time, figure out what\u2019s right for our customers. Obviously, we\u2019re not dying next year yet. But, like we said in our prepared remarks, we\u2019re happy with the ramp in TTS. And the best news is our customers clearly value having support across their devices, whether they bought them from us or somewhere else. And so that frankly, and the stickiness of those customers is what\u2019s most important to us here in the U.S.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Chukumba of Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Anthony Chukumba","Corie, you provided a little bit of color on rent-to-own including the fact it\u2019s going to be I guess rolled out to an additional nine states. Any color you can provide in terms of the comp lift from rent-to-own? I mean, was it material in the second quarter, and what are your expectations for that comp lift as the year progresses?","Corie Barry","Yes. So, what I\u2019d start with is that we said it last time, we\u2019re going to consistently say it, this is a great offer. It\u2019s great for our brand. It\u2019s great for our customers. And I think we said it out on the prepared remarks, financing options for our customers is really important. 25% of the business is done on our own branded card. You can see that it\u2019s important to have options. We always start with the Best Buy credit card, but now we have something additional that is available to customers who either might not want that as an option, or might not qualify.","Lease-to-own is having a positive impact on our comps, but we\u2019re not going to show the exact details. And the reason is because this is a program we would expect to build over time. We\u2019re still really early in this one. I mean, we\u2019re only into the first quarter of having it rolled out into two thirds of our stores. Over time, we think our sales associates will get more and more comfortable with the offering for our customers. We think customer awareness will continue to increase. We need to continue to implement some experience improvements. And ideally, we want to make this available online next year, as well as obviously very important to have a digital offering.","And then, to your point, we still have nine states to go, two of those being California and New York, some big ones. So, like we expected, we\u2019re definitely still seeing a number of customers use this program who are either new to Best Buy or that we haven\u2019t seen for a while. And so, we continue to like that. We\u2019ll give a little bit more color on this one at the Investor Update next month. But, in general, we definitely like how it\u2019s ramping and piecing. And most importantly, it\u2019s something that our customers seem to like. And the feedback we get from our associates is also that it\u2019s really nice to have this as a secondary financing option.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Lasser","Presumably you had existing purchase orders in place for your holiday product prior to when these tariffs are going to come in and your vendors are the importer of record. So, are you going to be sharing in the actual tariff impact, given those dynamics? And if so, can you quantify what the price increase you -- contribution you\u2019ve factored into your fourth quarter comp guidance? It looks like the domestic segment in the 1% to 2% range. And then, as part of that, how has the elasticity of the laundry equipment business that did see some tariffs earlier, informed your view on how this whole situation is going to unfold? Thank you very much.","Mike Mohan","Hey, Michael. It\u2019s Mike. I\u2019ll start and then maybe Corie can chime in. When I look at -- to answer to your first question, yes, with all of our vendors, we have existing purchase orders forecast commitments and contracts around what we pay for items and how we bring them into the country. To give you color on what might be changing, it will be far too soon to tell you that because some of the stuff\u2019s already been on the water, some of the stuff\u2019s actually in the U.S., some of the stuff may not have price increases, some of these items may evolve to different models before there\u2019s any really significant price impact, whether they get sourced from another factory outside of China, or really wrap to something else that\u2019s got a different feature set that would warrant a price increase. So, as we tried to explain in our prepared remarks, it\u2019s very, very fluid as to what we\u2019re doing.","The one thing I would probably leave you with on that point is the significance that Best Buy plays in the overall consumer electronics market worldwide, does give us more leverage than I think -- than we can probably explain on a call like this. But, it gives us exposure, because of where we source merchandise from, the ability to get to customers with the newest technology that create the right buying cycles is really important. And we\u2019re working with every one of our partners from where they source. Well, they\u2019re the importer of record, as you noted, to mitigate any impact to consumers on pricing and to us.","On a comment around appliances, there\u2019s very little to draw from that, and I\u2019ll let Corie add anything in between. Given we\u2019ve been living with price increases from a variety of reasons for the last almost two years, that category is very driven to duress and replacement. And there\u2019s a different elasticity when you\u2019re not trying to drive demand for a natural purchase. So, we\u2019ve got good understanding, but it doesn\u2019t apply a lot of go forward logic here. So, Corie?","Corie Barry","Yes. What\u2019s really tricky, and we started on it with the earlier question. I mean, we think that of our total cost of goods sold about 60% comes from China. But, it\u2019s a massively smaller portion of that that is actually, we think affected by the tariffs because of some of the negotiating power, because of the mitigating strategies that we\u2019re putting in place.","To your point about price elasticity, Q4 is also a really different quarter. I mean, keep in mind, this is a very promotional quarter and we will always be price competitive. So, the team is working through what stands from prior history of price elasticity, a little bit different in Q4. So, to Mike\u2019s point, we\u2019ve got a team who\u2019s working with our vendors, doing a really excellent job with the various mitigating strategies that they have in place, and then frankly, positioning us for the holiday really well.","Michael Lasser","Thank you. My follow-up question is on the Progressive situation. It seemed like that\u2019s gaining a good amount of traction, given all the comments that you\u2019ve made. Would your domestic comps have been positive without the Progressive relationship?","Corie Barry","We\u2019re not going to give the exact comps for Progressive, like we said before, and because mainly it\u2019s really early. We\u2019re still ramping. We\u2019re learning a lot. And ideally, over time, we continue to see better and better results from that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ray Stochel of Consumers Edge Research.","Ray Stochel","How do you think about your TV assortment now versus prior years? A couple points on that would be different approaches your vendors are taking on smart TVs and as a result over the top services. And then, how do you think about your TV supply chain and product mix compared to others in terms of geographical sourcing around tariffs? Thanks.","Mike Mohan","Hey, Ray. It\u2019s Mike. Thanks for the question. I feel very good, to answer your question about our TV assortment, now versus prior years. Best Buy has a history of leading innovation in this space, whether it\u2019s the connectivity of the device, the technology in the screen, or what size the TV is, and those are the three factors, I think people are looking at the most.","Interestingly, as more people look for solutions with streaming services, I would hope you would see that by taking a leading role, helping explain what people can do that you didn\u2019t think was possible. And getting a unified experience across multiple steps in their homes or finding ways to perhaps save some money. And we\u2019re working on ideas that can take advantage of the fact that 25% of our customers use the Best Buy credit card, and how can you blend the fact that we can help making buying device easier, perhaps with what you want to do with it. So, I\u2019ll stop the comment with that there.","When I think about our TV supply chain, yes, TVs are impacted on List 4A. Those are specifically TVs that are sourced out of China. And so, just as a reminder for the group listening that a bulk of Best Buy\u2019s business is on the large screen size, and those TVs are sourced out of Mexico. And those products are primarily 55-inch and larger TV sets. And we feel very good about those and where they\u2019re positioned and our inventory levels and the prices and the promotions we build and run on those. And when it comes to the products that are sourced out of China with an advanced lead time, I also feel good about what we have currently in inventory. And we\u2019ll look at our assortment as we move forward, based on where the demand signals are, if there\u2019s any pricing implications to them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Forbes of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. ","Steven Forbes","I wanted to start with a follow-up on the tightening of the full-year comp guidance and the commentary about the second half uncertainty. So, maybe if you can, just expand on what you\u2019re seeing today, right, as it relates to your consumers\u2019 conversion patterns, both in the store and online, inclusive of trade down or maybe just lower traffic conversion rates. I mean, are you seeing anything that gives you pause today or is it is it more just about conservatism, right, as we head into holiday here?","Corie Barry","No. I would definitely not characterize us seeing anything that gives concern today. I mean, I think we\u2019re very pleased with an almost 2 comp domestically here in Q2. We\u2019re seeing good buying behavior and I think we continue to see -- consumer is really interested in the products that we sell. And so, that gives us confidence heading into the back half here. We definitely tightened the range, because A, we\u2019ve just made it through half the year, and the result are there for the first half of the year; and then B, we\u2019re doing our best to look at specific category that we\u2019ve actually mentioned at the beginning of the year, like gaming or like the slowdown in mobile and just making sure that we feel like we take those into account. And then, finally, doing our best in a very fluid and changing environment to think through what we think the implications are in our categories in the back half.","Steven Forbes","And so, that\u2019s sort of a perfect segue into my follow-up here. You think about sort of your initial outlook for certain product category growth in 2020, whether it\u2019s an acceleration in certain categories, like gaming and mobile maybe even TVs. I mean, what categories did you -- sort of the greatest amount of pause as you conceptualize the potential demand implications of rising retail prices, given the likelihood that maybe underlying industry growth should be better next year as well?","Mike Mohan","Steve, it\u2019s Mike. Peter asked a pretty similar question around what we see for next year. The best way I\u2019d characterize it is, there\u2019s a lot of technology that\u2019s on the forefront of becoming more mainstream for consumers with what we\u2019re seeing this year. 8K TV is a great example of the connectivity solutions with streaming. There is a couple of services that are going to go live later this year that will create excitement in this space. There\u2019s continued demand for people to want to stay connected. And I think this is the way we\u2019re building relationships and memberships around our Total Tech Support offer. But, put those all together, add them into things we\u2019re seeing with good tailwinds, like our appliance business, the places that we\u2019re competing very well. That\u2019s how I\u2019d look at the landscape of categories right now. But again, it\u2019s too soon to give category specifics for our fiscal \u201821 guide.","Operator","Our next question comes from Curtis Nagle of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Curtis Nagle","Maybe just a little more specificity, if you could on gaming and why you think, I guess, second half of the year might be a little bit tougher than you initially thought, if I understood your comments correctly.","Matt Bilunas","Yes. The gaming cycle is well known, and as the years progressed what we\u2019ve seen is as there is more visibility to a couple of new platforms that have yet to be announced, but are well regarded as they\u2019re coming into play by next holiday season. The demand on the current console business is just off slightly, more than we would have anticipated. And some of the things that are filling in the space that always happens when a gaming cycle happens, are coming in at lower price points. The demand is quite good but is coming in at lower ASP. So, based on those factors and looking at where the category is in this cycle in advance of its next route that would probably indicate why we see some softness more than we expected.","Curtis Nagle","And Matt, I think, you alluded to this in some of your commentary in terms of I think that 4Q, but what are you guys expecting in terms of promotional intensity in the quarter? I know things are very fluid. But, any more color on that would be helpful.","Corie Barry","Yes. I think Q4 -- I think, it\u2019s always a promotional period. And obviously, we\u2019ve said it before, it is often used as a traffic driver as that eye catching price point. We would continue to expect that to be the case in this Q4. I think, we continue to expect the deals to start earlier and to last longer, I mean all of the things that we\u2019ve pretty consistently been saying. I don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s wickedly out of the ordinary or anything in front of us that looks completely different. But, it\u2019s always a promotional period. And I give our teams a ton of credit for their ability to plan for and then really effectively manage through any great Q4.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simeon Gutman","Just to clarify something on the guidance, and this -- I guess, on cautiousness about or uncertainty consumer spending in the back half. It sounds like that\u2019s entirely pushed into the fourth quarter, right, there you\u2019re not seeing anything that gives you pause around the third quarter. And Corie, I think you mentioned it\u2019s a mix of tariff uncertainty as well as a little bit of category uncertainty. And then, just as part of that and you were asked this earlier, Corie, if you look at like the In-Home Advisor business, not seeing anything where conversion is being affected or you\u2019re seeing lower tickets or just consumers taking a longer time to decide to convert on orders?","Corie Barry","I\u2019ll start with the latter from an IHA perspective. We\u2019re not seeing really any changes in behavior as we continue to -- and that\u2019s why we made a point that we continue to ramp our IHAs, and we\u2019re matching that to the demand that we\u2019re seeing. And we continue to really like how that business is performing, so not really seeing anything there. Matt, I don\u2019t know if you have any comments on the overall top-line.","Matt Bilunas","No. The overall top-line, I think like we said, we see categories come up and down, like we always do. As we look at this point in the year, gaming is -- like we said is the biggest sequential drag as you look at the back half. I think, the rest of the categories as you look into Q3 are kind of like what we expected them to be, gaming be a little bit of a change. I think, there is also what Corie said earlier, there is always a level of caution as you look at the back half of the year with this type of market. Most of that is probably geared toward Q4, but there is also a little bit over in Q3 as well as we start to see and the tariffs start to come in.","Simeon Gutman","My follow-up, just one more on lease-to-own. Can you share with us -- I\u2019m assuming your expectation is that it\u2019s going to bring in -- or you\u2019re going to find new customers into the business. But, can you tell us thus far in the markets that it\u2019s been rolled out. Is it just -- is it an existing customer who is just electing to finance their purchase differently or is it a new customer to Best Buy?","Corie Barry","We definitely are seeing some level of new customer. I mean, between the new customers that we\u2019re seeing and what I call reengaged or people we haven\u2019t seen very frequently, that\u2019s actually the majority of who we\u2019re seeing use the program. So, we like the fact that it\u2019s engaging for us a very different customer, maybe one that\u2019s been less frequent with us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. ","Brian Nagel","Congrats Corie and Matt. A question I have, you thought -- we spent a lot of time talking here about the uncertainty that tariffs and maybe some product cycles you bring to the second half of the year, you\u2019ve done a great job managing SG&A, even while you are investing, continue to invest in the business. So, the question I have is, to the extent that sales do track a bit choppier or maybe softer over the next few quarters, what leverage do you have on the SG&A side? How would you -- how could you react on the SG&A side to offset that?","Corie Barry","Yes. I\u2019m going to answer this in two ways. So, first of all, just to directly talk about SG&A, I mean, I think this quarter was a great example of our teams really being able to continue to find cost efficiencies in the business and to continue to manage the business really tightly. And I think, we have a pretty good track record of being able to flex with the business ebb and flow. And so, I feel really good heading into the back half that our teams are well set up, to be able to manage the SG&A in a way that makes sense. That being said, we\u2019ve been very clear that we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the business in ways that are going to bring this strategy to life. And I want to be clear and say, we continue to invest in the business, and we believe strongly in the strategy that we\u2019re bringing. And we\u2019re going to -- we\u2019re going to make those choices as we go through quarter-to-quarter. And so, yes, we definitely can manage what\u2019s manageable behind the scenes, but we\u2019re also very thoughtfully trying to make sure that we invest. And you\u2019ve seen the returns on those investments continue to improve. And so, I think, it feels like we\u2019re doing the right thing.","That being said, I mean, I know the start of the question is all about kind of the choppiness of the top-line. Here\u2019s what I\u2019d say and Matt said it too, we continue to be pleased with people and customers\u2019 interest in technology. And while yes, obviously we\u2019re trying to take into account the tariffs, that is genuinely, continuously a very quickly evolving situation. And I just want to reiterate that our teams are doing excellent work with mitigation strategies and at the same time, we\u2019re already seeing a lot of our vendors make some moves and move considerably some of that products. I mean, we talk about our current percent of COGS. We think next year that percent of COGS could be more like 40%.","And so, I think it\u2019s really important to note that while we\u2019re talking about a little bit of this choppiness for the back half, the teams and our vendor partners are working together hard to continue to mitigate the impact of those tariffs. And so, yes, we\u2019ll continue to work the SG&A, but I also want to be clear, we like where the strategy is going and we continue to have a really strong point of view that customers are interested in that we were coming to market and the products that we have.","Brian Nagel","And then, a follow-up -- and I\u2019m going to apologize, because I think half the questions here, to some extent are better than what you\u2019ve got. So, I\u2019m going to add one more to that. But, if we look at the narrowing of the guidance for the year, and I know to a certain extent we\u2019re splitting hairs because we gave small numbers. But you narrowed more from the top end than you did in the bottom end. If tariffs were not an issue, if the tariffs were not something to consider, how would that guidance -- how could that guidance look or that how could the shift in guidance look?","Corie Barry","So, this is the hardest question and almost nearly impossible for me to answer, because the tariffs aren\u2019t just about how they impact the individual SKUs, they\u2019re also about the consumer conditions, the macro conditions. And we\u2019ve seen -- I mean, tariff has been a point of conversation for almost 18 months now. And so, the constant morphing of tariffs and having that as part of the conversation, it\u2019s literally almost impossible for me to strip out and say just List 4 did this. It\u2019s more us trying to take that big step back and say, where do we see the implications, where do we see the consumer and how do we think that\u2019s going to impact the back half. And again, remember, part of the narrowing of the range is also just what we\u2019ve seen already in the first six months of the year. So, it\u2019s impossible to strip that out.","Brian Nagel","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Corie Barry","Thank you. Before ending, thank you for the questions. I think that was our last. I would like to thank you, Matt, and congratulate you on your first earnings call, and thank you, Mike, for joining us.

Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our President and CEO; and Sharon McCollam, our CAO and CFO. As usual, the media will be participating in this call in a listen-only mode.","This morning's conference call must be considered in conjunction with the earnings release that we issued earlier today. They both contain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain business events. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to facilitate meaningful year-over-year comparisons, but should not be considered superior to as a substitute for and should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures for the period.

These statements address the financial condition, results of operations, business initiatives, growth plans, operational investments and prospects of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.","In today's earnings release and conference call, we refer to consumer electronics or CE industry trends. The CE industry, as defined by the NPD Group, includes TVs, desktop and notebook computers, tablets not including Kindle, digital imaging, and other categories. Sales of these products represent approximately 65% of our domestic revenue. It does not include mobile phones, gaming, movies, music, appliances or services.","I will now turn the call over to Hubert.","Hubert Joly","Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I will begin today with an overview of our second quarter results and then update you on the progress we\u2019re making against our Renew Blue priorities. Then I will turn the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. So first, our financial results. In the second quarter we delivered $8.9 billion in revenue and $0.44 in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus $0.32 last year. The ongoing benefits of our Renew Blue cost reduction and other SG&A cost containment initiatives drove these better than expected results.","On the top line as expected sales in the NPD track consumer electronics category declined 2.5% in-line with our domestic comparable sales decline of 2.0%. Like other retailers and as reflected in this quarter\u2019s performance we continue to see a shift in consumer behavior. Consumers are increasingly researching and buying online. As a result traffic to our brick and mortar stores continue to decline and yet our in-store conversion and online traffic continue to increase due to the execution of our Renew Blue strategy which is in direct alignment with this shift. Our Renew Blue strategy is designed to grow our online business, enhance our in-store customer experience and leverage out multi-channel capabilities or deliver to our customers great advice, service and convenience at competitive prices in the channel they want to be served. Each of these initiatives contributed to our second quarter results.","And so I\u2019m pleased to update you today on the progress we\u2019re making against our renewable transformation road-map which is built around following areas. Merchandising, marketing, online, stores, Geek Squad services, supply chain, cost structure and employee engagement. So first of these areas is merchandising. We believe we\u2019re raising the bar in our retail channel by continuing to roll out compelling and differentiated customer experiences across major categories such as appliances, home theater and mobile. In the appliance category we opened 18 new Pacific Kitchen & Home stores within a store on our on track to end the year with approximately 115 stores versus 67 last year.","In the Home Theater category we opened seven new Magnolia design center stores within the store and our on track to the end the year with approximately 50 stores versus 33 last year. Both of these premium stores within the store concepts continue to outperform our expectations. We also rolled out over 800 Samsung and Sony Home Theater stores within a store during the quarter. This represents the first major merchandising transformation in Best Buy\u2019s home theater department in almost 10 years. We believe that home theater transformation further solidifies our position as the destination for customers to discover and interact with industry leading home theater technology particularly ultra-high definition or 4k TVs and we\u2019re encouraged by the early consumer response to our expanded ultra-high definition assortments.","We\u2019re excited about the future of this technology even though we believe that the impact to our business this year will be limited.","In the mobile category in the second quarter we began offering customers the option to purchase installment billing plans with the Top 3 U.S. carriers. While mobile phone demand in the second quarter including year-over-year trading volume declined as customers wait for highly anticipated new product launches the penetration of installment billing progressively increased during the quarter and we believe we\u2019re well-positioned to capitalize on the new products when they are introduced.","In the area of marketing, we made progress in our evolution from analog in mass to digital and targeted communications with our customers. During the quarter we continued to shift our marketing investment dollars towards digital media campaigns and away from print and television advertising.","We\u2019re also leveraging our Athena customer database to pilot new targeted email campaigns, we\u2019re in the early stages of being able to personalize marketing messages to individual customers which we view as a 2 or 3 year journey. We do however expect to see gradual and incremental improvements in marketing effectiveness every quarter our customer insights improve and our new personalization capabilities are rolled out.","In our online business in the second quarter we continue to leverage our ship from store, digital marketing and enhanced website functionality to drive a 22% increase in domestic comparable online sales. Similar to the first quarter ship from store represented over half of the online sales growth. We\u2019re also using ship from store to drive gross profit improvements on our clearance and end-of-life inventory by exposing it not only to our retail customers but also to our online customers. We also launched several customer facing improvements on the website to drive increased engagements in a more seamless online shopping experience including number one a new global homepage that is easier for customers to navigate, number two significantly richer visual and editorial content for the ultra-high definition, digital imaging in the health and wearables category.","Number three, new text messaging options for order confirmation and delivery that are garnering significant customer adoption and number four visibility to customers Geek Squad purchases instead of their My Best Buy accounts on bestbuy.com.","As we head into the back half of the year we will continue to launch online shopping experience improvements, such as additional product category we designed, expanded wish list capabilities and improved checkout process in an expanded and more inspirational holiday gift center.","Of course we will also be continuing a significant behind the scenes work on the transformation of our e-commerce platform. In our retail stores the field and store structure changes we implemented last quarter are to-date generating results in-line with our expectations. We have consolidated and simplified the field organization, we organized to help drive local strategies and reduce the number of management level roles.","In total what our year-over-year retail labor cost are now lower, other investment in customer facing labor including vendor funded labor has increased. While we still have much to do in reinvigorating the customer experience, we are making progress and are pleased to see our in-store experience contribute significantly to the 400 basis point improvements in our overall NPS or Net Promoter Score that we saw in the second quarter.","In our Geek Squad Services business we continue to increase our net promoter scores and drive down cost to operational efficiencies. We also continue to focus on refining our existing service offerings, improving the merchandising of our services, and building new offerings that meet the needs of customers in the context of today\u2019s rapidly evolving technology environment.","In our supply chain we continue to leverage and transform our distribution and fulfillment capabilities. In May, we implemented significant changes to our distribution operating model that aligned work schedules with customer demand including expanding our days and hours of operation. This implementation was seamless and we\u2019re now able to replenish inventory to our stores and deliver to our online customers faster which is both a competitive top line and improved customer service opportunity particularly in advance of the holiday season. We also continue to leverage our ship from store capability. Not only does it continue to be a significant contributor to our online sales growth, it has also been expanded to drive increased sales out of our retail stores.","Let me explain. In the past when blue shirts were looking for a product that was out stock in a store the system they used could only see a variable inventory in the individual store and a distribution centers. Today using the exact same system the Blue Shirts can now see all available inventory in our distribution centers and our 1400 stores. As a result our Blue Shirts are gaining increased confidence in being able to serve their customer and drive incremental sales.","In the area of returns, replacements and damages we continue to make progress in the second quarter including launching a company-wide awareness program for our Blue Shirts, our Geek Squad agents and our corporate support teams. This program is focused on raising awareness of the operational behaviors that are contributing to the over $400 million in annual losses that we have historically been incurring. The program is also rolling out new operating procedures to reduce these losses. These procedures include number one setting the right product the first time, number two, enforcing the company\u2019s return policy and increasing the frequency of exchanges. Number three inspecting return inventory, number four, culturally resetting in-store perception of the value of return inventory and number five exposing this inventory to our online shoppers.","As we have consistently said this online exposure is critical to optimize margin recovery because the majority of open box inventory is searched for and purchased online. And in the second quarter we began offering Geek Squad certified open box inventory online primarily in the computing and tablet categories. In the fourth quarter as new systems are implemented we will begin offering additional open box inventory that is in excellent conditions which represents the majority of our open box returns.","We\u2019re seeing early sales in margin improvements from the roll out of these new procedures. We expect to see stronger results as the program matures and we improve the online searchability and overall multichannel customer experience over the next several quarters. Relating to our overall cost reduction initiatives in the second quarter, we eliminated an additional $40 million in annualized cost taking a total renewable cost reductions to $900 million towards our target of $1 billion.","Now as it relates to our international segment while we have made considerable progress in our Renew Blue cost reduction initiatives we have substantial work to do on top line stabilization. To address this we\u2019re following the same kind of Renew Blue transformation roadmap that we\u2019re pursuing in the U.S. So to recap, while the other consumer electronics environment continued to be soft, the second quarter ended better than expected primarily due to strong expense control.","In addition we made significant progress against our Renew Blue priorities and clearly demonstrated our increasing ability to tightly manage what we can control. And looking ahead our goal is to continue to create a significantly differentiated multi-channel customer experience such that every interaction customers have with us regardless of channel makes them a promoter of the Best Buy brands.","In support of this we will be intensifying our investments in customer facing initiatives across both channels in the back half of the year and Sharon will elaborate on this later in the call. In fact I will now turn the call over to Sharon to cover more details on our second quarter financial performance and our financial outlook.","Sharon McCollam","","Thank you Hubert and good morning everyone. Before I talk about our second quarter earnings results versus last year I would like to talk about them versus our expectation. As Hubert said during the quarter we continued to make meaningful progress against our Renew Blue priorities which resulted in a better than expected non-GAAP operating margin rate of 2.9% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.44. These results versus our expectations were primarily driven by stronger SG&A cost containment initiatives, greater promotional effectiveness and better performance of our new credit card agreement.","I will now talk about the second quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue declined 4% to 8.9 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 38% to $0.44 primarily driven by the flow-through of our Renew Blue cost savings and other cost containment initiatives. As expected the positive impact of these cost savings were partially offset by the negative impact of lower volume, higher year-over-year sales in the lower margin gaming and computing categories and the previously communicated negative impacts from our credit card agreement and structural price investments.","Domestic revenue of 7.6 billion declined 2.4% versus last year. This decline was primarily driven by a comparable sales decline of 2% and a revenue decline of 20 million or 25 basis points due to the less favorable economics of the new credit card agreement. Domestic, comparable online revenue however increased 22% to 581 million due to substantially improved inventory availability made possible by the chain wide roll-out of shipped from store last January. A higher average order value and increased traffic driven by greater investment in online digital marketing.","As a percentage of total domestic revenue, online revenue increased a 160 basis points to 7.7% versus 6.1% last year. From a merchandising perspective growth in gaming, computing appliances and televisions was more than offset by declines in other categories including mobile phones, tablets and services. Services comparable sales declined 8.9% primarily driven by lower mobile repair revenue due to our success in decrease claim severity and frequency. Lower attach rates and higher mobile warranty premium costs which translate into lower commission revenue. These were partially offset by a factory warranty recovery related impact that occurred in Q2, fiscal \u201914 that did not recur this year.","International revenue of 1.3 billion declined 12% versus last year. This decline was primarily driven by a comparable sales decline of 6.7%. The negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the loss of revenue from store closures in China.","Turning now to the gross profit, the enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate for the second quarter was 23.1% versus 23.7% last year, an expected decline of 60 basis points. The domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate declined 50 basis points to 23.4% versus 23.9% last year. This decline was primarily due to a mix shift into the lower margin gaming and computing categories, structural investments and price competitiveness particularly in accessories a 20 basis point negative impact related to the less favorable economics as a new credit card agreement.","These declines were partially offset by an increased mix of higher margin large screen television and the realization of our Renew Blue cost reductions and other supply chain cost containment initiatives. The international gross profit rate was 21.1% versus 22.3% last year. This 120 basis point decline was primarily driven by our Canadian business due to increased promotional activity and an increased mix into the lower margin gaming category.","Now turning to SG&A, enterprise level non-GAAP SG&A was 1.8 billion or 20.2% of revenue versus 21.5% last year, a decline of a 189 million or a 130 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was 1.5 billion or 19.9% of revenue versus 21.3% last year a decline of a 147 million or a 140 basis points. This rate decline was primarily driven by the realization of our Renew Blue cost reduction initiatives and tighter expense management throughout the company.","International non-GAAP SG&A was 290 million or 22.1% of revenue versus 22.3% last year, a decline of 42 million or 20 basis points. This rate decline was primarily driven by Renew Blue cost reductions and tighter expense management in Canada and to a lesser extent China.","Merchandize inventories increased a 146 million or 2.7% to 5.6 billion primarily due to deliberate investments in high demand back to school computing inventory and inventory to support our over 800 Samsung and Sony Home Theater stores within a store. As we enter the back-half we expect this increased level of inventory to continue in order to support our ultra-high definition TV and Pacific Kitchen & Home expansions as well as our initiatives to reduce retail out of stocks.","In our consumer surveys one of the top reasons customers say that they do not buy when they are in a Best Buy store is that the product they are looking for is not in stock in that store at that time.","Now looking forward to the back half, as Hubert remarked earlier, industry wide sales are continuing to decline in many of the consumer electronics categories in which we compete. We\u2019re also seeing ongoing softness in the mobile phone category ahead of highly anticipated new product launches. Therefore absent any changes in these declining industry trends and with limited visibility to new product launch quantities. We continue to expect comparable sales to decline in the low single digits in both the third and fourth quarter.","From an operating income rate perspective in the back half we\u2019re expecting the following business drivers versus last year. One, a similar promotional competitive environment but with better promotional effectiveness internally. Two, a greater mix of online revenue that will put pressure on the overall operating income rate, three, continued industry softness and higher promotionality in Canada and China; and four, a net positive impact from our Renew Blue cost reductions as they will more than offset our investments in structural pricing, the new credit card agreement and the new incremental investments we\u2019re making in the back half of the year totaling 40 million to 50 million or $0.07 to $0.09 per diluted share to support the customer facing initiatives that Hubert referenced earlier.","This 40 million to 50 million will breakdown by quarter as follows, 10 million to 15 million in Q3 and 30 million to 35 million in Q4. As a result of all of these business drivers and particularly in-light of the fixed cost deleverage that will accompany an expected low single digit comparable sales decline, we\u2019re expecting the non-GAAP operating income rate in Q3 and Q4 to increase in-line with the year-over-year improvement that we saw in the first half.","Additionally in the back half the estimated diluted earnings per share impact of the discreet tax items that we discussed last quarter will continue to be in the ranges of flat to negative one in Q3, and negative $0.09 to $0.10 in Q4.","With that I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). We will take our first question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley","Just a couple of questions. First on the top line I think you called out TVs both in the printed release and in the script and then there should be product launches on the mobile side and those are two pretty important categories between TVs and mobiles. And so we appreciate the status quo view on the top line but shouldn't one look at I guess some of these trends and have a little bit more of a constructive outlook in the back half of the year?","Hubert Joly","I think anyone can have their view on the future. I think we have shared ours this morning. We have a backdrop of a consumer environment that\u2019s a bit fragile. We see the trends, of course in our space you always have ups and you always have downs so the net effect is what you\u2019ve to look at. Specifically as it relates to TV while we\u2019re excited by the new technology and the customer response I think we all have to appreciate the fact that the actual impact this year will still be relatively limited before we ramp up into next year. So that\u2019s something take into consideration. Of course as it relates to mobile. The uncertainties around the quantities you get at this point in time and frankly we have little visibility, a limited visibility at this point in time. So I think you can develop the view that there is upside but we want to highlight that there is some factors that limits the potential top line in the back half of the year. But again Simeon, forecasting is difficult so we shared our view and we respect yours.","Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley","And then my follow-up is regarding the intensifying of investments. Can you hash out whether that is how you are reacting to some to some opportunity that you see or is something changing that is unfavorable? Because I think the topline outlook or picture that we see doesn't seem so different from the way that it was laid out or forecast by you and so what is prompting the change?","Hubert Joly","I think what\u2019s prompting change is from a strategic direction standpoint there is no chance. Meaning that our moves completely consistent with the roadmap that we have outlined over the last couple of years and certainly this year. I think the investments are a combination of us seeing the potential of some of the initiatives we\u2019re working on as well as the need to be in the game for some of these initiatives. So no dramatic change but increasing confidence and sense of reality around these opportunities. I don\u2019t whether Sharon McCollam you want to add any color to this but that\u2019s what I would say.","Sharon McCollam","","Absolutely, I will follow-up on what Hubert said. There are areas where as you guys know we\u2019re seeing substantial improvements in the way our business is operating that we believe that we can accelerate faster. This is really about intensifying and accelerating our efforts into this year. They surround things that you would completely expect like improved shipping times to our customers, better fulfillment, customer facing initiatives in our stores. Some online investments that are highly competitive that we would like to not go into great detail here today. But they are all surrounding the customer and things that actually are facing the customer which we think is going to be very important and to your point, Simeon about the possibilities for Q3 and Q4 we think these will competitively position us much stronger as we go into the back half especially Q4.","Operator","And we will move on to our next question from David Schick with Stifel.","David Schick - Stifel Nicolaus","Could you give us any sense of what these capabilities like ship from\u00a0store to the customer at home or that inventory lookup that you talked about with associates in stores and we have certainly experienced that when we are in stores, the frustration in the past with the associate's ability to say yes right now. As you look at turning that on, how much do you think you gave up an opportunity over time and in particular last year's fourth quarter?","Sharon McCollam","Sure. David, I\u2019ve to believe that it is an important number. First let\u2019s just ground ourselves on ship from store, that aspect of our business right now which was over half of our online growth this quarter. In the store what we\u2019re seeing with that number is we launched it late April and the stores are just now starting to use it. We\u2019re seeing the numbers increase each day and we\u2019re looking again in these customer facing initiatives I was talking about, we\u2019re looking at some opportunities there to make that even a more efficient process once they found the inventory and getting it to the customer faster.","So I think that last year we didn\u2019t have it at all. Similar to ship from store, you\u2019re seeing you know what\u2019s doing for us obviously. In the store side of it, they did not have this capability and then in ship from store when you think about the back half of last year, if you recall in Q2 and Q3 we really only had 50 stores that were shipping, October last year we went to 400 stores shipping and then in January of \u201914 this year we went to -- our all 1400 stores. So in the back half we also expect the ship from store capability to benefit us in three ways. One of course is serving the customer where, when and how they wanted, they want that inventory and we have opened up that 2 billion of inventory to give to them.","The second is the margin improvement that we\u2019re seeing because particularly on our clearance end of life inventories, it is creating a much more efficient clearing method because we have so many viewers online to supplement the retail traffic thus driving a better outcome on the markdowns. ","Another benefit that we have seen from ship from store is that when we\u2019re allocating the inventory to all the stores we used to send a lot of that inventory back for reallocation when we\u2019re out of balance. We have significant, more than half of the inventory returned a year ago, we didn\u2019t have to return this year. Thus the cost and complexity that goes along with that. So those are what we\u2019re seeing now. The back half of course is a very different time of year and there is nothing in what I just shared with you that would say to us here that we\u2019re not going to see the types of benefits at a much higher rate occurring in the back half for us particularly again this is so big around Q4 when I\u2019ve to have it I need that gift, those kinds of demands from our customers and we will be shipping faster and that will be important.","David Schick - Stifel Nicolaus","And as a follow-up, the original Renew Blue take on the business was -- or the outline was the long term 5% to 6% operating margin. Now there has been a lot of puts and takes to the industry and you guys have worked on initiatives, there has been incremental pressures, there is opportunities all over the last 18 months. But do you think all those things together still boil down to a 5% to 6% operating margin opportunity long term for the business?","Sharon McCollam","Yes, I think that it's important though to recall that when we gave that we said we need very low single-digit but single digit positive comp sales. When you think about the revenue leverage that you see especially in quarters like Q4, on the fixed cost which I called out earlier in my business drivers for Q4, it's so significant and with our categories, these NPD categories tracking at this negative 2.5% rate I know it makes it hard to see but that 5 to 6 is predicated on that. What we\u2019re particularly pleased with right now well not excited about negative comps, don\u2019t get me wrong is that with the things that are within our control operationally and executionally we\u2019re continuing to improve in those areas. What that says is that when we get to that point, where we see the cycle comeback into CE that we\u2019re going to have the operational infrastructure and the cost structure that will highly leverage those sales and that\u2019s the part that we\u2019re greatly looking forward to and I know as investors you guys are too. But that\u2019s how we see getting to that number is going to be through some top line growth and then in addition to that continuing to make progress against these kinds of initiatives that we spoke of today.","David Schick - Stifel Nicolaus","I guess we will have to see if anybody ever makes a new phone or anybody wants a nicer TV again in the future. Thanks.","Hubert Joly","Thank you, David.","Operator","And we will move on to our next question from Alan Rifkin with Barclays.","Alan Rifkin - Barclays Capital","So first question surrounds the Renew Blue program. You had targeted $1 billion in cuts but for the last few quarters the expense savings have been declining sequentially with only $40 million realized in this quarter. As you look further out over the next couple of years, do you think $1 billion in totality is still the number? And in breaking it down between SG&A and cost of goods, where do you see the greatest incremental savings going forward coming from?","Sharon McCollam","Yes, in the spirit on the SG&A side of the Renew Blue cost reductions. We have obviously taken substantial cost out of the company and of course they have slowed I mean the 40 million is less than it was in the previous quarter. The place that as you know we have not included in that billion a large percentage is of the returns replacements and damages, we within the numbers we\u2019re reporting on our achievement of Renew Blue has an amount associated with returns, replacements and damages but it's actually very slow to-date. And off that as you recall let\u2019s just all get grounded. We said we\u2019re losing over -- approximately 450 million and we expect to lose a 100. So we see a 300 million to 350 million opportunity there.","It's very structural and how we go after it, we\u2019re going in the fourth quarter you will start seeing a lot of that online inventory show up and then Hubert in his prepared remarks to help give you guys more visibility to some of the other things that are happening in the company because while showing the inventory online is very important and quite frankly getting those viewers and getting that population when the majority of this inventory is sold online anyway is critical but there are other operating things happening internally right now and plan is being put into place and changes in operating procedures happening that we think are going to accelerate that for us as we -- this would be a 2016 opportunity for us as well. So that\u2019s where I see it coming from Alan going forward. We will continue, however there are areas operationally in the company, I would speak to our services areas and some of our other what I would call tasking related activities in our stores and some of our replenishment processes where I think that there is higher efficiency to be garnered but again many of these requires structural system changes, so are slower in coming.","Alan Rifkin - Barclays Capital","Okay. One more question if I may. Sharon, this is really the first time you have given definitive guidance on your comp outlook for the all-important fourth quarter and you are now saying it will be down low single digits. Where does this number really compare to where your plan was at the beginning of the year and what really has changed if anything in terms of your guidance on the comp for Q4 specifically?","Sharon McCollam","Yes Alan, we certainly believed that early in the year that we would see less softness in those NPD categories. We also were more optimistic about the innovation in mobile and after last year having the Samsung Galaxy other things came out we don\u2019t want to go vendor by vendor, we had a few exciting things last year but the fact that the innovation in mobile has been pretty soft this year was different than we hoped. Now the good news is that we have remained very conservative and you know us. We don\u2019t live on our wishes and hopes here; we live on what the data says.","So, based on the industry data around these categories it still does not paint a positive picture. If you look at the people who write about this industry even with a highly anticipated phone, not speaking to any one vendor but one of the highly anticipated phone launch. The saturation in the mobile phone category makes this complicated to forecast. We think it's exciting and we think the installment billing programs which by the way Hubert also called out. We\u2019re seeing an acceleration in that and it's very fast, the disruption of the carriers could be a dynamic that we did not anticipate. What\u2019s happening with the carrier plans right now what you\u2019re observing I\u2019m sure we did not anticipate.","Now again until we see what that means we\u2019re not going to put that into a forecast. We\u2019re looking at economic data just like you, our consumer trending data and this is what it's showing. Now that is the same data I might add that told us to tell you last quarter that Q2 would be negative low single digit comps which is exactly where we ended up and we still in those NPD categories gained share.","So that is what we\u2019re using Alan. So could it be better? Yes. Is the acceleration of Ultra-High Definition TV happening? There is no question about it. I saw an analyst report out this morning on the topic. So if that happens, you know when you read what I wrote this is predicated. What I explained and laid out is predicated on a low single-digit negative comp and the environment we\u2019re in now with only slight excitement and not any other offsets to this phone and UHD opportunity. Clearly I don\u2019t know if anyone is out there, that is better positioned than Best Buy with our new 800 Samsung and Sony Home Theater stores within the stores. I don\u2019t know how you could be better positioned to go after this new opportunity not to mention and I have to call this out is the blue shirts that are supporting that in our stores but knowledge of UHD in Best Buy, I\u2019ve to say we would put it up against anything in the industry right now and we\u2019re very product of that.","So those are the possibilities Alan, that is not something I\u2019m telling you that the data does not support it and then there also you need to get -- you would also have to have an excessive amount of inventory as well. So we will see what happens but right now we see the data says that we could see similar NPD performance, track the categories performance.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","Thanks, good morning and we can feel just how hard you guys are working to achieve these results so appreciate you sharing the time with us. A couple of things. If you looked at the NPD categories that you referenced, can you give us a sense of what the e-commerce penetration is of those categories and maybe kind of how you compare against that? Also how the profitability shift to e-commerce is affecting the margins, SG&A, et cetera? I'm just not sure we have gotten any quantification around that.","Hubert Joly","So e-commerce penetration in our categories is higher than in retail in general. We\u2019re one of the most highly penetrated sector from an e-commerce standpoint and it continues to shift, that\u2019s one of the things I said earlier. We\u2019re seeing continued and rapid shift in consumer behavior in researching and then buying online but if not buying online, studying the research process online before going to the stores which we do see is the for a given purchase, it reduces the number of trips to the store because you come to the store very well equipped and you completed.","This is not new but this is continuing and very significant this has been the premise of the entire Renew Blue strategy and transformation. Now we\u2019re very encouraged by the growth of our online business, 22% this quarter. The reason why we\u2019re excited about this is that, as we said before, is to achieve the same kind of market share online as we\u2019re experiencing in the stores and we have much to do. So all of this is happening in a context where we\u2019re able to improve our operating income rate year-over-year which is something that we\u2019re very excited about.","Now as it relates to your question pertaining to the profitability online versus the stores, I would first preface it by saying that trying to construct a meaningful P&L by channel is actually a fairly futile exercise because it is so inter-dependent. How should I count and allocate the marketing expenses? How should I count and allocate the investment that I make online for which a lot of the conversion is actually happening in the stores. So this is an exercise with limited practicality. This being said, in general online today the mix of products we sell, so let me say that profitability for given product is not materially different online versus in the stores. What we do see today is that from a mix standpoint not surprisingly the kinds of products that we tend to sell more online would be lower cube, lower touch, more commodity type products simple to buy, convenient and so forth. Whereas in the stores you\u2019re going to buy higher cube, higher touch products. You\u2019re going to have online -- still today despite our great progress lower attachments of accessories and services.","And I don\u2019t think that this is necessarily something that we will continue. In fact we\u2019re determined to change that by helping customers buy the entire solution online and so down the road we would expect the profitability to the extent that we can calculate profitability to converge between the two channels but today as we shift more towards the online channel, this is having a slightly negative impact on the overall gross profit rates because of these lower attachments.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","Just a clarification and then a follow-up. Of your business which is 7.7% penetrated online, what is your guys best guess as to where the industry is on that same penetration?","Hubert Joly","In the Renew Blue presentation back in November of 2012 we had tried to estimate that and from memory we had estimated that the market share or the penetration of online in our industry was in the high-teens and so clearly we have room to grow here. The mindset of the company as we see no reason why our online market share, or market share online should be lower than in the stores and we are determined to be agnostic from a channel standpoint and a profitability standpoint so as to be able to serve the customers the way they want to buy it.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","And if you can just help by telling us in your fourth-quarter guidance or your back-half guidance what you have contemplated for the promotional environment in Q4 specifically as you compare it against last year's kind of free for all?","Sharon McCollam","In our prepared remarks or in my prepared remarks I said and was very clear, and this is for both Q3 and Q4 that we expected a similar promotional competitive environment. I left out irrational but okay, that was your adjective. But what we said is that we\u2019re going to have better promotional effectiveness internally. After Q4 last year you will recall Hubert made many comments about what we would be doing differently this year and has really done that each quarter and we have seen it work each quarter. So going into Q4, the rational disciplines that we have implemented and some of this additionally is also very operating procedure and systematic internal or systematic internally.","We did not have the capabilities, pricing capabilities and promotional tracking capabilities a year ago that prepared us well for that kind of an environment. This year we have made investments in those areas. We have talked about those in previous calls and our teams are getting stronger obviously every quarter. So we anticipate our ability to do better but honestly we just believe that our competition will continue with similar behaviors to previous years. ","Operator","And we will move on to our next question from David Magee with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","On that last question, I was curious it seemed like last year the sector business sort of softened late in the year and people were culling too much inventory in the channel and then panic ensued. Are you seeing a similar build up this year or do you think you will see a build-up this year of the same level of inventory throughout the sector going into the fourth quarter?","Sharon McCollam","David you might be on the cell phone and we got a cut out on about every third or fourth word, could you just repeat your question for us please?","David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Last year I recall it seemed like that the business for the sector softened late in the year and inventory levels were too high across the retail sector and there was panic afterwards. I\u2019m curious as you sort of think about this year being similar, are you seeing inventory levels growing at the same rate as they did last year?","Hubert Joly","I think that\u2019s, we don\u2019t know of course the inventory levels of our competitors. What I would say is if you rewind to last year the market environment, the demand in our space in Q2 and Q3 as well as our own comps trended relatively positively in Q2 and Q3 I think we were -- in Q3 we were positive in the low-single digits and while we were probably getting market share, this was also represented of a more supportive business environment including in the very important mobile category and whereas this year to repeat when we look at the market in Q1 and Q2 including in mobile you\u2019ve a very different picture. Sharon talked about in mobile, everybody is talking and accepting new products in the back half but the penetration of smartphones in the country has really reached very high level. So how big of an impact is it going to have above and beyond the question of the availability of the inventory. So you\u2019ve I think a very different environment. Forecasting into Q4 is really hard; we\u2019re giving you our best shot. I think that after Q3 we all maybe able to get a better perspective. There will be more information but certainly the sentiment going into the back half of the year is very different from what it is today.","Now we\u2019re not sitting here thinking and hoping that everybody there will be say, okay so we won't compete in consumer electronics we\u2019re not counting on that. What we\u2019re highlight is that we ourselves are approaching holiday this year with a different set of tools than last year. Sharon talked about the better enhanced effectiveness around promotions and of course we have a whole list of things that we have been working on during the year that I mentioned including our gifting strategy and wish list which are being deployed. The better in store experience with the additional stores within the stores and expert labor in particular around Ultra-High definition TV but also appliances and what not. The more targeted marketing communication, the ship from store of course which will be in all of the stores was not in other stores last year. It was deployed in all other stores in January.","And then the increased effectiveness as a result of the organizational changes was made in the stores. So as you can see we\u2019re very focused on what we can control in executing everything in our control and then we will take the environment as it is.","David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Just a quick follow-up. Some people think that back-to-school is a harbinger of what is to come with holiday sales. Are you seeing anything with back-to-school that gives you reason for hope or cautiousness?","Hubert Joly","I would say that back-to-school so far is in-line with our expectations. There is potentially I think in retail in general, a more positive environment but we\u2019re not just going to take a couple or three weeks as a source of excitement. This is an economy in general in a sector where there is lot of volatility week to week and month to month depending on this, this and that. So but yes in general there is a sense that the retail environment in the last few weeks have been better and certainly the beginning of the quarter has been in-line with our expectations.","Sharon McCollam","And David I will just add we\u2019re very focused on the calendar at Best Buy and the things that go all around the calendar. One thing to consider which I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all considering. I have seen several reports, is that because of the weather last year many school districts are going back to school early and we are also very focused on how much of this is lift versus shift because of the timing of earlier back-to-school dates than a year ago to cover up for snow days. So that is just an add for you on some things that we\u2019re looking at internally just to make sure we don\u2019t get over -- get ahead of our lights in this.","Operator","Thank you. And we will move along to our next question from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank","A couple of questions. First, on phones, you have talked a few times about not sure what the volumes you guys are going to get or the inventory. How has that played out in the past iPhone launches? Can you remind us what kind of allocations you have gotten and has it actually been a positive to your business when it launches or is it maybe perhaps can be a negative because people are going to go to the Apple stores because you guys won't have the allocations?","Hubert Joly","Yes, I mean what I would say without getting into excessive details. We have a very good relationship with all of our key vendors in that space. I think we\u2019re mutually important to each other and we value their relationship. I think they value the channel. So in general that would be true in our business. Anytime there is significant innovation from a product standpoint that is far from being a negative if I can put it this way. So we look forward to the launch, I think our comments pertaining to the fact that every time in the initial weeks there is limited inventory and now I think we are being treated by our vendors very, very fairly. There is no doubt about this and I think in phones in the U.S. we have to keep in mind that while in the last five years you\u2019ve seen a rapid increase of the penetration of smartphone you will reach a point of penetration which is about 70% which is quite high and it's about 90% plus of the new phones that are being sold being smartphones but there is a point where there is a cap to the penetration of phone. So we\u2019re expecting a huge lift, is not something that we would contemplate.","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank","","When did you expect that to launch by the way? Is that a third quarter or a fourth quarter event?","Hubert Joly","I can give you a phone number in California to call for further details.","Sharon McCollam","We have some more visibility to these things than you do.","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank","Understood. One more question if I could on a different topic and just looking at the expenses that you referenced the November 2012 Analyst Day documented a few times. In that presentation I think at the time you had said that your North American corporate G&A was about $4.2 billion which I think was 10% of your North American sales at that time. Can you update us on where that number is 18 months later?","Sharon McCollam","We have not been continuing to publish that number, we actually because of the investments we have made in the stores and other things, we feel that it's little more competitive than it used to be. So we have made a decision to not continue to report on segments of our G&A. ","Operator","And we will move along to our next question from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer","My first question, you have mentioned the Ultra HD TV quite a bit and others have as well. As we look at that product category, what do you see -- maybe more from a qualitative standpoint, the consumer response right now? And are there certain things that need to change whether it be content and such to make Ultra HD maybe a bigger driver of better topline results at Best Buy?","Hubert Joly","What\u2019s very exciting about Ultra-High Definition TV compared to 3D a few years ago is that the customer benefits is immediately tangible and meaningful in the form of improved image quality which of course is a huge driver of demand in particular when you get to these very large screens, the number of pixels become critically important and what\u2019s very positive today is that even without new content you\u2019ve the upscaling and so with the current content the customers see a material difference and when they go to our stores we can show them the difference between high-definition and ultra-high definition TV and I encourage everyone on the call as well as the rest of the country to pay a visit to one of our stores where you\u2019ve the Samsung and Sony customer experience.","When you walk into the store you don\u2019t know that you need an Ultra-High Definition TV. After 10 minutes seeing the product and talking with Wesley [ph] blue shirt was hyper trained in Ultra-High Definition TV. You will know that you needed, the only question you will have is when and which one it will be. Now beyond that of course, there are various media companies that are working on 4k content. I think you can hear Netflix, you can hear Amazon, you can hear a variety of sources but again we don\u2019t need to wait for that to have that. The TV, Samsung and Sony also have storage devices that allow you to have access to.","So what\u2019s going to drive the penetration is the price decline. Now prices have started to go down and probably for many of you on the phone it's going to be highly affordable this holiday but for the vast majority of the public they may want to wait until next year and the following year. There is price points that are significant from that standpoint. So, we think it's essentially a price discussion but the product itself is very ready and exciting. So which is why we said this morning we are excited by the potential but do realize that the impact this year will still be rather limited.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer","A second question is a follow-up if I may. I think someone else asked about back-to-school. In recognizing back-to-school period has shifted a little bit this year and it is obviously not nearly as big as the holiday season but the question I have is we talked about some of these better internal promotional effectiveness. Are you seeing -- is there a way to say that here in back-to-school we have seen these efforts on the part of Best Buy to drive better results and maybe that is a harbinger of how we should think about your promotional effectiveness come the holiday selling season?","Sharon McCollam","Yes I think that obviously every day we\u2019re practicing better promotional effectiveness and when we look at our performance as it relates to all periods but back-to-school as well we have been using that rigor, that promotional rigor around all that that we\u2019re doing and obviously we\u2019re seeing outcome similar to outcomes that we saw in the second quarter. So yes, I believe that what you\u2019re seeing from us today as it relates to pricing and promotional rigor is going to be no different than what you see -- I actually believe in Q4 it will be better because you guys got to remember there were something\u2019s in Q4 last year that of course were above and beyond exceptional target breaches and other things which I don\u2019t even want to raise here. So I believe that all the disciplines we put in around and then those things that will not recur may put us in a very strong position thus the reason that in the prepared remarks today we talked about the fact that despite all of these things we\u2019re still expecting operating margin expansion in the back half equal to what we have seen in the first half of this year.","So despite some of these negative things that we\u2019re talking about despite the fact that we\u2019re going to -- we have guided to you slightly negative single digit comps we\u2019re still saying we\u2019re going to expand our operating margin even though -- versus some of the first call estimates we could have 300 million or so less revenues. So it is that promotional effectiveness and of course then there is the G&A side of it as well that\u2019s driving that but we\u2019re expecting to see benefit in Q4 on both.","Hubert Joly","Thank you Sharon and I think we\u2019re going to wrap this at this point and in closing obviously I want to thank our teams across the business for their outstanding commitment and hard work serving our customers every day and driving the transformation of our company and of course I would like to thank all of you on this call for your participation this morning and your ongoing support. So thank you and have a terrific day.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation."],"3642":["Best Buy Co., Inc.

Eastern Time today.","I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Mollie O'Brien - Vice President, Investor Relations","Good morning and thank you. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our Chairman and CEO; and Sharon McCollam, our CAO and CFO.","This morning's conference call must be considered in conjunction with the earnings press release we issued this morning.

These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to facilitate meaningful year-over-year comparison, but should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for and should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures for the period.

The consumer electronics industry, as defined and tracked by The NPD Group, includes TVs, desktop and notebook computers, tablets, not including Kindle, digital imaging and other categories. Sales of these products represent approximately 65% of our domestic revenue. It does not include mobile phones, gaming, movies, music, appliances or services.","I will now turn the call over to Hubert.","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Mollie, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with an overview of our second quarter results. We'll then provide highlights of the progress we're making against our priorities and then turn the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook.","So first, our financial results. The results we're reporting today are strong with both significant top line and bottom line growth in the domestic business. We believe these better-than-expected results are affirmation that our strategy of offering advice, service and convenience at competitive prices is paying off.","So more specifically, Enterprise revenue grew 0.8% to $8.5 billion, driven by a 3.9% increase in the domestic segment, partially offset by the impact of the Canadian brand consolidation and 120 basis points of pressure from foreign currency.","Better year-over-year performance in the Domestic segment drove a 50-basis-point increase in the Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate to 3.4%, and a 17% increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS to $0.49. We also returned $321 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases in addition to $81 million in regular dividends.","In the Domestic business, our comparable sales increased 2.7%, excluding the impact of installment billing, driven by continued strong performance in major appliances, large-screen televisions and mobile phones. Online comparable sales increased 17%, as our investments in new capabilities continued to drive increased traffic and higher conversion rates. We also saw industry revenue in the NPD-tracked categories, which represents 65% of our revenue, improved from a decline of 5.3% in Q1 to a decline of 1.3% in Q2.","In the International business, while revenue declined due to store closures and foreign currency, we're seeing higher-than-expected retention from the 66 permanently-closed Future Shop locations in Canada. We're now in the midst of converting the remaining 65 Future Shop locations to the Best Buy brands. And much of the work in investments around building a superior multi-channel customer experience are still ahead of us, as we will discuss later in the call today.","Now before I share specific highlights on our progress on key fiscal 2016 initiatives, I'd like to discuss a few strategic observations about what we believe has been driving our recent performance. And while recognizing the current turbulence in the financial market, we do feel this is an opportune time to do this as it is almost three years to the day of my appointment and nearly three years since the launch of our Renew Blue strategy.","Our first observation is that overall consumer demand for technology products and services including appliances and mobile phones is growing. This growth is driven by technology and product innovation and by micro factors such as population growth, the housing recovery and healthy living trends that are driving momentum in our appliance, home theater, connected homes and health and wearables business, which, we believe, will remain positive catalyst in quarters to come.","In addition, the increasing complexity and interoperability of technology products and the advent of the Internet of Things are making Best Buy's operating model increasingly relevant as customers want and need more help selecting, installing, connecting, integrating, using, maintaining and taking full advantage of their products.","Our second observation, which I mentioned earlier, is that the investments that we've made in our Renew Blue strategy to offer advice, service and convenience at competitive prices are paying off. This is evidenced by the market share gains we have achieved in the NPD-tracked categories, our growth in appliances and mobile phones and the overall positive domestic comps and expanded operating income rate that we have delivered both last year and year-to-date this year.","Our third and final observation is that we have three distinct competitive advantages that help us win with customers, drive better financial results and are hard for competitors to replicate.","The first competitive advantage is our ability to serve our customers online, in-store, and in their home. What does this mean? We now offer a leading-edge digital shopping experience to our customers online and in our new mobile app and we also have stores within 15 minutes of 70% of the U.S. population that not only provide advice, service and convenience to our in-store customers, but also operate as local distribution centers to provide online customers with greater inventory availability and faster delivery. And for Geek Squad, we're able to provide an array of services to our customers remotely in our stores and in their home.","The second competitive advantage is our positioning in the marketplace, which allows us to benefit from early adopters, who choose Best Buy when new exciting technology is released. And our strong merchandising and vendor partnerships allow us to showcase the best of what is selling, which, in turn, positions us to outperform the sales trends within the NPD-tracked consumer electronic categories even when they are negative.","This leads us to our third competitive advantage, which is our vendor partnerships. Not only do we showcase the best of what our vendors offer, we're also benefiting from the material investments that several of the world's leading technology companies are making in our stores. With these partnerships, we're able to bring to life interactive technology experiences that again make the Best Buy operating model more relevant for customers. And as you'll hear later in the call, our vendor partnerships are continuing to grow, confirming that they're bringing value not only to our customers and Best Buy, but also to our vendor partners.","So now with these observations as a backdrop, I'd like to discuss our progress on key fiscal 2016 initiatives. This quarter, I'm going to start with services as it is a critical component of our Renew Blue strategy. We have significant services assets today, including our ability to assist customers in our stores remotely and in their homes. We currently have approximately 20,000 Geek Squad agents and Magnolia System designers, and we're proud of the services we offer as we generate some of our highest NPS scores.","Now, two things have been negatively impacting our services top line. The first is the reduced frequency and severity of claims on our extended warranties. This has the impact of reducing our repair revenue, which at face value appears negative, but it's actually beneficial both financially and operationally.","The second is the decline of our traditional warranty business. We are addressing this decline by materially renewing our service offerings to make them compelling and price competitive. More broadly, we're ramping up our strategic investments in our services business to make it play an increasing role in our Renew Blue transformation, as a differentiator, as a business driver and as a profit center in its own right.","In this context, we have several new developments to share this quarter. They're all part of evolving this business from a traditional warranty business to a value-added services business that addresses the help our customers need.","So first, in our computing and tablet service categories, beginning September 13, we're launching a range of services, including Geek Squad Protect & Support Plus, which combines hardware support, 24\/7 software support and accidental damage in one plan priced very competitively. Second, we will also begin selling AppleCare later this quarter, and additionally, we will proceed to roll out our capabilities as an Apple-authorized service provider first with in-store pilots in 50 locations by holiday. Third, we've begun to offer a range of classes to help customers take advantage of their technology products, including in our digital imaging hubs, in our Samsung Experience Shops and in our Windows Stores around the launch of Windows 10.","In support of this services strategy, we are investing in talent, systems and processes to further enhance the quality and scope of the services we deliver to our customers. We're also continuing to drive operational and cost efficiencies, which are resulting in reduced repair costs and a higher year-over-year gross profit rate.","I'll now turn to our progress on our merchandising initiatives. In appliances, we've rolled out 35 of the 60 additional Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store planned for this year, increasing their presence to 152 of our stores. We also began the rollout of our expanded Samsung Appliance Experiences and expect to roll out approximately 225 Samsung Open Houses by the end of the year, which will be the largest dedicated in-store display of Samsung appliances in the U.S.","In home theater, we've continued to solidify our position as the destination for customers to discover and interact with industry-leading home theater technology, particularly, ultra-high definition or 4K TVs. We've expanded our Samsung home theater stores-within-a-store from 500 at launch to 603 and the Sony home theater stores-within-a-store from 350 at launch to 372. We've also rolled out 5 of the 20 planned Magnolia Design Center stores-within-a-store for this year, increasing their presence to 63 of our stores.","And as we enter the back half of the year and as pricing of these technologies becomes even more affordable, we believe that we will continue to benefit from the customer moving to larger-screen televisions and 4K technology.","In computing, we believe we are optimally positioned to help customers transition to the new Windows 10 operating system that was introduced at the end of July. We have a very large selection of laptops with Windows 10 already installed and a compelling in-store experience with Windows store-within-a-store. Today, we have over 600 of these in the U.S. and expect to have over 800 by holiday.","We've also been working with Apple to update the 740 stores-within-a-store that were first implemented in 2007. The stores-within-a-store will have new Apple fixtures and are larger with more display tables for phones, computers and tablets. We've already implemented approximately 350 of them and expect to upgrade a total of approximately 520 by holiday. The additional display tables are great for the merchandising of Apple Watch, which went on sale on BestBuy.com and in more than 100 of our stores in August.","Now because demand for Apple Watch has been so strong in these stores and online, we are excited to share that beginning September 4 we will be carrying Apple Watch in more than 900 of our big-box stores. Apple Watch will be available in all 1,050 of our big-box stores and in approximately 30 of our Best Buy Mobile Stores by the end of September.","Now I'd like to share some of the recent developments related to our online experience. In the second quarter, we continued to leverage our ship-from-store, digital marketing and enhanced website functionality to drive a 17% increase in domestic comparable online sales. This growth was driven, number one, by a significantly increased number of our online customers, who received and took advantage of our free two-day shipping promise, enabled by enhancements through our ship-from-store capability and supply-chain investments that are driving improved speed, convenience and reliability. Number two, increased by the increased visibility of open-box and clearance inventory and number three by the expansion of online-only flash sales.","We also launched several customer-facing site improvements, including expanded payment options for our customers through partnering with American Express to offer Pay With Points, the ability to search and shop by brand, and a significantly more relevant recommendation engine.","Turning to costs. To-date, we have eliminated $100 million in annualized cost as part of our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization program, which has a goal of $400 million over three years. These savings will be offset, however, by the incremental investments in our future growth initiatives, which, for this year, we expect to be approximately $120 million. To-date, we've invested approximately $65 million to fund these initiatives of which $35 million was in the second quarter.","So to repeat, we're proud of the results we're reporting today. As we look forward, the combination of an opportunity-rich environment and the strength of our competitive advantages lead us to have a positive outlook about our future prospects, starting with the important back-to-school third quarter. And so, of course, we'd like to thank all of our associates for their hard work and contributions to our success. The opportunities we have before us today are possible because of the talent and engagement of our entire team, and I'm extremely proud of their performance and ability to win.","I will now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our second quarter financials and our third quarter outlook.","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our second quarter better-than-expected results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Our Enterprise revenue of $8.5 billion exceeded our expectations due to a stronger-than-expected overall performance in our Domestic business in addition to higher sales retention from previously closed stores in our Canadian brand consolidation.","Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.4% also exceeded our expectations due to a higher gross profit rate in our computing business, a higher gross profit rate in our services business due to a periodic profit-sharing payment from our externally-managed extended service plan portfolio and an extended warranty deferred revenue adjustment and a better-than-expected performance of our credit card portfolio. As Hubert said, we are extremely proud of the team who drove these better-than-expected results.","I will now talk to you about our second quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 0.8% to $8.5 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.07 to $0.49, driven primarily by stronger year-over-year performance in the Domestic business from higher sales volume, improved gross profit rates and a $0.04 periodic profit-sharing payment in deferred revenue adjustments that we just discussed. These year-over-year increases were partially offset by a negative $0.02 impact from a higher effective income tax rate due to a discrete tax benefit in Q2 fiscal 2015 that did not recur this year.","In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 3.9% to $7.9 billion. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 2.7%, excluding the benefit from installment billing, an estimated 110-basis-point benefit associated with installment billing, and a 30-basis-point benefit from the periodic profit-sharing payment and deferred revenue adjustment in services.","Our Domestic comparable online revenue increased 17%, driven by increased traffic and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 90 basis points to 8.6% versus 7.7% last year. Versus last year's growth rate of 22%, this year's online growth rate of 17% was lower primarily due to lapping over 100,000 basis points of growth from ship-from-store in Q2 last year. The ship-from-store impact will continue through the back half of this year.","From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in major appliances, televisions, mobile phones and health and fitness was partially offset by ongoing declines in tablets. In services, revenues declined 13.1%. As Hubert discussed earlier, this is primarily due to lower repair revenue and, to a much lesser extent, declining attach rates in our traditional warranty business. Since we expect this trend of lower repair revenue to continue, which is a positive, comparable sales and services are expected to continue to decline through the back half of this year.","In our International segment, revenue declined 25.6% to $650 million due to the loss of revenue associated with the closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation, a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 1,200 basis points and ongoing softness in the Canadian economy and Canadian consumer electronics industry.","Turning now to gross profit, the Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 100 basis points to 24.4%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 120 basis points to 24.6%. This increase was primarily due to the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower costs due to lower claim frequency and severity, a rate improvement in computing hardware, an increased mix of higher-margin, large-screen televisions, a 25-basis-point impact from the periodic profit-sharing payment in deferred revenue adjustment we previously discussed, and a positive mix benefit from significantly decreased revenue in the lower margin tablet category.","These increases were partially offset by a lower rate in the mobile category, driven by increased sales of higher-priced iconic mobile phones, which deliver higher gross profit dollars, but carry a lower gross profit rate. The international non-GAAP gross profit rate was flat year-over-year at 22.9%.","Now turning to SG&A, Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.8 billion, or 21% of revenue, an increase of $57 million, or 50 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.6 billion, or 26% of revenue, an increase of $114 million, or 70 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by investments in future growth initiatives, in addition to SG&A inflation and higher incentive compensation.","International non-GAAP SG&A was $170 million, or 26.2% of revenue, a decrease of $57 million, at a rate increase of 20 basis points. This dollar decrease was primarily driven by the elimination of expenses associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. The 20-basis-point increase is driven by year-over-year sales deleverage.","As it relates to the Canadian brand consolidation, we incurred approximately $0.02 of negative non-GAAP diluted EPS in the first half of the year, which was lower than expected due to retaining sales at a higher-than-expected rate. As such, we are reducing our estimated impact of the consolidation to a range of $0.10 to $0.17 in fiscal 2016 versus our original estimate of negative $0.10 to $0.20 as the retention rate trends are expected to continue in the back half of the year.","By quarter, this expectation is broken down as follows. The negative $0.02 per share that we incurred in the first half, a negative $0.04 to $0.06 per share in Q3 and a negative $0.04 to $0.09 per share in Q4. Ultimately, when our consolidation initiatives are complete, we are expecting our Canadian business to be a more vibrant and more profitable business with profitability being defined as both higher operating income dollars and a higher operating income rate.","From a balance sheet perspective in the second quarter, we returned over $400 million in cash to our shareholders, $321 million through share repurchases and $81 million in regular dividends. In addition, in the last two weeks, both Moody's and Standard & Poor's upgraded Best Buy's debt rating by one notch. Moody's raised their rating to Baa1 and Standard & Poor's raised theirs to BB+.","I would now like to talk about our financial outlook. As Hubert said earlier, our competitive advantages and strong execution give us a positive outlook on our domestic performance versus the industry, which bodes well for us, as we enter the third quarter. It is difficult to know, though, if the recent volatility in the financial markets will affect overall consumer spending. To-date, however, we have not seen a measurable impact versus our original expectations. So, as such, our outlook assumes that there will be no material changes in consumer spending in the third quarter.","With that said, our year-over-year non-GAAP outlook for Q3 fiscal 2016 is as follows. In the Domestic business, we are expecting flat to low-single-digit revenue growth, and an approximately flat operating income rate driven by a higher gross profit rate offset by increased SG&A due to inflation and growth-related investments. In the International business due to the ongoing impacts of the Canadian brand consolidation and foreign currency, we are expecting an international revenue decline of approximately 30% and an international non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of negative 2.5% to negative 3.5%.","With these expectations, which assume continued strength in our domestic business offset by the near-term impacts of Canada, at the Enterprise level, we expect a flat to negative low-single-digit revenue growth rate and an operating income rate growth of flat to negative 20 basis points. This includes an approximately 15-basis-point negative year-over-year impact in the Domestic business due to an $11.5 million or $0.02 per share legal settlement that we received in Q3 of last year that will not recur this year.","Additionally, we expect the non-GAAP effective income tax rate from continuing operations to be in the range of 39% to 40% versus 38.1% last year, which could result in a negative $0.01 year-over-year non-GAAP diluted EPS impact in Q3 fiscal 2016.","I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go first to Anthony Chukumba from BB&T.","Anthony Chinonye Chukumba - BB&T Capital Markets","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First off, congrats on a blowout quarter. One thing that jumped out at me or one of the many things that jumped out at me was the 21% comps or sales growth in appliances. I was just wondering what would you attribute that to? And then second off, how sustainable do you think that is going forward \u2013 I mean, maybe not at that rate, but the double-digit rate? Thank you.","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Anthony. Thank you for your comments. So we are seeing sustained growth now over many, many quarters in our appliance business. This is driven by, number one, the markets. The housing recovery continues to be strong and you're seeing the customers equip their new house or replace their old appliances. That's a very positive factor.","And then second, investments in the appliance sector continue to be very strong. The deployment of the Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store, in particular, is helping us drive better customer experience and market share, in particular, not only in the extreme high-end but also in the better and best part of the market, which is where a lot of the interesting action is. We're also investing in the customer experience from an appliance delivery and installation standpoint. So these are very fundamental and sustained improvements.","Now, Anthony, this may fluctuate a little bit quarter-after-quarter, but we do expect continued traction, including given the competitive environments that I won't elaborate on, but we expect to continue to see positive performance in that segment.","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","And, Anthony, in addition to that, I'll just add one supply chain driver of this as well. We made a significant change in how we source inventories through our distribution network in the U.S., which unlocked a substantial amount of inventory for both our online business and for our individual stores in market. And that is also a driver of this and that will, too, continue as we move forward.","Anthony Chinonye Chukumba - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Horvers of JPMorgan.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I wanted to ask about the TV category. It seems like we're in a sweet spot here. How did \u2013 the pace of price drops in the category, are they occurring, sort of, in line with expectations? How did performance trend, let's say, in the second quarter relative to the past couple of quarters? And is the elasticity there such that you can continue to see accelerating comps into the back half?","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Chris. The price drops that every one of us, as a consumer can track, are very material. And so the prices at which one can buy a 4K TV now very, very exciting. We expect that this will continue in the second half. As we've mentioned in the prepared remarks, these TVs are becoming very affordable. And, of course, the innovation and the material change in picture quality is very helpful. So we expect the market to continue to do well in large TVs and 4K TVs.","And, of course, the second factor, a bit like in appliances, the way we merchandise and the customer experience in our stores, with investments we've made together with some of our key partners, with Samsung, with Sony, with LG, and the Magnolia Design Centers allow us to really perform particularly well in that market. So we see a number of very strong drivers of performance getting into the back half of the year. Now, of course, as we get into the start of the cycle, as you would expect, the margins are not going to continue at the same level, so, factor this in, but it's a very powerful cycle.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then, as a follow-up, I think, Sharon, last year you talked about some back-to-school timing shifting some demand into July. And we've heard a lot of other retailers talk about this shift unwinding and going the other way into August. So any commentary that you can share on the cadence and your thoughts on August so far and any potential lifts you've seen from shift.","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah...","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead...","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Oh, go ahead...","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I was just going to say the outlook that we've provided today on back-to-school in the quarter incorporates what we've seen so far, right, as you would expect. And so the projection reflects what has been happening since the beginning of the quarter. So I think we've made some positive comments on the overall back-to-school in our Q3 in general. So that's reflected.","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","But, Chris, we also last year \u2013 that may have been a discussion from other retailers, but that was not a dialog that we had in our conference call last year.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks very much.","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Chris.","Operator","We'll go next to Kate McShane of Citi.","Katharine McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. Good morning. My question centered around holiday 2015 and the expectations for the promotional environment. Just with some of the robustness, especially, in TVs, do you expect any alleviation in price competition as innovation remains pretty exciting going into the holiday season year-over-year?","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Good morning, Kate. Let me say one thing about Q4. Because we are the leader in the category and because any comments I would make today are highly sensitive from a competitive standpoint, you're going to find us relatively shy in terms of making comments that could be used against us, if I can put it this way.","What we have said in our prepared remarks is that we believe there are powerful trends from a demand standpoint around appliances, around TVs, around health and fitness and wearables and around connected home. The other thing I would say, more broadly speaking, not specific to Q4 from a competitive standpoint, if we step back a little bit and I could have included that in my remarks about the last three years, it feels \u2013 I don't know whether all of you will agree with that, but that the competitive landscape has, indeed, changed a little bit in the last three years.","There's a number of players, who have decided to de-emphasize or, in some cases, exit their category. And so that's an important factor. It's true that it's a tough category. So here you go. The other thing that has changed in the last three years, that is actually very notable, is the fact that today 89% of the U.S. population lives within states, where one of our online competitor, headquartered in Seattle, now collects the sales tax. And so three years ago, it was less than 50%. It was probably around 40%. So that's a very material change over a period of three years. So, altogether, from a strategic standpoint, we see these growth drivers, and I would add, based on your question that the competitive landscape has changed somewhat in the last three years.","Katharine McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I appreciate that. Thank you. And just another question. I mean, the number of initiatives with the shop-in-shops and some of the new news that you announced with Apple today with AppleCare and the updating of the shop-in-shop, how do you let your customers know about all these changes? And is it something that you're seeing the customers respond to?","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you, Kate. Marketing, we've not commented on marketing on this call. We've commented on marketing on every one of our previous call. We've had a very material transformation of our marketing efforts in the last three years, with the headline being, of course, more personalized. We went from analog and mass communication to much more targeted, relevant, personalized and digital communications. So as it relates to the shops-within-the-shop, one of the things, of course, is that there's not one of each in every store. So, as an example, we have the ability to target the messages in a relevant fashion, or we have the ability to target previous users of a particular brand and communicate the news and excitement about new product introductions.","More broadly speaking, I am very excited about these how these partnerships with our key vendors have evolved. It's more than just about the physical layout in the stores. These are very close partnerships. These leading tech companies invest billions of dollars in R&D. They have some very exciting new products, of course, regularly coming to market. And the collaboration that Best Buy has with some of these, of the foremost companies on the planet in the tech sector, is very inspiring. That includes from a merchandising standpoint, that's from a marketing standpoint and now also from a services standpoint.","And so, yes, it's an entire collaboration. And I think we can attribute some of our performance to this more targeted, more relevant communications, customer database Athena has been now busy at work. Athena is a very busy company over the last one or two years. And we had always said it would be a gradual implementation and exploitation. And I think we're getting better and better at this.","Katharine McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to David Schick of Stifel.","David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning.","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, David.","David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","You talked about the Canadian recapture rate being better than, I think, you had expected. Just a quick question there. Is that conservative assumptions as you planned it, or something that you're doing or adapting to? I'm curious how that's working.","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, David, in general, we're very pleased with the way the Canadian strategy is being implemented. Our team \u2013 this was heavy lifting consolidating two brands into one, closing 66 doors, converting 65 stores and then investing in the customer experience. So, so far, things are really progressing very nicely. The reason we don't give specific numbers, again, in part, for competitive reasons; two, it's early days; and three, as all of you know, North of the border, the economy, which is highly dependent on raw materials and the oil sector in particular has been impacted. The exchange rate is down, which is, of course, increasing the prices of consumer electronics product, which is slowing down demand.","So today, the better-than-expected retention is somewhat offset, of course, by the weakness of the Canadian economy. I think we'll be able to assess with reliability the final results once we're through the conversion and once we've upgraded the customer experience. But altogether, it was obviously the right thing to do. And it's progressing quite nicely in a somewhat challenged Canadian economy.","David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. As a follow-up question, you talked a little bit about the closer work with vendors and product launches, I think, in response to Kate's prior question. Could you talk about how a product launch from a vendor works today versus a few years ago? How Best Buy's interaction with a vendor on launching a product if we stepped back and looked at it versus three years ago?","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","David, that's \u2013 how much time do you have?","David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","(40:37) as long as you keep going.","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Because it really varies by vendor base. We have such a variety of vendors. In some cases, we actually work very much upstream, including in terms of product design and the choice of feature functionalities, and then this co-designing, the customer experience and in the marketing. In some cases, it's more about the merchandising and the marketing. So there's a whole range, but it's \u2013 in general, what I would highlight is that it is \u2013 it happens earlier on. It's more strategic, it's more integrated and it's working. That would be the summary. Now to our conference we would need to schedule separately.","David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning. This is actually (41:32) for Simeon. I just have a question around lapping the iPhone 6 sales from last year. Can you measure the incremental traffic that brought to the stores? And then, what do you see as a potential impact from \u2013 maybe iWatch is potentially offsetting that?","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","So your question is, does the launch of an iconic product generate traffic to the stores? The answer is yes. And increasingly, again, that's one of the things we're working on with our key vendors is to make it more dramatic and more unique and more differentiated vis-\u00e0-vis any of the other retailers. So I would say yes to that question.","As it relates to your second question is, does the Apple Watch momentum compared to the phone \u2013 that would be too much detail, I think, at this point. I think I would say we're very excited by, again, the early momentum of Apple Watch in our stores, which, obviously, a triggered decision that we've made with Apple to have an accelerated and expanded rollout. So we think that's a very exciting news. It's also reflective of how these partnerships, the strength of these partnerships lead to more opportunities.","Unknown Speaker","All right. Great. Thanks. But, specifically, around the iPhone 6, are you able to like quantify the incremental traffic from last year?","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","We didn't release anything last year, Simeon, (43:00) around the traffic, but, obviously, we had substantial traffic associated because, as you'll recall, one of our big callouts in our revenue in Q3 was related to the iPhone 6. But it was actually from a revenue point of view and from a units point of view, if you recall, it was very much about the revenue, and not the units. So when you think about that, because it's higher dollars. So I would say that it was certainly a traffic driver and we are thrilled to have a new traffic driver this year, something very iconic. I think we can all agree the Apple Watch is certainly iconic and having it in all 1,000 stores by the end of September is a big deal for us.","Unknown Speaker","Okay, guys, thanks. And then, my follow-up is around Project Athena and some of your price optimization initiatives. Can you just talk about where you are with those and are they expected to be in place by the holidays?","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","So there's two components. Athena is really our customer database, which allows us to have this greater personalization and more relevant, more targeted communication. So I think that we'll benefit from that during holiday. I think what you've seen these last couple of quarters is very indicative of our capabilities. And we'll continue to incrementally improve that in the coming quarters.","As it relates to the second part of your question, which is the promotional discipline, this is an area we have invested in. I think if I step back over the last three years, we've had several phases. One is we established a price match policy. Two, we have invested significantly in our price competitiveness, starting with hardware and then accessories. You've heard me talk this morning about services. We have previewed that in previous quarter, but with the launch of Geek Squad Protect & Support Plus that's another step forward.","And then, the other dimension we're talking about, which we had talked about last year, is the promotional discipline. We're applying more science and more tools to this area to make sure that the return on the promotional dollars is getting better and better. So we're continuing to see improved progress in this area. And we'll continue to deploy this as we move forward. We are a very data and science-driven management team here on matters like that.","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","And, Simeon, (45:33) going into holiday, though, and Q3 as well, with Athena, Athena is gradually and incrementally getting better and smarter every quarter. We have made substantial investments every single quarter. When you look at these growth investments that we have been making, a significant number of those have been directly in our ability to use Athena and the database. We've also brought in additional talent into the company in that area; some very sophisticated talent. And that, of course, is advancing us. So when we go into holiday this year, we are definitely going to have a more robust experience for our customers coming out of the efforts that we put forward with Athena.","Unknown Speaker","All right. Great. That was very helpful. Thank you.","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Baker of Deutsche Bank.","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Two questions. One, just on your store count, you're about flat year-over-year. I think you've closed maybe 50 stores out of 1,100 stores since you guys became the management team. As I recall from past conversations, you have a lot of leases that come up for renewal in 2016. Can you just update us on your thoughts on what your long-term store count should be?","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Yes. So first, the 49 stores that you might be thinking of, actually, were closed prior to us joining the company. So the first point that you made was actually just prior to Hubert joining, so just to round set on that fact. Since then, what we are doing, we do have a significant amount of our leases expiring. It's a substantial number and our strategy has not changed. As we are looking at each lease, we will rationalize as we think is appropriate. Last year, we closed five stores. And this year, we'll walk into the year and we will be assessing the leases and determining what that would look like.","But there is no announcement to be made. We consistently have said that targeting a store count, we're targeting rationalization of our footprint, particularly, in our multi-store markets, and to the extent that we have redundancy or stores that we feel should not be in the network long-term. Of course, we'll close those. We're not reluctant to close them. But, right now, as we've talked about consistently, we do not have \u2013 look at these numbers \u2013 we do not have a list of stores that we have negative cash flows, or significant issues with. So, that's the great news. We don't have a story to tell about our portfolio that is not performing.","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right. Yeah, excellent point. A second question, if I could, can you quantify the gross profit rate benefit of the change in the mobile warranty plan this quarter? I mean, do you list them in your press release in order of the magnitude? And then, a related question. I think you start to lap up against that in the fourth quarter of this year. Is that right?","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Yes. That's right. We do list them in order of magnitude. So that's all the information, because, again, some of this is pretty competitive. But we definitely list them in order. And I think you've got one that was quantified below it. So it's more than that.","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right. Yes. Understood. Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on to someone else.","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And, Mike, what I would say amplifying what Sharon just said, you'll find us increasingly prudent about releasing product category detailed information, because we are only focused on technology, because it's natural to ask these questions. And we're very focused on transparency, but we are also thoughtful about the help it provides to our competitors. So, hopefully, you'll understand when we feel that too much information can hurt us as a company, and therefore, can hurt our investors' trade secrets, we think, are valuable to our investors as well.","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Appreciate it.","Operator","We'll go next to Dan Binder of Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning and congratulations on a good quarter.","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","There were two things I wanted to touch on. First, you talked about increased conversion. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the change in the labor model and the dot-com acceleration, I suspect \u2013 I think you said it was a function of conversion how maybe average time to customer is coming down, if you could just touch on those two things?","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you for your question. There's multiple facets in your question. So let's start with the online components. Which we report online sales and it's an important part of our business, but we believe that online and mobile are a much bigger part of the business than just the online sales, because it's really front door to the store. This is where we all notice. This is where the customers start the research. So we are excited about the growth of online. We are excited about the increased traffic and the increased conversion rate.","I think the improvements that have been made on the site and in the app over the last three years are just extraordinary. Now we have a long way to go, but I'm very proud now of where we are. Still continued progress to be made in the checkout, in the customer experience, significant improvement from a supply chain standpoint, it's been transformative. The speed at which we're shipping now, in particular, enabled by ship-from-store, that's been a phenomenal transformation. Now the customers may start the journey online, they often go to the stores.","Now, we've always believed that as a result of these trends in consumer behavior, the store experience need to be so much better, right? Because when the customer gets to the store, she has done a lot of research and she's much more educated than maybe a few years ago. And so it's maybe that in some cases we see fewer trips to the store, because so much time has been spent before the store. And so the focus in the store is on the customer experience. So first physically and together with these vendors, we've invested significantly in the physical experience in the stores, and candidly, it is so helpful. You cannot use your senses online to see the difference in picture quality of the TV or the sound quality of a headphone. You really have to go to the store.","And then, of course, there's the blue shirts. Our associates are such a formidable weapon for us. And I hope we're doing a good job this morning on thanking them on the call for their amazing performance in the entire leadership in retail.","I think your question refers, in particular, to the comments we've made about the increased proficiency that we've made \u2013 that the associates have in the stores, even though we've taken $1 billion of cost out, we've actually increased the amount of customer-facing labor, and we've increased the product knowledge, the engagement and the overall sales proficiency. So we've talked about it as IST, individual sales productivity, individual sales tracking. This program has continued to be deployed. And we can measure the improvements as a particular area of focus. Our store leadership is focused on what they call \u2013 what we call value-add, which is the difference between the comps in the stores and the traffic. So it's really focused on what they control in the stores.","And we're seeing continued progress from that standpoint. I'm incredibly proud of what we're seeing in the stores. Now there's more to come. I think that I'd be lying to you, if I was going to tell you that we are consistently excellent. We have a number of stores, a number of associates that still have progress to make. But it's the combination of this better in-store performance and the excellent merchandising, the supply chain, the marketing, the service components, really the integration of all these capabilities that is resulting in these better-than-expected and better period results. So continued progress on all of these fronts.","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","And I'll just add that last year, we talked about the investments that we were going to be making in IST, because our systems and our HR management tools were not set up to manage IST. We've been making progress on that. The stores are able to much more easily see performance individuals, and our stores are being able to see their actual performance and be able to be coached and to be able to work on improving that performance. And we believe, without a question, that the efforts that we have seen related to this in-store are absolutely driving these positive comps.","So the implementation of IST last year, if you just go back and look at when we first started talking about IST and you look at the outcomes that we have been seeing in the retail stores, because, remember, that the retail stores delivered significantly positive comps this quarter. So we definitely believe that there is a correlation there and we are optimistic that we will continue to see longer-term improvements, as Hubert described, the proficiency that we're trying to build through this program.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","And if I could, just a follow-up on leverage and buyback. Obviously, the results have been showing improvement. Net of cash, you don't have a lot of leverage. Just curious if your thoughts around that are changing in any way.","Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer","No, not at \u2013 I mean, obviously, in the first quarter, we did repurchase about $321 million worth of shares. When we launched the program last quarter, I believe, we said we were going to do $1 billion over three years. There's no doubt that we are going to achieve that quicker just based on what we did in the second quarter. And we will continue to be there to support our stock. So I don't think anything's changed from our lens around maintaining a strong balance sheet. The performance clearly justifies us accelerating against that $1 billion, which you've already seen us do. So that's how we're going to \u2013 that's the best answer I can give you at this point.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Hubert for any additional or closing comments.","Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you so much. In closing, I'll just repeat this. Very proud of the results. We're excited about our prospects and opportunities. Very grateful for the work of our team and continue to be very grateful for your support, as we continue to unfold our story. So we look forward to seeing you first in our stores or online, we'll be there for you, and then on our next call. So thank you very much. Have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude our conference for today.

Welcome to the Best Buy's Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2012. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by 12 p.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Bill Seymour, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Bill Seymour","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our fiscal fourth quarter 2012 conference call. We have 2 speakers today: Brian Dunn, our CEO; and Jim Muehlbauer, our CFO. And after our prepared remarks, we should have plenty of time for your questions.","A few items before we get started. As usual, the media are participating in this call on a listen-only mode. Let me remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Best Buy may contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations.","Today's call is scheduled to be 1.5 hours to accommodate the material we are presenting today. We will be showing slides today on the webcast that run concurrently with our presentation, starting after Jim's initial comments. You can also download these slides on our IR site.","As previously announced on November 7, 2011, we began reporting net operating results of certain discontinued operations in our fiscal fourth quarter, primarily related to the Best Buy store closures in the U.K., China and Turkey. You'll find, on our IR site, a file that reconciles the fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 financials from continuing ops to financials that include discontinued ops.","You will also note that our reported results this morning include non-GAAP financial measures, excluding approximately $2.6 billion in charges associated with the purchase of CPW's share of the Best Buy Mobile profit share agreement and related costs; the Best Buy Europe goodwill impairment and restructuring charges, which are largely related to the activities announced on November 7. These results should not be confused with the GAAP numbers we reported this morning in our earnings release or the GAAP numbers we will report in our 10-K. In addition, the 2012 fiscal year adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share we'll be discussing today exclude the aforementioned items, as well as the gain on sale of investments previously discussed in Q3. For a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of our reported to adjusted results and guidance, please refer to the supplemental schedules in this morning's news release.","We also refer to free cash flow in today's results in our discussion today. Our definition of free cash flow is operating cash flow minus CapEx.","Finally, as you recall, we are changing our fiscal year, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. To assist you in your modeling, we have provided a file on our IR site today that provides fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 financial statements recast for the new fiscal year with the relevant reconciliations.","With those items out of the way, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian.","Brian J. Dunn","Good morning. I'd like to begin by providing an overview of several of the key items we announced today. First, our Q4 and full year results show that we finished relatively strong and delivered adjusted earnings in the top half of our most recent guidance range. Also, as you recall, we took a number of important actions last year that we expect to pay off in the near and long term.","Despite these actions and results, I'm not satisfied with the pace or degree of improvement in our performance and transformation, especially given the opportunities we have in the marketplace. So today, we're announcing a series of significant steps to drive our transformation in 2013 and beyond, all focused on improving the customer experience and our financial performance. This includes taking $800 million out of our annual cost through fiscal 2015, closing 50 U.S. big box stores this year, opening 100 Best Buy Mobile stores, driving growth in e-commerce in China and improving our customers' experience, among other actions.","We believe that this set of actions will help drive benefits this year and improve earnings and returns over time. I'll come back in a few minutes to tell you more about our planned actions in the year ahead, but first, I'll ask Jim to provide a quick overview of our fourth quarter and the full year results. Here's Jim.","James L. Muehlbauer","Thanks. As Brian mentioned, our fourth quarter and annual earnings results finished in the upper half of our updated guidance expectations. The quarter's highlights included continued strength in our online channel, overall market share gains, strong growth in connectable products, continued focus on expense control and strong cash management.","As noted in our release, there are a large number of additional reporting items in FY '12, which resulted from the proactive measures we took during the year to improve the business. These items include the closure of unprofitable businesses, restructuring costs, the purchase of CPW's interest in the Best Buy Mobile profit-sharing agreement and taking certain noncash impairments.","As Bill mentioned, our release details our GAAP results and our adjusted results of continuing operations for the quarter and the year. You should refer to these numbers for complete information regarding our financial results. In order to be consistent with how we've discussed results all year long and how we have provided guidance and, consequently, to what you have -- likely have in your models, I'll focus my discussion today on our adjusted results of total operations. Specifically, this includes operations that were discontinued in FY '12 and excludes restructuring and other charges. I believe this will be the most straightforward and transparent way to evaluate our FY '12 performance against expectations.","For the year, total company revenue finished at $51.1 billion and comparable store sales declined 1.7%, each falling within the guidance ranges we provided all year long. Revenue dollars were at the low end of our range, while comparable store sales were right in the middle of our expectation of flat to down 3%.","Our Domestic comparable store sales results in the fourth quarter were led by the online channel, which continued to deliver strong revenue growth of approximately 20%, after being up a similar amount in Q3. Online growth was fueled by strong traffic growth and year-over-year improvement in conversion rate, driven by continued competitive pricing, an expanded assortment and free shipping promotions.","Looking at our overall product categories, the biggest positive sales drivers came from our connected product focus areas, including tablets and eReaders with low-triple-digit comps and mobile phones with a comp of 20%. The robust growth achieved in these product categories reflects our continued success where connectivity, innovation and customer demand was strong this year. Appliances also delivered strong growth during the quarter, with comparable store sales growth of more than 10%, driven by increased store labor investments and promotional enhancements to grow our share of this business.","These growth areas in the Domestic segment were more than offset by areas of comparable store sales declines from gaming, notebook computers, digital imaging and televisions. These declines were primarily driven by continued industry declines in these product categories.","Despite the decline in Domestic comparable store sales in the fourth quarter, we believe our performance relative to the industry actually improved. As we estimate, our overall market share gain was stronger in Q4 than Q3.","International comparable store sales were bolstered by our Five Star business in China, which had comparable store sales growth of 8%, driven by strong consumer demand from the expected expiration of government-sponsored trade-in programs. This will be a headwind to our China sales early in FY '13 as some of this business is most likely a pull-forward of customer demand.","Total revenue growth for Five Star was 22% in Q4, reflecting the net addition of 38 new stores. Offsetting the Five Star comp growth were our businesses in Canada and Europe, which each had mid-single-digit comp declines. In Canada, the decline was a function of industry softness, as we believe we continued to maintain market share. Europe continued to experience slowed connection growth, given the difficult macro and highly competitive environment.","Turning now to gross profit performance in the fourth quarter. The Domestic segment delivered gross profit dollar growth of 2%. As anticipated and discussed on our last call, the rate decline improved sequentially to down 40 basis points from the third quarter decline of 130 basis points. This improvement was primarily due to more favorable product mix from strong mobile phone and lower notebook and gaming sales and more profitable sales within the computing, tablets and movie areas.","Within the International segment, gross profit dollars increased 6% in the fourth quarter. This growth was driven by a rate increase of 140 basis points. We were pleased to see rate improvements across each international business, an indication of our growing scale and presence across our key markets.","In Canada, the team did a great job of optimizing our dual-brand strategy with Best Buy and Future Shop. During the year, we made improvements to inventory management, solution selling and driving growth in the margin-accretive mobile business. In Europe, the increased gross profit rate was largely a result of improving our partnerships with carriers and a higher mix of postpaid connections. In China, our continued rapid growth of Five Star has given us greater size and influence in the market. Margins increased through reducing product costs and improving relationships with vendors, including more exclusive arrangements.","In total, the fourth quarter gross profit rate increased 10 basis points for the company. This increase was better than our expectation of a modest decline in Q4 and led to a full year rate decline of 40 basis points. For context, the 40-basis-point decline for the company followed a gross profit rate expansion of 70 basis points last year. Given the focus on Best Buy's ability to maintain gross profit rates within the current macro environment and competitive CE industry, it's worth highlighting that the full year company gross profit rate of 24.8% is 30 basis points above our previous 5-year trend.","We have been actively managing our SG&A spend all year long, and the fourth quarter was no exception. These efforts have helped to fund pricing and promotional investments. Total company SG&A increased 1% during the quarter, driven by a 3% increase in the International segment, while Domestic spending was approximately flat. Excluding our 53rd week and FX, fourth quarter company SG&A was down 4%. For the full fiscal year, total SG&A expense increased 1% and was down 1% when excluding the 53rd week and FX. The 1% increase in SG&A was better than our updated guidance of 2% growth.","Total company operating income dollars were up 8% in Q4, and the rate increased 40 basis points versus the prior year. For the year, our operating income declined 5%, which was at the low end of our updated guidance range of a 5% decline to 2% growth.","Moving on to EPS. Fourth quarter EPS finished at $2.47, representing an increase of 25%. Full year EPS was $3.64, representing 6% growth and finished at the top end of our most recent guidance of $3.35 to $3.65.","As I compare our full year EPS results to annual consensus of $3.38, I would characterize the $0.26 beat to annual consensus in 2 high-level areas. First, operating income accounted for approximately $0.10 of the favorability, a function of stronger gross profit rates and lower SG&A spending. The remainder of the favorability is related to taxes, which I'd separate into 2 different parts. First is what I would call normal and ongoing items, including the achievement of the low end of our tax guidance range, coupled with the resolution of tax matters. Together, this accounted for approximately $0.11. Second, and less significant, were benefits arising from our buy of CPW's interest in the Best Buy Mobile profit-sharing agreement, accounting for approximately $0.05.","Before handing the discussion back to Brian, let's quickly follow-up on a few key FY '12 initiatives we announced at last April's Analyst Day. E-commerce is one of the fastest-growing sales channels for our business. In FY '12, we achieved our online sales plan, gained market share and grew online Domestic revenue 18% over last year, an approximate 50% increase in the growth rate from last year. Sales momentum in this channel improved as the year progressed, and our strongest performance came during the holidays, where we estimate that we outpaced industry growth by almost 2x during this period.","As we said in April, one of our focus areas was improving market share. According to external sources, for the full year, we believe Best Buy gained market share in total. The focus of our market share discussion was on growing share in low-share product categories. Mobile phones continued their strong annual share gains in FY '12, driven by additional response to our customer promise and more stand-alone store locations.","We gained significant share in tablets through a successful build out of Tablet Central that utilized dedicated expert labor to assist customers through a broad assortment of product, connectivity and service options. In appliances, a strong share gain was the result of improvements to the operating model and enhanced promotional effectiveness.","In gaming, while we rolled our pre-owned gaming capability across our stores and improved our sales from important pre-orders for new titles, we did not achieve our market share goals in this business. The resulting sales miss in this area was amplified by the disappointing performance of the entire gaming industry, where sales declined double digits.","We also had a goal of selling 10 million Domestic connections during fiscal '12, this from a business that sold less than 5 million just 3 years ago. Total connections for the year finished at 9 million, falling short of our goal, but still growing 11%. The majority of the current connections business is driven by Best Buy Mobile, and that business had another very strong year, growing total sales by nearly 30% when we include stand-alone stores and services.","We stated goals to grow long-term earnings and expand return on invested capital. We took significant actions against those goals by closing our unprofitable big box stores in the U.K. and purchasing CPW's interest in the Best Buy Mobile profit-sharing agreement, which now gives us full ownership of this capability and 100% of the future profits as we expand the connection opportunities across additional categories.","Finally, we discussed capital allocation and our free cash flow generation expectation for the year of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, which we achieved at the top end, with full year free cash flow of $2.5 billion. With this cash flow, we continued to return cash to shareholders with $1.5 billion in share repurchases during the year.","So looking back on the year just completed, while consumer demand in the CE industry continued to provide headwinds in many traditional product categories, we took actions to leverage opportunities provided by our model, highlighted by improved market share, strong online growth, solid expense control, continued actions to improve international returns and capital allocation. In the end, our overall gross profit rate assumption for the year provided our largest financial challenge and materially impacted our ability to grow operating income dollars in FY '12 as we had originally planned.","The current macro and consumer environment fueled heavier promotional activity, especially heading into the holidays, which is a similar story that played out across most of the retail industry. It also provides another reason why we are accelerating the pace of our transformation.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Brian.","Brian J. Dunn","Thanks, Jim. I'd like to address the elements of the transformation work we announced this morning, but I'd like to begin by providing a bit of context on the actions we've been taking over the last few years and how those fit into our larger strategy.","In the last 3 years, the industry experienced little innovation in many of the large traditional CE categories such as television, PCs and gaming. At the same time, consumers have enjoyed greater price transparency and ease of cross shopping. As a result, we knew we had to accelerate our cost reduction efforts, adjust our sales mix and significantly improve on the experience we were delivering for our customers, all of this in the most uncertain consumer and economic environment we've ever experienced.","Last year, to better navigate the \"new normal\" consumer environment, we took some important steps to begin transforming the company and focusing on strategies we felt offered the best opportunities to deliver improved returns. We significantly restructured our International business, closing our big box stores in Shanghai, Turkey and the U.K. when it became clear these investments would not deliver meaningful returns consistent with timely expectations. As Jim mentioned, in November, we acquired CPW's interest in the Best Buy Mobile profit-sharing agreement. These 2 sets of transactions alone are expected to deliver over $250 million in benefits to Best Buy in fiscal 2013. But as I said at the top of the call, despite these actions and despite closing out the year at the upper half of our most recent earnings forecast, I'm not satisfied with the pace or degree of change we've made up to this point.","This is why today we announced a series of actions intended to improve our operating performance and further develop the multichannel \"shop anywhere, anytime, any way\" experience we offer customers. To drive the transformation in fiscal year 2013 and beyond, we are focused on 4 strategic imperatives: one, multiyear cost reductions; two, U.S. store format improvements in the context of our multichannel strategy; three, growth initiatives; four, improved customer experience. Before I dive into these, I want to emphasize the fact that each of them lives in the service of a dramatically improved customer experience.","I'll begin with multiyear cost reductions. We are taking several actions designed to significantly lower our cost base. These moves are intended to help us be more efficient and nimble and, of course, to drive our initiatives to grow earnings over the long term. Our plan is to free up financial capacity to invest in areas that will provide the greatest returns and invest in significant enhancements to the customer experience. In total, we expect to take out $800 million in cost and expense through fiscal 2015, with $250 million of the savings expected to be realized in fiscal 2013.","These planned reductions primarily fall into 3 areas: retail stores, corporate and support structure, and cost of goods sold. More specifically, we expect to achieve these cost savings as follows. Under retail stores, the largest component is the closure of 50 U.S. Best Buy big box stores this fiscal year that didn't meet our investment criteria. Also included in this category is savings associated with the new store operating model. The cost savings in corporate and support structure will come from IT services, non-merchandise purchases, reduction of positions in our corporate and support areas, and a reduction in outside consultant services. Savings in cost of goods sold will be driven by reduction of product transition costs, lower product return and exchange expenses, and other various supply chain efficiencies. Savings from these cost reductions will be primarily targeted to fund enhancements to our customer experience and drive improved returns, and I'll provide more on the improved customer experience in a few minutes.","The second strategic imperative is U.S. store format improvements in the context of our multichannel strategy. As we continue to focus on making it easier for customers to shop with us anywhere, anytime and any way they want, we are evolving our retail store strategy. We're increasing our points of presence while decreasing overall square footage and increasing profit per square foot. The changes we're making to our store portfolio are not only intended to decrease costs, but they also increase our flexibility. This strategy complements our fast-growing online channel by making Best Buy more accessible across multiple channels.","I'm very excited about the first stage of this work. We intend to totally transform and completely reset 2 full markets to demonstrate how our combined big box and small box presence enables us to provide a better customer experience, accelerate profitable areas like connections and services, increase customer touch points and improve profitability and returns.","On the big box side of the equation, we are rolling out at-scale market tests of our new Connected Stores in the most compelling value propositions in the Twin Cities and San Antonio. The Twin Cities will be fully deployed by this fall, with San Antonio completed before the holiday season.","We haven't talked much about the new Connected Store model, so allow me to provide you with a brief overview. Connected Stores are remodeled big box stores that focus on connections, services and an enhanced multichannel experience. This is a total transformation of a big box store, including physical changes and a new store operating model, all designed to provide the customer a dramatically improved experience as he or she shops for technology and the connections, content and services that make it work for them.","Some unique parts of the store. The stores are focused on driving key growth enablers of connections, services and our multichannel capabilities, like introducing great service products like Buy Back and Tech Support, or sending new tablet owners walking out with a wireless plan. We'll now have one larger combined team in computing and mobile phones and tablets that's on a singular mission to grow market share in hardware; accessories; services; and in particular, profitable connections. A new central knowledge desk in the center of the store, which will provide a central place to assist customers with services and connections and offer training and classes. The stores will also have expanded Geek Squad services anchored at the front of the store for improved customer service and employee experience.","The stores will transform the traditional front-of-store checkout to a dedicated multichannel experience, including enhanced in-store pickup. And we're going to accelerate the opening of more Pacific Kitchen and Bath and Magnolia Design Centers inside our bigger Best Buy stores. These premium value propositions have proven results, with Pacific Sales' store-within-a-store delivering more than double the comp growth of a Best Buy appliance department. And current stores with the Magnolia Design Center store-within-a-store are achieving double the comp growth over previous Magnolia Home Theater areas.","As part of the tests in the Twin Cities and San Antonio, we plan to decrease the big box square footage in aggregate across the 2 markets by almost 20% from store closures and downsizing of stores; and increase our customer touch points or doors by over 20%, driven by the continued build out of more Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in these markets. We'll also be introducing a new labor model, which I'll talk about later. And in these markets, we'll build out, as previously mentioned, 11 Pacific Sales Kitchen and Bath and 4 Magnolia Design Centers in select big box stores.","This test in the Twin Cities and San Antonio is based on several early versions of the Connected Store pilots we did in the Las Vegas markets and several others over the last year. The Las Vegas test stores generated a significant sales and gross margin lift compared to other stores located in a similar geography, and these results were achieved with less square footage in the Vegas stores. These at-scale market tests in the Twin Cities and San Antonio will provide important data to inform the further evolution of our retail strategy and footprint, providing us an opportunity to reintroduce a new Best Buy experience to new and returning customers, and helping us determine the pace and magnitude of future actions and other store-based adjustments in the coming years.","Of course, as a critical component to our evolving retail model, we will continue to open the profitable Best Buy Mobile small-format stores throughout the U.S., with plans to open 100 new locations this fiscal year. Our stand-alone mobile stores perform very well with customers and are on the path to generate strong financial returns. These locations have the highest customer satisfaction scores among Best Buy store formats, and we are happy with the financial results and see long-term value to the enterprise from our small box strategy. At full scale, we expect these stores will deliver an IRR of over 20%.","Our third strategic imperative is growth initiatives. We will continue to invest to prioritize the opportunities in existing businesses through 4 key growth initiatives: e-commerce, connections, services and China. These initiatives are expected to be both revenue and margin accretive to our model.","We've made good improvement in our e-commerce offering for customers, combining an improved online shopping experience with the multichannel benefits of in-store pickup. We expect our U.S. e-commerce revenue to grow 15% in fiscal 2013, almost twice the estimated growth of the overall market.","Our growth in this channel is being driven largely by improvements we have put in place, including competitive online pricing; broader use of free shipping, which has proven to be a powerful value proposition; the doubling of our online SKU count; and the addition of the Best Buy Marketplace, which significantly expanded our range of assortment, price points and brands.","Going forward, Stephen Gillett, our new EVP and President of Best Buy Digital, will play an important role in taking our e-commerce strategies to the next level. Stephen is tasked with accelerating our global digital strategy, entertainment offerings, multichannel capabilities and business development. He most recently helped lead Starbucks to a place at the forefront of digital retailing, and I'm very excited by what he'll do, not only to revitalize our digital relevance, but to use innovative digital thinking to create a genuinely seamless experience for our customers across channels, virtual and physical.","There continues to be a tremendous opportunity for Best Buy to solve connectivity issues for our customers, a real pain point for many people. Our sales of connections in the U.S. are targeted to grow 15% in fiscal 2013. The continued growth from Best Buy Mobile will be an important driver of this performance, of course, and the other critical piece of the equation is our ability to bring the mobile connections expertise to other parts of our business, including tablets and computing, to drive increased attachments of connections, accessories and services.","It's early in the expansion of the mobile model to tablets, but we already see a few encouraging data points of the mobile model at work. One quick example, based on the successful launch of the new iPad: compared to our launch of the iPad 2, the recent launch of the new iPad saw a 60% higher attach rate on Geek Squad Black Tie service and a significant improvement in the activation rates of broadband connections, which come with bounties, therefore generating a potentially more profitable transaction.","Our services offering continues to be one of our biggest differentiators and one which provides us a lot of incremental opportunity. Our Domestic services revenue is expected to grow 10% in fiscal 2013, driven primarily through 3 initiatives: the continued performance of our leading Black Tie warranty program across fast-growing categories such as mobile phones and tablets; the expansion of in-store service offerings like our popular Geek Squad Tech Support program launched early last year, which offers customers both in-store and remote support; and the new and very promising small and medium business opportunity via the combination of our existing business and the new capability and product offerings available from our expanded business products and the mindSHIFT acquisition last year.","Moving on to China. One important tenet of our China strategy is the expansion of our profitable Five Star stores. At full scale, we expect the Five Star stores will deliver an IRR of approximately 25%. We previously stated that we expected to do $4 billion in sales and reach 400 to 500 stores by fiscal 2016, and we are on track to accomplish that objective.","Another tenet of our strategy is mobile. I'm pleased to announce that we are implementing a mobile store-within-a-store concept inside Five Star stores this summer. We expect to have 6 up and running by July and another 8 to launch in August. These stores will be our first in China under our new Global Connect strategic alliance with Carphone Warehouse. You will recall that we announced a Global Connect venture late last fall. Its purpose is to bring the combined expertise and success CPW and Best Buy have had in mobile phones and connectivity to additional retail partners around the world. Based on what we've learned together in the United States and the global experience of our team in China, I'm confident we can bring a higher-value experience to consumers in China. Beyond China, we have also been very pleased with the response from a broader set of potential partners around the globe.","Our fourth strategic imperative is improved customer experience. While we have always taken pride in providing a great customer experience, we know we need to strengthen these experiences through our employees across any and all of our channels, regardless of how and where customers interact with us. We can't just claim to offer great service. We need to earn that right every day with every customer to ensure it is our #1 competitive advantage.","It's my intention that today's announcement represents just the first installment of several planned enhancements to our customer experience, and we will have more to talk about in the months and quarters ahead. But I want to highlight a few things we're doing right now:","We recently introduced the Perfect Match Promise for all items purchased at Best Buy. Perfect Match Promise is designed to help customers find the technology match that meets their unique needs, backed by a simple yet powerful value proposition we call \"30-30-30.\" 30 days of free phone support to get products up and running, 30 days of easy returns with no restocking fees and 30 days of competitor price matching.","Our popular Reward Zone loyalty program is about to get even better for more than 40 million members. Beginning in April, we'll be making improvements that make it easier for our members to redeem their points, both online and in-store. And in addition, over the next several months, we'll be enhancing the top-tier of our already industry-leading Reward Zone program, Premier Silver. These important customers account for a significant percentage of our profits. And to further recognize their loyalty, we'll be improving their free shipping benefit to include free expedited shipping for any order from BestBuy.com, a benefit comparable to Amazon Prime.","In addition to free shipping, we are offering free delivery where we will deliver, unpack and connect basic appliances to existing utility service; launching our Premier access perk where our top customers get premier access to new technology, popular products and iconic sales events, like on Black Friday, giving them a free house call from our Geek Squad where our expert agents will solve their most common technology headaches; improving their no-hassle return and price match policy to 60 days; all the while continuing their 25% point bonus and extra point flexibility.","At Best Buy, a positive customer experience and a positive employee experience are inextricably linked. We know we cannot deliver one without the other. And as part of our actions to significantly improve our customer experience, we will be making important changes later this year to our store operating model that are designed to drive a differentiated employee experience. Our intent is to ensure Best Buy stores are a great place for our employees to work, a place where they are inspired and rewarded, which in turn creates a positive impact on the customer experience and business performance. As part of this change, we will be implementing enhanced training, recognition and reward programs that reinforce the behaviors that deliver great customer experiences.","Key elements of the new model include increased training. We are planning a 40% increase in employee training to ensure employees have the skills and knowledge to deliver a differentiated experience, matching customers with the right technology for their needs from our industry-leading assortment of brands, platforms, plans and services. As part of this increased training investment, we will be implementing a program this summer in which all new hires receive a significant increase in training within their first 30 days of employment.","The second key element is an enhanced compensation model. This model, rolling out this summer, will provide financial incentives for delivering on customer service and business goals. The model and the incentives will vary based on the teams and individual roles within the store, but the intent is very simple: all store employees are eligible to participate in a plan. The whole store works together to create great customer experiences and meet business goals, and all employees share in a successful outcome.","We know changes like this work because we've deployed similar programs in parts of our stores already. For example, in Best Buy Mobile, the increased training, recognition and performance-based rewards have had a material positive impact on the customer experience, comps and profits, with all 3 of those critical metrics routinely performing well above our aggregate store performance.","One additional element of the model I want to highlight today is a streamlined communication process between corporate business teams, field leadership and the stores. The changes we are making over the next few months will increase the speed and clarity of information sent from corporate to the stores, as well as the store team's ability to offer feedback on what's working and what's not. The result will be a more nimble organization that can respond faster to challenges and opportunities within the business.","I'm going to turn it back to Jim in a moment to provide you with a look at our fiscal year 2013 guidance, but I've just given you a lot of information about our transformation strategy and actions, so let me sum it up briefly. We are revising our portfolio of store formats and footprints to improve the customer experience across all channels and to improve store performance and productivity, closing some big box stores, modifying others to our Connected Store format and adding more Best Buy Mobile locations. We intend to reinvest some of the expected $800 million in cost savings back into the marketplace by offering improved customer experiences and even more competitive prices. Over time, we expect a portion of the savings will fall to the bottom line in the form of increased operating profit. And at the same time, we are accelerating our key growth initiatives: connections, services, e-commerce and our business in China.","Looking specifically at the year ahead in our guidance, while I'm excited about the strategy we have for the future and the specific actions we have put in place to improve the business, I feel it's important to be pragmatic in the near-term outlook and take into account the realities we face today: first and importantly, as you have seen, sales in the traditional CE industry, from which we still currently derive the largest portion of our sales, are expected to be down again in fiscal 2013; second, we continue to face an uncertain consumer environment; and third, the significant changes we've introduced will take time for the benefits to flow through and reach their full scale of contribution. This is how I see the environment today, but we will benefit when market and macroeconomic conditions improve. And we are well positioned to grow earnings and improve ROIC more meaningfully over time, during our continued transformation in fiscal 2013 and more fully in the years ahead.","Now back to Jim.","James L. Muehlbauer","Thanks, Brian. With that context on the key transformational actions we announced today, let's discuss how these items impact our fiscal 2013 expectations. Our guidance for this year reflects the significant actions we have taken and the realistic view of the current environment that Brian just shared.","Before I begin, a quick reminder that, for ease of comparison, FY '13 guidance is for the full 12-month period of January 29, 2012, through February 2, 2013, under our new fiscal year. Also, year-over-year growth figures in the FY '13 guidance, except where noted, are in comparison to our adjusted and recast continuing operations results of FY '12, which is what will serve as the prior year baseline for comparison throughout fiscal 2013. Since I know you'll be building new models given our fiscal year change and the introduction of discontinued operations, we have provided 2 years of quarterly results that are recast for our new fiscal calendar on our Investor Relations website.","We expect full year company revenue in the range of $50 billion to $51 billion, which will again include a 53rd week. Given the expected decline in total CE industry sales, comparable store sales are expected to decline between 2% and 4%, which assumes we maintain our overall share and grow share in focus areas.","As Brian discussed, we expect strong Domestic segment comparable store sales growth from our online channel and from tablets, mobile phones, eReaders, appliances and services. Our view also includes expected industry declines to continue in televisions, digital imaging, notebook computing products and entertainment. We are also planning for positive International comparable store sales in Five Star and modest declines in Europe and Canada.","Full year operating income dollars, once again on a continuing operations basis, are expected to be down 4% to 11%. When you look at our year-over-year performance inclusive of the businesses we've exited, our operating income expectation improves to a decline of 4% to growth of 4%. Within our operating income expectation, overall gross profit rate is assumed to be approximately flat. Positive drivers include growth in connections and services and cost reduction initiatives, while the primary offsetting variables include investments to support price competitiveness and customer loyalty, as well as increased mix of online channel sales.","As outlined in our multiyear cost reductions of $800 million, $250 million is expected in FY '13, and the majority of this resides within SG&A. The primary cost reductions in FY '13 are driven by store closures; less overhead in corporate and support areas; and other cost reductions related to procurement, store operating model and advertising costs. Primary areas of SG&A increase in FY '13 include the addition of 100 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone, 50 Five Star and approximately 50 Connected Store locations; investments in driving services, including last year's acquisition of mindSHIFT; connections and e-commerce.","When combining the cost reductions with these areas of SG&A investment, our SG&A spending is actually down about 1% and down 5% when looking at the year-over-year spending, inclusive of the businesses we've exited. However, we also have 2 other items which increase our total SG&A spending for the year: more normalized incentive compensation levels and a 53rd week against a recast FY '12 of 52 weeks. Including these items, our total SG&A is expected to grow approximately 3%. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 36%.","Moving on to earnings per share, we expect fully diluted earnings per share of $3.50 to $3.80, excluding FY '13 restructuring costs related to the actions we announced today. This represents fully diluted adjusted EPS growth of 3% to 12%, compared to a recast FY '12 adjusted total EPS under our new fiscal calendar of $3.39.","Free cash flow is expected to be in excess of $1.5 billion. Our capital allocation mindset hasn't changed, and we currently expect approximately $750 million to $1 billion of share buybacks during fiscal 2013. Our EPS range assumes the low end of this estimate.","From a capital spending standpoint, we expect approximately $800 million in capital expenditures this year, focused on the initiatives outlined today, including online, Best Buy Mobile SASes, Five Star, Connected Stores and services, as well as core IT projects and maintenance.","While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I realize the shift in our fiscal year requires many of you to update your models to reflect our recast quarterly results and to develop your FY '13 estimates. Given this, let me provide you some quick context on the expected progression of adjusted results:","From an EPS perspective, we currently expect the weighting of the quarterly adjusted EPS, as a percent of the full year, will not be materially dissimilar to the recast and adjusted FY '12 quarterly EPS results available on our Investor Relations website, within Tab B of the file titled Recast Financials for Fiscal 2011 and 2012.","When looking at operating income from continuing operations, where our range for the year is down 4% to 11%, we expect the decline to be larger earlier in the year, especially in Q1, driven by lower sales comps and softer year-over-year gross profit rate performance than is expected for the year as a whole.","Finally, we expect to incur pretax restructuring charges related to store closures, severance, asset impairments and other costs in fiscal 2013, resulting from the transformation actions outlined this morning in the preliminary range of $300 million to $350 million. While a large majority of these charges will be in cash, many payments associated with exiting leases will likely be made over multiple years. Including these charges, we expect fully diluted earnings per share of $2.85 to $3.25 on a GAAP basis. Our guidance of $3.50 to $3.80 is for adjusted results that exclude these restructuring charges.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Brian.","Brian J. Dunn","In summary, I'm pleased with many of the actions we've taken over the last few years that will bring improved financial benefits and an improved customer experience. But I believe we need to move even faster to adapt to the realities of the market, and the actions we're announcing today move us boldly in that direction. I'm confident that the transformation we are making will take our customer experience to new heights, grow earnings and ROIC, and deliver excellent value for shareholders.","Thank you. And now, I'll turn it over to the operator for the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","The 50 store closures, could you help us out as to where they are or what made the decision, how you picked the 50? And then I have a follow-up on that front.","Brian J. Dunn","It's Brian. I'll tell you what; we're not going to specifically tell you where the 50 are. We're going to talk to our employees first about that. I can tell you that, as I mentioned in the call, they are stores that did not meet the hurdle rate we saw for continuing operations. And further, there will be stores, as I mentioned in the call, in those test markets, Minneapolis and San Antonio, that will be reconfigured, and there will be store closings in those 2 markets.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And secondly, on this -- the EBIT dollar growth down 4% to 11%, Jim, there are a lot of moving parts. Could you just help -- take us to the number that, that's actually off of? And just to be clear, the savings you're talking about, the $250 million this year is embedded in that down 4% to 11% guidance number.","James L. Muehlbauer","Yes. Sure, Greg, I'd be happy to talk about both of those. So what you were quoting is the operating income guidance from continuing operations of down 4% to 11%. With the number of activities that we did this year and certainly the fiscal year change, one of the things that shareholders and the sell side will see next year is that when we report actual results, our results are going to be broken into 2 pieces: continuing operations and then discontinued operations. Clearly, we're going to receive a large benefit in discontinued operations from the store closures and model changes we made this year that aren't going to show up in that continuing operations line. So one of the things that we purposely tried to do in the call today is when you compare on an apples-to-apples basis the total results of the business, we're actually looking at op income dollars, if we weren't reporting discontinued operations, to be more like a range of down 4% to up 4%. But specifically, what you're going to see next year in the continuing ops line is just the results of our continuing operations. That's the down 11% to down 4%. So specifically, within that, you can look on our website; you'll see reported information for what we are using that as -- what we used as the anchor for the FY '12 recast, number one. And number two, to your point, Greg, the savings that we have, of the $250 million, are included in the guidance ranges that we've provided. They're actually what's helping us fund a large portion of the investments that we can make in the customer experience activities and actually improving those new store footprints that we're doing in our connected digital stores.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, on the business through the quarter, it seems like it got a lot worse or slower in January or February from your December results. Could you highlight some of the category shifts there, what got weaker and promotions through the quarter?","James L. Muehlbauer","Yes. Greg, really, just a mixed bag. Certainly, I'm not going to dive into the detailed results within individual months, but I think it'd be unfair to characterize all the pieces moving in the same direction over those 2 months. Broadly, versus our expectations and what we saw in the closeout of the year, is the Mobile Phone business got stronger, which was great. We were also very happy to see our mix of sales in the home theater area also improve. So we mixed into more profitable categories. The softening that we saw was predominantly focused on the gaming business, which has been a drag in the industry and certainly within our portfolio all year long.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies & Company.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","It's Dan Binder. Just wondering if you could give us a little bit of color above the EBIT line for next year, in terms of directionally, the type of price investments you think you need to make and what the resulting gross margin outlook is.","James L. Muehlbauer","It's Jim Muehlbauer. So we've made a number of investments in improving our overall price impression during the current year. And we were very happy that -- current year, just to be clear, FY -- I'm referring to FY '12. We were very happy to see the progression in our overall market share gains, especially in the back half of the year, and very pleased to report that total market share for the company went up in the quarter and for the year in total. So those pricing impressions that we have deployed this year in FY '12 really were focused on a number of different areas. They most meaningfully show up obviously in our largest product categories like televisions and computing. As we look at next year, certainly, the growth that we're planning in the online space is an area that we continue to make appropriate investments in to grow that business, to emphasize the benefits of our digital and physical presence. And we're also mindful of where the competitive environment will continue to be for a period of time. So part of it's in our plans and part of it is we've got firepower set aside to read the market as the year goes on, because we're certainly focused on providing value to our best customers and making sure that we get every chance to give them the full experience of what our model can provide. And the first entry point, as it always has been, is you got to have a great price in the marketplace to drive that hardware so we can actually do what we do best: selling connections and services while offering those great products that our vendors provide us.","Brian J. Dunn","Dan, this is Brian. We appreciate the question. I would just add that this notion of us gaining share this last year in fiscal '12, we're very pleased with that. That was our intent. You should expect us -- during this time, when the industry is experiencing a temporal contraction, you should expect us to work diligently to maintain our share in categories where there is less innovation and to grow our shares -- our share in those key core connected categories. We view that as utterly mission-critical to what we're doing. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Citi Research.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wondered if you could help us understand a little bit better the timing of when we are going to see some of these changes. I know there's a clear definition of some of the Connected Stores and when that will change, but for all the other changes that you're making, is it more like FY 2014 where we'll see these changes to the store, where you'll really start to see it impact both comps and margin? And also, could you identify what the CapEx requirement is for the new rollout of the Connected Stores?","Brian J. Dunn","I'll let Jim comment on the CapEx required. You should start -- you will start to see movement this year in fiscal 2013. We're very -- as I mentioned, very enthusiastic about the Connected Store markets -- test markets we're running in Minneapolis and San Antonio. The big question there for us is, what is our customer transfer rate? We're going to be very focused and work very diligently and play offense in helping make it easy for our customers that are used to shopping in location A and moving them to one of these connected digital stores, location B or location C. So we're going to proactively and then actively work to transfer these customers, and that will largely dictate how rapidly we move in these markets and expanding this test. But the customer transfer rate is the big question for us, and we're very, very focused on delivering against that. Jim, you want to comment on CapEx?","James L. Muehlbauer","Yes, I would be happy to. As I mentioned in our overall CapEx guidance for the year, we've set aside money to roll out those new Connected Store tests in certainly Minneapolis or -- sorry, the Twin Cities and San Antonio, as well as a few other select markets. The capital that's going to be required to do that is not an enormous portion of our total $800 million of spending. And really, it's intended to lay out, from a test standpoint, what is it going to take in those stores to deliver the type of experience that we have? So we're not, at this point in time, going to lay out the economics of the investment or the returns, other than to say that we're modeling it off of the work we've done so far in Las Vegas and some other markets, which candidly was nowhere near as comprehensive as what we're planning to do going forward. And to Brian's point, I think the overall excitement that we have in the business is this is the first time we're really able to take entire markets and transform the entire experience and then put marketing support and muscle behind it all at the same time to see how the digital, physical big box and small boxes work together. So the capital investment is going to be modest in that space so far, and we'll be happy to provide more results as we get into that journey and see some of the details of these tests.","Brian J. Dunn","Just as an example, one of the things that we saw in Vegas in a number of the stores, but there's one in particular, a store that's 19 years old in Las Vegas that is essentially performing on a comp basis like it's new again. It went from an old and tired footprint to a place that is vibrant and really demonstrates the sort of best of what we can do in this connected world. And it is comp-ing materially better than the balance of chain, as is the Vegas market, as I mentioned in my remarks. And that really is the core here, bringing to light all the things this technology can do for customers and having it in a place -- in a space where we can showcase that so people can make great decisions about all the choices they have. Thanks for the question, Kate.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of follow-up questions -- or one question, I guess, the way everybody says it and then I ask too, the -- we had a call yesterday talking about some of the changes that the vendors are doing with pricing of televisions. I'd love to get your thoughts on what's happening. And do you think it's going to have any impact and help your margins, first of all?","Brian J. Dunn","Gary, I'm going to ask Mike Vitelli to comment on that, please.","Michael A. Vitelli","As a matter of practice, we're not going to comment on our vendors' policies or distribution practices. But with that said, we think that our combination of stores, employees, the ability to demonstrate products in the store, on our websites, we believe that there's no better retailer positioned than Best Buy to help explain and show customers the benefits of the technology and features that our vendors invest in and are seeking to get a return on. So we believe we're best positioned to do that and to sell advanced products and advanced features to consumers.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, I'll take that as a yes. Just a follow-up, I think one of the -- the stock obviously is not performing as well as some people may have hoped for today. And one of the things that we're seeing with companies that are generating a lot of cash flow is beyond the buyback, which you're doing pretty nicely, raising dividends and paying out and kind of accepting a certain percent return to investors for dividend policy. What have been your thoughts about the dividend?","James L. Muehlbauer","It's Jim. I'm happy to take that. Certainly, as Brian and I have both talked about over the last few years, the position that our business is in, given its size and scale and its cash-generative capabilities, has allowed us the capacity to not only invest in the business, but also to enhance shareholder returns. And what we have purposely been doing in the marketplace over the last few years is getting more aggressive in repurchasing shares based on what we know we can do with the business and based to how our company is currently valued. We certainly understand the perspective that shareholders have -- certain shareholders have around the role that dividends play. It's an important part of our story as well. Quite candidly, at this point in time, as we make the choices around how to deploy our cash, what we're always most interested in is investing money to grow our core businesses and to make them more profitable for the long term. And that's where you're always going to see our capital allocation strategy take hold first. So as we look at this year and beyond, what we're most conscious of is looking at our cash balances and making sure that we have the money available to invest in the transformation that Brian outlined, and that we're really looking to the success that we're planning for the markets in Minneapolis and San Antonio to be indicative of how our investment profile should move moving forward and what pace we should make that investment. So first and foremost, we're here to drive the core business in profitable areas that we know will enhance shareholder value. That's our first function. And we want to make sure that we have enough capacity to let that play out, because that is the transformation story within Best Buy. We also continue to review options around share repurchases and dividends, and we have proactive conversations with all of our internal and external constituents on that point. And we're not in a specific position today to talk about any further details other than what we laid out in the release and script this morning.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Schick with Stifel, Nicolaus.","David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Back to -- you've got some discussion of that Vegas test, and you mentioned sales and gross margin lift. I just wanted to get a little more specific, I guess, as a road map here. Is there an operating margin lift as well? And anything you could give about magnitude of said lift.","Brian J. Dunn","So the question is about the magnitude of the lift and what we're seeing in operating margins, and we're just not going to break that down further. What we can -- what I can tell you is what we have seen is giving us a great deal of confidence and great enthusiasm for what these connected digital stores can do. And this is not just a brick strategy. This is about all the channels coming together around the customer and having a real physical manifestation of that in our connected digital stores. And in the upcoming quarters, as we open the markets and roll the markets out, we'll be reporting with some regularity about what we're learning and what we're seeing. But again, the key thing for us there is going to be not only those metrics you just identified, but that very important customer transfer rate where we're going to spend a great deal of time and energy focusing. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alan Rifkin with Barclays Capital.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Of the $800 million in cost reductions that you've targeted for the next few years, it certainly looks like, more so in 2012, the benefit is coming from the store closures. If the Twin Cities and San Antonio tests perform as you hope and expect, would that not imply more store closures further down the road?","Brian J. Dunn","Yes. Thanks for the question, Alan. Let me say this: I am -- we are very enthusiastic about the future and the notion of what Best Buy can do to make technology work for each and every one of our customers and transforming this business as the CE industry continues to evolve. And I think it's really important that the listeners on the call understand we believe these flat innovation cycles are temporal and not permanent. The television business is going to be an important environment -- business in the years ahead, for example. But as part of this strategy, when we learn more about this transfer rate and where -- what we're able to do in terms of migrating customers from store A to store B, to online, on the phone, any one of our channels, that will inform our future trajectory on square footage. I mentioned on the call this morning that we anticipate a 20% reduction in Minneapolis and San Antonio. We think that's a really excellent testing point for us. And we are very confident that as we put our energy behind a customer-transfer strategy, that we'll be in a position to be really well informed about what the future square footage looks like for Best Buy.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So, Brian, so if the tests work, would it be reasonable for us to assume that a potential 20% square-footage reduction in other markets may be possible? And then as a follow-up, how do you think about the group of stores that are cash flow positive today, yet are not yielding their cost of capital? Could you maybe just elaborate a little bit on how you're thinking about the future of those group of stores, however many they may be?","Brian J. Dunn","Alan, I appreciate the question. I just want to be clear here. In terms of -- I know it's of great interest, the number of locations. It's just too early to say what the exact right number is, and we're going to learn a lot more this year from the markets. I do want you to understand I'm not wed to a specific number of stores or square footage. What I am wed to is further developing our multichannel strategy, which is shop anywhere -- anytime, anywhere and providing the best experience with the most choices for our customers. That's how we're thinking about this.","James L. Muehlbauer","Yes. And I think, specifically, Alan, to your question around what might we expect in other markets, certainly, from a hypothesis standpoint, our density is different in different markets. So depending upon how this test plays out, we may have markets that are well below the 20%. We may have markets that are above the 20%. To Brian's point, that's what's going to play out in this test. Certainly, our density of stores is much higher in the Twin Cities than it is in San Antonio. That's part of the reason. Purposely, we picked 2 different types of markets to focus on. The other element that you talked about was stores in the portfolio that do not meet our investment returns. We have many, many, many stores that provide well above our investment returns in the portfolio today. As a matter of fact, of the -- even of the stores that we're announcing from a closure standpoint, there are just a handful of them that don't make money on an NOP basis, and even fewer that don't make money from a cash flow basis. So this is all about transforming the experience in those stores. And the connected digital store formats that we're putting out there are all about leveraging the brand, the traffic and the customers that we have in those markets today and giving them a better experience, which we know will build on the great returns those stores have already.","Brian J. Dunn","Alan, just one last thought here. I know there's a great deal of interest in the number of the 50 big box stores we're closing today. I don't want lost in this, that we have announced that we're opening 100 more Best Buy Mobile stores, which is a very important growth vehicle for us. All along, we've been very, very clear about this. Our intention is to leverage our square footage and to have more distribution points for our customers. So while we are reducing square footage some number, this is really about, how do we position the company so we're where our customers need us to be? I don't want that lost on anybody following the story. We're clearly going to have more doors and less square footage. Thanks for the questions, Alan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.","Peter J. Keith - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I had a 2-part question on the cost reductions. I guess I'm just curious on how much control and visibility you have on the $800 million. Certainly, it seems like there's good control on the SG&A items, but the $200 million of cost of goods items, it seems like that might be a little bit difficult to predict over a 3-year time period.","Brian J. Dunn","I'm going to ask Jim to comment on it, Peter, but I want you to know that $800 million that we've talked about this morning in the release and in our prepared remarks, we have a high degree of confidence that we will be able to deliver that number. Very, very high degree of confidence. There may be shifting between buckets, and I'll let Jim comment a little bit on that, but that $800 million, this management team views as a very firm number.","James L. Muehlbauer","And it's really building off of the success that we've had over the last couple of years. Clearly, once again, as you saw in our results for the quarter -- our Q4 and for the year, we continue to bring the SG&A rate down. Specifically to your question on the cost-of-goods-sold bucket, I'd ask you to think about that in a couple of different pieces. There is a substantial portion of that, that's really related to how we continue to make improvements to our management of return and exchanges and end-of-life transitions, working in partnership with our vendors and our stores, and things that we can do in our overall model, that we can actually control a lot of our own destiny in that space. So when you see cost of goods sold, don't queue into that different negotiation strategies with vendors on core product costs. These are waste we and our vendors see in the system, around product that is being purchased by customers for good reasons and being brought back, that we think we can do a good job working in concert with our vendor partners and really solve a bigger problem in the industry and being more efficient while serving our overall mission, which is giving customers a better experience, which really means making sure what they buy from us works and they continue to be happy with it. So a large port of that -- a large part of that is controllable in our system. It's not subject to negotiation.","Peter J. Keith - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. Just a follow-up question I had then. On the store closures, one thing that was not mentioned today was your effort to reduce square footage in existing stores by 10% over 3 to 5 years. Is that still an initiative? If it is, could you give us an update on how that's proceeding? And is that at all factored into the $300 million of savings in retail stores?","James L. Muehlbauer","Yes. To the point Brian had made earlier, we have been talking about expanding our points of presence and reducing overall square footage for some point of time. When we last met with many of you in the April analyst meeting, we laid out the strategy of looking for a minimum of a 10% reduction in our square footage. It was always intended to be accomplished through a combination of downsizings and a smaller portion of store closures while, at the same time, building more points of presence with the small boxes. So not only have we not given up on that strategy, we've been very successful in executing what we said we were going to execute this year. And what you should look at today's comments on is really building on that success and our continued commitment to drive the outcomes and reducing our overall square footage. Back in Q2, I mentioned, I believe, on the call, that we had anticipated that we were going to touch probably -- I think it was like 25 or 30 stores for the year. What we ended up touching, just specifically, was about 43 big box stores during the current year. And on average, across those 43 stores, we reduced square footage by approximately 15%. Now to be clear, those were individual stores. We'll see how that amount moves going forward. But for that tranche, it was 15%. The other thing that exceeded my own expectations this year was for that square footage we took out. We have already been successful in either subletting or giving back over 70% of that to landlords. So we've got that expense for those stores out of our operation. So once again, just small data points on a small subset. But I know there's many questions by shareholders at a time, talking to retailers about the real ability. And will they actually close stores when they say it? Will they actually shrink? We exceeded our expectations that we set out for this year. And certainly, with the plans we've laid out going forward, we're very interested to see where the expansion of our small box footprint and the shrinkage opportunities we have on our overall square footage really will take the business model.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I have a couple of questions today. On the market share front, as I look at the government retail sales data for consumer electronics stores over the 3 months ended February, the number was down about 1%. And if you look at PCE data in nominal terms, in December and January, the 2 months of the quarter that are out, the numbers were up low-single digits. So I guess when you think about market share gains, if you could share with us some of the sourcing and the magnitude perhaps and who you're including in that bucket, because it seems like the revenue did soften up perhaps a bit more than the market, at least from some of the easily available data.","Michael A. Vitelli","This is Mike Vitelli. The data we use is very specific in working with the categories that we track that are not -- everything that we sell. So when we're talking about share, we're talking about the share in categories that we track. We're very specific at the product-category level. Government data oftentimes include stores that sell other things. So we actually believe the triangulation of the data we're looking at. We saw, over that same 3-month period, that everything we've seen is the industry down about 4% in the categories that we track, while we were down less than 2%. And that's where we see our share gains across almost every category that we've looked at.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And, Mike, if you can just amplify on that a bit. As you look out to 2012, any outliers in your revenue forecast in terms of major categories, be it TV or some of the PC categories? Anything that you think might be particularly hopeful or tough for you in 2012?","Michael A. Vitelli","I think, as Jim mentioned, some of our more -- the traditional CE categories like television will be a lot like it was in fiscal year '12, that is, a relatively flat unit scenario with some modest ASP declines. So the revenue of television will be down slightly. Computing is different. It'll kind of be a bifurcated year. The period leading up to Windows 8, the notebook industry will probably be soft. But we have some confidence that Windows 8 is going to change that, particularly on the revenue side more than the unit side, more towards the second half.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then my second question, you're now -- it's almost exactly 2 months past the closing of the repurchase of your stake in Best Buy Mobile, and I know it's probably early to look for results from the work you've been able to do. Any insight you have as you implement some of the mobile strategies across broader pieces of the store, on what that's doing to your ability to upsell, generate service revenue, et cetera?","Brian J. Dunn","Yes, we're actually very pleased, Matt, with what we've seen there to date. I mentioned on the call what we saw with the sale of the new iPad. We were very pleased with the very material improvement and execution around that. And I just want to -- just flip one word on you here. For us, it's not about upselling as much as it is about selling customers the technology they need and all the services that light them up and make them work. But that iPad launch was a very strong indicator of the work this new solutions business group is doing, and we're very pleased with it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Bradley B. Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Wanted to follow-up on the connections overall. The total additions fell a little bit short of your goal for the year. I was hoping you could just talk a little bit more about some of the industry drivers there and why you expect that to accelerate this upcoming year, and then some of the underlying margin drivers as this industry continues to mature.","Brian J. Dunn","I'll let Mike talk about some of the specifics as he sees them, but I think it's companion to the answer I just gave Matt, and it is that capability, and that's why the deal we made with CPW was so important, so we're able to expand that connections business group, that capability to a broader set of our categories. And they're the categories that are growing in our industry right now: phones, tablets, Macs and PCs. So we're actually very pleased with the directionality and what we're going to be able to do with that group.","Michael A. Vitelli","This is Mike again. And when we look back at fiscal year '12, and most of our connections in fiscal year '12 came from the actual connections of smartphones and other phones, those were a little bit less than our expectations in the way some of the iconic phones launched and when they launched within the year. When we look into fiscal year '13, as Brian mentioned earlier, we've combined the team, both here in our headquarters offices and in the field. That is driving the computing business, the tablet business and the cellphone business together. What we're seeing is, in addition to phone -- continued growth in market share and units in the smartphone business, our ability to connect tablets. And we saw that significantly change versus the iPad 2 launch to the new iPad launch. We believe we're going to be able to continue that and press that, both in the tablet business and the computer business throughout fiscal year '13.","Bradley B. Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I know we're going long, but if I could ask one last question on CapEx, the $800 million plan for the year, still relatively low as you look at it as a percentage of sales. But at the higher end of the range, from a historical perspective, is this a level that we should look for, for the next several years? Or is there going to be an opportunity to reduce that level of spend going forward?","James L. Muehlbauer","Yes, I would characterize it, honestly, more in the range of what we did in the last several years. Certainly, it's nowhere near the high-water mark we had a number of years ago, and I'd put it into the camp of fairly consistent with what we did last year. A couple of, I think, important callouts. One is the mix of what we're spending on is dramatically different now versus what it was 3 or 4 years ago. Much less emphasis on new stores, much more emphasis on core existing businesses like services, mobile, things of that nature. And where we really see the opportunities to continue to invest behind our strategy is, clearly, we can spend more and will spend more in the online digital space to continue to improve that experience. The other thing that I would call out is, depending upon how these Connected Store tests work, that will absolutely inform our capital spend profile over the next 3 years. Because when that test is successful, like we do with all things that are successful, we'll want to roll that out into the marketplace. But we're going to do that with proven results and proven returns. So that is a variable that I would see in the CapEx plan. I don't -- I'm not suggesting that our CapEx is going to move up enormously as a result of that, but it will influence our thinking specifically around where we spend CapEx over the next 3 years.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Big picture math on the guidance. So last year, it looks like the adjusted is $3.39. You add $0.30 for exiting Europe, call it $0.15 to $0.20 for buyback and you get $250 million in cost savings. That seems like it's about $0.45. You add that all up, it's about $4.30. Is that the right way to think about it? Or does the $250 million double count some prior restructuring? And if it is, are we basically assuming that the price investments is the primary offset to get back down to the $3.50 to $3.80?","James L. Muehlbauer","Yes. In the road map you walked through, I think if -- I'll take the amounts out of it for a minute. But in general, that's the right way to think about it. Specifically to your question, you're double counting a little bit at the price at the -- I'm sorry, the actions we took last year and the $250 million. If I helicopter up, the way I'd look at it is as follows, is that if you look at the benefits that we're receiving from the businesses that we exited, which is providing tailwind to the EPS growth, certainly, the continued buyback activity that we have planned will provide some tailwind to growth. The cost savings that we've laid out for roughly $250 million are providing some tailwind. We're reinvesting those costs in our biggest-growth businesses: connections, mobile, services and online. And we're using that money also to help fund several of the very important price impressions and customer experience levers that Brian talked about. All at the same time, looking at our Domestic business specifically, is that given the sales comp expectations in some of the traditional categories that Mike Vitelli talked about, we're expecting profitability declines in those spaces. So we're using those cost savings to offset some of the gross margin dollars on the lines we see in that space also. So this is all about positioning the business for profitable, long-term growth. And in the current environment, looking at next year, certainly, with the weight of those big businesses declining, that puts pressure on our overall cost structure. And what we don't want to do -- it would be very simple not to invest in the future and show better returns for next year. That would be a very short story over the next 2 or 3 years. What we're committed to doing is driving where we see value for the long term and investing prudently in proven actions, which is why we're redeploying that SG&A the way we are today. It's purposely why, in the $800 million of cost savings we've laid out, we've said that over time we expect more of that to fall directly to the bottom line. It's all moving to the bottom line right now. We're just reinvesting higher portions of that to get our business in a position to grow even faster when some of those headwind pressures alleviate.","Brian J. Dunn","Into growing businesses like connections, like services, in places where we know we make a difference. We appreciate everybody hanging with us through a long call today.

But rest assured, the work will be shared with Hubert as he transitions into the company.","I, along with the full executive team, will do everything we can do to ensure a smooth transition to provide continuity of leadership and to make sure he has the benefits of the good work done to date so that he hits the ground running.","Let me briefly discuss the performance of the company. As we've been discussing for some time now, the company continues to face significant challenges. As is widely known, markets in China and Europe are facing enormous difficulties and that has had a negative impact on us. In the U.S., economic conditions are soft and will probably remain so for the indefinite future. Consumers remain very cautious, and sales in the industry may be dampened at the moment by those who are holding back on spending as they await some highly anticipated new technology releases.","Like virtually every other competitor in the Consumer Electronics sector, Best Buy's second quarter reflects these realities. However, we have made progress and we are building on it. For instance, even in a weak economy and a challenging environment for retailers, our Domestic U.S. comp sales trends improved 210 basis points from the first quarter, and we also maintained our market share.","Best Buy continued to expand our services offerings, signing partnership deals with Verizon and Target, which underscores the company's move beyond the traditional big box.","We reduced costs. Big box square footage was down 4%, and revenue per square foot was up slightly.","Moreover, we continued to see strong growth in connections and revenue generated online. Each of these are areas where we have provided deliberate focus and actions over the past several months.","All that said, Best Buy clearly remains in turnaround, which will take time to come out of. Given that reality and the fact that we've just welcomed a new CEO to the company, we are suspending Best Buy's share repurchases and earnings guidance for fiscal year 2013. In taking these actions, we are, as you would expect, providing Hubert with the flexibility and the opportunity to make decisions on these and other important matters as he addresses the broader challenges ahead.","I will now turn it over to Jim.","James L. Muehlbauer","Thanks, Mike. As Mike said, our second quarter performance is a reflection of the current product cycle challenges in CE hardware, highlighted by industry weakness across several large categories. Q2 did see an improvement in comparable store sales trends compared to Q1, but this was overshadowed by lower gross profit rates, driven by unfavorable mix of sales within mobile phones and televisions, additional promotional activity in the computing category and weak performance in our International business. I'll cover each of these items in more detail shortly.","From a revenue prospective, consumer demand in several large categories continues to be challenged, but our Domestic market share during the quarter was up a little from the prior year. In fact, according to external sources, our market share for the quarter, year-to-date and trailing 12 months are all at or above levels of the previous year.","The Domestic segment comp sales decline of 1.6% in Q2 represented improvement over the 3.7% decline in Q1. Strong growth from tablets, mobile phones, appliances and eReaders was more than offset by weakness in categories like gaming, digital imaging, televisions and notebooks.","The product categories having the most notable improvement from Q1 to Q2 were stronger growth in mobile phones and smaller declines from notebooks and gaming products. There's speculation by some that a portion of the current industry softness may be from customers holding off purchases until some of the highly anticipated new product launches hit later this year. It remains to be seen how much customers are truly waiting. But what we do know is that we have seen this phenomena play out before, and there are significant product launches expected in the second half that will provide some tailwind to sales.","We continue to make progress on expanding our online sales. During Q2, online sales increased 14%, ahead of the industry, led by traffic growth and a strong increase in conversion rate.","Q2 comparable store sales in the International segment declined approximately 8%, showing modest sequential improvement from Q1, but still did not deliver at the levels planned for the quarter.","The weak results in International clearly continued to weigh on the company's overall sales and operating income performance in the first half. Specifically, comp sales in our Five Star business improved modestly from Q1 when it was down 28%.","We're seeing continued weakness in the China CE market that appears to be consistent across major competitors. This decline is attributable to lower consumer spending as growth in the Chinese economy slows, weakness in the housing market and by the absence of government-sponsored rebate programs for appliances and other products.","In Canada, a high single-digit comp decline was the result of continued industry softness in notebooks, digital imaging and home theater, similar to trends in our business in the U.S. Like the U.S., overall market share in Canada was also about flat.","Our business in Europe posted a low single-digit comp sales decline in Q2, improving from the mid-single-digit decline experienced in Q1. The sequential improvement was driven by increased promotional activity in a competitive environment.","The largest change in the quarter's performance was from the decline in the gross profit rate. We planned Q2 gross margins to be below last year, but the actual decline was more than we anticipated. Given the significant impact in our results, I want to make sure that we spend some time clearly laying out the key drivers.","Let's start with our Domestic segment. First, we saw improvements in sales mix between product categories that favorably impacted year-over-year gross profit rate, driven by strong mobile phone growth and lower notebooks sales in the mix. However, this favorable impact was offset by 3 factors that reduced our rates in the Domestic segment.","First, in mobile phones where we achieved strong comp sales of 35%, we sold a significantly greater mix of higher ASP smartphones as compared to last year, which led to a strong increase in gross profit dollars although at a lower gross profit rate. Second, as Q2 progressed, we saw lower industry unit volumes in notebooks than we anticipated. In response, we added promotional activity to stimulate consumer demand. While these actions improved sales trends, added market share and helped manage our inventory levels, they also reduced rates. We consider these moves necessary as we position ourselves for the second half, which will include the important launch of Windows 8. Finally, in televisions, we saw a mid-single-digit unit growth in the quarter. However, the growth was driven by more consumer demand in small and midsized screens where ASP compression has been most prominent and where margin rates are traditionally lower.","Moving to the International segment. The gross profit rate declined 130 basis points in Q2, predominantly driven by increased mix in the wholesale business and promotional activity to stimulate demand on mobile phones in Europe.","Looking forward into the second half, there are several factors, which indicate that the level of gross profit rate decline experienced in Q2 will improve. These items include lower promotional activity in computing given new product launches, benefits from tech support services beginning to contribute meaningfully to gross profit rate and eased margin compression within mobile phones as the mix of handsets sold becomes very comparable to last year.","We continue to control SG&A, and spending during the second quarter was below our plan. Q2 SG&A decreased 2% as we benefited from previously announced actions to reduce costs through changes in our corporate and field operating models, by adjusting labor to match demand and from store closures. For the year, our cost reduction programs remain on track, and total SG&A spending is now expected to be lower than our original plans.","Looking back at the first half of the year in total, here's what we've seen. Performance weakness from our International segment has led to an operating loss of $83 million in the first half; macroeconomic conditions in Europe and China and lower sales in Canada continue to provide challenging headwinds. Our Domestic business is generally in line with our original first half expectations, and we have successfully maintained Domestic market share. SG&A spending is down versus last year and is below plan. However, we also see potential trends that indicate a more challenging industry and consumer demand environment than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year.","Looking into the second half of the year, there are some positive tailwinds as we sit here today. There are multiple new product releases that we expect to drive increased consumer demand in key categories, and SG&A spending is expected to come in below our original plan.","We also have headwinds to confront. We are not expecting major improvements in our key International businesses. We now expect lower industry revenue than our original expectations in computing, digital cameras and gaming and less favorable sales mix in key hardware categories. We see indicators suggesting improved Domestic gross margins in the second half as outlined earlier, but still expect gross margins to be down for the full year.","Moving to our full year outlook. As you know, we have a vast majority of our annual earnings still in front of us. And as I've just covered, there's a lot of variability as the second half industry and consumer demand plays out.","However, based on our current outlook, we have lowered our earnings expectations for the full year results. Given these expectations, and in light of the CEO announcement that we made yesterday, we believe that it is appropriate to remove our annual guidance for fiscal 2013. We will, of course, continue to provide qualitative forward-looking commentary on the business. For example, we do expect our free cash flow for fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion.","I've covered a lot today, and we're happy to provide more color during the Q&A.","For now, I'll turn the call back to Mike.","George L. Mikan","Thanks, Jim. Let me offer just one final reflection. Having spent the last 4 months operating on the inside of this great company, I've had the opportunity to learn about the business in detail. I've talked to customers, I've met with store employees, gained a deeper understanding of the distinctive assets and the power of the brand and the partnerships we have with vendors. Based on these experiences, I'm more optimistic than ever about Best Buy's future and I look forward to continuing that journey as I return to the board as Chairman of the Audit Committee.","Thank you, everyone. And now we'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alan Rifkin with Barclays.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess if I'm permitted just one question, it's kind of a philosophical one. So if your Domestic business essentially came in line with your expectations and Europe on a sequential basis actually improved, I guess I'm trying to understand why are you suspending your official earnings guidance as well as the share buyback program? Is it a function of greater uncertainty in the marketplace or the -- is the potential exists that Mr. Joly will have a different strategic plan for the second half, which may impact your earnings and your buyback activity?","James L. Muehlbauer","Alan, it's Jim Muehlbauer. Two things. First off is we talk about the Domestic business being in line with our first half expectations. As we discussed, we were over our planned expectations in Q1 in our Domestic business. The business started to soften from an industry standpoint in Q2. When I put the 2 quarters together, we're basically in line. Looking forward, as we talked about on the call, we certainly have a lot of variability in how the year is going to play out from a consumer demand standpoint, especially with the key product launches we see in the back half of the year. Candidly, the visibility to the magnitude of the impact of those launches is very variable at this point in time, especially given the concentration of sales we have over the holiday season. That, coupled with giving Hubert some time to come in and understand the business and assess where he wants to take the organization long term, we believe that the best thing to do in light of those 2 circumstances is to give him the flexibility, which basically resulted in us deciding to take guidance away for the balance of the year, really to give him a chance to digest what's happening in the business model.","Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So can we expect to hear on your third quarter call, if not before, a detailed strategic plan from Mr. Joly as to where he wants to take your business going forward?","George L. Mikan","Alan, it's Mike. I don't want to get ahead of Hubert and his digestion of all the work that we've been doing and the impact that he will choose to take. But I can assure you that Hubert is a decision maker, he's action-oriented and he will come to the marketplace as appropriate, so he'll hit the ground running and take on all the great work that has been done over the last several months.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Eric Hiller - RBS Research","I want to focus on the margin trends, Jim, versus your plan. You said SG&A, in particular, came in a little better than expected, getting some costs out faster. Could you relay what those costs were and if we think this rate that you've done, the down 2%, can be maintained?","James L. Muehlbauer","Yes, Greg. As you know, from the beginning of the year, we put plans in place to dramatically lower our cost structure. We made several of those moves starting at the end of last year into Q1 around some of the organizational changes we made in our operations -- our operating model, both in our corporate offices and our field locations. We've also been trimming back expenses in a variety of areas of the business so that we can make sure that we fund the important investments around the growing and profitable parts of the portfolio, especially in our Best Buy Mobile business and our Service business. So the good news is, is that we continue to invest in those businesses. And as you saw from the results in the second quarter, we continue to see strong growth in our Services business and in our phone business and we're investing SG&A behind that. We continue to expect to take costs out as we go throughout the year. Our plans for the year are actually more bullish on the amount of costs that we can take out and we\u2019ve kind of reflected that in our forward-looking view was well. Candidly, we've got a lot of work to do over the long term in taking costs and rightsizing the business to the opportunities you see going forward. So we still certainly believe that what we're doing in FY '13 is just a good start on those fronts. There's more opportunities to take costs out for the long term.","George L. Mikan","And Greg, it's Mike. I will also suggest that as we go forward, reflecting the actions that we -- the aggressive actions we're starting to take with our cost structure in terms of our store portfolio and footprint, we also want to be looking at the store productivity and revenue per square foot and seeing that improve and you started to see that this quarter with an improvement of 1%. It's slightly up, but our intention is to demonstrate that improvement over time.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Schick with Stifel, Nicolaus.","David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Want to talk about the sort of global sales slowdown that you're talking about. Do you think that there's a new -- and some of the product cycle discussion around that, is it a new pattern that's forming in terms of purchases? Is there a longer duration between television purchases? Your insights as to how consumers are looking at purchases of some of the higher-ticket stuff outside of the obvious Windows 8 cycle would be helpful.","Michael A. Vitelli","This is Mike Vitelli. Thank you for the question. What we're seeing is we focused a tremendous amount of our attention in the first half, and in fact, globally on some of the key categories that we've seen tremendous consumer interest, in mobile and connected products. So we've grown our revenue in mobile phones and tablets. We grew our share in both of those categories and in computing. Those are areas that we're seeing strong consumer interest and we wanted to make sure that we're positioning ourselves in that place for the second half of those launches came out. Appliances, as an industry, are relatively stable. We grew our -- we grew both our comps and our share in that category as well. So the place where you're seeing -- we're seeing slowdown has been in some of the more traditional categories like television and that's right where we were in our plan. We expected this year to be -- there to be a decline there. That's playing out to be true. Units are up, ASPs are down and that's something that's playing out literally around the globe in the television category.","David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So Mike, do you think that, that's a change in how often -- historically there was an idea that there was a replacement cycle. Is that replacement cycle changing due to cord cutting or changing due to technology or is there something changing in that?","Michael A. Vitelli","Well, I think it's actually more of -- if you think of that fact that units are actually up year-over-year, consumers are buying as many televisions -- more televisions than they were a year ago, their costs are lower. So in that sense, the interest in television and the interest in entertainment is actually continuing to grow. There are more devices to choose from. We've got tablets, we've got mobile phones that have that capability so there are more products that are there. So there's really no new data that we have that's suggesting that replacement cycles are changing.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I do understand you guys have suspended guidance. I think we all kind of understand that. But given that the look -- the comments you've made regarding the broad sales slowdown as well as the gross margin degradation, is there any reason to believe that the year-over-year trends in operating income will be much different in the second half than what we saw in the second quarter?","George L. Mikan","Yes, we certainly expect that the trends that we saw in the second quarter, based on what we see right now going forward, are not going to extend into the back half of the year in the same way. I do want to highlight, specifically in what we\u2019ve talked about in the sales trends and margin trends in our business, are not things that we see unique to Best Buy. We certainly see them being driven by the same industry mix factors that are happening in the business and basically being driven by what consumers are currently interested in buying in key categories whether it's smartphones, whether it's the activity we see in the tablets and current notebook space. And once again, just given the vast amount of consumer activity in the back half of the year around the holidays, it's difficult to predict around where consumers are actually going to go during that period, especially with all new releases that are coming out. Quite candidly, we just don't want to get out too far in front of us given the uncertainty around demand in the environment and the impact of those releases in general.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I wonder if you guys are going to be willing to address any of the movement around the buyout offer from your former Chairman and CEO. And if so, just wondering the thought process on what occurred over the weekend in terms of the disagreement in some of the language in terms of standstill agreements. And it sounded to me that the board is open to discussing things with Dick Schulze, but couldn't come to an agreement on some of the language around that, is that a correct characterization?","George L. Mikan","Michael, I appreciate the question. We've been -- we've issued a release. The board has issued responses to that and releases. And as of now, the only thing I would add to what's been out there in the public marketplace is our proposal still stands and we feel it's up to Dick to respond from there. But that's all I really have to add at this time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Along those lines, Mike, can you just expand and shed a little light on how the board is thinking about maximizing shareholder value? We're getting snippets of a lot of different things right now and it's hard to dimension what the strategy is.","George L. Mikan","Well, thanks for the question. As we've been talking about for several months now, we're focused on building out a strategic plan that is what we believe to be a better Best Buy for the future. And as I stated earlier, Hubert will come in and take a look at the elements of the things we've been working on and bring those to further action as appropriate, so that's first. Second, getting a permanent CEO in place was a big objective of the board. And as you know, originally, when we discussed the transition to interim and ultimately to permanent, we talked about 6 to 9 months. The board has acted -- in our mind, we've acted swiftly in getting what we think is a great candidate in that role for the future in about a 4-month time period, so a lot of heavy work has been there. But with respect to a long-term value and also just have you look at where we believe we are today, you're seeing some of the improvements that we've been working on with our cost structure, which is important. But we've got a very strong financial position. We remain with a strong balance sheet with significant assets to leverage, strong free cash flow with diversified businesses. And so the board continues to focus on the strategic plan with a permanent CEO to execute against that and we'll do that swiftly as Hubert comes in at his time line.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Strasser with Janney Capital Markets.","David S. Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","So there's a lot, obviously, going on whether it's the offer, it's the new CEO transition, it's tough business environment. What's the mood as you walk around the headquarters, and even more importantly, as you kind of visit stores? I mean, how impaired do you think the mood is around the company and how hard is that going to be to get back or do you feel relatively comfortable there?","George L. Mikan","Obviously, Best Buy has gone through -- has had -- we've had our challenges and the things that are playing out in the public marketplace is a distraction. I can't say that it isn't impacting the, I'll call it, the engagement of employees. That being said, everyone's focused on improving business performance. And there's a great passion and belief in the brand of Best Buy. And so for the most part, we believe that whether it's in the stores or within the corporate campus here, that people are looking to the future and are excited about the prospects and we're going to continue to stay focused at. And I believe that with the announcement of a permanent CEO, that brings additional stability to the organization and people feel good about that. So overall, we feel like we're in a -- in positive territory with respect to employee engagement.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Bill Seymour","Matt, Vitelli wanted to add something on the end of that just real quick.","Michael A. Vitelli","Michael, I just wanted to add you talked about the mood in the field, and I wanted to emphasize because we did talk about what the sales performance has been. We had double-digit comps in cell phones, tablets and eReader and major appliances and our Services grew. We've just put in a new operating model in our stores that's starting right now in our second half where we're incentivizing team-based performance in our mobile department, in our computer and tablet department, in our homes department. We've put training in place that we're now bringing all of our people through. And our teams are excited about that. We've also started to open some of our new stores and our Richfield store is open. Our territory general managers, many of them were in yesterday and actually took a tour there. Some of them have not seen it before, though several had. Some hadn't. It's a very exciting environment. We are so pleased with the early reaction that our employees are having, our customers are having. The comp sales performance, our services growth, all things that we are expecting. It's fairly early. It's been open for a month, but the U.S. operating model that we put in place, the incentives and training we have for our sales people, our supervisors and coaches, our assistant managers focusing on our services, connectivity and home business and these new stores, we're excited as we move into the second half.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess it's my turn now. You made a point of having held market share this quarter, but your gross margin obviously came under some unanticipated pressure. I realize that the answer to this question will probably evolve over the next number of months, but are you running the business these days with share in mind or profit in mind, and how are you prioritizing the 2?","James L. Muehlbauer","Matt, it's Jim. We're running the business with both in mind. We have to be cognizant of what customers are interested in buying in different windows of time and when you look at the margin in any one individual quarter, you could get mixed messages in what the long-term business plan looks like. The reality of our margins in the quarter, we expected them to be down. It was down more than we thought, primarily because we had fewer smartphones available last year. If you remember in Q2 last year, there was -- we were in between launch cycles on smartphones. We're more fully in stock this year. The reality of those higher-priced smartphones, they still come with the same margin value for the connection we get, but the price point is higher, that which drives the margin rate down. So that's just an industry phenomena. Doesn't speak any difference in how we're running the mobile phone business year-over-year. In the computing space, we've seen all first half the year that the notebook industry is just softer than was anticipated heading into the launch of Windows 8 in the back half the year. We'll see if that volume comes back as part of that launch. But in the meantime, what we're doing is we're making sure that we remain competitive and that we drive footsteps into our store and that we have relevant, strong market share in that important category as customers come in again shopping for Windows 8. And the value of the inventory we have in categories like that, we have to stay on top of those levels as well and we did some prudent things during the quarter to manage that. So we don't anticipate those activities going forward given the product cycle we'll see in the back half of the year. And then specifically, also from a market standpoint, in televisions, when consumers mix into lower ASP TVs in the midsized and small-sized TV, that's a market phenomena across-the-board. We just get lower margin rates through those and we have less attach of our services and other products on those items. So really, none of those are changes in strategies from Best Buy's standpoint. We're trying to maximize gross profit dollars based on what consumers want to buy. And we see that mix of sales improving in the back of the year. It's just difficult, once again, given the range of potential outcomes around the various new product launches to see exactly where that's going to go.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.","Peter J. Keith - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Jim, just a follow-on to what you had mentioned with a range of product launches. Clearly, you've been mentioning Windows 8. Could you give as an idea, though, of what some of these product launches are that are coming out and where you have some uncertainty around the timing?","Michael A. Vitelli","This is Mike Vitelli, thanks. There -- what's exciting, there are launches in all the categories that we focused on. There are launches coming out in tablets, there are launches coming out in smartphones, launches in eReaders, there's a gaming launch that's scheduled. So there are launches in a lot of key categories that we focus our attention on, that we have grown with double-digit comps and that we've grown share in. So we're looking forward to that as they come out. And that'll -- a lot will be -- begin to happen in the third quarter when you get into that October period. So October, November are always significant, but they seem to be more significant and concentrated this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Magee with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on the -- on how important you think the UPP pricing structure might be in the second half of the year, and what might drive better large-screen TV demand?","Michael A. Vitelli","This is Mike Vitelli again. So UPP, unilateral pricing policies, the attempt there is, in whatever category it is, is to stabilize the pricing of the products under those categories and what we've seen is that's succeeding. We're seeing manufacturers hold on those -- onto those plans. There's a greater focus in profitability, particularly in our TV vendors, but we're seeing in other categories as well. So manufacturers trying to bring value for their products and our sales team that's well-trained to be able to present those values to consumers, we think, is a good combination.","David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Do you see anything that would improve the large-screen TV demand?","Michael A. Vitelli","Large TV demand is going to based on the prices that are put in the marketplace and what they're competing against. So UPP is not looking to create demand, but to stabilize value and -- but we think that balance between demand creation and profitability will be a better one for the industry overall in the second half.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect."]}}
