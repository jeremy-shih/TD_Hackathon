At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to your host, Kris King. Please go ahead.","Kris King - Vice President-Global Investor Relations","Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Mylan's conference call to discuss our third quarter 2015 earnings and our offer to acquire Perrigo Company. Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Executive Chairman, Robert Coury; Chief Executive, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; and Executive Vice President and CFO, John Sheehan.","During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements may include, without limitation, statements about the proposed acquisition of Perrigo by Mylan, which I will refer to as the Perrigo proposal, Mylan's acquisition, which I will refer to as the EPD transaction of Mylan Inc. and Abbott Laboratories' non-U.S. developed end markets specialty and branded generics business, which I will refer to as the business, the benefits and synergies of the Perrigo proposal, or EPD transaction, future opportunities for Mylan, Perrigo or the combined company and products and any other statements regarding Mylan, Perrigo, or the combined company's future operations, anticipated business levels, future earnings, planned activities, anticipated growth, market opportunities, strategies, competition, Mylan having sufficient supply of EpiPen Auto-Injector to meet anticipated demand due to Sanofi's voluntary recall and other expectations and targets for future periods.","Because forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties, actual future results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, uncertainties related to the Perrigo proposal and the consummation thereof, the ability to meet expectations regarding the accounting and tax treatments of the EPD transaction and the Perrigo proposal, changes in relevant tax and other laws, the integration of Perrigo and EPD business being more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected, operating costs, customer loss and business disruption being greater than expected following the Perrigo proposal and the EPD transaction, the impact of competition situations where we manufacture, market and\/or sell products, notwithstanding unresolved allegations of patent infringement, any regulatory, legal or other impediments to our ability to bring new products to market, any changes in our differences with our inventory of or ability to manufacture and distribute the EpiPen Auto-Injector and those set forth under the forward-looking statements in today's earnings release and the risk factors set forth in Mylan N.V.'s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015, as well as our other filings with the SEC.","These risks, as well as other risks associated with Mylan, Perrigo and the combined company, are also more fully discussed in the Registration Statement on Form S-4 which includes an offer to exchange\/prospectus and was declared effective on September 10, 2015 in connection with the Perrigo proposal. The offer to exchange\/prospectus filed with Mylan with the SEC on Schedule TO on September 14, 2015 constitutes the offer document for purposes of the Irish Takeover Rules.","Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update any statements made today, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Today's call should be listened to and considered in its entirety and understood to speak only as of today's date.","In addition, we will be referring to actual and certain projected financial metrics of Mylan and Perrigo on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are presented in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance. Please refer to today's earnings release and the presentation used during today's call, both of which are available on our website, as they contain detailed reconciliations, where possible, of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.","I would also like to point out that Mylan's offer for Perrigo is governed by the Irish Takeover Rules. Under the Irish Takeover Rules, Mylan management is prohibited from discussing any material, new information or significant new opinion which has not been publicly announced. Any person interested in shares of Mylan or Perrigo is encouraged to consult his or her professional advisors.","Before I turn the call over to Robert, let me also remind you that the material in the call, with the exception of the participant questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's expressed written permission.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Robert.","Robert J. Coury - Executive Chairman","Thank you, Kris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would like to welcome our employees around the world to the call and thank them for their unwavering dedication, hard work and focus, which is what makes our consistently strong results possible. I would also like to welcome any Perrigo and Omega employees listening in today. We certainly look forward to welcoming all of you to the Mylan family soon, as we have never been more confident in completing what we believe will be a very successful tender offer. In addition, I would like to say a special hello to the Perrigo employees in Israel today. We are very excited to have now received approval to dual-list on the Tel Aviv Exchange and to finally have the opportunity to acquaint ourselves more closely with Israel, Israeli investors and Perrigo Israeli employees.","Before I turn the call over to Heather, Rajiv and John, who have a lot to cover today, I would like to make a couple of points regarding our offer for Perrigo and to clear out some of the possible misinformation. First, the notion conveyed by Perrigo that the Mylan offer is a bad deal for Perrigo shareholders is simply preposterous and disingenuous. We will show once again today with math using Perrigo's own updated numbers that this is a substantial and compelling offer to Perrigo's shareholders.","Let me also simply highlight that Perrigo themselves have left their own shareholders no other options except to rely on non-strategic measures, such as cost cuts as well as the hope that they will trade at a very high PE multiple at a time when multiples have been completely reset throughout the industry, in order to generate their stand-alone long-term shareholder value. This strategy is flawed and simply will not produce sustainable growth over the longer term and in sharp contrast to Mylan's well-established long-term strategy and exceptional operational performance that you will hear more about today.","With that said, as you will see later, it really doesn't matter which unrealistic multiple Perrigo wants to apply to itself because the immediate and significant earnings accretion to be realized by the Perrigo shareholders, which is potentially in excess of 80%, speaks for itself. If Perrigo is correct, and the math doesn't lie, then you will see that the math will speak loudly in favor Mylan's offer.","Here is just one clear example of how the math alone will demonstrate the compelling value of the Mylan offer. Perrigo has recently projected its maximum stand-alone earnings capability for 2016 to be at $9.45, including the completion of a $500 million share buyback by year end. What they haven't told you and what we will demonstrate using Perrigo's own math is that Perrigo's shareholders have the opportunity to earn $16.48 in 2016 if they simply accept Mylan's offer and reinvest the $75 in cash back into Mylan stock at the current share price.","Even if you accept the premise that Perrigo can achieve a forward 16 times PE multiple without our offer, their stock will still only be trading in the $150 range. In comparison, what we will show today is that our combined earnings after reinvesting the $75 in cash would be worth approximately $200 per share using only a 12 times multiple, which I believe will only increase over time.","This substantial value is also in sharp contrast when you also consider the potential downside in Perrigo's stock should Mylan not receive the greater of 50% of acceptances by 8 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on November 13. With this immediate and substantial accretion offer by our proposal to the Perrigo shareholders, this is anything but a bad deal for Perrigo. Therefore, in order to realize this immediate and significant value, you should tender your shares by the close of November 12 or risk losing this offer.","Lastly, with the October 23 deadline, which has now passed, for Perrigo to make material announcements, I did reach out to Joe Papa this past weekend and again offered to sit down with them so that we can plan with our management teams, as responsible leaders should, and bring in our two great companies together. We filed this communication this morning with the SEC. I also made it clear that I will be open to discussing corporate governance as part of this conversation with the aim of coming to a negotiated transaction. Unfortunately, Joe once again rebuffed my offer and missed the opportunity to discuss his thoughts on this matter.","As I have said in my meetings with shareholders, I am very open to a conversation about corporate governance with the Mylan Perrigo combination and will continue to maintain an active dialogue with shareholders on this matter.","With that, let me turn the call over to Heather.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. To say the least, the last few months and days have been eventful. We have had a great quarter, we have a great outlook for the remainder of the year and have tremendous growth trajectory supported by many opportunities in front of us. In addition to reviewing our quarter, we will again discuss our compelling offer for Perrigo and give an update on our integration planning for once the transaction is complete.","Now let's turn to the third quarter, where we've broken a number of records. On the top line, adjusted sales totaled $2.7 billion, a constant currency increase of 36% compared to the same period last year, with our Mylan legacy business delivering 14% growth on a constant currency basis, reflecting our diversification and scale. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS came in at $1.43, up 23% compared to third quarter of 2014. This performance was fueled by strong revenue growth across our generic segment, with each of our regions experiencing year-over-year constant currency increases in adjusted sales.","Turning to our Specialty segment. We continue to believe, now more than ever, in the underlying strength of the EpiPen franchise as well as the growth potential for the market overall going forward. We have continued to be proactive and competitive in maintaining our 85% market share, so while we saw a slight softening in the overall epinephrine market in Q3, total script volume remains positive for EpiPen on a year-over-year basis.","Against this backdrop we note Teva's statement that it will not be in a position to potentially launch a BX-rated or AB-rated alternative to EpiPen any earlier than the second half of 2016. Additionally, Sanofi has instituted a nationwide recall of Auvi-Q, affecting hospitals, retailers and consumers. We have confirmed that we have sufficient supply of product to meet any anticipated demand. We're confident that the widespread familiarity with EpiPen established over more than 25 years coupled with our robust training resources will provide access and support for those impacted by the recall.","We take our leadership position on the epinephrine Auto-Injector market very seriously and would like to point out that there are approximately 28 million at-risk individuals in the United States. Of the approximately 14 million people who have been diagnosed, about 10% are carrying an Auto-Injector, leaving room for substantial upside.","Additionally, anaphylactic events can occur in people with no known allergies. This was demonstrated by a recent survey of schools participating in our EpiPen4Schools program. The study indicated that more than 20% of the students or others on school grounds who had an anaphylactic episode and were treated had no idea they had any allergy. Obviously, this underscores the continued opportunity to build education and awareness about the need for access to our product, including public entities, as well as the run rate that still exists for our EpiPen franchise.","As a result of these developments, we see additional opportunities this year. We therefore expect adjusted EPS to be at the upper end of our range for 2015. This represents once again greater than 20% EPS growth. Moreover, given the long-term landscape change for the EpiPen market, we see EpiPen contributing an additional range of approximately $0.25 to $0.30 to adjusted EPS next year, which will only enhance the already-stated significant growth rates projected for Mylan Perrigo on a combined basis.","Before leaving EpiPen, I'd like to add that the recent developments in the news in the epinephrine market as a whole are particularly significant, given the number of organic catalysts we see for Mylan in 2017 and beyond, which Rajiv will be discussing. That said, we have never had a strategy to build a business based on one product or one-off event. Instead, we remain committed to building a differentiated platform that will deliver long-term sustainable growth for shareholders while at the same time benefiting our patients and other stakeholders.","Our results so far this year are a testament to our strategy, ability to execute it and exceed expectations, and our skill in leveraging the assets that we brought together, whether it's returning the EPD business to growth, lowering our tax rate or continuing to invest in R&D. Given current market dynamics, especially in the pharmaceutical sector, trading on fundamentals has never been more important, which is why a Mylan Perrigo combination is so compelling.","On last week's call, we got another glimpse at Perrigo's operating performance, which is struggling. On sales, they reduced their guidance by $150 million to $250 million. On EPS, while they announced adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2016 that was above consensus, taking a closer look, the change is driven by employee reduction and other cost cuts as well as financial measures. Stripping all of that away, adjusted diluted EPS guidance on the core business was actually reduced by $0.24 below consensus. This ultimate reduction in guidance is not a result of one-time item, but of continued degradation across their Consumer Healthcare business. Furthermore, API has declined by 16% year-to-date.","Looking at Tysabri, the longer-term hope has evaporated. Patients usage is down approximately 4% annually since 2010. But the recent failure in the Phase III study of SPMS, there is potential for further decline as SPMS patients who use Tysabri off-label (17:14) turn to other alternatives. Tysabri, as we know, contributes almost one-third of Perrigo's adjusted diluted EPS.","The complementary Mylan Perrigo combination will not only derisk Perrigo's shareholders on a stand-alone basis, it will provide enhanced growth, scale and capability. As such, we strongly believe that Perrigo's shareholders will see past the company's latest round of one-off initiatives, they will appreciate that Perrigo's stand-alone strategy is simply not a viable alternative to Mylan's offer, they will grasp the compelling value of our offer, which provides immediate accretion in excess of 80% as well as greater growth potential for the long term, and respond by tendering their shares.","Before turning the call over to Rajiv, I'd like to thank all of our employees around the world for their continued dedication to our cause and for remaining focused on executing and delivering the outstanding performance our shareholders expect and deserve.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv.","Rajiv Malik - President & Executive Director","Thank you, Heather. And good morning, everyone. I am very excited to review the performance of business, update you on our progress on some of our key growth drivers and provide some insight into our integration planning for Perrigo, including a high-level overview of our plans for our first 60 days of running this business.","As Heather mentioned, all of our regions contributed to the outstanding performance we delivered during the third quarter with each delivering very impressive double-digit revenue growth. Our global Generics segment generated third-party net sales of more than $2.3 billion, a year-over-year increase of 48% on a constant-currency basis.","In North America, sales were approximately $1.1 billion, up 29% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Our legacy business grew by 24% as a result of continued strong performance of sales from new products and higher volumes on existing products offset by lower net pricing.","We continued to see an improved flow of approvals coming out of FDA, and we launched 14 new products in the U.S. this quarter, including several generics to market and complex products such as Lidocaine, Transdermal, Paliperidone and (19:45).","In Europe, adjusted sales were approximately $630 million, a 95% constant currency increase as compared to the third quarter of 2014. This increase was largely attributed to the contribution of our acquired EPD business. Our legacy business grew 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis as a result of sales of new products and high volumes on existing ones, primarily in Italy and France. These increases were offset by government-enforced pricing reductions and complicated market conditions.","In our Rest of World business, sales totaled just under $550 million, a year-over-year increase of 47% on constant currency basis. Sales from our legacy business grew 21% on constant currency basis, driven by new product launches in Australia and Japan and high volumes from our India operations, especially our ARV franchise, and our promising business in Brazil.","We continue to be very pleased with the integration process of our Abbott EPD business across the various regions, taking a country-by-country approach to maximizing the potential opportunities from this combination. We have put in place new operating structures in several countries and are beginning to realize the benefits of cross-selling and an enhanced focus on key products.","We are extremely pleased to see a continuation of low-single digit growth in revenues across our EPD geographies in the third quarter, which reverses historically declines in that business, and we see this continuing through the end of the year. As we noted last quarter, the improvement in this business has been quicker than expected and we are currently tracking ahead on our execution plan. We also continued to make progress executing against a number of our key growth drivers and positioning Mylan for continued organic growth well into the future.","Let me start with our respiratory platform. Sirdupla continues to be a nice product for us in Europe. We are very pleased with how we (22:10) on the launch of this product and now have more than 500 out of 1,160 clinics dispensing the product in the UK. As we continue to build on our respiratory platform, our once-a-day LAMA, revefenacin, nebulized product for COPD partnered with Theravance, entered into Phase 3 clinical program in September. This program currently remains on track for an NDA submission in the later part of 2017.","We are also making good progress on our generic Flovent program for U.S., which we have partnered with Prosonix. Generic Flixotide, which is the same product in Europe, is on track to be approved in Q1 2016.","We are excited to update you on our significant progress in our generic ADVAIR program. As you are aware, the FDA Draft Guidance requires several key elements to achieve an AB-rated generic product. We are very pleased to report to you today that we have successfully achieved the following milestones for this product and are on track to submit our ANDA this December. Formulation design has been developed to be qualitatively and quantitatively the same as the reference product. We have completed our clinical end-point study and have shown our product to meet all Draft Guideline criteria. Our device robustness and Human Factors Studies have now been completed and demonstrate that our device can be used successfully with new patients as well as those trained on ADVAIR DISKUS. These studies met all three defined protocol criteria in vitro insulin studies against the reference products have met all acceptance criteria.","We have also completed PK bioequivalence studies for the two of the three stance (24:11) meet all draft guidance partner's criteria. The third and the final PK study is ongoing and will be available following the December submission. In addition, we have had excellent engagement with FDA throughout our development program and have recently completed a productive and collaborative pre-ANDA meeting with the agency.","Moving on to our biologics and insulin analogs program with our partner, Biocon. We are very excited about the progress these programs have made during the last year, with five programs successfully completing Phase I clinical trials and four programs in active Phase III testing. To this end, we plan on submitting in 2016 three biosimilar applications and one glargine application in the U.S. and Europe.","As an update to our trastuzumab development program, we have now completed enrollment of our Phase III study, with the first study results expected to be available in the second half of 2016. We expect to submit our application in the first half of 2016.","For pegfilgrastim, we have now completed the enrollment in our Phase III trials. We plan on filing this product application in the first half of 2016. The Phase III clinical program for our adalimumab is advancing well and is expected to complete for a second half of 2016 submission.","Finally, we have now completed recruitment for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes studies for our glargine program and we expect to have these studies completed by mid-2016. We continue to pursue our discussions with FDA regarding interchangeability. We also are very pleased with the completion and qualification of the state-of-the-art facility in Malaysia and activities to transfer that product into that facility. We plan to submit a European filing and our U.S. application in the second half of 2016.","While we continue to execute on the current portfolio, we also continue to actively explore opportunities to further enhance Mylan's biologic portfolio around the globe. Regarding our Copaxone program, as we indicated last quarter, we have responded to all FDA requests to-date. We remain confident that we are positioned to receive approval for our product.","The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has instituted an inter partes review proceeding on all claims against a third Copaxone 40-milligrams patent and a hearing has been scheduled for May 2016. We generally believe that the IP surrounding the 40-milligram franchise is weak.","Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we are looking forward to close our acquisition of certain women's healthcare businesses from Famy Care by the end of the year, although the close has been delayed a bit as we await final approval from FIPB in India, which we expect very soon.","Turning now to Perrigo. Let me start out by being very clear; we are capable, confident and ready to run the Perrigo business as soon as we close and have been putting in place a comprehensive readiness plan to allow us to do so. Of course, the first step will be ensuring business continuity of their existing businesses and maintaining the operational and commercial excellence that Perrigo and Mylan are known for.","As we discussed during the last call, I don't think anyone should doubt our ability to manage Perrigo's Generics or API businesses. These capabilities are at Mylan's core and our strong capabilities in these areas will only enhance the Perrigo effort. Also we are very confident that we can do more with Omega within our combined commercial platform in Europe than what Perrigo has done or could do with this effort on a stand-alone basis, especially given our strong track record in the region, with the Merck and Abbott EPD integration.","Now let me talk about the private label manufacturing. One of the key factors which has been called out for success in this area is supply chain excellence. Mylan's supply chain, manufacturing and packaging capabilities are well recognized as being second to none. Our global supply chain operations are based in Dublin, and this hub has been operational since 2009.","Our complex platform manages more than 1,400 products and 15,000 SKUs from around 40 internal manufacturing sites and more than 1,400 third-party suppliers and contract manufacturing organizations. With this platform, we serve approximately 145 markets around the world, have more than 35,000 customers and we serve these customers and markets in 40 different languages with varying packaging and artwork. All of this makes adding Perrigo's supply chain to our existing business very straightforward.","I also want to address the comments made by Perrigo about the lack of synergistic opportunities in the API business. First, I would like to note that API synergies are a relatively small part of our estimates. That said, the opportunity we see here is about having a broad and diverse platform and deploying that platform, including its capacity, capabilities and portfolio, in an opportunistic way. For example, after the Merck Generics acquisition, we successfully integrated 50% of the pipeline and portfolio despite not having the relevant capabilities prior to the acquisition.","Turning to the next slide. We manage a complex and diverse network of more than 30 finished dosage internal sites that are physically located across the network and maintain a close proximity to key markets. Our ability to manage its complexity is a result of our continuous focus on operational excellence, including quality and delivery of a broad range of portfolio to customers at the right time and in the right quantities. We can bring Perrigo into our network and even more effectively deploy their efforts to the benefit of our business and customers.","As you know, we have successfully executed a number of global and transformational integrations and we have established a permanent Integration Office. As part of this process, we have identified interim leaders for key Perrigo functional areas to lead the integration, in addition to Ranjan Chaudhuri, who we announced today to be the global commercial leader of our OTC business. These leaders are prepared and fully capable of managing these functions in the event the Perrigo leaders in those areas choose to depart upon closing.","We have also retained third-party consultants to support us in this process with significant experience in the OTC space. This will only further ensure that we are well prepared to manage the business. A critical strategy for us will be to get to know the key talent at Perrigo and implement retention programs. We believe that, as we communicate with leaders and their employees, they will see the significant opportunities for their future growth that this combination presents and they will be excited to engage with us on achieving a shared vision for the combined business. We very much hope to make this a collaborative effort and we'll seek to retain as many of Perrigo leaders as possible.","Within the first 60 days, we will have developed a clear roadmap for integration of our businesses, a plan for synergy realization as well as a defined operating model. With regards to synergy realization, I would like to restate our confidence in our estimate that the combined company will achieve at least $800 million in annual pre-tax operational synergies by the end of year following the consummation of the offer.","Perrigo's cost-saving actions announced last week further relegate that synergy potential from a much larger combined Mylan Perrigo platform. For instance, Mylan's global supply chain operations are already located at our Center of Excellence in Ireland, where Perrigo is looking to consolidate their supply chain operation, providing strategic and synergistic opportunities.","And we have already advanced in the implementation of Mylan's Global Shared Services structure, another area Perrigo identified for efficiencies, which could be implemented more effectively as part of Mylan. Working with the Perrigo team, we expect to identify additional opportunities from the combined assets. We are confident in achieving these synergies both in a controlled subsidiary or 100% ownership position, although we have stated we believe some different steps may be taken to achieve that synergy realization depending on the ownership level achieved.","Finally, I would like to remind everyone again that Mylan has successfully integrated several large and highly complex transactions dealing with multiple geographies, new business areas and convoluted structures, including operating metrics as a majority-owned controlled public entity for several years. While this combination with Perrigo has its own unique dynamic and complicating factors, we are realistic about the challenges, confident in our planning and experience and optimistic that once we get to day one, our combined teams will put the (35:24) of the last few months aside and get to work together to ensure our mutual success.","In closing, I would like to also give my sincere thanks to Mylan's employees who have demonstrated unwavering focus on our business and our mission every day and are now energized about the Perrigo opportunity and looking forward to welcoming their new colleagues to Mylan.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John D. Sheehan - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Thanks, Rajiv. As Heather and Rajiv both mentioned, we are extremely pleased with our financial results for the third quarter of 2015, highlighted by the strong revenue growth in our generic segment and the exceptional free cash flow that we generated during the quarter.","Our adjusted total revenues for the third quarter of 2015 were $2.7 billion, an increase of 36% on a constant currency basis from the prior-year period. Adjusted revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $122 million in the current quarter when compared to the prior-year period, primarily reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to the euro, yen, rupee and Australian dollar.","When compared to exchange rates at the beginning of the quarter, our adjusted revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately $23 million. Additionally, third-party net sales were positively impacted by the contribution from the acquired EPD business of approximately $462 million, of which approximately $314 million was in Europe, $105 million was in our Rest of World region, and the remainder coming from EPD Canada.","As stated during our second quarter conference call, foreign currency translation has been significantly impacted our reported revenues as a result of the strong U.S. dollar.","As such, we expect that our actual reported full-year 2015 adjusted revenues will be at the low end of our 2015 guidance range. On a constant currency basis, however, we expect to be near the midpoint of our guidance range for 2015 adjusted revenues.","Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter of 2015 was a very strong 58%, up approximately 400 basis points over the prior year. Our strong margins are primarily the result of the positive contribution from the EPD business combined with new product introductions and increased margins on existing products within North America. We continue to expect our full-year adjusted gross margin to be at the upper end of our 2015 guidance range.","On an adjusted basis, R&D expense was $174 million or approximately 6% of total revenues for the quarter. Adjusted R&D expense has actually increased over the prior-year quarter as a result of the impact of the EPD business. As we continue to invest in our key growth drivers during 2015, we expect adjusted R&D spending as a percentage of adjusted total revenues to be near the midpoint of our guidance range for the full year.","At the same time and also on an adjusted basis, SG&A was $492 million or approximately 18% of total revenues for the quarter. The acquisition of the EPD business accounted for the majority of the increase in adjusted SG&A for the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted SG&A as a percentage of total revenues to be close to the midpoint of our 2015 guidance range.","We continue to realize significant tax benefits from our inversion transaction and, as result of our ongoing effort to optimize our tax structure, during the third quarter we adjusted our full-year 2015 estimated annual effective tax rate to 18% from our previous assumption of 19%. This resulted in an adjusted tax rate for the third quarter of approximately 17%. As we move towards the end of 2015, we continue to look at additional tax planning strategies for opportunities to further reduce our tax rate.","Our third quarter adjusted net earnings were $734 million or $1.43 per share, a 23% increase from our Q3 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.16 per share. Excluding the gain that we recognized in the prior-year period for the settlement of contingent consideration related to the Agila acquisition, adjusted diluted EPS increased an impressive 42%. The EPS growth in 2015 was achieved in spite of foreign currency headwinds, thanks to the strength of our global operating platform, including the recently acquired EPD business combined with revenue growth across our legacy Generic business.","Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was a record $1.1 billion for the current quarter, representing an increase of approximately $655 million from the prior-year period, which is the result of the growth in adjusted earnings combined with our ongoing working capital initiatives. Through diligent cash flow management, our free cash flow increased 158% to $1 billion. Over the first nine months of 2015, free cash flow has risen 72% to $1.4 billion as compared to $818 million in the prior-year period.","Year-to-date capital spending was down slightly as compared to the prior year at $207 million as we continue to invest in our business and growth drivers. As a result of our strong operating cash flow, at the end of the quarter, our gross debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2:1.","We have no amounts outstanding on our $400 million receivables facility or $1.65 billion revolving credit facility. In addition, during the third quarter, we further optimized our capital structure through the redemption of our $1 billion 2020 senior notes and repayment of our cash convertible notes which matured in September.","We funded these transactions through a $1.6 billion term loan which we entered into at the beginning of the quarter. We remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit rating, including after a successful completion of the offer to acquire Perrigo, and we continue to have ample borrowing capacity and financial flexibility.","As a reminder, we have a fully committed financing facility to fund the acquisition of the Perrigo shares pursuant to our tender offer. For the full year, as Heather stated earlier, we expect to be at the high end of our 2015 guidance range at $4.35 per adjusted diluted share. I would note that we are not assuming the launch of generic Copaxone or EpiPen competition in 2015.","Now turning back to our tender offer for Perrigo. I'd like to quickly revisit the HUSP. As we showed a few weeks ago using Perrigo's own updated numbers and even using their proxy peer group, we believe that Perrigo would trade at $153 per share or a 15 times EBITDA multiple, which is discount to where they're trading today and is a significant discount to the value of our offer.","Turning to slide 21. On a stand-alone basis, Perrigo has told you that their plan would deliver $9.45 of EPS in 2016 based on their recently announced financial initiatives, or $9.83 if you give them credit for the run rate cost savings they hope to achieve within three years. Applying an illustrative 14 times to 16 times multiple to that EPS estimate, Perrigo would be worth between $132 per share and $151 per share next year assuming phased-in cost savings or up to $157 per share if you give them credit for run rate cost savings on a stand-alone basis.","In comparison, Mylan's offer for Perrigo using Perrigo's own numbers would deliver $9.55 of earnings attributable to each Perrigo share assuming phased-in synergies or $10.83 per Perrigo share assuming run rate synergies. This represents accretion of 3% to 16% to Perrigo shareholders. Even if you only apply an illustrative 12 times to 14 times multiple to this EPS and add $75 in cash, it implies a total value of $190 per share to $226 per share.","It is important to note that these per share amounts are based upon Mylan's analyst consensus estimate and do not include the $0.25 to $0.30 of the EpiPen Auto-Injector 2016 upside opportunity Heather referred to earlier. And if shareholders choose to reinvest their $75 of cash consideration in the combined company, they would receive $16.48 of EPS assuming phased-in synergies and $18.70 assuming run rate synergies. This represents 77% to 101% earnings accretion attributable to Perrigo shareholders due to the premium embedded in our offer.","Again, even if you only apply an illustrative 12 times to 14 times multiple to this EPS, it implies a total value of $198 per share to $262 per share, a substantial premium to what Perrigo could deliver on a stand-alone basis. So, if shareholders choose Perrigo's stand-alone strategy, even if you assume a higher range of multiples of 14 times to 16 times, your shares would be at best be worth $151 per share. However, if you vote in favor of the transaction, your shares will be worth more, no matter what you choose to believe in terms of multiples.","Again, let's return to the math. Assuming only an illustrative 12 times multiple and phased-in synergies, based on Perrigo's numbers your shares would be worth $190 with no reinvestment and $198 with reinvestment, a substantial premium to the best-case scenario of Perrigo stand-alone or a $37 to $45 premium to Perrigo's current hypothetical unaffected stock price. Giving credit for run rate synergies at a blended multiple 14 times, the earnings attributed to the Perrigo shareholder would represent a value of $209 per share without reinvestment and $231 with reinvestment, a $56 to $78 premium to today's current hypothetical unaffected stock price.","Remember, in order to reap this substantial value and for the transaction to be completed, greater than 50% of Perrigo ordinary shares will need to be tendered into the offer. We would therefore encourage Perrigo shareholders to tender their shares before the close on November 1th2. There is no risk to you of tendering early. If you tender before the 12th and the tender fails, you will receive your Perrigo shares back. If you do not tender, however, you risk losing the significant value we are offering. Wait and see is not the right choice if you want to benefit from the premium we are offering. Bottom line, the M-A-T-H is a clear and compelling value proposition relative to Perrigo's stand-alone plan.","That concludes my remarks. And I'll turn the call back over to Stephanie for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Marc Goodman with UBS. Your line is open.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Morning. Heather, on EpiPen, can you talk about the pricing commentary in the press release and put in context what it means relative to the troubles we learned about yesterday with Auvi-Q and with the Teva delays? And can you also comment on have there been any changes in channel inventory levels maybe in anticipation of the Teva generic coming?","And then third question is, it seems with the recent changes here with EpiPen that you should be able to do over $5 a share of earnings next year and I was curious if you would make a comment on that. Thank you.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Sure. Thank you, Marc. I'll start with your last point. I can't disagree with your math. As far as EpiPen, I guess a couple of things. As far as inventories are concerned, we have not \u2013 and I think I had mentioned actually on last quarter as well, we have not seen any irregular things happening or our customers selling beyond because they were anticipating a Teva launch.","I think that there had not been any commentary about Teva coming into the market and, obviously, they've now clarified yesterday that it won't be at least till the second half of 2016. So our inventory levels were running due course. There were no issues there, as I mentioned. There was a little softness in the overall epinephrine market in the third quarter. But as you know, we continue to see double-digit growth year-over-year and so the comparable had been very high. With that being said, we've still seen EpiPen grow in volume year-to-date.","And as far as all of the recent events, I would say that our dynamic with the payers will stay just that, I think very dynamic. As I've noted throughout this year, we have been very proactive and competitive to maintain our market share. Obviously, in light of some of the recent developments, I think that we'll continue to have opportunities to improve that situation because it's not as competitive as it was.","So as happens in this space, the competition landscapes can change very rapidly and I think our ability to first and most importantly be there for the patient and the safety issue. And we have been very closely monitoring and assisting to make sure patients can get the scripts of EpiPen so they're not going without product. So I would say all-in-all, as I mentioned in my commentary, the runway looks very bright and I think the future of the EpiPen franchise is just going to be one that's got a lot of brand equity and a lot of sustainability, too.","Robert J. Coury - Executive Chairman","The only thing I would like to add to Heather's comments and because you asked a question, Marc, and obviously under Irish Takeover Rules we're not allowed to give forward-looking projections, but since you did the math on your own, not only do I support Heather's answer to you about your own math, but this opportunity with EpiPen really could not have come at a more opportune time because it only fuels the trajectory of our growth that we've been delivering for our shareholders over the last several years.","Especially when you think about what Rajiv said about our generic Advair application being filed by the end of this year, we have the real possibility to get on the fast track. If that occurs, then if you take a look at what we see ahead of us in 2016 and then jump right over to 2017 with the potential launch of significant catalyst, you can see that the whole EpiPen situation could have not come in a more opportune time.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, hi. Good morning. I have three questions. First, John, can you talk a little more about gross margin and whether it's sustainable at these levels and some of the pushes and pulls?","My second question is for Heather. When you describe Perrigo, I can't help but think it sounds like you're pitching a stock to short. Can you talk about your philosophy of why you're talking about your target in a way that suggests that you can do a far better job with it? You're about to part with a lot of precious capital of your shareholders, yet you seem to be focused on the negatives of the business more than the positives, yet you haven't lowered your price.","And lastly for Robert, what are these corporate governance changes you're committed to making? I think it's appropriate to be more specific in this case so that your shareholders believe it's more than just lip service to get a deal done. Thanks.","Robert J. Coury - Executive Chairman","Yes, so, first, Gregg, let me before I turn it over to Heather for her commentary. The Mylan shareholders have already spoken in terms of the Perrigo transaction and the opportunity. We've spent an exorbitant amount of time with the Mylan shareholder describing to them why this asset in our hands is the right next opportunity to bolt-on to our existing platform with our existing assets.","And we convinced them when they supported us in the August 28 vote, we convinced them because we pointed to other assets that we've acquired that we said very consistently on a stand-alone basis if you look at what we paid for the other assets, this is almost d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. There are many assets that we've bolted on to our platform that we do not really like on a stand-alone basis. But then bolted on to our platform, as you can see through the demonstration of our continued, very strong execution and performance, we were able to deliver continual double-digit growth to our shareholders. So I think that Perrigo is going to be no different and I'm going to have her explain that in more detail.","In terms of the corporate governance, I've been very, very open, very, very direct and very transparent about, one, saying that the entire whole corporate governance discussion over this transaction has been nothing but a red herring. With that said, I do listen to shareholders, and Perrigo shareholders, in particularly. That's why I extended my offer to Joe Papa and their Board of Directors to sit down and have a dialogue.","If this is really something that's all that's left out there, then let's sit down and talk about for the combination of the Mylan Perrigo combination, for that new structure, that new company profile, the new size and scale that the combined company will be absolutely warrants an open discussion about, not just what's on my mind, but I'd like them to participate. I'd like them to have a say-so.","I've offered them Board of Director seats to help oversee, not just participate, but actually help oversee on a going-forward basis. You can't get any more transparent than I have been about opening up or wanting to open up a dialogue and leave everything on the table because I think it's the appropriate thing to do.","Heather?","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Yes, so, I don't have much to add. I would just say that we've tried to outline that our ability to really leverage, and I think given when you look at the United States market, the dynamic that we would have with the same customers and being able to take and have these complementary businesses going to those same customers and being able to we believe really not only change the paradigm but be able to evolve as rapidly as we're seeing as just the most recent announcement of the Walgreens Rite Aid. Our customers are becoming larger and global. And to be able to have the scale and the ability to rapidly adapt to that, we think happens on this combined basis better than them on a stand-alone.","And as we've said many times to the Europe platform, Omega, they didn't have any existing infrastructure there. So, if you look at our critical mass now around the Rx channel and the Gx channel and our successful integration of EPD and how we've turned that business around, it really just shows and highlights that now adding Ox to that channel, again, our ability to really leverage this business and create, make one plus one equal more than three, is how we've always approached transactions and that's why we've approached the Perrigo, trying to layout the realities of Perrigo on a stand-alone basis versus combined with Mylan.","John, you want to hit gross margin?","John D. Sheehan - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Gregg. With respect to gross margin, I guess I would start by pointing out that since 2010 our gross margins have increased from 45% up to the high end of the guidance range that we indicated we would be at this year of 55%. So the gross margins have been sustained. They have steadily increased over the last five, six years.","We've done that with, most importantly from my perspective, a best-in-class operating platform which has been driving annual cost reductions in our product portfolio, the vertical integration that we have in that operating platform, the very strong integration of API, our own API, into our products. It also has been driven by the positive pricing environment that we've seen, especially over the last couple of years in North America. And, yeah, I would agree that EPD has been a portion of the increase that we've seen this year in 2015.","But to your question of sustainability on a going-forward basis, I would say that what we've demonstrated over the last five years, I see that continued to be sustainable, especially as we continue to add complex new products like generic Advair and our biologics products.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sumant Kulkarni with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have three. First, outside of over-the-counter, what are some of the specific business development priorities for Mylan, given that competition on the generic side may start to appear more formidable with the Teva Allergan transaction?","Second, if the Perrigo stand-alone business appears so challenged in some fashion, what can Mylan specifically do to kick-start that business and how long would it take to turn it around, excluding any revenue synergies?","And third, sorry if I missed it, but could you give us an update on the Antitrust review of this transaction in the U.S.?","Robert J. Coury - Executive Chairman","So, regarding Antitrust, we should be hearing really any day, quite frankly. Heather?","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Yeah, Sumant. As I was explaining about Perrigo, their challenge is sustainable growth on a stand-alone basis. So we've continued to say they have a good solid business. It's just when put with the Mylan and brought together with the Mylan entity, our ability of how we approach customers, of how we leverage the platform in Europe, how we can then broaden and go to other geographies with the assets we've put together is what we continue to show, not to mention the at least $800 million of synergies that we think we'll be able to get out of the combined platform.","So it's really just bringing the scale together and being able to leverage these complementary platforms that 1 plus 1 equals more than 3 or 4. And that's what, as we've said, our history and our track record has shown that we've continued to be able to do that with those transactions.","I'd say as far as business development opportunities, yes, we've said we'll focus on the OTC channel in continuing to go about and enhance that platform. Obviously, Perrigo accelerates that. But we're interested in building and we believe there's great product opportunities in other assets out there that would let us continue to build the OTC, both in the U.S. as well as Rest of World.","And as we've said before, we continue to believe there's dosage forms, therapeutic categories that we still don't have critical mass in. As we added the injectable platform as an important bolus and opportunity for us to gain critical mass in that area, we believe that we've got other areas, such as ophthalmics, that we can continue to bolt-on and really leverage our global commercial platform.","John D. Sheehan - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","And then the only other thing I would add is a sustainable cash flow business versus a business that is struggling to grow, I do believe that what we bring to Perrigo is an immediate protection of the downside that we can forecast that we see in their stand-alone business. You cannot ask shareholders to rely on delusional high P\/E multiples in order to deliver growth. You must rely on your own capability of producing earnings growth and leave it up to the Street to decide ultimately what P\/E multiple and, in particular, platform or profile it deserves.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Finkelstein with Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Andrew Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks very much for taking the question. I was hoping you could comment more on a couple things. Number one, you mentioned better margins on some of your existing products in North America. And could you comment how much of that is related to pricing?","Number two, Perrigo announced plans to spin off its BMS business. How do you think about a business like that in terms of where you can compete successfully in OTC? And then finally, you mentioned ophthalmics, if you could comment anymore on the capabilities you do have there, including with products like generic RESTASIS. Thanks very much.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","I'll start on the North American Perrigo question. Look, I would say as far as price increases, we've had a very consistent approach. We have absolutely had opportunities around generic pricing, but I would tell you is, as we noted I believe in our commentary, that we've seen our volumes up more than our increases.","So when you look our broad portfolio and hundreds of products, it's not dependent on any one product or any massive price increases across the board. So I would say what we continue to see is because of the shortages and some of the issues with the FDA, that our ability to have that reliable supply has really been a differentiator for Mylan and has allowed us to continue to do more and optimize the assets we have.","As far as the Perrigo businesses and commentary on their price cuts or businesses they're selling, look, I think it would be premature for us to comment on those assets or their assessment. I think that's why, as Rajiv talked about, our first 60 days it's really getting in there and assessing both the people and the businesses and before making any kind of quick rush decisions about what may or may not make sense going forward.","Rajiv?","Rajiv Malik - President & Executive Director","And regarding our product mix, in our global portfolio, we have a bunch of ophthalmics products, including a pending ANDA with RESTASIS, which we are waiting to hear from the FDA. We have filed this ANDA a couple of years back and are waiting to hear from the FDA.","John D. Sheehan - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","And I would just close by saying that similar to the last question regarding margin, that the North America increase in margin is the combination of both, as I said, a positive pricing environment, but just as importantly, the cost reductions that our global operating platform has been able to achieve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Ronny Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I have three. First, Rajiv, about the insulin product, there are two formulations (66:35) out there. There's a vial formulation and a prefilled syringe formulation. And I know you're working on the prefilled syringe formulations. Others have been struggling with the vial formulation. Can you just confirm to us that you were able to get the vial formulation right? Is this one of the formulations that will be submitted in 2016?","Second, on R&D. You seem to have a lot of trials going into Phase III, both on the branded side and biosimilars. Should we expect an increase in R&D in 2016 above the current percentage of revenue, even with the nice EpiPen number? Can you just give us an idea about what is the step function in R&D to cover those?","And last, to come back to you guys on this issue of governance, I understand that you want to talk to the board of Perrigo in this issue. But for your own shareholders I think the question is, are you willing to undo the stichting requirements to keep Mylan independent? Are you willing to change the board election to allow shareholders to propose new members, for your own shareholders, looking long term? Is this in the plans? Would you commit to that? Or is this something that you think is like bedrock the way Mylan should operate long term?","Robert J. Coury - Executive Chairman","Thanks for the question, Ronny. Rajiv, let me take that first and then you can take the other two. Look, Ronny, I don't want to be discussing corporate governance in a vacuum. I think it's appropriate when you look at this new combined entity, its profile, its size and scale, what this new profile will be on a going-forward basis. I think it's very important rather than do this in a vacuum or on our own, I think it's very important that two boards come together and discuss this matter openly. I think it should be discussed with shareholders.","Certainly, I would speak to Mylan shareholders. Let me remind you that this corporate governance has been voted in by the Mylan shareholders. And I will always be open. With that said, this is really about the Perrigo transaction right now, but I will always be open with both the Mylan and Perrigo shareholders on an ongoing basis.","And all the type of governance changes that you've outlined, I will absolutely be open to all of those things with a good discussion. I believe, first, we need to deal with the Perrigo and the Perrigo potential transaction because I think, again, Ronny, a lot of this is a big red herring. I truly believe it's much more of an excuse that's being used right now than the realities. We are a public company. A company that's a public company is for sale every single day. That's what a public company is.","We, as a board, we've made our position abundantly clear that we would not hold this company back. There has been several types of transactions I have mentioned that we would be open for, both in value and in structure, and especially transactions that would accelerate the mission and strategy of the company while delivering value for shareholders. So I want you to understand because I know this is something that you've heard about, something that you've, I'm certain we're going to have a lot more discussions about, but I can't be any more transparent. Let's not use this as an (70:15).","So in a way to take it off the table, why I mentioned this morning, why I reached out to Joe after I saw that he left the shareholders no other alternative than to rely on some high P\/E multiple. I'm giving him and the Board of Directors an opportunity to have dialogue. I will invite their board members to participate in any questions or considerations on a going-forward basis and I will also invite their board members to come on the board and represent the Perrigo side, the Perrigo shareholders.","So let's not use corporate governance in the place of the real value proposition that 80%-plus accretion that we're given to the Perrigo's shareholder. So let me leave it at that. And, Rajiv, you can address both the ....","Rajiv Malik - President & Executive Director","Yeah, so, Ronny, for glargine, our 2015 submission targets include both vial and cartridge. As far as the R&D spend is concerned, I think it's about the phasing-in of these clinical programs and also on an increased revenue base, the total absolute number of R&D dollars. And we will be maintaining it, our R&D spend, between 6.5% to 7.5% range as we have been \u2013 we believe these dollars are good enough for us to manage this programs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Umer Raffat - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a few, if I may. First, Robert, when you say corporate governance changes, are you referring specifically to stichting or are there other considerations you're evaluating as well? Just wanted to understand that better.","And then, Heather, the slides mentioned that for Abbott Established Products business, the year-over-year constant currency growth is 5%. Can you give us what it is without FX adjustment for Abbott Established Products?","And finally, John, so what exactly does the purchase accounting amortization entail? I just want to understand like specifically what exactly does it include in that? And what's the $41 million financing-related cost that was non-GAAPed out? Thank you.","Robert J. Coury - Executive Chairman","In terms of the corporate governance, again, I don't think there should be any limitations when you have an open dialogue with your shareholders, or, in this case, with Perrigo and Perrigo's board. I don't think there should be any limitations if you really are open to have a discussion about corporate governance as a whole.","John D. Sheehan - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah, so on the question of the EPD revenues without being on a constant currency basis, you certainly know that the euro has weakened substantially against the U.S. dollar over the last year. And you also know we didn't own the EPD business last year, so that it wasn't included in our revenue. So I would just say that the EPD business revenues on an actual value as expressed in U.S. dollars are down year-over-year. But, again, it wasn't in our numbers, so it's not necessarily a relevant point.","I guess I'll just also hit, Heather, the purchase accounting amortization. When we make an acquisition, U.S. GAAP requires the allocation of the purchase price to the value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the intangible assets are then amortized. That's a non-cash amortization charge which had been a consistent adjustment that we've made associated with our adjustments from GAAP to adjusted earnings.","And lastly, the financing charges, those represent the costs associated with the refinancing of our capital, our balance sheet, including the committed bridge loan that we have in place associated with our Perrigo tender offer.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","And I guess just as a practical note I would add on the EPD business, as we stated when we acquired that business, Abbott themselves had forecasted it to be a declining business. And we had believed that, in our hands, we would be able to focus on investment to make that flat to slightly growing. And I think what we've seen and reported today is just that we continued to exceed those expectations. That business has done very well integrated into the Mylan legacy European platform.","So we're proud to say that we're ahead of schedule and continue to see a lot of, not only great cash flows associated with the business, but they're really complementary in nature to the retail pharmacy channel that we already had our legacy business in.","Operator","Our final question comes from Jason Gerberry with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. Good morning. This is Derek on for Jason. I just had one question. I was wondering if you could talk about the $17 million one-time customer incentive in the EU and whether that was related at all to Perrigo's distributors not taking any Omega products during the quarter? Thanks.","John D. Sheehan - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","No, I can confirm to you that it was not. It had nothing to do with that. It relates to the integration of our EPD business in Europe and was, as I indicated, a one-time payment associated with the bringing of the EPD business into Mylan.","So, with that, I'd just like to close the call by saying thank you to all the participants. I think that the slides that we reviewed with you today will be available on the Mylan website. We think they produce a clear and compelling case for the value proposition that we're making to the Perrigo shareholders. And we would be pleased to continue to engage with you on the subject.","Thanks very much, operator. And you can close the call.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I'd now like to hand the conference over to Ms. Kris King, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Kris King - Vice President, Global Investor Relations","Thank you, Saeed. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Mylan's fourth quarter and year-end 2014 earnings call. Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Sheehan.","During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements relate to, among other matters, the acquisition of by Mylan N.V. of both Mylan, Inc. and Abbott Laboratories' non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business, which I'll refer to as the Abbott business.","Our and Mylan N.V.'s expected or targeted future financial and operating performance; results, metrics, and plans and expectations related thereto; the inability to obtain regulatory approvals and planned launches of and anticipated exclusivity periods for new products. Because forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties, actual future results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the ability to meet expectations regarding the accounting and tax treatments of the transactions with Abbott, changes in relevant tax and other laws, the integration of the Abbott business by Mylan being more difficult, time consuming, or costly than expected, operating costs, customer loss and business disruptions being greater than expected following the transaction with Abbott.","The impact of competition; situations where we or Mylan N.V. manufacture market and\/or sell products notwithstanding unresolved allegations of patent infringement; any regulatory, legal or other impediments to our or Mylan N.V.'s ability to bring new products to market; those set forth under Forward-Looking Statements in today's earnings release, and the risk factors set forth on our Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2013 as updated by our Form 8-K filed on August 6, 2014, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2014, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2014 as well as our other filings with the SEC.","These risks as well as other risks associated with Mylan, Mylan N.V., the Abbott business, and the transaction with Abbott are also more fully discussed in our proxy statement filed with the SEC on December 24, 2014. We undertake no obligation to update any statements made today whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Today's call should be listened to and considered in its entirety and understood to speak only as of today's date.","In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are presented in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance.","Please refer to today's press release, which is available on our website, as well as the SEC website, as it contains detailed reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","Before I turn the call over to Heather, let me also remind you that the material in the call with the exception of the participant questions is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's expressed written permission. An archived copy of today's call will be available on our website later today and will remain available for a limited time.","With that I'll now turn the call over to Heather.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Kris, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Mylan is off to a phenomenal start this year. Our announcement this past Friday is a great example, having successfully completed our acquisition of Abbott's non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business, we now are beginning our next exciting chapter of growth.","As we've been stating all along, this is absolutely the next right strategic transaction for Mylan and nearly doubles our size in our top 10 markets outside the United States, further expands and diversifies our product portfolio and customer base, and gives us significant financial flexibility to aggressively pursue opportunities that make strategic and financial sense for the company.","We expect the transaction to be approximately $0.20 accretive to EPS in 2015, $0.25 in the first full year, and to increase thereafter through 2018. We also expect to maintain double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth rates through 2018. In addition, we see our tax rate declining to approximately 20% to 21% during the first full year and then following into the high teens thereafter.","Anticipating all of these benefits, we began planning with Abbott leadership as soon as we announced the deal back in July so as to lay the ground work for what we believe will be a very smooth integration now that the transaction has closed. I'd like to take this opportunity on behalf of Mylan's board of directors and senior leaders to welcome Abbott's EPD employees to the Mylan family. We very much look forward to the contributions they'll make as they take up our cause of delivering better health for a better world.","As we take a moment and look back at 2014, we again delivered strong financial performance by leveraging the diversity and breadth of our global platform, maintaining our relentless focus on disciplined execution and seizing opportunities whenever and wherever they arose.","Sales for the year totaled $7.7 billion, a constant currency increase of 13% compared to 2013. Adjusted diluted EPS totaled $3.56, an increase of 23% compared to our prior year performance. Every one of our business segments contributed to this growth with our North America and Rest of World generics regions and our Specialty segment delivering double-digit revenue increases. In addition, EpiPen became our first product to generate $1 billion in annual sales.","Our employees around the world deserve the credit for these great results. On behalf of our board and senior leaders, I'd like to thank them for their hard work and unwavering dedication to our cause. Their commitment will serve us well in 2015, which we believe will be yet another very strong year for the company.","Specifically, we anticipate revenue growth of 33% and EPS growth of 21% both on a constant currency basis. In addition, we continue to see opportunities to accelerate our 2018 target of at least $6 on adjusted EPS.","As I mentioned in 2014, EpiPen became our first product to reach $1 billion in annual sales. We're proud to have reached this milestone and note that we achieved it by growing the franchise at a compound annual clip of nearly 30% since 2008, a reflection of the product's tremendous brand equity.","As I've often reiterated, we have continued to expand the epinephrine market in unconventional ways, specifically by focusing on education, awareness and access. Our EpiPen for schools program is a great example as is our advocacy on the regulatory front with 48 states now allowing undesignated epinephrine auto injectors in schools.","Our assumptions around EpiPen for 2015 incorporate that we already participate in a highly competitive, multi-player EpiPen marketplace and that we are operating in a very aggressive payer environment. And while we continue to believe that the regulatory barrier-to-entry for an AB-rated generic EpiPen remains high, we also are factoring the impact of an AB-rated competition into our guidance in the second half of the year. That said, we continue to invest in product innovation and geographic expansion as well as new formulations.","We also continue to pursue our unconventional approach to growing this franchise. It focuses on shaping legislation to continue to expand assets for consumers and other public entities, generating awareness about severe allergies, providing education to help those at risk take control and continually looking for ways to enhance consumer's experience.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv.","Rajiv Malik - President","Thank you, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. As you have heard 2014 was another very strong year for Mylan strategically, operationally, and financially. We saw double-digit growth in our business including 21% growth in Specialties, 18% in Rest of World, 12% in North America, as well as 3% growth in Europe, which includes absorbing 4% to 5% of price erosion.","Our strong performance in North America was particularly noteworthy as it comes despite us not being able to get certain key approvals due to continued regulatory delays at FDA. We believe that FDA has made some good progress implementing GDUFA since the program went into effect in October of 2012. The agency has increased its inspections of domestic and foreign manufacturers although the median review time for ANDAs is standing at about 42 months.","Nevertheless, we remain confident that over the long run, a properly resourced and transformed FDA will yield substantial benefits in the U.S. and beyond in the form of improved safety access and transparency. I'd also note that Mylan received more FDA approvals in 2014 than any other company including six first to files all, of which have fueled our strong financial performance during the year.","In addition, we have more ANDAs pending approval than anyone in our industry. 283 to be specific including 44 pending first to files opportunities. As you know at Mylan, we are never standing still and we have started off 2015 with an announcement of several additional complementary transactions that will further enhance our existing platform.","Last month, we announced an agreement to acquire certain female healthcare businesses from Famy Care, which is the world's largest producer of generic oral contraceptive products. This acquisition will provide Mylan with an enhanced and now vertically integrated platform to accelerate our growth in the global women's healthcare space.","Famy Care will bring us four high quality manufacturing facilities in India, two of which have been approved by FDA and the European health authorities. They have one of the lowest costs and largest manufacturing footprints dedicated to oral contraceptive products and will bring Mylan strong capabilities in OCP cycles, injectables, IUDs and tubal rings.","On the commercial front, this acquisition will build on Mylan's existing partnerships with Famy Care in North America, Europe, and Australia, and will also make Mylan a hormonal contraceptive leader in high-growth emerging markets around the world. This transaction also complements the business acquired from Abbott, which includes a women's healthcare portfolio and sales and marketing capabilities.","The purchase price represents a mid-teen EBITDA multiple on a forward basis for a high growth and profitable business. Looking ahead, we are anticipating annual EBITDA growth in excess of 25% over the next several years. That acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to Mylan's adjusted diluted EPS upon closing, which is expected to occur in the second half of 2015, subject to regulatory approval and certain closing conditions.","We also recently announced a partnership with Theravance Biopharma on the development and commercialization of TD-4208, a novel investigational, once-daily, nebulized, long-acting muscarinic antagonist for COPD and other respiratory diseases. TD-4208 has shown positive top-line results in COPD patients in multiple Phase II studies and FDA recently agreed to the design of the Phase III program, which is anticipated to begin this year.","We believe TD-4208 has the potential to be the only FDA-approved once-daily, single-agent nebulized product for COPD and it may offer longer-term opportunities for combination with other nebulized products. In addition, the patent portfolio for TD-4208 is currently expected to provide exclusivity in the U.S. until at least 2025, which doesn't include any potential patent term extensions.","In addition to the geographic and portfolio expansion, we continue to make significant progress across all of our other key growth drivers. Continuing with respiratory, we are further developing our presence in this space both through external activities such as Theravance and internal development programs.","Our Phase III clinical trials for generic Advair are progressing well and we anticipate filing our application with FDA at the end of this year. We continue to believe that Mylan will be the first to bring to market an AB-rated substitutable generic form of Advair in the U.S.","We're in the process of giving final shape to our manufacturing in order to be positioned to handle the appropriate capacity upon launch. We also anticipate two European respiratory launches in 2015, generic Seretide MDI and generic Flixotide MDI.","With regards to complex products, we continue to advance our insulin analog program; we commenced two Phase III trials for Glargine, which are progressing well. We continue to pursue the opportunity to have one of the first interchangeable insulin analogs to Lantus. We also have made significant progress in terms of manufacturing readiness.","On the Copaxone front, as we told you last quarter, we have responded to all FDA requests to date in terms of our ANDA and we remain confident that we're well positioned to receive approval for our application and be in a position to launch at market formation.","On the legal front, the U.S. Supreme Court's decision did not address the invalidity of the last remaining patent and we believe that the prior invalidity ruling will be confirmed by the Federal Circuit. We are pleased with the Federal Circuit's accelerated briefing schedule. From a guidance perspective, we are taking a conservative approach and assuming launch in the second half of 2015.","We also continue to advance our biosimilars program. We strategically selected our portfolio with a primary focus on monoclonal antibodies. We are aggressively executing on the development of this global pipeline, which currently includes six products. We expect three of these programs to be in Phase III in 2015.","As we have noted before, we expect to launch these products initially in the Europe and Rest of the World markets. As you know, we launched in the world first trastuzumab biosimilar in India in 2014 and we have now submitted this product in 15 more countries. We also continue to expand our injectable business and today we offer a global portfolio of more than 230 injectable products in a broad range of dosage forms.","We continue to take steps to integrate the Agila business and ensure its position as a high quality reliable source of injectables for the long-term. Hence, we are taking all steps necessary to ensure that Mylan's one quality standard is deeply embedded across the Agila's manufacturing sites. While we may continue to have some issues as we implement our remediation efforts, we are confident that a deliberate, thorough approach to ensure a sustainable culture of compliance is the right way to capitalize on our Agila investment.","Turning to our infectious disease growth driver, during the fourth quarter, two of the three largest buyers of antiretrovirals in the world, The Global Fund and the Government of South Africa completed three year tenders and Mylan won a leading share in both cases. Today, we supply more than 40% of ARV volume in developing markets and provide access to high quality ARV treatments to more than five million patients each year.","In addition, we continue to expand our infectious disease business beyond ARVs, signing several agreements with Gilead for the distribution of Hepatitis C treatments. We were recently appointed as exclusive partner for the launch of Sovaldi and Harvoni brands in India and we expanded our non-exclusive rights through Sovaldi and Harvoni in 91 developing countries.","Let me now turn the call over to John, who will walk you through our financial performance in greater detail. Thanks.","John D. Sheehan - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Rajiv, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures and I refer you back to Kris' comments at the beginning of today's call regarding our use of adjusted measures.","Starting on slide 16. As you can see our total revenues for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 experienced double-digit constant currency growth. We are very proud of the commercial performances of each of our businesses and regions in 2014.","Looking at our operating profitability measures, adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2014 was a very strong 54%, up nearly 300 basis points from the same prior-year period. Our adjusted gross margin for the full year was 52%, up approximately 200 basis points from the prior year. Our strong gross margins are primarily the result of new product introductions in North America as well as a positive pricing environment, and the growth in sales of EpiPen Auto-Injector.","Importantly, 2014 represented the sixth consecutive year of gross margin growth that has resulted in our gross margin increasing from the mid-40% range to well over 50%. During 2014, our gross debt outstanding decreased slightly from the prior year and with the purchase of Abbott completed on a debt-free basis, we have ample financial flexibility going into 2015. We continue to benefit from low short-term interest rates as the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was below 4% in 2014.","Additionally, to further enhance our capital structure, during the fourth quarter, we redeemed our 2018 high-yield senior notes by issuing a term loan at substantially lower interest rate and extended our revolving credit facility on enhanced terms.","Turning to slide 17, 2014 continued a six-year period of exceptional growth in our business. As we look forward to 2015, we are very pleased with our consistent double-digit growth in revenues, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted diluted EPS, all of which demonstrate our unwavering commitment to achieving our target and enhancing shareholder value.","With that, I'd like to now discuss our expectations for 2015, which are laid out on slide 18. At the bottom line, we are projecting an increase in our constant currency adjusted diluted EPS guidance of 21% based upon the midpoint of our 2015 guidance range. Our EPS guidance is after absorbing $0.15 per share of FX headwinds on the combined business.","This EPS guidance range is based upon the following income statement line item guidance metrics, all of which are on an adjusted basis with the exception of total revenues. Total revenues are projected to be between $9.6 billion and $10.1 billion, the midpoint of which on a constant currency basis is an increase of 33% from the 2014 total revenues.","Our generics business is expected to generate revenue growth of approximately 40% in 2015, which includes revenues from acquisitions of approximately $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. Specialty revenue is expected to be flat as we've assumed generic competition for EpiPen in the second half of 2015.","With the recently completed Abbott transaction and the pending Famy Care acquisition, we continue to diversify our business, both in terms of our portfolio and geographically. Following completion of these transactions, slightly more than 50% of our revenues will come from North America, about a third will come from Europe, and the balance will come from rest of world.","I'll speak further in a few minutes on the drivers of our year-over-year revenue growth. Gross margins will increase again to be between 53% and 55%, the midpoint of which is approximately 200 basis points higher than 2014.","Drivers of the increase include new product revenues and the strength of our North American generics business as we continue to benefit from an improved product mix. Our gross margins are being further enhanced by the Abbott assets acquired combined with the efficiencies of our global platform.","SG&A will be between 19% and 21% of total revenue, a slight increase from the prior year due to the inclusion of the business acquired from Abbott and R&D will be between 6.5% and 7.5% of total revenue as we continue to invest in our future.","With these guidance metrics, we project adjusted EBITDA of between $2.9 billion and $3.3 billion. Also, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 21%. The midpoint of which is a 500 basis point decline from our adjusted effective tax rate in 2014 of 25%, which is attributable to our enhanced global tax structure and improved competitive positioning from the closing of the Abbott transaction.","Based upon 2015 guidance metrics, for operating cash flow of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion and capital expenditures between $400 million and $500 million, we are projecting adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, with a midpoint of $1.25 billion, a 41% increase from the prior year.","Finally, we are projecting an average diluted share count of between 495 million and 500 million shares utilizing an assumed average full year share price of approximately $60, which includes the impact of the shares issued in conjunction with the Abbott transaction.","As a reminder, under our cash convertible notes, we have approximately 43 million warrants outstanding with the majority of the warrants having a strike price of $30. We have assumed dilution from these warrants to be approximately 20 million to 22 million shares for 2015.","Turning to slide 19, you will see a reminder of some of the key assumptions utilized in the 2015 guidance. Specifically, we've factored in the strength of the U.S. dollar and the expected foreign currency impact for 2015. Included in our earnings release is a table of assumed foreign exchange rates used in developing our 2015 financial guidance. The 2015 guidance includes the contribution from the Abbott EPD business from the date of close as well as the inclusion of Famy Care beginning in the second half of 2015.","Slide 20 provides further details regarding our revenue growth in 2015. We expect the legacy Mylan business to contribute approximately $700 million to $900 million of incremental revenue in 2015. Revenue from new product launches as well as volume growth in our base business will serve to offset single-digit price erosion on our existing products.","In terms of base pricing assumptions in the generic segment, as we traditionally have, we've assumed low single-digit price erosion in North America. Further, we have assumed mid-single-digit price erosion in rest of world and mid-to-high single-digit price erosion in Europe.","We expect revenue from acquisition, principally the established products business we acquired from Abbott to contribute approximately $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion of incremental revenue in 2015. The year-over-year negative impact of foreign currency translation including the impact from the acquired businesses is expected to be approximately $300 million to $400 million due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.","Slide 21 shows a projected bridge between our actual 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $3.56 and the midpoint of our 2015 guidance range of $4.15, an increase of 17%. New product launches and revenue from acquisitions will drive our earnings growth in 2015. We expect our Q1 EPS to be in line with the prior year with each of the following three quarters' EPS being higher than the prior year. We expect the third quarter EPS to, once again, be the strongest quarter in terms of earnings. Our second quarter EPS is expected to be slightly lower than the fourth quarter due to the anticipated timing of new product launches.","Turning to slide 22. At the end of 2014, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was approximately 2.8:1, down considerably from our leverage ratio of 3.5:1 at the end of 2013. With the closing of the Abbott transaction, our balance sheet becomes even stronger as our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio now stands at approximately 2.3:1. We now benefit from a competitive global tax structure that strengthens our financial position and will help to accelerate future growth. We remain committed to our stated M&A parameters and our long-term gross leverage targets at investment grade levels.","To summarize, our fourth quarter provided a very strong finish to 2014 and is a testament to the strength and diversity of Mylan. We look forward to doing more of the same in 2015 and beyond.","That concludes my remarks and I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ronny Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. A couple of them. The first one is on EpiPen. Can you just go into the assumption \u2013 a bit more granularity, are you assuming next generation product coming from you guys in 2015? And what kind of a share and price are you willing to share with us, you're assuming on attrition.","Second question about your European plan, now that you had a little bit more time to look at the Abbott asset, can you just drive a little bit into that business with a bit more granularity? What are the few things you have to execute on in 2015? What products will drive the growth? What countries will drive the growth? How much cost synergy are we looking for? Is there some synergy assumption in there? Just a bit more granularity about how this business will go forward? And frankly, how are you going to report it? That is, how can we, from the outside, track your progress over the next couple of years with this business?","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","Hi Ronny. Well, thank you. So I'll start with EpiPen. As I have stated now for quite a while as expectations around our product innovation and lifecycle, I've tried to maintain and reiterate the fact that we've grown the market in a very unconventional way, around, I think, first the underlying fundamental strength of the brand equity. But what became obvious to us is that there was the lack of awareness and education, and, quite frankly, just the ability to have access to EpiPen was quite low.","So as we did EpiPen4Schools, for instance, to allow undesignated EpiPens in school, and we now are continuing to take that into other public entities, that I've said while it has grown in unconventional ways, we wouldn't be looking at your traditional lifecycle management brand product switches, that we believe that the EpiPen has not only brand equity but as well as the comfort and the ease of use after over 25 years of being on the market.","So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are absolutely continuing to look at product innovation and geographic expansion as well as new formulations. And you will continue to see us come out with some of those things, those features. But as it relates to a brand new product or new device, our EpiPen and the brand equity around it is what will remain our mainstay in the U.S. market.","As far as our assumptions, Ronny, also as we've reiterated, as we continue to diversify ourselves and have many levers to pull on to manage this business, it makes each individual lever that less material. So I think what you should know and take comfort in, especially given our track record, that we've said that we've incorporated the multi-player environment, the competitiveness of that, the reimbursement, the payer reimbursement and how we're seeing that; those dynamics continue to play out as well as an AB-rated in the second half of the year.","So I think we've taken a very balanced conservative approach around our assumptions with EpiPen. I think we think it will continue to be a great product for us into the future, kind of regardless of these near-term dynamics. So that would be on EpiPen.","As far as Abbott, obviously, we had said a couple of things, that from a strategic and complementary perspective it doubled the size of our top 10 markets outside of the U.S. and many of those \u2013 most of those being in Europe. So to be able to take that business now and really leverage both the physician channel as well as the pharmacy channel, we believe, is why in our hands with the enhanced focus and investment behind it, we can do more.","And I think as you look at the portfolios and the complementary nature of where we could enhance from a physician call point and that branded generic model as well as enhance the scale and our breadth of product portfolio to the pharmacy, we are going to be able to continue to leverage that franchise.","And as we get into more granularity just as far as those product opportunities, I would say, again, it's not about a product, it's much more about the therapeutic and the therapeutic areas and the franchise and the breadth of that. If you look across cardiovascular and GI, some of the places that Abbott EPD, their strength has lied, it marries up very well now with the breadth that we can bring on that.","So, look, I think in these coming months, after integration, we'll continue to keep you guys updated as we are successfully integrating the businesses. And as far as the reporting perspective, it will be absorbed in our generic segment throughout our divisions between North America, Europe, and rest of world.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gregg Gilbert, Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. My first one is on generic Advair; I'm sorry if I missed it. But are you still confident that you can receive approval and launch by the end of next year on generic Advair in the U.S.? And then on business development, Heather, how likely do you think is it that a deal in the near to medium term would actually be able to leverage the infrastructure you got from Abbott as opposed to being unrelated to that? Thanks.","Rajiv Malik - President","Regarding generic Advair, Gregg; as I mentioned, that we remain on track to file this ANDA by the end of this year and in the new GDUFA environment, I think, given that time, we expect to launch it after about maybe 12 months to 15 months period of time. That's what's the expectation is.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","And, Gregg, as far as BD; obviously, we've been pretty vocal that Abbott certainly was the right next transaction, not only from a strategic perspective, but because of the significant financial flexibility that would afford us. So I hope you've heard in my voice and will continue that we are actively pursuing very aggressively on opportunities and absolutely anticipate that we could announce another material transaction before the end of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Heather, maybe you can elaborate a little bit on what sort of acquisition that might be, what specific areas. I mean, what do you think \u2013 where are there holes in your portfolio? What \u2013 should we be surprised if you guys try to buy a company like a Salix or are you more looking at opportunities to expand geographically?","And then, secondly, if I could ask just about \u2013 trying to understand your strategy in respiratory. I mean, obviously, respiratory is a very competitive category. We've seen your competitor Actavis get out of the respiratory business, while you're \u2013 it looks like you're doubling down on respiratory. Can you talk about where you see that in terms of the importance of that business? And is the COPD drug that you licensed from Theravance, is that going to require a large sales force or is that something you can bundle with generic Advair? Just trying to understand how it all fits together. Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Sure, Jami, thank you. Look, I'd say as far as targets goes, the good news is given now our scale across the globe there are many, many opportunities to complement it. And what I mean by that, that everything from whether it's enhancing on the specialty side, enhancing on the generic side through geographic expansion as well as other categories or dosage forms we're not in, we've said many times that we're at 12%, 13% market share here in the United States. There is still therapeutic categories. Just as we recently bolstered our injectable to really put us in \u2013 the ability to have a leadership position in injectable.","So I think as you think about these different categories, we have an opportunity to add. And so with that being said, it allows us to kind of be smart and patient as we find that right next transaction for Mylan. So I don't want to hone in on any one area. I want to tell you that we're looking at everything. Actively pursuing, as I said, as you can imagine standing still is not in our DNA, and especially given the environment that we're in today, which is I consider still to be kind of a hyper consolidation activity going on in our sector. So we are truly looking that we could add, we believe, significantly both from a strategic perspective as well as the financial perspective, here in the near term.","As far as respiratory, I'll touch on that and then I'll let Rajiv add to it. But, obviously, we've continued to look at very \u2013 if you think of this in kind of a couple of buckets from a niche perspective, really our enhancement around COPD, our experience, our infrastructure, our relationships in that market, we believe continue to put us, as you know, a great partner in that space. And I think that's something that we will continue to build leadership on.","When you think about whether it's our generic Advair and some of the other opportunities, the franchise, when we acquired it from Pfizer, really gave us the opportunity to take some of these more complex, very difficult-to-manufacture products that have, we believe a high barrier-to-entry to let us participate in those marketplaces.","And as far as our go-to-market strategy, I think that, that continues to evolve. I think from the marketplace here in the U.S. throughout Europe that that continues to evolve. And the good news is given now our scale whether across physician, hospital or retail, we're really going to be able to maximize those products at the time they come to market.","Rajiv Malik - President","In fact I think I can build upon. I think, Jami, you should take it in two buckets for us, one is the COPD, the nebulized space where we have some pretty decent share with the performance and this will complement very well that space, the nebulized space and we will continue to look to further expand this space.","Second is the generic Advair or other slew of products like Seretide, Flixotide, Flovent and we can go on where we continue to add more and more portfolio internally as well as externally like our \u2013 some relationship with ProSonic (40:31) because we believe this is the high barrier, difficult to make, needs considerable investments, not just from the science perspective but also from the manufacturing perspective. And we also believe that with Abbott now, we have sales infrastructure so whether it's a generic or we need to have a hybrid approach or needed approach the physician, we are well positioned across geographies to take this portfolio of respiratory products very successfully.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","So I guess just in conclusion on that point, as you talked about how it all fits together, I think that, hopefully, what you're continuing to see us execute on is continuing to diversify our businesses across both therapeutic categories, dosage forms and geographies into these channels that continue to let us have multiple levers on managing this business and that scale and our product portfolio and really our investment and not only R&D to some of these are complex products as well as commodity products that really truly I think set us apart to have a portfolio as deep and wide as ours goes.","And lastly, our continuing investment in our global supply chain. So, controlling our own destiny, we believe in the environment that we're living in today from a regulatory perspective continues to differentiate us as we are now manufacturing about 80% of what we sell around the globe. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus today on one of your key growth opportunities going forward perhaps in the Hepatitis C partnership with Gilead. And so we understand the prevalence pool is very large in these developing markets, maybe 100 million patients or so. And we also understand you had a very good partnership with Gilead in HIV. So I guess the question is what types of market share have you had in reference to the other companies that had Gilead's HIV licenses, market share versus other guys. And then also what type of cumulative treatment rates have you seen in developing markets with your big antiretroviral sales base?","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","So I'll kick off here and then again I'll let Rajiv, who is obviously very close to this. What I will speak to is our relationship with Gilead is that as you mentioned has been very good through the years. And I think that we've continued to distinguish ourselves as the partner-of-choice as you probably saw them giving us the exclusivity in the India commercial space. So I think that speaks to not only the partnership as you look across all of the markets that we're exporting into with them but their selection of us on an exclusive basis, especially around this Hep C product, both of them.","Rajiv Malik - President","And again, you know, it's a future \u2013 you're asking me question of future, but I can give you a data point from the past that there were several such agreements Gilead had with eight or 10 generic companies on Truvada and Atripla. And Mylan has the one, which has capitalized it to the maximum that we today around those products have a large market share to the tune of 60%, 70%. And that's all our partnership with the Gilead is just beyond signing an agreement, having rights to the market, but working with them to bring the next level of science and the efficiencies into this so that we can provide access to millions of the patients out there. So we are at the end of process focusing on filing this product into all those 91 countries and also continue to assess those market space to be able to give you the answers that you are seeking for.","Operator","Thank you. Our next call is from Douglas Tsao from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, two questions. First, just in terms of the SG&A percent, obviously, you're going to be taking out some of the infrastructure with the Abbott business. But how should we think about that? And I know it's not necessarily a perfect way to think about it, but just as a percentage of sales, do you think that in-time, as you enjoyed that business that we should see some greater leverage there? And then also if you could provide just a little color in terms of how you're seeing your insulin program develop and how you see that marketplace playing out over the next couple of years?","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, Doug. I'll take your first one. Look, I think that when you look at our SG&A right now for 2015, we were primarily focused on business continuity as we're integrating the Abbott businesses. So I absolutely think there is opportunity as we look out into the future, as we look at the combined businesses and what makes the most sense from an infrastructure perspective. And, look, we're also continuing, as I said, investing in everything from EpiPen and some of the other the brand products that we have. So I think you can continue to see us be responsible like I said first and foremost, it was about business continuity this year.","And as far as the insulin program?","Rajiv Malik - President","Yeah. On insulin, I think as an update our Phase III on glargine, two Phase III studies of glargine continue to progress very well. We have also invested heavily with our partner Biocon in Malaysia in preparedness for \u2013 manufacturing preparedness for glargine. At the same time, I think, we are continuing to focus on interchangeable, bringing the interchangeable product ahead of every other player in USA and we see this as a very exciting opportunity.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Louise Chen from Guggenheim. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Louise A. Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is on Copaxone. Just curious what gives you confidence in the approval in 2015 and what type of share you expect to take from both regular Copaxone and the 3TW. And then secondly, on Famy Care, just curious if you could give us more color behind some of the metrics that you've mentioned earlier, maybe sales growth would be helpful and also some of the gross margin, operating margin. Thank you.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank, Louise. So I'll start with Copaxone. Look, I would say, our confidence level is around again are our continued, our interaction with the FDA, us believing that there is nothing left for us to do on our end. We've submitted and answered all the open questions that we have with the FDA and feel that that therein lies our confidence with action, regulatory action to be taken this year.","And as far as, I guess I'll comment kind of collectively on share, whether it's Copaxone or Famy Care. You know, look, given the size of our businesses now, we again aren't getting down into product individual opportunities or the kind of market share. Obviously, our guidance is significant and we give that range to as we continue to look at the risks and opportunities and the volatility around this business across the geographies and everything that we take into consideration. And I think our track record in really trying to guide appropriately that we've taken those things into consideration and don't break out product-by-product or any of these bolt-on type of acquisitions that we've made to enhance our product portfolio.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. So I have a couple of questions. I guess first, with respect to your assumption for EpiPen, obviously, Mylan has a lot of experience in launching AB-rated generics. Maybe you could just talk about what the typical impact is on the brand in terms of price and volume when an AB-rated generic launches. That's my first question.","Second, with respect to ex-U.S. pricing, obviously, there is \u2013 continues to be price pressure ex-U.S., could you just talk about the outlook for pricing in Europe and Rest of World in 2015? And then finally, two product opportunities, on Lidoderm, I didn't quite catch exactly what your expectation is there in terms of launch timing. And then on glargine, could you just walk through the Phase III conclusion timing, the estimate of concluding Phase III for glargine? Thank you.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","Wow, at least somebody didn't disappoint us in getting four questions or five questions into the queue. So I'll, David, try to hit you, hit each one of them. So EpiPen, we have stated, I don't \u2013 I think that EpiPen is a very atypical product. And I believe a couple of things, not only just from a brand equity perspective, but as we've mentioned, the comfort and the familiarity of the use of that product in a life \u2013 potentially in a life-threatening situation. And we believe that that's what puts a very high barrier bar to an AB-rated in the first place.","But if an AB-rated were to get approved, we also believe you would not see the typical conversion that you do around an oral solid product. And with that being said, we've even seen oral solid products as you may know, whether it's a levothyroxine or a Dilantin, there are some products out there that people feel very secure about the product that they're on and resist changing them for \u2013 whether it's neurotherapeutic.","So as you can imagine, none of those fall into the category of having seconds count when you could be in a potentially life-threatening situation. So we believe patient's familiarity, use and comfort with the product now that's been in the market for over 25 years, that there would not be a typical generic curve. But like I said, with that being said, we have taken the conservative approach and modeled AV competition in, but like I said, I think EpiPen will be a very important brand for us for many years to come.","As far as ex-U.S. pricing goes, especially around in Europe, this year, this past year, we continued to see volume be able to overcome the price erosion that we did see, which is as we still saw growth in that region despite the price erosion. And we have factored in middle single-digit erosion going forward. So with that being said, we're still seeing \u2013 anticipating double-digit growth across all of our generic business segments next year.","As far as Lidoderm is concerned, look, I put my crystal ball away last year because I would have said we absolutely were in a ready position to have that approval. As you know there has been a lot with GDUFA and the FDA's restructuring and there has been some very important first product, market formation products that haven't been approved yet. And we consider Lidoderm to be one that's important. We certainly believe that, hope to get an approval here soon. But with that being said it's really kind of immaterial to any particular contribution because we've again anticipated and absorbed all of that in the range that we've given for 2015.","And I think on Lantus \u2013 I'm sorry, I forget the last one on Lantus. David if you could repeat? Yeah, do you have that?","Rajiv Malik - President","Yeah, it was both I think the completion of the Lantus study. And David, we have two studies going on, one on the type 1 which is a 52-week treatment and second on the type 2 which is 24-week treatment. And these studies will be finishing, the top line data will be available by the second half of 2016.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Christopher Thomas Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much, had a couple here. Maybe first, just looking out, if we look out, let's say, three years to five years for Mylan, is the company a much more brand-focused organization than it is today, looking longer term, or do you see relatively equal opportunities to grow and acquire in the generic franchise relative to brands?","And then second question was just thoughts on Pfizer's acquisition of Hospira and how that factors into your view of the injectable markets and how that market evolves for Mylan as we look out the next few years? Thanks very much.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thank you, Chris. Look, Chris, I wouldn't try to put us in a box of brand, generic. What I would say is that we continue to expand and diversify ourselves to be a healthcare provider. And I think that spans across everything from the physician, the retail, the hospital. And when I think about our ability to take a very broad portfolio and whether it's, as we're interfacing with a much more consolidated customer base on, from a global perspective, the GPOs, I think that it's this breadth across our portfolio that really is continuing to put us in a differentiated category.","So as we look at opportunities, I'm not saying we're more branded focused, we're more generic focused, we're more OTC focused. What I can say is that we continue to look at ways that we can mean the most to our customer, that gives us that diversification across geographies as well as across products. And like I said, just allows us to continue to deliver on our mission of wanting to reach 7 billion people. So I think just to underscore that there is many, many assets out there available that will let us accomplish this in many different ways.","As far as Pfizer and Hospira goes, look, I think that consolidation always lends itself to opportunity. And I think going back to when, whether from Bioniche and then when we added Agila, we said that we believe that put us in an opportunity to really leapfrog to a leadership position in the injectable space. And I think we continue to have a great opportunity to do so.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Heather, can you give us a flavor for some of the key countries in Europe and how you did? And then can you also talk about the breakdown in Asia, just kind of the key franchises and how you did in the quarter and for the year? Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So, look, I think obviously as you know, as France goes, goes Europe for us in the Mylan legacy world. And so I think we have maintained a leadership position. I think we have been quite \u2013 we're operating obviously in a highly competitive marketplace over there. But we have continued to see actually regaining of some market share. We've been doing some direct advertising as well as building that Mylan brand and that Mylan equity. And I think we've seen great growth when I look at Italy and some of the other substitution countries. What I think now married up with Abbott, what this provides us is to take their strength. And about eight of these top markets in Europe, whether it's Germany, UK, some of the Central Eastern Europe, and really allow us to now bring this critical math across all of Europe.","So while, like I said I'm excited with our growth in Europe last year on a legacy basis, I'm more excited about what I think the Abbott and Mylan business can now do together and the kind of growth that we're going to see in Europe. As far as the rest of Asia, Asia grew double digits in 2014 led again by India and our emerging markets, our HIV franchise, the ARVs continues to grow at an accelerated double-digit rate. And lastly Australia and Japan continue to be very well and meet our expectations.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question will come from Sumant Kulkarni from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is a clarification. If AB-rated competition on EpiPen does not appear, will the upper end of the range still hold all else equal? And secondly on Biologics and the HIV and HCV franchises, there could be potentially lots of patients ex-U.S., and it could be a growing market. But could you give us any quantitative or qualitative color on how profitable those business businesses could be?","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So let me first start, as I said earlier we gave a range for a reason. There is a lot of \u2013 there is many moving pieces and parts to this business globally as far as all the range is considered. So, look, I can't answer a hypothetical as an AB doesn't come, but 16 other things do. A lot of things factor into that range that we've given. So I can't take one individual aspect of that with EpiPen and give you an answer. What I can say is that again I think we've been responsible in guiding you to the midpoint of our range and what we think that the opportunities or challenges that lie ahead.","And as far as given you any further breakout around these franchises, we've really don't get into like I said product profitability or margins around these products. I think you've got a look at the overall health of our franchise and the results we just reported and the guidance we've given you now going forward as an overall indicator. And, obviously, we've shown tremendous growth on those segments and gross margins.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Rajiv Malik - President","With that operator and everybody, we appreciate your support and interest.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kris King, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Kris King - Mylan NV","Thank you, Crystal. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Mylan's conference call discussing our second quarter 2016 earnings and our acquisition of Meda AB, which I will refer to as the Meda transaction. Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President Rajiv Malik; Chief Financial Officer Ken Parks; and Chief Commercial Officer Tony Mauro.","During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook and 2016 guidance, the Meda transaction, the acquisition of Renaissance's non-sterile topicals-focused Specialty and Generics business, and other matters related to the company and its business, including regulatory matters, product development, and acquisitions. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from today's projections. Please refer to the earnings release we filed with the SEC on Form 8-K earlier this afternoon for a fuller explanation of those risks and uncertainties as well as the limits applicable to these forward-looking statements.","In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share, constant currency total revenues, adjusted gross margin, adjusted cash provided by operating activities, net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, adjusted R&D expense, and adjusted SG&A expense, and are presented in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measures as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to those GAAP measures are available in either our first or second quarter earnings releases, which are posted on our website at newsroom.mylan.com.","Let me also remind you that the information discussed on the call with the exception of the participant questions is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's expressed written permission. An archived copy of today's call will be available on our website and will remain available for a limited time.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Heather.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Thanks, Kris, and welcome, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us today.","I'd also like to take a moment to welcome Ken Parks, who joined Mylan as CFO on June 6 and is here today for his first earnings call with us. In addition, I'd like to welcome to the call all of our employees around the world, including the most recent additions to our family, the great team we acquired on June 15 from Renaissance, and on Friday the terrific team at Meda. We're excited about both of these transactions, with the Renaissance business bringing us a complementary portfolio of about 25 branded and generic topical products, which combined with Meda's offerings positions us to be a leader in dermatology.","The Meda transaction will allow us to build even greater scale across our operations and expand the breadth and diversity of our product portfolio, geographies, and sales channels around the world. Meda also positions us to be a leader in the global respiratory and allergy market. In addition, these transactions further strengthen our already very strong cash flows.","As with any transaction, we believe people are the most important asset, and we're delighted with how engaged the teams of both organizations are as we now focus on fully integrating these organizations, so that we can increasingly go to market as One Mylan and maximize the potential of our expanded global platform.","With that, I'd like to elaborate a bit on the commentary I provided during our call in May, namely, that we believe that the rebasing of our sector has been a healthy exercise for the industry. It has helped investors draw more meaningful distinctions among the different types of business models in our sector because, as we have mentioned many times in the past, it simply makes no sense to paint the industry with a broad one size fits all brush, particularly when it comes to generics and specialty, which vary widely in terms of product and geography mix.","In Mylan's case, we have spent the last decade differentiating, diversifying, and derisking by expanding through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. As a result, we now have extensive manufacturing operations, whose technologies range from API to oral solids, to injectables, transdermals, and respiratory expertise. We have a portfolio that now stands at more than 2,700 separate products, including generics, branded generics, brands, and over-the-counter medicines.","We also have positioned ourselves such that we have no significant concentration in any single product, channel, or business segment. Moreover, we have continued to grow scale throughout North America, Europe, and rest of world. All of this has enhanced our financial strength and flexibility, positioning us to continue investing and growing for many years to come.","It's for these reasons we're so proud of our performance during second quarter. On the top line, we generated total revenues of more than $2.5 billion, year over year an increase of 8% on a constant currency basis, that was fueled by solid growth in our North America and Europe generics regions and strong double-digit growth in our Specialty business. On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $592 million or $1.16 per adjusted diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 28%.","I'd also like to underscore that on a sequential basis, our revenues rose by 17%. Adjusted EPS increased by 52%, and cash flows increased 240% on the strength across all geographies, all of our business units, including new launches, demonstrating the power of us truly maximizing all of our assets.","Consistent with our historic track record of delivering stronger growth in the second half and on the strength of new product launches, EpiPen seasonality, and our recently completed acquisitions, we are committed to our 2016 EPS guidance range of $4.85 to $5.15.","As I've indicated, we could not be more excited about Mylan's longer-term prospects and look forward to discussing our bright future at our Investor Day event, which we will host in conjunction with third quarter earnings. On behalf of Mylan's board and our entire leadership team, I'd like to thank our employees for their outstanding teamwork and execution during the quarter and for their continued commitment to our cause.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Thank you, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone.","We continued to see solid performance across our businesses during the second quarter, once again demonstrating that the scale and diversity we have created provides us with the strength, consistency, and resilience to ever-evolving market conditions, further differentiating us from our competitors.","We launched more than 100 new products across our global platforms. And with Meda, we now sell approximately 2,700 products around the world. Overall, our Generics business delivered third-party net sales of approximately $2.1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 4% compared to the prior-year quarter.","In North America, our generics business grew approximately 6% to just over $1 billion. Growth came primarily from a significant number of new product introductions, leveraging our strong global platform. We launched 18 new products during this quarter.","The generic pricing environment was again consistent with our expectations and guidance to you. Tony will elaborate on this topic shortly.","In Europe, sales totaled $604 million, an increase of approximately 6% over the prior-year period. This result was mainly due to sales of new products and higher volume on existing products, as we continued to benefit from integrated approach of selling our established product assets under One Mylan. Pricing was essentially flat in the second quarter because of our diversified product portfolio.","In rest of the world, sales totaled $523 million, a year-over-year decrease of approximately 2%. Our operations in India improved throughout the quarter, as we saw HIV tender volumes return towards our expected levels, resulting in growth of more than 30% on sequential business compared to Q1. Additionally, Japan, Australia, and the rest of the emerging markets showed favorable sales on existing products. With that said, we continue to remain confident in the strength of these businesses.","Our Specialty division delivered revenue of $403 million in the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 33%, as a result of higher sales of EpiPen, Perforomist, and ULTIVA. Tony will provide more details on this.","Our global platform has been further strengthened and diversified by the growth of our global established brand and branded generics business, as these key brands continue to perform at or above our expectations. These established brands and branded business will be even further enhanced by the addition of the Meda brands.","Meda's attractive portfolio is just one of the reasons why I share Heather's excitement about the recent completion of the transaction. The addition of Meda strengthens our position in several therapeutic franchises, significantly expands our over-the-counter business, and accelerates our expansion in several attractive emerging markets, which will help us further maximize our efficient, high-quality operating platforms and a broad product portfolio.","During this quarter, we also completed our acquisition of the Renaissance topicals business. By bringing together the Renaissance business with Mylan's and Meda's strong dermatology portfolio, we are confident that we will be able to drive significant growth from this franchise, especially by taking the combined portfolio and pipeline into the new markets outside of North America.","We are looking forward to now moving from pre-integration planning to truly integrating these businesses into the Mylan family. We are very excited, as we'll be moving into integration phase along with the key leaders retained from Meda and Renaissance leadership. While we remain focused on business continuity, we also are very excited and upbeat to realize the potential and value of bringing together the best of these organizations and our combined efforts.","We also continue to execute on our strategic growth drivers, and let me highlight a few of the developments during the quarter. Turning first to our biosimilars portfolio, we are pleased to report that we remain on track to file trastuzumab, pegfilgrastim, and glargine to U.S. FDA and European Medical Agency in 2016.","Our 24-week data from our HERITAGE study for our biosimilar trastuzumab confirmed the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of our product being developed in partnership with Biocon. This study was presented at the ASCO meeting in June. And we are now expecting to present our results for the 48-week extension of the HERITAGE study at the important European Society for Medical Oncology [ESMO] Congress in October.","Recently, the European Medicines Agency has also accepted for review Mylan's Marketing Authorization Application for our proposed biosimilar pegfilgrastim, also being developed with Biocon. In addition to analytical, functional, and preclinical data, the application also includes clinical data from pivotal PK\/PD and confirmatory efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity studies completed earlier this year. The results from the studies are also expected to be presented at ESMO in October.","In addition to this, we continue to make progress on our other programs and we'll continue to provide further updates as our filings are accepted. As a reminder, with our Biocon partnership and Momenta collaboration, we have access to a combined portfolio of 15 biosimilar and insulin analog generic products in development. This is one of the industry's most robust and diverse portfolios.","As we continue to invest in this important global area, we are continuing to differentiate the structure of our partnerships. For instance, with Momenta, we have a great deal of product-by-product optionality.","On the respiratory front, our partner Theravance Biopharma announced that enrollment of more than 2,300 patients has been completed in the three ongoing clinical trials comprising Phase 3 programs for revefenacin, an investigational LAMA in development for the treatment of COPD. The replicate efficacy studies are expected to be read out in early fourth quarter of this year, to be followed by a 12-month long-term safety study and plan for an ANDA filing in 2017. Regarding generic Advair, we remain confident in our application, as we continue to be actively engaged with FDA towards the execution of this very important ANDA.","Finally, I also would like to thank our committed and talented global workforce for their significant contributions to our business and mission during this quarter.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on the commercial landscape.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan N.V.","Thank you, Rajiv.","As Rajiv noted, we continued to see strong growth in our global Generics business, including in the U.S., where the pricing environment continues to be a topic of much focus. Let me reiterate that we continue to see pricing across our very broad product portfolio to be in line with our expectations, demonstrating the importance of scale and diversity.","For example, during the first six months, both our global generics business and specifically our North American core generics business saw year-over-year price erosion in the mid-single digits. Given the continued strength of this core business, we continue to anticipate price erosion in the mid-single digits for the remainder of the year.","Our North American generic business also benefited from a large number of new product launches, including the first-to-market launches of armodafinil, doxycycline 50mg, and doxycycline 200mg, representing a combined IMS total market value of $650 million. Our Specialty business also saw double-digit growth across all our major brands.","With respect to EpiPen, revenues were driven by net price favorability, due in part to payer pricing dynamics year over year, as well as strong sales volumes in anticipation of the peak season. We began realizing the benefits of customer contract negotiations over the last several quarters. I'd note that year-over-year comps will continue to evolve until we pass the one-year mark of the Auvi-Q recall.","I want to stress that we continue to invest in expanding the size of the overall market by increasing awareness and access to this important product. We also continue to educate stakeholders about the complex supply chain dynamics as a greater share of costs are being shifted from employers to patients.","Finally, I would like to echo Heather's and Rajiv's enthusiasm for the completion of the Meda transaction. Commercially, we see significant opportunity to maximize our robust product portfolio, which now covers an even more diverse array of Rx, Gx, and OTC products across customer channels and geographies. We see many opportunities to do more with these products across the Mylan platform as we optimize our sales force, bring new products into new countries, and maximize high-potential brands.","We also continue to be uniquely positioned to reliably supply our growing global customers' increasing demands. EpiPen is just one example of where we can do more by consolidating our expertise across Mylan and Meda.","With that, I will turn the call over to Ken.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start out by saying that I'm extremely pleased to be a part of this call and a part of the Mylan team. I'll now turn to our financial results.","Second quarter revenues grew to $2.6 billion, and that's an increase of 8% over the second quarter last year. As Rajiv already noted, our Generics segment grew 4% and our Specialty segment grew 33%. The generics pricing environment was consistent with our expectations and declined at a mid-single-digit rate overall in the quarter.","While foreign currency movements were volatile following the outcome of the Brexit vote in late June, the year-over-year impact of currency translation on our second quarter result revenues was insignificant due to the diversity of our portfolio of businesses across all geographies.","As Heather noted, second quarter revenues increased 17% sequentially, with growth in both of our segments and all three geographies.","Adjusted gross margins for the second quarter were 56%. That's up approximately 200 basis points from the prior year and the prior quarter as a result of the new product introductions and favorable Specialty sales.","Moving on to operating expenses, on an adjusted basis, R&D expense increased slightly over the prior year, as we continued to invest in our respiratory, insulin, and biologics programs. As a percentage of revenue, second quarter R&D declined by approximately 50 basis points from the prior year to 6.6% of total revenues. SG&A expense, also on an adjusted basis, remained essentially unchanged at approximately 21% of total revenues in the second quarter.","As a result of our strong operating performance, adjusted net earnings increased by $118 million from the prior-year quarter to reach $592 million, and adjusted diluted EPS increased 28% to $1.16 compared to $0.91 in the prior year. I will also point out that adjusted diluted EPS grew 52% sequentially from the first quarter of this year.","For the six months ended June 30, total revenues grew to $4.8 billion. That's a year-over-year increase of 13% on a constant currency basis, and includes an additional two months of sales from our established products business.","Adjusted gross margins for the six months ended June 30 were 55%, or up approximately 100 basis points from the prior-year period. Adjusted R&D and adjusted SG&A expense were approximately 7.5% and 22% of total revenues respectively for the year-to-date period. As a result, adjusted earnings for the six months ended June 30 increased by $195 million to reach $979 million, and adjusted diluted EPS therefore increased 19% to $1.92.","Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics, adjusted cash provided by operating activities was strong at $485 million for the quarter, which drove the first half adjusted operating cash flow to reach $687 million. The strong performance in the quarter reflects improvements in our operating results combined with our continued focus on effectively managing working capital.","During the second quarter of 2016, we issued $6.5 billion of senior notes in anticipation of the completion of the Meda offer and repaid $500 million of senior notes which became due in June 2016. We have no amounts outstanding on our accounts receivable securitization or our revolving credit facilities.","At the end of Q2, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 2.2 times. We remain fully committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating and reducing our leverage subsequent to the closing of the Meda transaction.","Looking ahead, we feel confident with our ability to continue to leverage our outstanding global operating platform, which now includes the recent acquisitions of both Renaissance and Meda. And we're committed to our 2016 outlook of adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $4.85 to $5.15.","In terms of phasing of our earnings for the remainder of 2016, Q3 will again be our strongest quarter and slightly higher than Q4.","With that, we'll open the call up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much, just two questions for you guys. First on the U.S. generic environment, and thanks for all the color on the call, is there any concern on your part that some of the weakness that your smaller competitors are experiencing results in more aggressive and less rational behavior from those companies, and that could ultimately impact your franchise if the market gets a little bit destabilized by that dynamic?","The second question is between the very strong EpiPen trends you're seeing right now and the earlier than expected Meda close, it seems like there could be upside to the guidance range. Are there any offsets we should thinking about, or are you just being either cautious or conservative now in terms of the range? Thanks very much.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Hi, Chris. Thanks. So I'll start on the U.S. generics, and then if Tony and Rajiv want to add anything. I guess from my perspective, as we've continued the dialogue around the diversifying and the differentiation in product mix and the breadth of portfolio, certainly as you look at some of the smaller players, I think weaknesses from the niche products as well as perhaps how they were playing their business and positioning it.","And I think that the other thing you have to take into consideration is balancing that, to your point about does it drive more irrationality, is our customers that are continuing to get more global and their demands and needs are getting far greater. And I know Tony touched on this in his remarks, but I really think that shouldn't be underestimated. The need for reliable supply is continuing to I think again be a differentiator for Mylan and our ability to meet these global needs in a very reliable, as we've touted before, through sheer hard work that has been put together this last decade is a supply chain that we believe is second to none. And I think you see some value, continued value being placed on that by our customers.","So I can't speak \u2013 as we've always said, our business is going to be competitive. It always has been; it always will be. But I don't sense I would say that hyper-competitiveness that we've seen, say, five years ago when our customers were much more willing to change just based on price and not necessarily be focused on if that company could actually supply their needs. So I think it continues to shift towards being a not only a differentiator for us, but a real value driver and growth driver for us, which is why we have the confidence around the stability in the market.","As far as EpiPen goes, Chris, here is what I'd say. You've heard me say this a thousand times. All good things don't happen at once; all bad things don't happen at once. When you're looking at the complexity of our company globally, across geographies, across channels, across products, we believe that when we came out with our guidance this year, we anticipated obviously the Meda transaction. We anticipated a lot of probability waiting on launches and so forth.","And with all that being said, I think when you look at our guidance ranges being within 3% each way of the midpoint that we believe that's a very tight range, and we believe it's taken a lot in consideration. And we've always said when we feel that we should update or move that guidance, we're the first to come and do that to the market. But we believe right now that it is absolutely taking a lot into consideration given all of the moving pieces across our platform.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good afternoon and congratulations on the quarter, two questions if I can. The first one is this issue of the EpiPen cost shift to the patients you've mentioned. Could you just discuss a little bit more about that? How does that get reflected in your earnings? And what are you currently doing in terms of your business operations to try to help the patients along; that is, do you have confidence that that issue will not begin to impact your earnings in the next few quarters?","And then second, I guess for Rajiv, on Advair, I remember the GPhA, the people presenting from FDA mentioned that only 12% of end application gets approved first round. I know Advair is very important to you, but you can just give us a feel for what makes you confident that you can get such a complex product approved first round given the rate of approval at FDA at first round.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","All right. Thanks, Ronny. I'll start on EpiPen and then hand it over to Rajiv. So, Ronny, I love the opportunity to clarify this point around insurance and the changing dynamic in the payer landscape. It really is not \u2013 the point is not being made from our earnings perspective or what we see with EpiPen. I will continue to say that we couldn't be more proud of our investment to expand and increase access and continue to see EpiPen as an important product to the community, and as again Tony mentioned, our opportunity to even enhance that throughout Europe now with the Meda transaction.","But this point, I think there has been a lot of discussion and some headlines around patients going from paying a copay to now paying the entire cost of a product. And where EpiPen falls, because if you look on an annual basis, as a life-saving drug, to have a WAC [Wholesaler Acquisition Cost] price at just under $600, I think that you can see it falls as not an expensive product.","And so when employers through high-deductible plans that were incentivized to increase high-deductible plans through Obamacare, as people \u2013 as employers shift more cost to employees and make that everything's got to come out of pocket before you hit your deductible is where you're seeing a lot of noise around EpiPen.","And so from our perspective, we're continuing to try to do our part on educating on that supply chain, and we all know it's complex and our healthcare and insurance is complicated. But we are just continuing to try to do our part, messaging and continuing to do everything we can to ensure patients have access to our product. And so that really is the point on the insurance, not at all from what we're projecting from a business perspective around EpiPen.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","And regarding Advair, generic Advair, Ronny, our confidence comes from two data points. One, we have been seeing generic Advair as being unique in a way just given the FDA's engagement, not just after the filing but before filing, the number of interactions, agreement on protocols, agreement on what their expectations are. All this has been built into the science, number one.","And number two, you will see that over the last five months, we have seen a huge movement about the execution of this file, just to let you give an appreciation about various PAIs, Pre-Approval Inspections, which is around device or drug substance or access to drug product, is all behind us. Our confidence again comes back from how we see the file being executed as until date. So we are I think very confident about that maybe we'll be able to improve the FDA's percentage of first-round approvals.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, just a couple of questions. First, Heather, I think we've talked about this before. I think you have $1 billion or so authorized for share buyback. And when you announced the Meda deal earlier this year, you had to suspend the buyback because of the pending deal. Now that the deal is closed and if you still believe in your $6.00 number next year, the stock does look pretty cheap. Should we expect that you implement that buyback?","And secondly, just a question around the IPL process, which we will hear about in the next couple weeks, you guys still don't have Copaxone 20mg on the market. I'm just wondering if you can share with us your expectations for what the market opportunity might look like for you for Copaxone 40mg? When do you plan to launch? And without Copaxone 20mg on the market, what does that say about your confidence level with Copaxone 40mg? Thanks very much.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Thank you, Jami. As far as the buyback goes, first let me start with this. As you know, we are constantly looking at our capital allocation, and absolutely the share buyback is an option as to how we, being part of the mix, we absolutely \u2013 it\u2019s back on the table as an option that we have, just as we\u2019re looking at many other ways. I can tell you, though, our priority is really to delever. It is about really making sure we\u2019re balancing all of that. But it is absolutely back on the table as an option.","And as far as the $6.00, I guess I just want to because sometimes you guys throw these little flippers in there. What we\u2019ve committed to is $6.00 in \u201818. What we\u2019ve said since announcing the Meda transaction is we have the opportunity to hit that earlier. But what we are absolutely committed to is the $6.00 in \u201818.","And as far as IPR, I'll speak to the confidence, and then Rajiv, anything you want to add \u2013 or Tony on the market opportunity. We couldn't be more confident in the IPR, the process and where we stand in that, and are anxiously awaiting the results of that next week. And I would just remind on our confidence to get the product approved, look, the reality is that the transformation that FDA has gone through and is going through over these last couple of years with GDUFA, there have been casualties to that and there have been casualties in the backlog and how they're being able to handle them as they move towards GDUFA goal dates. Obviously, Copaxone fell prior to getting a GDUFA goal date like our generic Advair. So all I can say is speaking on the science and speaking to our application on both the 20mg and 40mg that we absolutely have all the confidence in the world of getting it. But as you know, I've said I'll love the fact when we're not talking about when we're going to get Copaxone approval.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Heather, I will just add that we appreciate it's been a painstakingly long process with FDA, but we just have a very minor clarification from FDA we received recently which has been responded to. And there's nothing as scientifically pending at all and we are waiting to hear from FDA about the next steps. So that's where I would say we are pretty confident of bringing this product in the market as soon as possible and hopefully in 2016.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","And we think the opportunity is still significant. It's a big product, and we still believe that it's going to be \u2013 it will be a good product for us.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan N.V.","Maybe just to add, it's not very often in the generic marketplace we get to launch a multibillion dollar product into a limited marketplace, and I certainly think that Copaxone is one of those opportunities. So we, as Heather and Rajiv articulated, truly look forward to bringing this product to market.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please check that your line is not on mute. Thank you, and we'll move on to our next question from Sumant Kulkarni from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my questions. First one, could you comment on the price versus volume component of your Specialty Branded segment? And second, given the exceptional that you've had in that Specialty Brand segment that has helped your gross margins, could you comment on the trends within the generic gross margins and how sustainable those might be going forward?","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","So let me start, Sumant, and then again I'll let others chime in. As far as the mix goes and I think what we tried to articulate especially on the Specialty side is that it's a combination of certainly we've seen nice growth in volume. Yes, part of that has been to the pricing dynamic, but I think more of note is this idea of the net price. And what Tony spoke about is that our realizing these renegotiated contracts, which we've now said starting at the end of last year, that those wouldn't happen overnight. But as we've continued to renegotiate, and as we've said, it's not just about one product, it's a whole portfolio of products, we've been able to continue to see that increase. And so again, I think as far as us realizing those margins are sustainable as we work ourselves through these contracts. And if the dynamic around the EpiPen market would ever change, those would change as well. But I think what we're continuing to benefit now is the realization of those. And I think as far as generic...","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","I would say \u2013 Tony, you can add, that we are holding pretty well the volumes. We see the volumes pretty flat, and we have guided you to mid-single-digits erosion over the year, and we are seeing nothing else than the middle single digits, and that's what we are forecasting for the rest of the year.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan N.V.","Yes, thanks, Rajiv. And I would say I know there has been a lot of short-term focus specifically, whether on U.S. generic pricing or U.S. generic margin stability. And what I would say is over the last decade we have built our portfolio for the long term, to value-create. And I would say stability and predictability are direct results of diversity and differentiation. And you're seeing that today and as we report it the rest of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Elliot Wilbur from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, good afternoon. Heather, just going back to the Meda transaction real quickly, you had earlier I guess suggested that in fact that you're still on track or for $6.00 in '18 and can pull that forward in 2017. But specifically, I think you guys had talked about $0.35 to $0.40 EPS accretion in 2017. And obviously, given the earlier than expected close, this will mean that you're still comfortable with that metric, but I just want to confirm that.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","So I guess I'd say first marginally a little earlier. We had said Q3. But I think importantly, Elliott, to your point, I, look, could not be obviously more confident in hitting the $6.00. I think that we look forward to the opportunity to bring that up. I can't wait to get to Investor Day that we now announced to be part of Q3 because I think our opportunity to really showcase these assets that we've pulled together from Abbott to Famy Care to Renaissance to Meda is really going to showcase this platform and our ability to really maximize these assets. So I don't want anything to take that away, and I can tell you we are very, very focused on the opportunity and how we pull that forward.","So there is \u2013 like I said, I hope you can hear the inflection in my voice that there is nothing that we're more focused on. And yes, I think we're still on track. There's nothing that has changed that would change the accretion number that we talked about. And again, I think the Q3, once we have a couple months under our belt and we're able to come forward with our long-term vision and roadmap and ability to execute against that, hopefully our track record speaks for itself. Again, we're going to be able to show you how we're able to do more with these assets coming together than they were doing on an individual basis.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Douglas Tsao from Barclays. Your line is open.","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe if you could, start with the generics business in rest of world was below what I was looking for in my model. I was just wondering if you could provide some perspective in terms of what might have happened during the quarter. And then just on EpiPen, if you could, provide some detail in terms of what your sense is in terms of inventory in the channel right now because that number looks very strong. Or do you think that reflected true end demand for the quarter? Thank you.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Doug, let me respond to the rest of the world business. If you recall, in the first quarter we have seen (41:45) for the HIV tenders because the global fund and Chemonics, which is a new agency managing the tenders, has not located, and it took them time for that machine to warm up. And we started seeing an influx of tenders towards the middle of May. So we have seen sequential growth of 30% on this business. Everything is now back on the expected levels which we were expecting. So nothing is inherently weak with that business. In fact, we are very excited by the volumes being back. So that what has resulted into 2% year-over-year decline of this overall business.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","And as far as EpiPen goes, Doug, no concerns at all. We see inventory absolutely in the normal range.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, thanks. Heather, going back to the sector rebasing that you highlighted, is that over, or are we entering a cyclical patch that could last several quarters? And then to flip a prior question around, if that is the case, does that create opportunity for you as you look to consolidate the broader space? And the second question is, what is your guys' strategy to break into the U.S. OTC market?","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Randall, as always, you do not disappoint about getting a lot into your questions.","So let me start with the rebasing because I do feel passionately about this being in this industry for as long as I've been. Look, I'm hopeful that the rebasing continues, that this is not memory loss in about a month and hot air starts building back up again. Because I think that what we found ourselves in the generic specialty sector is unsustainable business practices. And I think that it's just that simple. And I think individual companies are now having to, however much affected they may have been by an unsustainable business practice, they're having to regroup, reorganize, and rebase themselves.","My hope is, as I mentioned, that that has driven, I think, forcing a much more thoughtful look at businesses and understanding the mix because all companies aren't created equally. And like I said, I'm hopeful that Wall Street doesn't have short-term memory loss and goes back to trying to paint all with one or trying to support what I don't believe is sustainable long term.","So we believe there has been a lot of short-term focus. We had said you can't build a great company quarter by quarter; it's over the longer term. The last decade we have continued to hopefully show that that has paid off in both the near, mid, and long term. And we look forward to coming back out to you guys on Investor Day and showing you how, one, that the ability for us now to take this significant financial flexibility we have and continue to build and complement this platform we've put in place which we'll, to your point, continue to consolidate, I think those assets the companies need to let go of products, and small nice tuck-ins, like we just did with Renaissance.","And as far as OTC, I'll have to ask you to wait for Q3 because I think we really want to come out in a holistic way, talk about our geographies, these channels, and how truly we believe approaching these markets with a One Mylan approach we're going to be able to do more. So anyway, look forward to that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Finkelstein from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Andrew Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good evening, thanks for taking the question. Could you talk a bit more about the guidance for the year? Can you quantify to any extent what the contribution is from Meda and Renaissance or to the extent, aside from timing, anything in Meda that's changed?","And then as you look across some of the geographies ex-U.S., is there anything you can highlight maybe as a preview of the Investor Day of areas that are first on the to-do list to begin driving those synergies from Meda, whether it's in countries like Italy, or is it bringing products across geographies? Any hints you can give there would be appreciated.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Okay, thank you, Andrew. So I'll start with integration. Look, hopefully by now the fact of our business continuity and our track record would let you realize the fact that we are not only very focused on integration but have a very disciplined approach, that it's not just about bringing a company into the fold. It is truly about integrating businesses, people, best practices. And so as we are now doing that over these acquisitions, most recently Meda, we absolutely, I can assure you, have multiple work streams. As we had reported last quarter, actually our preplanning phase of that allows us to hit that ground running once we hit day one. And I can tell you I'm confident that when we do lay out those plans and those opportunities, they're very robust. They cut across all geographies.","So we're not prioritizing one over the other. The benefit of having great people and bringing their management team into the fold of our management team, we're able to really divide and conquer across the globe, across channels, and across these great brands and especially this new channel of OTC. So we couldn't look more forward to coming in and highlighting all of that. And I guess I don't feel I can give much more of a teaser than that for Investor Day.","As far as guidance is concerned, look, we've got \u2013 when you look at the complexity of not only our business in general and the Generics business, both here in the U.S. but around the globe, that's why as we continue to grow Specialty, grow Brand Generics, grow our brands, grow OTC, it is just for that reason of complexity and volatility that we've said the diversification and differentiation lets us absorb that now. Our scale, our sheer size and scale is able to absorb that volatility and manage this business. And hopefully when I look \u2013 and that's why I said I couldn't be more proud of Q2 that we were able to be right on top of revenue, beat the EPS consensus, and all sequentially because I know many of you that I had discussions with after our last quarter, everybody felt that we were taking such a big leap from Q1 to Q2 that if we could show that this business could perform of what we said it was going to do, that certainly would pave the way for the kind of growth and hopefully market multiple that should respond to that accordingly.","So that's why I highlighted the sequential growth of not only top line 17%, bottom line 52%, and the strength of our cash flows. So like I said, I think that hopefully you're realizing our guidance takes a lot into consideration and our ability to manage to that and perform and deliver. Again, I think this quarter just underscores this management team's ability to do that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I have a couple questions, please. I guess first, with respect to Meda, I'm hoping that you could paint a picture for how you're restructuring the business and what changes you're making to Meda after acquiring it, how you're integrating it, et cetera, and also how you have to change the accounting from IFRS accounting and accounting changes that are going to result there.","And then second, with respect to the second quarter GAAP to non-GAAP, could you just provide some detail on the $174 million in restructuring and special items? I know that you completed Renaissance, and that obviously resulted in additional restructuring charges in the June quarter. But if you could provide some details on the $174 million, that would be great. Thank you.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Sure, David. So look, David, as far as painting a picture, we will paint a very detailed picture. We obviously have owned them now for all of a week. To my point earlier, our planning around just that, the geographies, the products, unfortunately, we could get work streams and people in line. But as you know, the Swedish takeover rules did hinder as far as some of the detail \u2013 of getting into the details.","So I can assure you that over these next couple of months we will be putting the machine that we put in place from an integration office perspective. And I can assure you, like I said, we've retained the management teams, and it is really about us integrating, as I said, best practices. This isn't just come in and do it the way Mylan has done it. We're getting new businesses, new business channels, new products, new brands, that it is about learning from each other, and really that's been our success in the past. I look at the Abbott EPD business. We brought that business in. It was different products than we've been in before. Some different channel. And really bringing that management team and that business in fold, we've been able to show we could do more together than they were doing on an individual basis. And I can assure you, I have all the confidence in the world that Meda will be that same story, and we look forward to coming with that very pretty picture around Q3.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","And, David, on your question around the acquisition-related costs, I'll answer the question. I'll also point out that we filed our 10-Q concurrently with this call, and we have those details in there. But primarily, the biggest chunk of that $174 million of cost is really due to the financing-related acquisition costs around Meda. And we've broken out in there that we did some purchase of Swedish kronor ahead of time. We had an unrealized loss on that due to the movement in the currency over the time period, and also the fees related to the financing and the existing bridge loan facility that we took into place. All of that is broken out in the footnote there, but that is substantially all of the cost.","And on the IFRS accounting side, as you know, we also prepare Mylan's books and records on both U.S. GAAP and an IFRS basis. We started that process last year. We will continue to basically just roll the Meda process into that. So we've already done it through the Mylan accounts, and we'll do it the same way with the Meda accounts.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Fraser from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Gregory D. Fraser - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. It's Greg Fraser on for Gregg Gilbert. I had a quick follow-up on the very robust Specialty sales. You commented on the strong demand growth and the price growth, and the inventories were normal. I just wanted to confirm that there weren't any one-time type items that helped sales in Q2. And maybe you could comment on how you're generally thinking about market penetration and growth potential for EpiPen over the longer term. Thank you.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","No, I'll reiterate. There's nothing out of the norm when we look at our EpiPen business right now. And again, as we stated, we're going to have to continue to evolve until we get one year under our belt from the Auvi-Q recall because obviously how that plays out, especially in Q4, that will continue to evolve.","As far as just the overall strength of EpiPen, I think as we've talked before, the brand equity of EpiPen, the life-saving nature of this important medicine, our continuing to educate and invest in the access to this product, I believe that EpiPen will be a very, very important product for a very long time. With that being said, I think as I said earlier in my remarks, we don't have a significant concentration from any one product or business segment at Mylan today. And as we continue to grow, just as now we're bringing Meda into the fold, EpiPen from a true dollar contribution will just continue to shrink. So again, there's no over-reliance on EpiPen as a brand. But I can tell you that there's every bit of focus on the role EpiPen plays in the lives and saving lives and then getting to as many patients as we possibly can. So that's what I would say about our EpiPen franchise.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, thank you for taking my question. Heather, what was the year-over-year organic growth for the Abbott EPD business? And then what was the organic growth for the Generics business excluding Abbott and excluding any tuck-ins year over year, one?","And then perhaps one for Tony as well. Tony, so on generic Advair, Glaxo on their transcript recently said that they've absorbed a vast chunk of genericization effect through price reduction already on generic Advair. And they're saying the generics no longer have a straightforward \"proposition\". How do you think about that market going into first quarter next year and your PDUFA?","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","So, Umer, we have said, I think I've been pretty consistent on this for years as we bring in acquisitions. I think that as we did with Abbott, for that first year we broke out, so you could continue to see the growth from Mylan and the growth from EPD. But honestly, because of our robust integration processes and bringing these companies together, it's now Mylan legacy. So for me to sit here and try \u2013 that is what our business is. And like I said, Q3 we'll look forward to being able to now highlight Mylan in this platform and now bringing Meda into the mix.","But it would be \u2013 it's just not even possible for us to break it apart that way anymore because we truly are going to market as One Mylan. And we've got strong products, strong brands that's complementing the retail segment, the physician channel, and now the OTC channel. So all I can say is that we continue to see robustness around these products that we've brought in, and we continue to grow them.","And as far as Advair, I can't \u2013 I'll just say that obviously when you have an $8 billion \u2013 $9 billion brand product, we couldn't be more excited to bring the generic to an affordable alternative to market. And again, I think there will be significant barriers to entry just given the complex dynamics. And so I can't \u2013 I think it will be an incredible important product that we'll able to bring to patients.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan N.V.","Maybe just to add, certainly throughout the last 20 years we've seen opportunities when brands came in and tried to be generics and when generics went against other generics. It's a voluminous competition field, we certainly realize that. And I don't think there's anybody based on our breadth of portfolio, based on our relationships with customers in the retail segment, the payer segment; that we're ready for it and we're excited about it and look forward for the opportunity to bring that product to market.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gerberry from Leerink. Your line is open.","Derek C. Archila - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi there, this is Derek on for Jason, just a couple questions. So first, could you provide the contribution from the Renaissance transaction in 2Q, and then just give some color on the growth profile of that business?","And then second on biosimilars, you guys have made some regulatory progress there. What would it take to get you to take a larger stance in that market and maybe own 100% of the economics? Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","So as far as Renaissance goes, no, we don't break out product-level contribution. As I said, we acquired 25 brands and generics and brought them in the fold June 15. And as I said, when you look at that combined with now the Meda assets in derm that we are bringing on board is really going to allow us to be a leader in that space. We think the derm space is a nice niche space. It's one that we didn't have critical mass around before. And again, just like all of our other product lines, bringing that kind of critical mass and combined with the critical mass we have around all these other therapeutic franchises, we're again just able to leverage them and maximize them from our global customers to meaning the most to our patients.","As far as biosimilars, I would challenge that no one has doubled down in this field any more than we have. We now have access to up to 15 products, optimizing our global commercial platform. So we will continue obviously to invest very heavily. But I would suggest that we have more investment in biosimilars today and certainly as we look over the horizon from an R&D perspective.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Okay, thank you. Thank you, guys. We appreciate all your questions and look forward to seeing you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

You may begin.","Kris King","Thank you, Maria. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Mylan's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. Joining me today for the call are Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Sheehan.","During today's call, including the Q&A, we will be making numerous forward-looking statements pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements often may be identified by the use of words such as may, will, could, should, would, project, believe, anticipate, expect, plan, estimates, guidance, trends, forecasts, potential, intend, continue and variations of these words or comparable words.","Our forward-looking statements made today include, among others, statements relating to anticipated business and product performance levels; trends in European and outher countries; planned launches of and anticipated exclusivity periods for new products; our ability to achieve forecasted full year results while absorbing the impact of negative price pressures; expectations for capital expenditures; expectations for R&D, SG&A and other spending; our guidance range; future earnings; planned activities; anticipated growth; the consummation of a planned transaction and other expectations and targets for future periods, including our expectations regarding the second quarter and for 2013 overall. Because these statements are forward-looking, they inherently involve risks and uncertainties and, accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.","Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors set forth under forward-looking statements in our recent earnings press release dated today, May 2, 2013, as well as the risk factors set forth in our report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2012, and in our other SEC filings. You can access our Form 10-K and other filings, including our press release, which we filed on Form 8-K through the SEC website at www.sec.gov, and we strongly encourage you to do so.","In addition, during the call, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. It should be noted that non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted revenues, adjusted gross margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share, should be used only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, or as a superior measure to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.","Please refer to today's press release, which is available on our website as well as on the SEC website, as it contains detailed reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures we use to our first quarter results prepared in accordance with GAAP.","Before I turn the call over to Heather, let me also remind you that the material in the call, with the exception of the participant questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's expressed written permission.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Heather.","Heather Bresch","Thanks Kris, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'd also like to welcome and recognize Mylan's employees around the world. It's because of their continued dedication and hard work that we once again delivered a very strong quarter. And on behalf of the Board of Directors and our entire management team, I'd like to congratulate them on a job well done.","Our first quarter results are right in line with our expectations. On the top line, we delivered $1.63 billion, a year-over-year increase of 5% on a constant currency basis. On the bottom line, we delivered $0.62 per adjusted diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 19% that placed us at the upper end of the EPS guidance range we provided during our call in February. We remain very confident in our full year guidance ranges, including our adjusted EPS range of $2.75 to $2.95.","In our Generics segment, we reported third-party net revenues of $1.41 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 2% on a constant currency basis, and we continue to expect to launch approximately 500 products globally this year, and remain confident that this segment will deliver revenue growth of 3%.","We were pleased with the performance of our North America region during the quarter and continue to show strong momentum. Although third-party net revenues declined 4.5% year-over-year to $733 million, recall that in the first quarter of 2012, we launched the first generic version of Lexapro and it was one of our largest launches to date. When we exclude the revenues associated with this product from our North America results, the region grew at a very strong double-digit rate.","Worth noting is the performance of Mylan Institutional, as we continue to leverage that platform to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace, underscoring why we have taken additional steps to further bolster our strength in this attractive category.","In our EMEA region, we posted our third consecutive quarter of growth. Third-party net revenues totaled $370 million, representing a year-over-year growth of 10% on a constant currency basis. France and Italy continue to be significant contributors to the region's growth, and we're also seeing increased opportunities in the U.K. We expect Generics to be a growth driver for us throughout the year, particularly as generic utilization continues to rise in every one of our major markets, as governments increasingly recognize the importance of generics to the sustainability of health care systems.","Our Asia-Pacific business performed well during the first quarter. Third-party net revenues totaled $305 million, representing year-over-year growth of 10% on a constant currency basis. Strong growth in our anti-retroviral franchise helped drive this result. We see substantial growth and opportunities still ahead for this business, as we continue to garner significant share and tenders in South Africa and India. In addition, we expect to see accelerated growth during the second half of this year in our ARV commercial activities in the private sectors of both countries.","You may recall that on January 1, we began our exclusive, long-term, strategic collaboration with Pfizer in Japan. Our combined portfolio now exceeds 300 products, covering numerous therapeutic categories. We intend to launch generic Tacrolimus in the new Pfizer-Mylan packaging in June, and expect that it will be the sole generic on the market for 6 months. Importantly, the collaboration has been very well received by health care professionals.","As for our Specialty business, we reported third-party net revenues of approximately $212 million during the first quarter, a 24% increase compared to the same period last year. We continue to expect that our Specialty business will deliver revenue growth of 30% this year, and that it will remain a very important strategic growth driver over the long term.","With respect to EpiPen, we're very pleased with its performance during the first quarter. Although total scripts were down 4.4% year-over-year, the decline was due almost entirely to the very long, cold winter we experienced this year in the U.S. in contrast to the winter of 2012, which was the warmest on record. Further, with spring finally here, script growth in the market over the last 2 weeks has averaged more than 8%, and we have captured the majority of that growth. We also announced a coupon offer last week that is designed to encourage patients to obtain sufficient quantities of EpiPen, so that they have access to this life-saving medication anywhere they may need it.","The first quarter also reflected a new market entrant in mid-January. Its share over the last 8 weeks has remained flat, coming in at just below 4%, and its trending under our current expectations. As you may know, this year marks EpiPen's 25th anniversary. We are rolling out a series of events to continue to educate and build awareness around anaphylaxis. Additionally, we continue to see many states taking proactive measures to help ensure that students have access to EpiPens in schools. In addition to the 14 states that already allow access, 26 states have bills working their way through legislatures, and we remain confident that it's only a matter of time until the rest of the states follow suit.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John D. Sheehan","Thank you, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures, and I refer you back to Kris' comments at the beginning of today's call regarding our use of adjusted measures. I am pleased with our financial results for the first quarter of 2013, a great start to what we will believe be -- what we believe will be another successful year for our company.","Our Q1 results were in line with our expectations, and we remain confident that our full year results will be achieved within our guidance, as detailed in February during our earnings conference call. In addition, we continue to work towards completing our acquisition of Agila, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter of 2013, subject to regulatory approval and certain closing conditions.","Our double-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth in the first quarter versus the comparable quarter of the prior year was achieved, in part, through strong results at our Specialty business, which generated revenue growth of 24% for the quarter, fueled by sales of EpiPen. Continuing the positive trend that we experienced starting in the second half of 2012, our European business, powered by our operations in France, grew by 10% on a constant currency basis as compared to the first quarter of the prior year. And our Indian business continued to grow at a strong double-digit rate on a constant currency basis, with favorable sales of both anti-retro API and finished dosage form product.","Getting into the details, let me now walk you through our financial results for the first quarter of 2013. I will also provide an update on our capital structure, Agila transaction financing and our liquidity position.","Starting at the top of our income statement. Total revenues for the quarter were $1.63 billion, an increase of approximately 3% when compared to last year's first quarter revenues of $1.58 billion or approximately 5% on a constant currency basis. Within our Generics segment, third-party revenues were $1.41 billion, a slight increase when compared to the first quarter of the prior year and in line -- and fully in line with our expectations.","Our Specialty segment's third-party revenues increased over $40 million or 24% when compared to the same prior year period. For the remainder of 2013, we are forecasting a continuation of the unfavorable translation impact on sales denominated in certain foreign currencies, principally the Indian rupee and the Japanese yen, which we experienced in the first quarter. Therefore, we currently anticipate that our total revenues for 2013 will be towards the lower half of our previously disclosed guidance range of $7 billion to $7.4 billion.","Looking at our operating profitability measures. Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter of 2013 was a very strong 49%, up approximately 1 percentage point from the same prior year period. This strong quarter margin is primarily the result of the growth in our Specialty business. Within Generics, gross margins remained stable when compared to the same prior year period, despite a lower contribution from new products in the first quarter of 2013.","Adjusted operating income was $383 million for the first quarter of 2013. Consistent with our top line growth, this represents a 4% increase compared to the prior year. This is primarily the result of the improvement in gross margin, as previously discussed, partially offset by our planned increase in R&D.","R&D expense, on an adjusted basis, was $103 million or approximately 6.3% of total revenues and up approximately 30% from the prior year. We continue to invest a significant amount in our biologics and respiratory platforms, which accounts for the majority of the increase from the prior year. Excluded from adjusted R&D expense are certain third-party licensing payments made during the quarter of $23 million for the acquisition of products under development.","Our guidance range for adjusted R&D expense for the full year remains at between 6% and 7% of total revenues. At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was $310 million or approximately 19% of total revenues, at the midpoint of our full year guidance range of 18% to 20%. Excluded from adjusted SG&A is approximately $19 million of costs, principally banking fees and due diligence-related expenses related to our planned acquisition of Agila.","Adjusted EBITDA for the 3 months ended March 31, 2013, was $443 million, an increase of 8% when compared to the prior year, and remains forecasted at $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion for the full year.","Moving on to our consolidated non-operating financial metrics. Adjusted interest expense for the first quarter of 2013 was $63 million. We continue to benefit from low, short-term interest rates. As of March 31, 2013, the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was approximately 4.3%. We continue to use interest rate swaps in order to target a long-term 70-30 fixed-to-floating debt portfolio, which we believe is an optimal ratio.","The effective tax rate in the current quarter was 26.5% as compared to 25% in the fourth quarter of last year, and at the midpoint of our full year 2013 tax rate range of 26% to 27%. As we continue to review our 2013 tax planning strategies and the anticipated mix of our earnings, we expect that our full year effective tax rate may be closer to the lower end of the guidance range.","First quarter adjusted net income was $246 million or $0.62 per share, a 19% increase from our Q1 2012 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.52 and in line with our expectations. Our guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS for 2013 remains at $2.75 to $2.95 per share.","With respect to the second quarter, we expect that adjusted diluted EPS will be in the range of $0.66 to $0.68. We continue to anticipate our third quarter will be the strongest quarter of the year, and we are forecasting our fourth quarter to be comparable to or slightly stronger than the second quarter.","Turning to our cash flow metrics. Cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis was approximately $90 million. Our GAAP cash flow from operations for the current quarter was approximately $88 million, leaving us with unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling at almost $300 million.","The first quarter is historically the heaviest in terms of the usage of cash as a result of the timing of certain payments, including taxes, interest and incentive compensation. And we are still forecasting our full year 2013 adjusted operating cash flow to be within our guidance range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion.","First quarter capital spending was $53 million, and we continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be within our guidance range of $300 million to $400 million. Additionally, during the first quarter, we completed the previously announced share repurchase program by purchasing approximately 16 million shares of common stock for approximately $500 million, consistent with our objective to return capital to our shareholders.","As part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our capital structure, in the first quarter and subsequent to the announcement of the Agila transaction, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps for a significant portion of the transaction's overall financing. By entering into these swaps, we are confident that we will be able to finance the Agila transaction at an effective weighted average interest rate below 4%, assuming no significant deterioration of Mylan's credit spreads.","To further improve our existing capital structure, in early April, we executed an additional $1.8 billion of forward-starting interest rate swaps that fixed the benchmark interest rate on planned debt issuances in 2014 and 2015. We intend for these debt issuances to fund the redemption of our high-yield bonds maturing in 2018 and 2020. The respective first-call dates for each of these bonds is November of '14 and July of 2015. Assuming that our credit spread does not change from its current level, we expect that these transactions, together with certain other planned capital structure transactions, will reduce our existing interest expense levels by approximately $50 million in 2014, exclusive of the impact of the anticipated Agila acquisition financing.","At the end of the first quarter, following the share repurchase and the additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility and AR facilities, our gross notional debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was 2.9:1, leaving us with about $2 billion of financial flexibility to continue to take advantage of further accretive opportunities. We remain committed to our 3:1 long-term gross leverage target. And when our leverage exceeds that target, we remain committed to deleveraging within an 18-month period.","To summarize, our first quarter was strong and in line with what we had anticipated. We remain confident in our financial targets for 2013, and we look forward to updating you on our strategy and longer-term outlook at our Investor Day on August 1.","That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes of the line of Marc Goodman of UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","If I -- first, can you give us a little more flavor on Europe, kind of dig into France specifically and talk about kind of volume versus price and what's happening there and whether your market share is remaining relatively steady? Are you willing to give up a little bit of share for profitability? Just give us the dynamic there, please, for France. And then also just talk about Italy a little bit as well. And then just on Epi -- and then just -- obviously, EpiPen has been a huge topic of conversation. The numbers came in pretty good in the quarter, and you're still confirming, for the full year, the numbers. And you made a comment that the allergy season and the winter and how that played out. I'm just curious, how much of EpiPen is that seasonal issue with respect to allergies versus how much of EpiPen is just your traditional -- you're worried about a bee sting, or you're worried about that type of event?","Heather Bresch","Okay, sure. Okay, so starting in Europe. So Marc, I would say we're just seeing more of what we reported last quarter, which is volume more than offsetting price and, especially in our largest market like France, that really driving that growth. Italy, certainly second, as far as growth rate. And we see kind of -- as we've said, all of our major markets, we've seen this generic utilization continuing to increase. As you know, there's still a good bit of runway room there. I mean even when you look at the entire market of France, it's still in the mid-20s as far as generic penetration. So we feel that there it -- it's -- like we said, continue to be a growth driver this year. We continue to see some stability. And I can assure you, as I think we maintained over the last couple of years, as Europe was facing its challenges, but we were making sure that we did balance profitability and making sure that we wanted to continue to grow our business in a sustainable way. And I think that our numbers show that, not only did we do that, but we've certainly been able to also hang on to our share and stay the market leader in France. As far as EpiPen goes, I'm very encouraged by the last couple of weeks. I mean, I -- we couldn't have had 2 more diverse bookends as far as the comparator, as far as year-over-year goes. So last year, as I mentioned, the warmest on record. This year, one of the coldest and extended. So we absolutely see a direct correlation between temperature and snowfall, specifically in the central and northeast regions, with EpiPen sales. I mean, we went back and looked down to zip code as far as temperatures and weather and that impact and trends over the last couple of years. And that's why I was confident to say that we believe almost all of that 4% was entirely due to the weather. And over the last couple of weeks, the spring has finally arrived. As I said, we see now an average of 8% growth year-over-year, and that's still to a pretty significant growth last year. I mean, we're still dealing with weeks where we were having unprecedented market growth last year. So coming off of -- to grow over still a very high base, I find very encouraging. And like I said, we do see a lot of seasonality for sure, that's why third quarter will continue to be our strongest quarter yet due to that seasonality. But what we have seen with the education and awareness and growing that around this at-risk population, that we do see, for instance, these hot -- these trends growing outside of just that typical Q3 growth. So overall, I, like I said, continue to see EpiPen being very strong, accelerated growth and very encouraged by the most recent script trends, and we expect that to continue as we certainly now enter what, for us, will be our push on direct-to-consumer advertising and all of our other initiatives.","Operator","Our next question comes of the line of Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Heather, if you could address what's going in the U.S. Generics business. I mean one of your other competitors reported weak sales in generics, and obviously, there's a lot lumpiness because of difficult year-over-year comparisons. But what are you seeing? And I think I heard you say you still expect to achieve 3% growth in your total Generics business. That would require a significant recovery in the following 3 quarters. So if you could just talk about what are those first-to-file opportunities? Or how we should think about the outlook of that business? And I know this is a year where you're up against very difficult comparisons because there were, as you said, a voluminous number of new product launches last year. But how should we think about 2014 and going forward? I'm not asking you for guidance, obviously, but just how we should conceptually think about it.","Heather Bresch","Yes. So look -- yes, and I think I'd start with the fact that -- as I've often said, I think it's very difficult, as large and diverse as many of the companies have become, to try to use one brush to paint all. I think when we look at the brand business, that's very dependent on individual portfolios and product mix, as I think that, that is very much at play here for our industry. We joked when people kept asking last year about the patent cliff. And I said, \"You know, I think it's relative.\" We don't see a cliff. We see continued opportunity on numerous product fronts and still numerous therapeutic and different dosage forms, just like our recent announcements of adding to our injectables business. So from my perspective, we see the generic industry alive and well. We still see a lot of runway room here the United States. I think we'd still continue to see somewhat of a stability in the pricing environment. There's still a good bit of market interruption, especially in the institutional space. But we're seeing that across the board that we've been able to very opportunistic about. So I would say that we've got a very strong outlook. We've got over 180 ANDAs on file with the FDA. We have over 35 first-to-files. So the business is very strong, very healthy. We see growth. And as far as the percentages, remember that we -- I just talked about Europe being the growth driver for us, Asia Pacific. So as you mentioned, the 3% is our total global Generics segment. So that -- and we obviously feel confident about hitting the 3%.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can I just ask a follow-up, Heather? Can you -- is there any color you can provide us on the Pfizer partnership in Japan? Are you seeing revenues from that yet? And anything that you could share with us would be very helpful.","Heather Bresch","Yes. I mean, it's -- right now, it's right in line with our expectations. As I mentioned, we're launching Tacrolimus and expect that to be an exclusive launch. All of the new packaging is rolling out. So I mean, the partnership has gone extremely well. And like I said, it's continuing right now to be right in line with our expectations. And we think that, certainly over the longer term, that's just going to continue to build and build as we're able to build that portfolio and the brand. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao of Barclays.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just in terms of the North America Generics business, we've obviously seen some moderation in terms of the pricing environment for the base business. I was just curious if you could provide some perspective in terms of what you're seeing there, and as well as sort of dynamics in terms of market share vis-\u00e0-vis sort of individual products and sort of customer relationships right now.","Heather Bresch","There -- I don't have much more to add on the pricing environment, except that it's the generic industry. It's going to continue to have different products affected at different times. But overall, we're still seeing a fairly stable pricing environment from an erosion perspective and, certainly, continue to see our volumes growing. And like I said, we're still on track to launch 500 products globally and still a significant amount in the United States. So from a product -- the breadth of our product and the pricing environment, we continue -- that's why, I wanted to stress that we see a lot of strong momentum for us in that business. As far as the -- our customers go, obviously, as I've said before, I think the consolidation with our customers is actually advantageous, because as they become larger and larger, their needs and their -- the need for them to have reliable suppliers that can provide the capacity they need is, I think, where only a very few can. So I think Mylan is in a great position, as not only we have significant capacity today, but as we've said, we're doubling the size of Mylan over the next few years. And that ability to be able to meet the global demand that many of our customers are facing now, we think we're positioned great to take advantage of that opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur of Needham & Company.","Elliot Wilbur - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions around the EpiPen franchise. Heather, I think, during the course of your prepared commentary, I think I heard you say something about instituting a coupon program. And I'm just wondering if that's something along the lines of a 0 co-pay coupon. And if you can maybe just talk about whether or not the entrance of Auvi-Q has caused you to change anything in terms of your marketing game plan, call activity or call frequency. And then as a follow-up to that, I mean it looks like we've -- you've gone the longest period of time without instituting a price increase on EpiPen since late 2009. I'm just wondering if you think the product is basically, essentially fully priced in terms of the value proposition. And we're probably looking at something more in line -- in terms of thinking about price increases going forward, something more in line with the sort of normalized pharmaceutical inflation rather than the price increase levels we've seen in the past.","Heather Bresch","Okay. So I'll start with the coupon. It is a 0 co-pay coupon. And as I mentioned, it's really been encouraging multiple scripts. As you know, it's important that people have EpiPens readily available and accessible wherever they need them. So it's been -- we're very happy with the coupon. And in fact, we've seen higher pens-per-scripts count as we continue to see people not only asking, as you know, the guidelines. The guidelines that are out there around anaphylaxis say that you should always be carrying 2 with you. So that has helped drive that scripts -- pens per script. But we've also seen some good positive results from our coupon, which we just launched over the last couple of weeks. As far as  Auvi-Q, as I mentioned, they're currently trending under our expectations. So I'm very proud about not only the brand equity or our -- we believed that EpiPen, not only had a very strong brand, but that tried-and-true product sense that we believe EpiPen brings to the market, we continue to see that holding ground. And like I said, I continue to now be encouraged by the last couple of weeks that are showing just year-over-year growth in the overall epinephrine market, and us able to capture more than half of that. So feel very good about the EpiPen franchise and believe that we absolutely will deliver on the 30% growth for the Specialty segment. And as far as pricing goes, look, I think we'll continue -- we continue to have opportunities around prices, as other brands do, and we'll continue to make decisions based on that opportunity going forward. But I'd, by no means, say that there's no room for price anymore in EpiPen.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shibani Malhotra of RBC Capital.","Shibani Malhotra - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So yesterday, on an earnings call, one of your competitors in injectables said that, while companies are getting into the market, there's going to be a lot more consolidation in the industry. So I was just wondering, Heather, if you can talk about how you see the injectables landscape playing out, in particular, in the U.S. And then one for John and you. You talked about the $4 billion in accretive -- $4 billion you had available for accretive transactions last year. And clearly, you bought Agila and purchased your shares. How should we be thinking about the way you're going to spend the rest of the $2.5-ish billion that is left?","Heather Bresch","Okay. So as far as the injectables space, look, I mean, obviously, with our announcement of planned acquisition of Agila, we believe that this sector is ripe for a consolidation. I think that between the market shortages and the significant problems that many manufacturers are having, continue to make it very ripe for consolidation. So I believe that, that's a great sector of the market, a high gross margin. I think that's going to continue even as other players come in. But -- so totally agree with the consolidation point. As far as our M&A activity, I guess what we'll continue to underscore is that we continue to look at everything. And -- but we are committed to the parameters we laid out there last year, which is being an accretive transaction and remaining investment grade. So I would say there's a lot of different ways to get there and look at things. But just assure that we're -- still got a lot of activity under way.","John D. Sheehan","I agree with that. I did. I'm just going to say don't have anything to add to that. That's absolutely correct so...","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gilbert of Bank of America.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Heather, you talked about some opportunity in the U.K. Can you expand on that? Secondly, are you still expecting respiratory guidelines shortly? And third, do you think any of the recent changes at OGD in staffing and structure, not PDUFA but other stuff, will slow anything that's material to Mylan?","Heather Bresch","Okay. I'll start with the U.K. and then I'll let Rajiv hit the respiratory point. So listen, U.K. actually similar situation, we were able to take advantage of some product opportunities because of market shortages. So I think, again, we're really seeing in some of these countries, where as we got our supply chain to be more in-house, as we mentioned before, we spent a lot of time bringing in those products that were in-license before and we're now about 70% of everything that we're selling, we're manufacturing or controlling that supply chain. So we really see that benefit, not only to be continuing to grow our product portfolios in some of these other attractive markets, but then also have the ability to take advantage of market opportunities. And that's what we've seen in U.K. and see some further opportunity going forward. Rajiv, do you want to add more to it?","Rajiv Malik","Yes. On respiratory, I think we'll continue to work with the FDA very closely towards the AB-rated program and FDA -- we -- just because we are working with the FDA, we will know if FDA is very close to finalization of the some -- the guidance around these respiratory products, the DPIs, the dry-powder inhalers.","Heather Bresch","Yes. And I'm sorry. I'm not sure. I think there was a third...","Rajiv Malik","The FDA, restructuring at FDA.","Heather Bresch","Look, I think that, obviously, under PDUFA, it has a lot of requirements and parameters out there as far as the structure and their ability to not only add the personnel needed, but the inspection around the approval and Office of Generic Drugs. So look, we continue to work closely with FDA on all fronts to do whatever we can to help on that front, and to continue to make sure that the legislation is getting implemented as it was intended.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Finkelstein of Susquehanna Financial.","Andrew Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Maybe you can talk a little bit in more detail about how the constant currency growth is looking across various parts of Asia Pac and then how much of the currency headwind is affecting you, just so we can think about how to forecast that going forward. And then on EpiPen, Heather, can you give any more color on how the new coupon program is expected to affect the net pricing on the product? What's the typical co-pay that patients are paying? And then if it's a 0 co-pay, obviously, you're picking up that difference, so any color there would be appreciated.","John D. Sheehan","Sure. So I'll -- this is -- I'll start, I guess, just a couple of points. First of all, with respect to the currency headwinds, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, principally relates to the Japanese yen and the Indian rupee. And in our first quarter press release, you can see in the materials and in the attachments the impact that currency had on each of the various regions, and that it's principally in Asia Pacific. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, the -- as a result of the currency headwinds, which we, at least at the moment, are forecasting to continue for those 2 currencies throughout 2013, that we would see ourselves, rather than being at the midpoint of the guidance range for revenue of $7 billion to $7.4 billion, to be on the lower end of that. So I think that implies a roughly $100 million worth of currency impact. And as I said, it relates principally to that region.","Heather Bresch","And as far as EpiPen goes, I mean, there's obviously numerous, different insurance programs around the country. So as what people are paying in co-pay varies. But I would say, on average, that the coupon, for us, it would not be affecting the price. And the coupon, for us, as we work with the insurance and those programs is really all more like a rebate. So like I said, again, it's just to help encourage people that do have co-pays, that they could be able fill 2 or 3 scripts at a time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott of JP Morgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just 2. First, coming back to the injectable side of the business, as you kind of are just looking for a much broader move into this market, can you just comment a little bit about how you feel pricing is in this setting? I guess with the shortages that are out there with investments people are making, do you think prices are appropriate at these levels? Or do we need to see further price resets at some of these older products just, again, given the dynamic of how much investment used to go into this space? Second was on Europe, just interested in your thoughts on the sustainability of these utilization trends we're seeing. Do you see this as a multi-year opportunity? Or just kind of what inning do you think we are of this uptick in utilization. I'm trying to think, as we're looking out beyond '13, how should we be kind of thinking about growth in that region?","Heather Bresch","Okay, sure. So as far as the institutional market goes, I mean, look, I think that this is -- there were a lot of different dynamics at play here. Certainly, obviously, we've seen severe supplier issues. But I also think that we -- that, that space got to where they --- it was chasing the floor. So I think that there was very whacked-out prices, dirt cheap, literally cheaper than dirt for some of those older products. And the bar needs to go. It needed to go up from a quality perspective, and it needs to go up and get rebalanced from a pricing perspective. So I think that we have certainly seen that. And I'm not -- there's extremes on both ends. But I think, overall, the bar is going up. And so that stability and that tide will go with it. And so I see that staying, because I think people realized the detriment it did to this therapeutic category by having the dynamics in place that were. So hopefully, now, especially with the enhanced FDA actions around inspections and quality and GMP, that this will be something that will be the new standard going forward. As far as utilization, I absolutely think that, that will continue. I mean, what we've always said is, once a government realizes the economics and the year-over-year continuing of those economics with utilization versus a price cut, it's significant. And so what we see with utilization rates going up is behavior changes. You don't get consumer behavior changes with price cuts to the manufacturer. But -- so we -- I absolutely believe it's for years. Because it's not flipping a switch. It's not going to go from 24 to 44 overnight or wherever it may be able to go to. I think it's just going to be a steady rise, as we've been seeing in Japan, once the government focused and put targets out there, just that steady continued increasing, I think that's what we're going to -- should expect out of Europe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger of Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have 2 questions. The first is, in terms of the new launch revenue that came in at $117 million, that was below our forecast. And it would be great if you could help frame the contribution of Diovan HCT and the Actos. Because I'm just wondering if there's any destocking ahead of the loss of 180-day exclusivity or something like that, and how we should think about those. And then, second, I don't know if you can provide any color, but if you could please comment on the Copaxone U.S. patent appeal process, timing, et cetera, on that September of 2015 patent.","John D. Sheehan","So the $117 million of new product revenue that you referenced, David, that's in North America. And as you know, we don't break out individual product revenues. So that I can't provide a whole lot of color on that, other than I would say that there was -- that the $117 million was fully in line with our expectation. And number two, I don't think there were any unusual impacts on new product revenues, such as you were suggesting.","Heather Bresch","And as far as Copaxone, all arguments are actually next week. And so, I won't try to forecast the timing of a ruling in that. As you well know, it could be 2 months, it could be 12 months. So -- but the oral arguments are next week.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky of Canaccord Genuity.","Randall Stanicky - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Just 2 questions, one for Heather and one for John. Heather first, you gave some pretty helpful color around EpiPen and what a potential impact of generic would have in 2015 at your Analyst Day last year. I'm just wondering if anything has changed or if we can still look at that as a rough guide of what you think the current impact would be. And then I have a follow-up for John.","Heather Bresch","Okay, yes. No, I absolutely do. And Randall, we've continued to make sure that, as far as everything from the rating and the substitutability that -- around, that I believe the bar is fairly high to get an AB-rated EpiPen due to the device needing to work the same and so forth. So not only do I continue to still believe the bar to be very high to even get generics approved, to be AB-rated. But if that were to happen, then yes, I'm absolutely very much confident in the assumptions I gave, that it would be a very unique and -- I tried to call out a couple of other compounds that have very slow conversion. We absolutely believe it would fall on that category.","Randall Stanicky - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, John, just a quick question. What's the likelihood or potential that we see another buyback this year?","John D. Sheehan","Well, obviously, the decisions with respect to share repurchase programs are made actually at the board level and all. And so, we do maintain $2 billion of financial flexibility, as I indicated in my prepared remarks and all. And we're always -- we, as the management, and the Board of Directors are always evaluating shareholder value accretion transactions. And we think our stock has been a very good investment for us over the last couple of years. But I probably have to stop short of speculating as to whether we'll do another one or not.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Chiang of CRT Capital.","Timothy Chiang - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","I had 2 questions. One, Heather, how -- can you comment on how you're doing on Zovirax ointment? I know you guys got the approval on the generic about a month ago. And I had a follow-up for John.","Heather Bresch","Look, we don't comment on individual launches. But I -- we're -- it's a great product, and we're the only generic out there. So anyway, it's -- we believe it will be a nice product for us.","Timothy Chiang - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","And John, just a follow-up on the stock buyback question. I think your guidance reflects that your share count could be around -- as low as 385 million shares this year. So I guess you still have some room potentially to buy stock back, is that right?","John D. Sheehan","Well, I think that the weighted average diluted shares in Q1 is slightly below 400 million. That obviously reflects the fact that the share repurchase program only was effectuated towards the latter part of the quarter. So I do think that as we move into Q2, in particular, that you'll see the share count drop from that, which is in the first quarter. And just to be clear, the guidance that we provided -- we were clear on the fourth quarter earnings call and guidance that the share repurchase program of $500 million was included in the guidance and share count that we had provided to you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal of Bernstein.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I have 2 of them. First, Heather, have you guys estimated the number people who currently do not have coverage for EpiPen, who might be able -- eligible to get reimbursed for the drug once the exchanges come into play next year? And second, one of the other companies in a similar market just made a deal with an external funder source for $150 million to just fund the first 3 programs -- their first 3 biosimilar programs. Kind of looking at the cost of those programs, should we expect a significant increase in R&D? Are you considering getting a financial partner as well to support those programs and accelerate a few of them forward? Can you just give us a little bit -- an idea of how you think about funding the clinical cost of biosimilars?","Heather Bresch","Okay. So as far as -- I believe it's very insignificant, the amount of patients out there that don't have coverage. But that being said, there's still a lot of opportunity for the at-risk population. We're only covering about 10%, 11% of that today. So I think any time that health care is extended or given more coverage, especially in an area where you still have such underutilization, there can always be incremental benefit. As far as the biosimilars, I mean, I think, obviously, when we came out with this year's guidance, we spoke very specifically about our R&D and did kind -- now with being at 6% to 7% of revenue, that we were now in a position to have significant dollars for our R&D platforms to fund things, specifically around our biologics programs, our respiratory programs, like generic Advair and such. So we believe obviously that, that's again a differentiator to be able to, not only be continuing to invest in core generic products, but now have the hundreds of millions needed to fund these very difficult and hard-to-manufacture and formulate products. Rajiv, anything you...","Rajiv Malik","No. You covered everything.","John D. Sheehan","Good, just that -- well, we already have a partner with Biocon, too, right, Heather?","Heather Bresch","Yes. No. I mean, right, we're partnered on several of our products. But anyway, that's obviously all full loaded in our budget.","Rajiv Malik","Part of the budget, yes.","Heather Bresch","Okay, guys, well, thank you so much for the call. Bye. Thank you, operator.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's first quarter 2013 earnings call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day."],"15846":["Mylan N.V.

My name is Deidre, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mylan Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participant lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Melissa Trombetta, Head of Global Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Melissa Trombetta","Thank you, Deidre. Good evening, everyone. Welcome to Mylan\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me for today\u2019s call are Mylan\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; Chief Commercial Officer, Tony Mauro; and Chief Financial Officer, Ken Parks.","During today\u2019s call, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial guidance for 2019. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause further results or events to differ materially from today\u2019s projections.","Please refer to the earnings release we furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K earlier today, as well as our supplemental earnings slides, all of which are posted on our website at investor.mylan.com for a further explanation of those risks and uncertainties and the limits applicable to forward-looking statements.","Mylan routinely posts information that may be important to investors on this website and we use this website address as a means of disclosing material information to the public in a broad, non-exclusionary manner for purposes of the SEC\u2019s Regulation Fair Disclosure Reg FD.","In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We will refer to these measures as adjusted and present them in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance.","Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measures, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to those GAAP measures, are available in our fourth quarter earnings release and supplemental earnings slides, as well as on our website.","Let me also remind you that the information discussed during the call, except for the participants\u2019 questions is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan\u2019s express written permission. An archived copy of today\u2019s call will be available on our website and will remain available for a limited time.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Heather.","Heather Bresch","Thank you, Melissa. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining our call. First and foremost I\u2019d like to thank my colleagues around the globe. Mylan has made tremendous strides in 2018 in delivering on our mission to provide the world's 7 billion people access to high-quality medicine and all the credit goes to our hard-working and dedicated employees.","Together we have launched biosimilar in key markets, progressed several scientific programs, overcome regulatory hurdles and continue to advocate for policies that breakdown barriers to access just to name a few.","We\u2019ve also said many times before that Mylan's business model is built on diversification across our commercial, operational and scientific platform, making us resilient but not immune to macro industry dynamics and changes within healthcare systems around the globe.","Realizing this we have focused on our investment and strategic execution, which had yielded a diverse and differentiated business platform. We believe with this diverse platform we\u2019ll be able to continue to deliver superior returns over the long run. Today 64% of our total revenues come from outside the United States and as far as our product mix U.S. generics make up less than one-third of our portfolio.","With that said, even in light of the current industry environment and conditions our results in 2018 were strong. Our 4% decline in total revenues and flat year-over-year adjusted EPS reflects solid execution for Europe and rest of world segment helping to offset the volatility in our North America segment where net sales were down 18% year-over-year impacted largely by three factors.","First, we experienced slower than expected uptake of our generic Copaxone even after reducing the price by more than 60%, which perfectly illustrates the current distorted financial incentives within the specialty pharmacy marketplace. That said, we adapted and recalibrated and are now seeing improved pull-through of our Glatiramer Acetate.","Second approval of generic Advair did not occur in the timeline we had anticipated but the good news is we received it early in 2019. While we are also seeing misaligned financial incentives for complex products in the retail pharmacy space we were able to apply our learnings from generic Copaxone and adopt a unique launch strategy with Wixela. I'm pleased to report that we received a positive response thus far.","And lastly, we rationalized a significant portion of our commodity generic business. After reflecting on the accomplishment of 2018 it\u2019s becoming more and more apparent that one of Mylan's greatest strengths is the incredible agility it's created throughout the company this clearly is one of the core strength in executing against our strategy.","Our strong execution and the results of our performance reflect our continued ability to adapt quickly and strategically to market conditions. While at the same time we remain committed to being a leader for the generics industry and advocate for changes to the current structural issues in the U.S. healthcare system that hinder access to generic.","To that end, we are extremely encouraged by recent proposals by the administration and the CMS call letter that strives to ensure that generic and brand products are placed on proper formulary tiers, incentivizing generic uptake, as well as creating a much-needed generic tier for specialty.","We applaud these proposals and look forward to patients benefiting from the system the way that it was intended to encourage generics and biosimilars. One that allows innovation and competition to drive each other, which in turn creates further access to more affordable medicines.","Looking ahead to 2019, we felt incredibly positive about our ability to deliver a strong financial performance. Specifically, we expect to generate total revenues between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion which is mid single-digit growth versus 2018. This guidance reflects topline growth across all three of our geographic segment North America, Europe and rest of world.","And impressively this growth includes more than $1 billion of new launches nearly all of which have already been approved. Unlike 2018, this outlook reflects a return to new launches driven by complex and specialty products that we believe will more than offset price and volume erosion.","There has been a lot of discussion about whether or not the U.S. generics industry has stabilized. Value has certainly been extracted out of the U.S. marketplace and that value has affected companies differently depending on their portfolio. From our perspective the U.S. generics industry is made up of three important and distinct types of product, commodity, complex and specialty. This distinction is important because the level of investment uptake and competitiveness vary significantly across these three groups and had shifted over time.","As you can see in our earnings deck on slide 10, Mylan's investments over the last decade are now being realized and the evolution of our portfolio will deliver over the longer term. We will continue to invest in specialty and complex products, and we see this trend continuing, which will require additional allocation of capital.","As our U.S. portfolio has evolved and diversified so to as our overall global portfolio. The product mix we have today reflects the fact that we don't believe in sacrificing investments for the long-term and 2019 won\u2019t be any different.","We expect to deliver adjusted EPS in the range of $3.80 to $4.80 representing a year-over-year mid single-digit decline at the midpoint which reflect incremental R&D and sales and marketing investments to support current and future topline growth. In addition, we\u2019re looking to generate adjusted free cash flows between $1.9 billion and $2.3 billion.","Switching gears to be on 2019, I\u2019d like to take a minute to talk about the steps Mylan is taking to transition to a business model that we see predominantly being driven by organic growth. Sustainability cannot be dependent on prior success alone, but requires a company willing to reinvent themselves in order to further build upon that success of keeping pace with the ever changing market dynamics.","With that said, we are driving capital market discipline down into every segment of our business distinguishing between value creating and value consuming assets. We formalize that work and have set up a business transformation office that is putting a highly disciplined financial lens to unlock latent value from the assets we\u2019ve integrated throughout the company.","Through this rigorous process we expect to deliver continued long-term growth and attractive shareholder return by maximizing new products reallocating investments to drive share of economically profitable products all while maintaining a competitive sourcing and manufacturing footprint. We look forward to providing you with the full details of our business transformation roadmap at our Investor Day this fall.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rajiv.","Rajiv Malik","Thank you, Heather. To begin I would like to provide an overview of our 2018 business results by region. In Europe, net sales totaled approximately $4.2 billion representing mid single-digit growth from prior year. The increase was a result of strong performance of our brands including Creon, DYMISTA and Influvac each with double-digit growth, new product sales and a favorable impact of foreign currency translation.","In the Rest of World segment, net sales totaled approximately $3 billion, an increase of 7% from the prior year including headwinds in the foreign currency translation. This increase was primarily the result of new product sales across the region, strong performance of our ARV Franchise, whereas Japan, Australia and China also showed strength on higher volumes of existing products.","Our business in North America had net sales of $4.1 billion, a decrease of 18% from the prior year. This was primarily impacted due to the lower than anticipated update of generic Copaxone and delayed approval of generic Advair. As part of our Morgantown remediation and restructuring activity and accelerated commoditization of oral solids, we discontinued almost 250 SKUs of highly commoditized oral solid products. North America benefited from some exciting launches of Fulphila, DAPTOMYCIN and exclusive 180 days of Tadalafil and full year impact of generic Copaxone.","I will address Morgantown plant. After the April 2018 inspection and receipt of a 483 form the company took a comprehensive restructuring and remediation of the Morgantown plant to address the issues that had been identified.","Notwithstanding these efforts, the company received a warning letter related to the previously disclosed observations in the fourth quarter. The issues raised in the warming letter are being comprehensively addressed. The Morgantown plant continues to supply products for the U.S. market, while we execute on and assess the restructuring and remediation activities.","No significant new product revenue is forecasted from the Morgantown plant in 2019. Also we look at our business in North America, only five of our top 50 gross margin generating products are currently manufactured in Morgantown.","We remain committed to maintaining the highest quality manufacturing standards at our facilities around the world and to continuous improvement in a time of evolving industry dynamics and regulatory expectations.","Now, I will focus on 2019 and our outlook for the year. 2019 will be a significant year from the new product launch perspective and we are uniquely positioned to add approximately $1 billion in new product revenue.","Almost all of our major products driving 2019 growth are either already launched or approved around the world. Also no product is forecasted to make up more than approximately 3% of global revenues including our EpiPen franchise.","In North America, we are incorporating all of our recent learning's including the relatively slower uptake and conversion of more complex and specialty medicines and are adopting to accommodate the changing needs of the market.","The high single-digit revenue growth we expect in North America is largely driven by complex and specialty and biologics, including a steady and continued up take of generic Copaxone share, building further upon the successful launch of Fulphila in 2018 as we expand our biosimilars portfolio for the U.S., extending our respiratory portfolio with the launch of our NCE YUPELRI, and most importantly, a unique and patient centric launch of Wixela Inhub where we have a first two market opportunity.","Also the impact of volume loss due to portfolio rationalization of commodity products undertaken in 2018 will be largely behind us. To elaborate on Heather's comments on slide 10, you can see a year-over-year decline in commodity product revenues as we evolve our business to benefit from the strength and anticipated growth of complex, specialty and biologics products.","In Europe, we see mid single-digit revenue growth driven by a diverse mix of brand, generic and OTC portfolio. Focus selling and marketing investments on key brands like Dymista, Creon, Influvac and Betadine will continue to be an important driver. Some other key drivers of European growth will be continued up take of generic Copaxone, biosimilars like Hulio, a biosimilar to Humira, and Ogivri, a biosimilar to Herceptin.","And Rest of the World we see mid single-digit revenue growth largely driven by a double-digit growth in China and Brazil, while Australia, Japan and our ARV franchise will continue to perform steadily. Biosimilar launches across the region will drive new product. Brands like Dona, Dymista and Elidel will be another key driver.","I would now like to take a few minutes and share a summary of our key scientific and regulatory achievement. And before I begin I would like to thank my Mylan colleagues for their contributions and persistence to bring these difficult-to-develop medicines to patients and acknowledge our close collaboration with our partners.","These achievements have required years of hard work, passion, perseverance to bring these alternative options to patients who need these products. A series of significant scientific achievements began just over a year ago, starting with the first approval of generic Copaxone 40 milligram in U.S. and Europe. A number of biosimilar regulatory approvals around the world followed, included Fulphila, a biosimilar to Neulasta; Ogivri, a biosimilar to Herceptin; Semglee, a biosimilar to Lantus; Hulio, a biosimilar to Humira; and ABEVMy a biosimilar to Avastin. We now have regulatory approvals for biosimilars in more than 65 countries around the world.","We also received FDA approval of an NCE for Revefenacin, our Yupelri inhalation solution developed with our partner Theravance. This product is a first once a daily nebulization treatment for patients with moderate to severe COPD who may benefit from or prefer nebulized LAMA treatment.","We also continue to make advancements for Influvac, our seasonal flu vaccine primarily in Europe. In addition to our trivalent version, we have launched our quadrivalent version, Infuvac Tetra, as well as obtained our first pediatric indication. Also, we continue to expand this in other markets outside of Europe such as Australia and Canada.","And last but not the least, U.S. FDA approval of Wixela Inhub, the first generic of ADVAIR DISKUS. As we understand, because of the significance of this complex generic, FDA took a few more months to conduct a very thorough secondary review and ensure the labeling was as up to date as possible.","No scientific or significant regulatory issues were raised during this period. These scientific achievements have further differentiated us from our peers and set us up very nicely for growth of complex, specialty and biologics products.","Moving to our pipeline, we along with our partner Revance, had an initial advisory meeting regarding our proposed biosimilar to BOTOX. Based on agency's feedback, the companies believe that the 351(k) pathway for the development of the biosimilar to BOTOX is viable and provides the opportunity to develop and commercialize the first biosimilar to BOTOX. Our other key programs including biosimilars such as IDN [ph], Avastin, Humira, insulin analog and Glatiramer Acetate once-monthly remain on track.","Given the evolution of the U.S. market and dynamics of the commodity generics, we also continue to evaluate our R&D program and resource allocation and from here onwards we'll further increase the emphasis on moving up the value chain with a focus on complex, specialty and biologics opportunities, the NCE's and brand lifecycle management strategies.","Finally, I would like to echo Heather\u2019s remark about our focus this year on evaluating or value creating and value consuming assets. We have assembled a second to none portfolio and a pipeline with commercial assets across the world. And we are very excited to have another look into the businesses and operations so that we can leverage these assets to the maximum and are able to focus on value creating assets.","Now, I will turn it over to Tony to elaborate on some of the details around our investments in our business segments. Thank you.","Tony Mauro","Thank you, Rajiv, and good evening. I would like to reiterate the confidence you heard from Heather and Rajiv, and the overall performance of our business in 2018. I am proud of the many achievements from the past year, including the scientific advancements you just heard about which have positioned us well for long-term growth. In 2019 you will see our projected revenue growth in the mid-single-digit with 64% of our total revenue coming from outside of the U.S.","Driving this growth will be an acceleration of our global key brands across Europe and Rest of World complement by a number of critical complex and specialty launches in the U.S. As we examine the evolution of our business, and look ahead at what it will take to continue our success, we recognize the importance of valuing future potential. As such, we plan to incrementally increase our sales and marketing investments around our complex, specialty and global key brand products with the understanding that these products require added attention to achieve their full long-term potential.","We are shifting our SG&A spend guidance to approximately 21% to 22% of sales with the ultimate goal of advancing access for patients while driving profitable long-term growth. I will now walk you through a few of the key drivers and efforts already underway starting with North America where we're expecting high single digit revenue growth in 2019.","Earlier this month we launched Wixela Inhub our generic Advair Diskus at a price point of 70% below the brand wholesale acquisition cost to insure savings for patient, as well as payers and employers. With the sales force of 150 individuals, we have optimized our market share with our pharmacy partners and are pleased with the early conversion levels.","In addition to providing a lower cost alternative, we are committed to providing patients and healthcare providers with training and education to ensure a seamless transition. The launch of our new chemical entity YUPELRI rate is another exciting example of a product that requires a unique focus from a sales and marketing standpoint to help create new demand and address unmet needs for COPD patients.","We are pleased to bring an important treatment to the market and anticipate YUPELRI will change the paradigm in the COPD state as the first and only once daily nebulized bronchodilator approved for the maintenance of COPD.","Our sales force is actively calling on healthcare providers and we are pleased with the initial response from physicians and our customers. We go confident this trend will continue as we progress throughout 2019 and YUPELRI meet its full market potential over the coming years.","Continuing with the U.S. our oncology and hospital teams have been focused on the successful launch of Fulphila, our first biosimilar in the U.S. and the first biosimilar to Neulasta. We are offering comprehensive patient resources including a patient focused call-center, field reimbursement support and a co-pay assistance program.","Additionally we have a dedicated facility calling on healthcare providers in clinics and in hospitals. As a result of these efforts we are seeing an increase in weekly chart back and had over 15% of the prefilled syringe market earlier this month.","Lastly we are pleased with the accelerated uptake of our Glatiramer Acetate. Over the past months we've had strategic discussions with our customers resulting in further collaboration and subsequent changes in plan coverage increasing utilization by 34% since the beginning of the year.","We also continue to see an increase in the use of our outpatient focus support services offered to our MS Advocate program, including in-home injection trainings with an experienced MS nurse and a 24\/7 patient support centers. Our new prescription now crossed the 35% market share threshold and we look forward to continued growth in the coming months.","Turning to our European business, we project mid-single digit revenue growth in 2019. We've been very pleased with the growth of our global key brands specifically Creon, Influvac, Dymista and Brufen which grew double digits on average in 2018.","Influvac specifically we are the market leader in Germany and France with greater than 50% market share in each country based on the most recent quarterly data. Additionally we are pleased with the launch of TOBI Podhaler and TOBI Solution falling our acquisition last fall and will utilize our existing commercial infrastructure to promote and grow this products.","Looking ahead to 2019, we are forecasting on average a double-digit revenue growth on our key brands as we continue to further invest and leverage our commercial infrastructure of approximately 3,800 sales and marketing employees and focus efforts in key markets such as France, Germany, Italy, U.K. and Spain. We had a milestone year for our biosimilars program and are excited to be launching Ogivri, our biosimilar to Herceptin in many key markets like Germany and France and will continue to launch in other countries throughout 2019.","In addition to this, we remain encouraged about our generic Glatiramer Acetate 40 mg in Europe. Today we have launched nine countries in this region and we have planned for continued expansion and expect to more than double our sales in 2019.","In the Rest of World region we are forecasting mid-single digit revenue growth. In Japan, to added sales and marketing resources we expect double-digit growth in Amitiza and Creon sales. In China additional resource investment will generate more than 70% sales growth for Sebivo and Elavil and greater than 20% growth for Dona.","In Australia we will focus on Dymista projecting to nearly double sales in 2019. Our Rest of World sales and marketing team comprised of 2800 individuals is strong and dedicated to growing our business to concentrated efforts in countries through the region.","To conclude, we are excited about our anticipated global growth in 2019 and our enhanced investment to maximize long-term results for the future. Our teams around the world are focused and ready to continue executing on our growth initiatives.","With that I'll turn the call over to Ken.","Ken Parks","Thank you Tony and good afternoon everyone. I will take a few minutes to provide a quick overview of our financial results for 2018. For the full year both total revenues and constant currency revenues of $11.4 billion were 4% lower than the prior year. On a constant currency basis, net sales in Europe which was up 1% and Rest of World which was up 10% help to partially mitigate an 18% decline in North America.","Excluding approximately $258 million related to the Morgantown restructuring and remediation expenses combined regional segment profitability declined 7% versus the prior-year. Europe grew 1% while Rest of World grew 21%. These combined results help to partially offset a 16% decline in North America mostly due to lower volumes on existing products including EpiPen as well as pricing declines.","On a full-year basis, we reported adjusted net earnings of $2.4 billion and adjusted EPS of $4.58 which is within our previously communicated guidance range. Adjusted EPS versus the prior year primarily reflects benefits from ongoing integration activities and lower share count following the completion of our $1 billion share repurchase program in the beginning of the year offset by the impact of the decline in our total revenues and increased sales and marketing investments. As a reminder, we did not achieve the targets of our Blue Team 6 incentive program and there was therefore no payout under that program.","Adjusted free cash flow for the 12 months ended December 31, 2018 totaled $2.7 billion that's an increase of $86 million compared to the prior year and above the high-end of our initial guidance range for 2018. The year-over-year increase reflects ongoing improvement in working capital velocity, as well as lower capital expenditures.","2018 adjusted free cash flow conversion was healthy at approximately 115% of adjusted net earnings that's another measure of the strength and durability of the cash flow generating capabilities of our business.","During 2018 we repaid more than $630 million of debt including a \u20ac500 million note that matured during the fourth quarter. At the end of Q4 2018, our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio has calculated under our credit agreements was 3.8 times and was in compliance with our covenant requirements.","On February 22nd of this year, we entered into amendments to our credit agreement to extend the leverage ratio covenant of 4.25 times through the December 31, 2019 reporting period. These amendments provide us with additional financial flexibility as we manage our capital structure during 2019. This does not change in any way our commitment to our deleveraging strategy or our investment grade credit rating. This is simply a recognition by our banking group of the dynamic changes occurring within our industry.","Even considering the additional investments in SG&A and R&D that we've discussed today, our capital deployment priority remains focused on deleveraging as we've consistently communicated.","We now intend to repay more than $1.1 billion of debt in 2019, including scheduled maturities in June and November. This represents an increase of approximately $500 million in debt repayment versus our previous target.","We remain fully committed to our investment grade credit rating and to further reducing leverage as we work towards our long-term average debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio target of approximately 3.0 times. We anticipate that we'll achieve this target through both continued debt repayment as well as EBITDA expansion.","Moving to 2019 at a high level, we expect total revenues in the range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, which represents an increase of 5% at the mid-point versus full year 2018. Full year adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.80 to $4.80, that's down 6% at the mid-point. And finally, we expect adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion.","As you heard from Rajiv, in our topline outlook we expect positive volume growth and a significant contribution from new product launches, including Wixela coupled with the carry-forward impact of generic Copaxone, Fulphila and YUPELRI. These are expected to more than offset the competitive market dynamics in the U.S.","In 2019, we're expecting our adjusted gross margin percentage to be in the range of 53% to 54%, reflecting the benefit of new launches and increased volumes in addition to ongoing benefits from our Mylan integration activities. We also expect global pricing trends to continue to be relatively consistent with what we experienced in 2018.","As you can see on the adjusted EPS bridge on slide 14 in our supplemental earnings material, it was posted on our website today. We're expecting a positive contribution from sales growth driven by new product launches and volume from existing products, partially offset by pricing.","These benefits help fund incremental selling and marketing and G&A investments that support new product launches, as well as geographic expansion of our key global brands in Europe and the Rest of World. In addition, we'll continue to invest in R&D to fund the long-term health of our business.","Finally, we expect interest, tax, shares and FX to have a slightly diluted impact on adjusted EPS in 2019. The year-over-year increase in our adjusted effective tax rate is due primarily to the implementation of tax law changes in markets such as Sweden and Italy, as well as the full phasing in of the tax law changes enacted in the United States at the end of 2017.","For 2019, adjusted free cash flow we expect to generate between $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion. Net of capital expenditures between $250 million and $400 million. The year-over-year decline versus 2018 is primarily driven by the increased investment in working capital required to support our topline growth expectations in the year, as well as investing in our operational capabilities to support over $1 billion in revenue coming from new product launches.","As always, we'll seek to make these investments as efficiently as possible and continue as we move through the year to look for opportunities to maximize our adjusted free cash flow. It's our ability to generate strong free cash flows supported by the durability of our portfolio and the strength of our balance sheet that provides us with financial flexibility to invest in the future of our business.","A quick comment on calendarization as you think about modeling, we expect both total revenues and adjusted EPS to be slightly more heavily weighted to the second half relative to 2018 due primarily to higher profitability and timing of new product launches. In addition, we expect Q1 to contribute slightly less adjusted EPS on a relative basis than the prior year.","As we've discussed in the last few quarters, we're continuing to evaluate metrics other than EPS that better reflect how we manage and measure the performance of our business. As Heather and Rajiv both mentioned, we've created a formal business transformation office to evaluate value creating, as well as value consuming assets.","This office will help shape our road map going forward and will include leveraging financial systems and generating additional metrics that will help us effectively track our performance against this roadmap as we move forward. We'll update you on our progress on this at our Investor Day this fall.","Now with that, we'll open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the line of Elliott Wilbur with Raymond James.","Elliott Wilbur","Thanks. Good afternoon. Question for the team I guess with respect to the step up or elevations in SG&A investment expected relative to historical implies something on the order of $250 million to $350 million of additional investment in absolute dollars and outside of the color commentary you provided throughout the course of the \u2013 your prepared comments. Just wondering if you could go into a little bit more detail on what and where exactly these investments are and what do they enable for you to do that you're not doing currently and how do they enhance your long-term growth for profile? I mean, did it set you up to bring in more assets like YUPELRI and TOBI? Just not really sure how to kind of think about this in terms of sort of how it may change your strategy and some of the growth initiatives going forward?","Heather Bresch","Surely. And I'll start and then anyone on the team that would like to also chime in. I think it's important you kind of teed it up yourself in your question when you said our historical ranges. I think that if I go back several years and look at our historical product portfolio, they're primarily generics, a large number of which were U.S. generics and as you know we pointed out on the chart a large number of those generics were more of that commodity based products.","So if you think about from an SG&A perspective we have trended on the lower end because those types of products that require the sales and marketing behind them and obviously that's kind of how the U.S. generics industry work especially around this commodity type products.","I think that as our evolution from both the acquisitions from Abbott and Meda, which obviously especially from Europe and Rest of World perspective, gave us a much larger portfolio around key brands, as well as OTC products. Those require investment and ongoing investment.","So, while there are certainly some that we're maintaining because we've had them on the market a while. There's others that we see a value and kind of reinvesting more in. Because some of these products and other companies hand weren't getting the same level of investment that we are now saying kind of fruitful returns from.","And then I would say just our evolution in North America both from that commodity type product and to the specialty and complex, as you know, I think as Tony walked through the kind of services and everything that goes around these more complex products, certainly cost more.","And then I think last but not least when you look at things like our YUPELRI launch and products that for the first time you're certainly investing and ramping up that investment before it's paying returns.","So I would say that it synthesizes all of that, it's looking at our portfolio shift, which is certainly responsible for our cost infrastructure shift. I mean, when I look at us amongst our appears. I would still say that this 21% to 22% range is very much on the low end. It's certainly not up there with the typical specialty which are in the high 20s. I think that we believe that this 21, 22 range is kind of is our new step up basis for the kind of investments that we see that like said not just to deliver the revenues for 2019 but certainly beyond. Because as we have seen in especially with these complex products much slower ramp, much longer tail.","So these are products that as we look at the different regions of the world much different contribution but importantly all driving over the longer term, certainly nothing on a quarter by quarter basis.","So I appreciate the question because I think it really gives us an opportunity to make sure people are really looking at our portfolio correctly both our diversification in the United States, as well as importantly our diversification across Europe and rest of world.","Tony Mauro","Thanks, Heather. And I just might add Elliott I think as Heather outlined whether it's YUPELRI in North America along with Biologics our global key brands in Biologics in Europe and Amitiza and Sebivo in Rest of World is about increasing our share of voice, capturing additional market growth and getting more opposition touch points. Really as we invest in these resources not just from a marketing perspective but a selling and resource perspective it\u2019s getting more with more that's really the opportunity we see ahead of us.","Ken Parks","And Elliott I'll just add and maybe this is last comment on this. But you've heard us talk not just on this call but the last couple of calls about you identifying value creation assets, identifying those things that we want to do slightly differently with them.","You can be assured that as we\u2019re looking at this incremental investment to support growth in certain products that we\u2019re putting very, very strong financial analysis around this. And that has been part of what's coming through this business transformation process as looking at not just what a product contributes that may be a gross margin level, but what is it takes for us to support that product whether it be in the launch phase or the life of the product.","So to add on to what Heather and Tony both said is, you can be assured that we are putting financial disciplines around looking at returns on these investments whether it be in the area people or marketing. So we know what we're getting for the money that we do put out there.","Operator","And your next question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein.","Ronny Gal","Good evening. Thank you for taking the questions. So just starting with tax, is that fair that the new tax level you are describing is probably the go forward tax level we should expect from Mylan going forward. And then just want to ask a little bit about the strategic view when I look at some of the struggles we had with the financial markets over time some of that probably is resolvable with \u2013 like a private company. I mean I'm sure you consider the possibility how do you think about it and I'll stop there? Thank you.","Ken Parks","So, Ronny, I'll take the tax question look as I called out in the in the comments there were a couple of statutory changes that happened at the beginning of this year and as we\u2019ve talked about the impact of 2017 Tax Reform Act in the United States.","And said really what happened to us with all of that is we had a minor negative impact whereas a lot of companies who were in the U.S. had a bigger favorable impact moving their tax rate down. The minor negative impact that affected us was really due to the minimum tax calculation that didn't fully come into play in 2018 but does come into play in 2019.","So to your question out is this the new rate for us, I think it's probably close to the new rate. We have a great tax payment a good group of people that are kind of always looking at opportunities to evaluate if we can do something slightly differently, but I think that tax rate is probably the right thing to think about for us today.","Heather Bresch","Yeah. And Ronny as far as the strategic committee is concerned, so as I have said previously the committee is looking at lots of things and everything and is you should expect as they put that note out there it was to look at anything and everything that could unlock value. And while I don't want to speak for the committee it is my understanding that I think they're nearing completion of the review.","Operator","And your next question comes from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much. Just two quick ones here. First, we\u2019re seeing a wider range of earnings for the guidance then we see in the past. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on what's behind this and maybe talk through some of the bigger swing factors in this year's guidance. And the second one is, I just want to come back to the SG&A discussion. I guess my question here will you be able to evaluate this year of these investments rather than the impact you could expect or is this a longer-term process that you\u2019ll be able to evaluate the spent. And the type of spent coming here is this spend that you kind of turn off and on quickly if you're seeing areas is this working or isn\u2019t working or treating about the small but sales rep and headcount that may be a little bit harder to scale down if you're not seeing the return? Thank you.","Heather Bresch","Okay. Chris, I\u2019ll start off and then I\u2019ll Ken or Tony chime in. So I think -- the wider range I think is just reflective of the volatility that we've seen in the marketplace and I think we\u2019re trying to be respectful of that volatility and take kind of everything in consideration. As I said in my opening remarks, while we believe our platform has certainly proven to be more resilient and it\u2019s not immune as we pointed out our 2018 we were at the lower end of that range. And we consider that to be very strong result in light of the fact that we didn't get approval on Advair in the year and we had much lower uptake on Copaxone.","I think if you look at these opportunities, look they\u2019re significant new but they\u2019ve got significant dollars attached to it. So I think we try to take a very balance and measured approach to how we are weighing all those things in the business to make sure we\u2019re kind of putting that right range out there that gives that right flow.","And I think that as we look at the business really I look at our year-over-year growth and continuing that revenue growth in all of our segments it really just came down to making sure we provided those wings for the opportunity. The opportunities and risks that are always associated with this business around the globe and make sure that we\u2019re putting something in there we think accounts for the right level of the assumptions now that we do have Advair approved and how we\u2019re thinking about that uptake.","And like I said what we see happening now with Copaxone and may have taken longer than we wanted to but as Tony pointed out we\u2019re starting to see some better pull through. So it was really just trying to give quite honestly what I think many of you guys have asked us to be mindful of which is the \u2013 all the moving pieces and parts to these business and giving ourselves and making sure we give ourselves that range and that latitude because of just that all the moving pieces and parts.","As far as SG&A, I guess, I would just say look as you would assume Chris those investments you don't get a return on investment dollar for dollar and you\u2019re wanting depending where things are if it\u2019s a new launch like YUPELRI versus like a Creon where we continue to see growth in markets and Influvac. So we\u2019ve got some of these global key brands like I said that while they been in the portfolio for a while. We are saying benefits of investments and those are happening real-time.","So I think it's a little bit of everything there's things there's infrastructure we\u2019re putting in. There are things that we think have a longer term pay off and there's also things that were putting in place that'll help us pull through the products we have coming in the pipeline, because as we have one of the largest complex product pipelines out there. And so a lot of this groundwork will help us pull through what will be needed as far as services or infrastructure around these products as we move forward with our portfolio of mix.","Rajiv Malik","Yeah. Let me add that to your last point about switch on, switch off yes in small some of the smaller countries the emerging countries where we see there are limited period opportunities we have that ability to switch on, switch off some of those SG&A expenses just because of using some of the contracted sources in those countries.","Ken Parks","And Chris look I think hopefully you hear as you\u2019re listening to all of this talk about the confidence in the business that really what this comes down to as we brought these businesses together and we\u2019re spending more and more time digging into what's going on in the business and what we have as far assets we're excited about the opportunities that we have.","And so as we think about investing -- as we do anytime we invest we\u2019re going to do it with discipline and thoughts and metrics and thinking about where the money is best, but we feel really good about the position that we have the assets to invest in.","Tony Mauro","And maybe just to close it out when you think about the SG&A investments we\u2019re making very strategic from a headcount perspective but good portion of the selling and marketing incremental growth we\u2019re seeing is going to be just ramping up the advertising promotion or somebody\u2019s key assets globally that do have some nimbleness in terms of future spend once we get into a level. We feel like it is grown appropriately.","Operator","And your next question comes from Gary Nachman with BMO Capital Markets.","Gary Nachman","Hi. Good afternoon. So regarding the remediation of Morgantown, how far will that stretch into 2019? I want to understand what's still involved and how long it will persist? And then outside of the issues at Morgantown, have you seen stabilization in the U.S. generic market continue? So far into 2019, what sort of base decline there are you assuming in the guidance? Thanks.","Heather Bresch","I'll start with the stability in the market place. As I pointed out in my opening remarks, I think, it's very difficult to look at the U.S. generic market and paint it with one brush. I think we have said for a while that portfolios are very different and so each company's intersection with what's happened in the marketplace is going to be very different.","There's no question that I think value has been extracted out of the U.S. market place and I think we see that -- we've seen that daily over the course of the last several months especially as you look at consolidation of what's happened with our customers, as well as the ramp up of approvals of that fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth generic for products that as we would characterize in that commodity bucket.","So, for us we have continued to see this mid single-digit decline or erosion in the business and we believe that from our perspective that is holding pretty steady. We think a driver for that for us for Mylan is because as we look at the U.S. generics market, we believe there's three distinct buckets. There's the commodity bucket, specialty bucket and the complex bucket and each of those require a different level of investment, a different up take, as well as different competitiveness in the marketplace itself.","So from our perspective that is -- that diversification in the U.S. business has allowed us to absorb a lot of that volatility and like I said not be immune to it and I think that as we look forward we're kind of still seeing that mid single-digit erosion. I think the biggest difference for us is having the product new launches be able to offset that erosion and that's really been historically what has meant success in this business if your new product launches could offset your volume and price that that's what's made this -- that's what has made this market and I don't think that's changed.","It's just I think the hurdles for some of those approvals have become higher and they're obviously more significant launches. So I \u2013 that\u2019s perhaps a long winded answer but I think it's important that we're not just trying to characterize the entire U.S. generic marketplace and all the players like I said with one brush.","Rajiv Malik","And regarding Morgantown plant, Gary, as I stated earlier, we continue to execute and assess our restructuring and remediation activities at the site to this 2019 and of course we are focused on meeting our commitments to FDA and as well as our customers. Now, as for any negative financial impact on the business, I think, we don't see that anymore as we go into 2019.","As I've mentioned, it's I think largely behind us. We continue to supply from Morgantown our key products. We continue, as we said there's no new big launches or no new launches budgeted in 2019 from Morgantown and also from the materiality point of view only five out of our top 50 North American products today come from Morgantown.","Operator","And your next question comes from Liav Abraham with Citi.","Liav Abraham","Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions on new product revenues. Can you provide the new product revenues in 2019 total and apologies if I don't understand this? But when you talk about $1 billion of new product launch revenues in 2019, is that a $1 billion in total or an incremental $1 billion over 2018? And then any additional color you could provide on the breakdown of new product launch contribution in 2019 would be helpful either on a product basis or geographic basis? Thank you.","Ken Parks","Look, the $1 billion is the total incremental year-over-year benefit of new product launches and it comes from a couple of places and I'll give you kind of the geographic order of magnitude. We had products that we\u2019re launched in 2018, but haven't seen their full 12 months cycle yet. So the carryover benefit of those products is a part of the billion dollars that is new product launches until they hit their one year mark. So that's great because those products are in the market and we have a feel for how they're doing.","Besides that what I would tell you is that out of that $1 billion call it somewhere around three quarters of it is probably in North America and the rest of it is split kind of evenly between Europe and Rest of the World just to kind of give you order of magnitude pieces there.","And then if you want to kind of understand a little bit about the North America piece it will have a portion of that carryover component, but it also as where we have Wixela obviously and that's a significant contributor to new product launches in North America, which once again approval behind us launch is underway and we feel really good about the uptake on that.","As far as contributions from these products, we\u2019ve consistently said we\u2019re not going call out anyone individually but what we said is these products have intended to contribute even with our partner arrangements at or above the Mylan average overall.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jason Gerberry with Bank of America.","Jason Gerberry","Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, the first question on biosimilars so has the strategy and a product like Fulphila in the U.S. fundamentally changed from last year or initially you may be the expectation was the GPOs would have driven the pull-through on a product like this and now the view was it to need a sales force much like the strategy of the Pfizer\u2019s and Novartis of the world. And then also can you comment just how think about the generic Advair launch. Can you supply and have we tapped the market do you expect pharmacies to really drive direct switch and would you have unlimited Part D access? Thanks.","Tony Mauro","So maybe just Jason I think well first of all we had a very focused sales force on that product since launch we\u2019re going to expand it because we see additional opportunities not just with this particular product on oncology but a whole breadth of products that we have today and in the future in oncology.","So I don't that the strategy is changed tremendously from that product perspective we\u2019re seeing over 15% market share growth to that pre-filled syringe business, we've been very selective on the customer's who went after and I think we feel very, very good about our performance of that launch and how it\u2019s going to flow into 2019 and you had asked additionally about Advair.","Rajiv Malik","Yeah. And regarding Advair we have a state of art dedicated facility, which is up and running and producing and shipping the product today and if opportunity comes we have enough capacity to supply the market.","Tony Mauro","And maybe just commenting on your Med D comment we know 50% of Advair usages is in the Med D space. I can tell you from products like Glatiramer we launched, initially we\u2019re being block out at the Med D program with Wixela out of the top 10 Med D plans we have full parity and access on eight or 10 them at this moment two weeks of launch. So we feel very good about the initial ramp. We feel very confident about our capabilities from a supply and our pharmacy mix that we got from a customer perspective And we have high hopes moving forward.","Operator","And your last question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. I had one for Ken and one for Heather if I may. Ken there is a lot of feedback from Mylan investors on the low end of EBITDA guidance, especially also from the debt investors. So my question to you is this in 2019 the low end of revenue guidance is actually just about the same as 2018 actual revenues. So in that context why is the low end of EBITDA guidance so much lower than the actual 2018 EBITDA, especially considering SG&A should potentially be not as much if the revenues are not tracking towards the type of growth they should put up? And Heather was just curious if you could add some color on a couple of recent departures on the Chief Legal Officer and the Head of Europe side? Thank you very much.","Ken Parks","So look I'll start with the modeling question around SG&A and revenues and EBITDA but look its right now what we're targeting as we go into this year is SG&A at a rate of 20% to 21% -- 21% to 22%, I am sorry.","And as we do that that clearly is a level of investment on even the low end revenues where you said they were the same at the low end as what we have this year but it is an increased step up investment. So that drives EBITDA bit lower and it's very simply that.","So now to your point around, as we move through the year we'll certainly watch these investments and ensure we're getting back from them what we're expecting to get and we may pull back a little bit on some of that investment, we may reallocate it somewhere else where we see it taking hold even stronger. But effectively I'd say it's pretty straight forward map, the same revenues with a slightly higher SG&A at either point on the range gives you lower EBITDA.","Heather Bresch","And as far as departures, I guess I'll just start with saying I think as having I'll say the longest which would I think fairly be accurate; the longest tenure management team here in continuity as you know, that's important to us and we think it's absolutely been one of the important aspects of Mylan's success and executing on our strategy and quite honestly what we have in front of us.","As you know, yeah, we've had a couple departures starting with our Chief Legal Officer. I think not only is he just going back to private practice in D.C., but as we noted we're going to continue having a relationship in advisory capacity. So that's just kind of in the normal course.","And as far as others throughout the organization, I mean, as you can imagine we've got over 30,000 employees and we have a lot of people coming and going. I think, certainly, like I said when you look at the top level of this executive management, we've been the longest tenured out there and that's very important and we've built a lot of great bench strength under us.","So the exciting news is there continues to be great opportunities for current employees, as well as we're always looking at balancing that with bringing in new talent and new perspective. So I couldn't be more excited about the team we have and the opportunities to bring some new hires in. So, thank you. Thank you for asking that.","Operator","This does conclude today's Mylan fourth quarter 2018 earnings call and webcast.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host, Ms. Kris King, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kris King","Thank you, Janine. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Mylan's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Sheehan.","During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements relate to, among other matters, the proposed acquisition of Mylan of Abbott Laboratories non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business; our expected or targeted future financial and operating performance, results, metrics and plans and expectations related thereto; the ability to obtain regulatory approvals and planned launches of and anticipated exclusivity periods for new products.","Because forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties, actual future results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the timing and accounting of tax treatments of the proposed acquisition; conditions of the completion of the proposed acquisition, including the receipt of approval of Mylan's shareholders; the terms and timing of the regulatory approvals required for the proposed acquisition; costs and other challenges of the integration of Abbott's non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business by Mylan; the possibility of higher operating costs and business disruptions following the proposed acquisition; the impact of competition; situations where we manufacture, market and\/or sell products, notwithstanding unresolved allegations of patent infringement; any regulatory, legal or other impediments to our ability to bring new products to market; and those set forth under Forward-looking Statements in today's earnings release and the risk factors set forth in our Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2013.","We undertake no obligation to update any statements made today whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Today's call should be listened to and considered in its entirety and understood to speak only as of today's date.","In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are presented in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance. Please refer to today's earnings release, which is available on our website, as well as the SEC website, as it contains detailed reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to those directly comparable to GAAP financial measures.","Before I turn the call over to Heather, let me also remind you that the material in the call, with the exception of the participant questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's expressed written permission. An archived copy of today's call will be available on our website later today and will remain available for a reasonable amount of time.","With that, I'll now like to turn the call over to Heather Bresch.","Heather Bresch","Thank you, Kris. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Mylan delivered a solid performance in the second quarter, with all of our regions and businesses reporting year-over-year growth, including double-digit increases by our Specialty and Rest of World businesses.","Sales totaled approximately $1.8 billion, up 8% on a constant-currency basis and right in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS rose 1% to $0.69, which was at the upper end of our guidance range. We were able to deliver these results despite the ongoing delays in approvals of key products by the FDA, once again, demonstrating our ability to leverage our global platform and commercial opportunity.","Our ability to consistently deliver on our commitments reflects the dedication and the hard work of our employees around the world. And on behalf of Mylan's board and our entire management team, I'd like to thank them for a job well done. I'd also like to greet Abbott's employees, who will be joining us as part of the deal, and look forward to welcoming you to the Mylan family.","Now I'd like to walk through the commercial performance of our businesses. In our Generics segment, we delivered revenues of $1.53 billion, a constant-currency increase of 6% as compared to the second quarter of 2013. In North America, sales totaled $737 million, up 3% year-over-year. This underscores the broad-based strength of our overall business, given the delays in product approvals that I mentioned. So we look forward to the contributions these approvals will make.","In Europe, sales totaled $396 million, a 5% constant-currency increase compared to the second quarter of '13. We continue to be encouraged by the year-over-year growth we've seen over the last couple of years, and look forward to the addition of the complementary commercial platform we are acquiring through the Abbott acquisition, which we believe will only further enhance our growth prospects for this region.","In our Rest of World, sales were up 11% year-over-year, constant currency, totaling $396 million. Our ARV franchise continues to drive this double-digit growth, as does our Japan business.","As for Specialty, sales were up 22% year-over-year, totaling $288 million. This was driven both by market expansion for EpiPen, as well as price. Our market share remains stable at about 90%, and we continue to expect double-digit growth for the rest of 2014 for the market and for EpiPen, which remains on track to become this year our first billion-dollar product.","We continue to pursue initiatives that drive education and promote access to EpiPen. For example, all 50 states now allows students to carry their Auto-Injectors to school, and 45 states have passed laws or regulations that allow or mandate schools to stock undesignated pens.","We also continue to invest in our very important organic growth drivers, which are key components to delivering on our target of at least $6 in 2018. Rajiv will update you on some of these shortly.","Additionally, the Abbott transaction not only complements our existing strategy by hitting on many of our key drivers, but it also positions us to potentially accelerate achieving our $6 target. Abbott builds on our strong momentum, expands and diversifies our business in our top 10 markets outside of the U.S. and clearly positions Mylan for our next phase of growth. The anticipated and financial flexibility created by this transaction immediately positions us to execute on highly strategic and financially accretive transactions in the near term.","With that said, given the tendency of the Abbott transaction and management's current activities around additional strategic opportunities, we will be postponing our Investor Day until a later date.","As for our outlook for the rest of 2014, we are narrowing our guidance range for revenue to $7.8 billion to $8 billion and for adjusted diluted EPS to $3.25 to $3.45 per share. This reflects the delays we have been experienced as FDA implements FDASIA. Given where we are in the year, we will not fully realize the annualized impact of key product launches in 2014 that we still are anticipating by year end. We now expect to fully realize the benefits from these products in 2015.","This guidance also reflects launching Copaxone by the end of the year. However, even without the launch of Copaxone in the fourth quarter, we would still expect to be within our guidance range for the year.","With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv to update you on our growth drivers.","Rajiv Malik","Thank you, Heather. And good morning, everyone. I would like to provide an update on a few of our key growth drivers. I'll start with our generic Advair program.","At our Investor Day last year, we provided a detailed overview of our progress on this subject, especially as it relates to our manufacturing capability. Since then, here's what we have accomplished:","First, we have validated our science further on a clinical scale. Second, we have initiated our clinical trial activities. Third, we have initiated the validation of our production scale manufacturing. Fourth, we continue to have a very productive dialogue with FDA around the science.","In conclusion, we continue to expect to have the first AB-rated substitutable generic form of Advair to the market in 2016.","Now let me turn to Copaxone. We continue to work diligently with the FDA on our application, and I can assure you that the approval of a generic Copaxone is one of the highest priorities for the agency. They are well aware of the importance of the providing patients with access to a generic version of this product as soon as possible.","In terms of our ANDA, we have completed everything that has been asked of us, including completing and providing the agency with a comprehensive gene expression studies, encompassing the entire genome. We also comprehensively addressed every issue raised by Teva in their seventh citizen petition, including the questions about Mylan's formulation.","Let me be very clear, there are maybe 13 other formulations of generic Copaxone that they have procured outside of the U.S., but they are not testing Mylan's product, and they do not have access to our ANDA.","With respect to legal cases, there is ongoing litigation in India brought by Teva against Natco, which is yet another attempt by Teva to block U.S. generic Copaxone competition. They have made similar arguments to the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking an injunction, and that court rejected Teva's request for an injunction. Out of the respect to Indian courts, we will not further comment on this matter other than to say we think that Teva's legal efforts seeking an injunction in India are likely to be as ineffective as their efforts in the U.S. courts.","I will close by drawing to your attention that the U.S. Solicitor General's brief in Teva's case pending before U.S. Supreme Court states that \"it appears likely that the Federal Circuit would ultimately reaffirm its conclusion that a patent is indefinite\" even if the Supreme Court adopts a new standard of review. The Supreme Court hearing is scheduled for October 15.","We also continue to make good progress on our biologics and insulin programs, and look forward to providing additional updates on these in the future. Let me now turn the call over to John.","John D. Sheehan","Thanks, Rajiv. Today, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures, and I refer you back to Kris's comments at the beginning of today's call regarding our use of adjusted measures.","I'd like to begin today by walking you through our second quarter financial results, which, as Heather indicated, is in line with our expectations from the beginning of the quarter and as stated at the time when we announced the date of this call. These results represented yet another strong quarter for our company with contributions from all regions.","Our Q2 results were achieved as a result of a strong performance at our Specialty segment, where revenues increased by over 20% in the current quarter and by our continued double-digit constant-currency revenue growth in our Rest of World region, driven by our Indian operations. In addition, our North American Generic business continues to generate solid results despite continued delays in key product approvals in the United States.","Starting at the top of our income statement. Total revenues for the quarter were $1.8 billion, an increase of approximately 8% when compared to revenues of $1.7 billion in the prior year. Our revenue growth in the second quarter was the result of a 22% increase in our Specialty segment, driven by the strength of EpiPen.","For the 6 months of 2014, total revenues increased to approximately $3.6 billion as compared to $3.3 billion in the first 6 months of 2013, an increase of 8% on a constant-currency basis. The Generic and Specialty segments contributed equally to the revenue growth in the year-to-date period, and we now expect our total revenues for 2014 will be in the range of $7.8 billion to $8 billion.","Looking at our operating profitability measures. Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter of 2014 was a very strong 50%, up over 100 basis points from the same prior year period despite the lack of significant new product launches in North America. Our strong margins are the result of growth in our EpiPen Auto-Injector, combined with the benefits and efficiencies of our vertically integrated operating platform.","For the 6 months ended June 30, adjusted gross margins remained relatively constant at approximately 50% when compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $410 million for the second quarter, down slightly from the prior year, primarily as a result of investments we've made in R&D and support infrastructure during the second quarter.","Adjusted operating income for the 6 months ended June 30 increased to $806 million as compared to $797 million in the prior year. R&D expense on an adjusted basis was $139 million for the second quarter or approximately 8% of total revenues and near the upper end of our guidance range. As I indicated during our first quarter earnings call, we expected R&D spending to increase throughout the year as we continue to invest in our biologics and respiratory programs. For the 6-month period, adjusted R&D expense was $256 million or approximately 7% of revenues, and our guidance range for adjusted R&D expense for the full year remains between 7% and 8% of total revenues.","At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was $374 million for the second quarter and $727 million for the 6-month period. While adjusted SG&A for both the quarter and year-to-date period were at the upper end of our guidance range of 18% to 20% of total revenues, we do expect to be within the range for the full year.","The growth in SG&A and R&D demonstrated our continued investment in important drivers of our business, including our direct-to-consumer advertising related to EpiPen and the anticipated new product launches within North America, including the planned launches of Copaxone and Celebrex.","Adjusted EBITDA for the 3 months ended June 30 was $488 million, an increase of 6% when compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the 6 months ended June 30 was $948 million, a slight increase when compared to the prior year. And we continue to forecast adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion for the full year.","Adjusted interest expense for the second quarter was $64 million and $128 million for the 6-month period. Adjusted interest expense was essentially flat when compared to the prior year quarter and year-to-date period, despite approximately $1.9 billion of additional borrowings in 2014 as compared to 2013. We continue to benefit from low short-term interest rates, which has offset the increase in interest expense from higher long-term debt. As of June 30, 2014, the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was slightly below 4%.","Second quarter adjusted net income was $273 million or $0.69 per share, a slight increase from our Q2 2013 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.68 per share and in line with our expectations. For the 6-month period, adjusted net income was $534 million or $1.34 per share.","As Heather indicated earlier, we've narrowed our EPS guidance range for the year to $3.25 to $3.45 per share, with a midpoint of $3.35 per share. This guidance range includes Q4 launches of Copaxone and Celebrex. Our assumptions for Copaxone take into account the patient conversion to Teva's new formulation and assumes an additional generic competitor in the market at market formation.","In terms of the quarters, we expect Q3 EPS to be between $0.90 and $0.95 per share. This implies Q4 EPS of over $1 per share, which is driven by seasonally strong results in certain markets, as well as the launch of Copaxone. Furthermore, even without the launch of Copaxone in the fourth quarter, we would still expect to be within our guidance range for the year.","Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Year-to-date cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis was $559 million, which is up 98% from our 2013 comparative amount of $283 million, leaving us with unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at June 30 totaling $194 million. We're still forecasting our full year 2014 adjusted operating cash flow to be within our guidance range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion.","Capital spending for the 6 months ended June 30 was $153 million as we continue to invest in our strategic growth drivers, and we expect full year capital expenditures to be within a range of $350 million to $400 million. At the end of the quarter, our gross debt to EBITDA leverage ratio is approximately 3.3:1. We continue to have ample borrowing capacity and financial flexibility and remain committed to our 3:1 long-term target for gross leverage, which represents an investment-grade credit profile.","Further, as Heather stated earlier, we continue to be active in the M&A space and remain committed to our stated M&A parameters that any transaction would be accretive to earnings and maintain our long-term gross leverage targets. As you are aware, our financial flexibility will be significantly enhanced through the proposed Abbott transaction, which opens up even more opportunities to create additional value for our shareholders.","To summarize, our second quarter was strong and provides yet another example of our ability to effectively and efficiently manage our business while producing solid results for our shareholders.","That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Not easy to limit myself to 2 questions, but I will try. First, John and Heather, so you're postponing your Analyst Meeting that was scheduled for September, even though that meeting was scheduled just a couple of weeks before you announced the Abbott deal. I'm wondering if you can provide a little bit more color as to why is it, all the noise around tax inversions that is -- is that a reason? And it also seems that you're hinting at other strategic activities. And John, if you could just talk to how you're able to get another deal done before the Abbott deal, which doesn't close until the first quarter of next year? And then the second question is for Rajiv on Copaxone, what are the gating items on Copaxone approval, generic Copaxone approval? Since it sounds like you're very close.","Heather Bresch","Well, the good news is you figured out how to get 6 questions down to 2. But anyway, I will kind of kick it off here, Jami. First, I guess what I'd say is taking kind of everything into consideration and wanting to come with a full picture of what now the Abbott-Mylan combination will make, we just felt that it would be the best interest to be able to come with that full picture. And in the meantime, we absolutely are busy looking at everything, I think. We've teed that up when we announced the Abbott transaction that we believed that it would be a great -- not only a great strategic transaction, but also financial in the sense that it really sets us up to have extreme and significant cash flow and financial flexibility to immediately to be able to strike and to do other transactions. So I think that just with everything taken into consideration, we thought that the best way to come in front of you guys and give that full picture, how 1 plus 1 equals 4, would be at a later date. And I think that as far as everything else goes, the noise around inversions and everything else, Jami, I guess, the only thing I'd say is there's tremendous speculation. And really, at this point in time, that's all it is. And we are continuing to move forward. We feel solid about our transaction and look forward to laying it all out there for you guys.","Rajiv Malik","And, Jami, on Copaxone, I think nothing is due -- as we just mentioned, nothing is due from the science perspective from us now. We have provided every scientific evidence, including detailed analytics, biological testing and the last, the gene expression study to FDA. FDA had taken its time to review it. Any day, we are expecting to hear from FDA about -- if there is any other open issue. But I mean, we remain very confident that we have addressed every aspect of the science. And now, in fact, it's -- from our point of view, these are few administrative hurdles, which they need to go through just because it's the first generic ANDA.","John D. Sheehan","And I would just close, as Heather indicated, in her comments about looking at everything that -- within that there is nothing that would preclude us from being able to do certain transactions here in the near term.","Operator","The next questioner is Douglas Tsao with Barclays.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So to start with, in terms of the Generics business on products. It was noticeable to me that we didn't get commentary on Lidoderm. And I was just wondering if you could provide an update on the status of your application there and your sort of confidence in terms of getting an approval by year end. Or is that something that you're now thinking is going to happen next year? And then, John, just curious in terms of the guidance, I noticed that you obviously take down the revenue range, as well as the EPS range. But the adjusted EBITDA range seemed to stay the same. So if you could just sort of walk through some of the moving parts that sort of are driving that dynamic.","Heather Bresch","Okay. So I'll start off with Lidoderm. I'll tell you, Doug, we absolutely have every bit of confidence in our Lidoderm application. And I guess, I don't want to sound like a broken record and maybe that's why I didn't call it out. There's absolutely no science issue. There's no issue with our patch. It is truly administrative. I think as we continue to work with FDA, they're struggling in some regard to prioritize and continue to prioritize the most meaningful ANDAs. And obviously, as Rajiv said, Copaxone isn't at the top of their list. We very much hope we have it this year. I mean, I -- and to your point, we have several key launches, key products that we're still anticipating this year. So I would say that we've taken all that into consideration and probability weighted all of these ones that we're still anticipating to get. And like I pointed out, the good news is, they're going to come. And while we may not get the full benefit this year of what they're going to contribute to our business, we certainly will get that full benefit next year.","John D. Sheehan","And just with respect to EBITDA, Doug, what I would say to you is, is that when you look at narrowing of the range that -- our guidance range that we provided here this quarter, that the narrowing was a $0.05, $0.06 differential. And when we looked at the other moving parts associated with EBITDA and where EBITDA was both initially and now in the range, we believe that we'll stay within the range for EBITDA and, therefore, didn't need to make an adjustment to that guidance.","Operator","The next questioner is Greg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregory B. Gilbert - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I have 2 for you, Heather. The press release talks about highly strategic and financially accretive transactions in the near term. So would you like to set the bar for us on the likelihood of a deal or deals before Abbott closes? Or offer any other color to straighten people out on what that specifically means? And my second question on inversions, of course, is just what is your personal view on whether the Treasury Department can and will do something soon to materially affect inversions? Or is it just noise and speculation as you suggest?","Heather Bresch","Sure. So, Greg, I'll say this, we absolutely are busy looking at strategic and financially accretive transactions. I'm not going to give a time frame. I think that we're active. And I think as John and I both noted, there's nothing precluding us from announcing or closing a deal prior to the Abbott closing. But with that being said, we don't have a gun to our head. Again, we're able to really look. There's a lot of opportunities out there, and we are looking at everything. And I think that depending on timing and depending on all the different moving pieces and parts, if we can strike sooner rather than later, I can assure you that, that's what our interests are. As far as inversions, I guess, here's my two cents worth on it. I think there is a lot of noise, in the sense that the facts have really been sheltered. I know I've joked before, \"Don't let the facts get into the way of a good story or a good campaign.\" And I truly believe there's such an uneducated dialogue going on around inversions right now that is going to be very, I believe, difficult for an Executive Order at the Treasury Department to do something that doesn't just truly jeopardize foreign entities, including the companies who have inverted and just companies that are foreign that do a significant amount of business in the United States, which contributes to huge jobs. There's treaty aspects. So I think as much as the Senate may want to vote on something to take it back into the field and be able to say to their constituencies they're trying to do something, I just continue to think the odds of anything getting done and looking at one little snapshot of our tax code, which needs significantly reformed, is unlikely.","Operator","Your next question is from Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Harold Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Heather, can you give us a little more color on kind of what's going on in Europe, in France and in Asia, and specifically Agila, which is still a relatively new acquisition and how that's been performing? And then second question is just on EpiPen. I thought it was just a really big quarter. And I know we usually get a big seasonal quarter in the third quarter. So I was just curious, was there any strange inventory build this quarter that might have taken away from what we should normally expect as the big third quarter? Or is this really just underlying demand?","Heather Bresch","Sure. So as I mentioned in my remarks, we stay very encouraged. We've continued to see year-over-year growth throughout Europe, especially our largest markets, France, Italy. And obviously, the Abbott transaction just allows us to build even more critical mass around the physician channel and the opportunity for us to now leverage that business between the pharmacy channel and physician channel in those markets throughout Europe. So we're extremely excited, not only about what are now core business and the stability around our core business. But now what we're going to be able to add to it, I think, is going to be significant and truly allow us to get the 1 plus 1 equals 4 out of Europe. As far as Agila goes, it's right in line with what our expectations have been around Agila. We're continuing to be able to get significant product approvals and launches. And like I said, the Agila business is really hitting on all cylinders, and everything remains on track from an operational perspective, as well as a commercial prospect. As far -- in Asia, as I mentioned, our ARV business continues to drive that double-digit growth, as well as Japan. Japan has -- our partnership with Pfizer continues to be -- really exceed our expectations. We've seen double-digit growth in Japan. So that's really driving -- like I said, those 2 are really driving that double-digit growth. As far as EpiPen goes, there, we do not see any inventory build or any issues. We do see significant demand. It's continued to -- third quarter has continued to not disappoint. As far as the market expansion and the demand for this product, I think that our direct-to-consumer advertising has continued to drive great demand, as well as all of our legislative efforts knocking down the barriers to have access to this important drug. So I think all in all, everything -- we couldn't be more excited about the continued opportunity we have around EpiPen.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a follow-up on some of the earlier business development comments. Can you just talk about the tax rate implications if you were to acquire let's say another x U.S. branded business prior to the Abbott close? I guess, can you leverage in that situation your new tax structure? And then just a bigger-picture question. One of the little pushbacks we've been hearing from investors post the Abbott deal is this kind of trade-off between earnings accretion and organic growth as you maybe look at additional established product divisions. How do you think about that balance when you consider maybe some of the assets that have been talked about in the market that might be lower growth, but have very strong financial returns as compared to maybe higher multiple, higher growth assets that could support higher growth for the overall business and multiple expansion? Just how are you debating those options as you look at assets out there?","Heather Bresch","Chris, I think that's what we try to stress. And I think, obviously, just to your point, what Abbott really sets us up for is, one, what we're able to do with this business and combining it with our existing business and infrastructure with our operational excellence and being able to really do more with that asset than it was in its current setting. And I think that in addition, obviously, it gives us significant financial flexibility to tee up some of these other transactions that we've been talking about. I think that there is a balance as we continue to look at things that will allow us to build that cash flow, and we're certainly looking at things that both have a high growth rate, as well as those that still may build or contribute to this financial flexibility as long as it complements and has strategic rationale. I think what we've been solid behind is that, that comes first and foremost. And the other things, whether inversion, whether synergies, that, that is a byproduct. But at the end of the day, if it's got the right strategic rationale and we believe tees up for our shareholders the greatest return and lets us have the most flexibility is really what our priorities are as we look at these transactions. John, do you want to hit the tax?","John D. Sheehan","Yes. On the tax side, to the extent that we were to execute on the transaction prior to the close of the Abbott transaction, which, I believe, is the genesis of the question, I do believe that we track proper tax structuring, and we have a very strong tax team here at Mylan that would be able to do so, you would get maximum benefit out of any maximum benefit leverage from any tax structure. So yes, I think there's a lot of opportunity there on the tax side.","Operator","And our next question is from Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital Markets.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just maybe for John, on the guidance. If we look historically, 3Q has been the strongest quarter. But taking into your 3Q -- your third quarter guidance and then looking at the full year range, it implies possibly an up fourth quarter. And that's even in light of, as you said, not needing a generic Copaxone. Can you just help us walk through if there's anything that we're missing or what the bigger contributors to be to 4Q? And then Heather, just a question on EpiPen. You've previously said that you're going to address -- or you would address the EpiPen life cycle management at the upcoming Analyst Day. And in lieu of not holding that or postponing that, can you give us an update on that?","Heather Bresch","Sure. John, do you want to go first?","John D. Sheehan","Sure. Randall, I think that the Q4 being stronger than Q3 is the combination of the benefit of Copaxone, as well as other expected product approvals in the fourth quarter, as well as the timing of spending throughout the year. And as I indicated in my comments, we do expect that the revised guidance that we provided for the year would be achieved -- the low end would be achieved, without the approval of Copaxone. So it's the combination of Copaxone, new product approvals and timing of spending.","Heather Bresch","And as far as EpiPen goes, so Randall, here's what I'll say because I am looking forward to getting in front of you guys with some of the initiatives that we're working on around EpiPen and really creating -- continuing to enhance access to EpiPen. But I think what I'd first say just to maybe level set or put in context, regardless of what we would do to add to this franchise -- and like I said, there's several different initiatives that would add to the overall franchise strategy -- that we continue to see great brand equity and customer loyalty to the product we have on the market today. And we -- that product will stay on the market today regardless of what else we may bring to the market. So it's not so much -- I know historically, we certainly are all aware of a lot of the brand tactics, with switching and swapping out products. That would not be the strategy around EpiPen because just I think it's a very unique product that has significant, like I said, not only brand equity but customer loyalty to the current drug device that we have. And we just see anything else that we bring just to be additive to the franchise. And like I said, I do look forward to bringing you and sharing those initiatives.","Operator","And the next question is from Sumant Kulkarni with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The first one is when should we start seeing the potential positive financial impact of the recent generic Paxil CR legal development? And the second is on business development. You had singled out the OTC area as one capability that Mylan would like to have. Would you still answer that question the same way? And for John, quickly, would you be willing to dip below investment grade if you had to budget transaction between announcement going to the closing of the Abbott transaction?","Heather Bresch","Okay. So first of all, obviously, we're very pleased with our Copaxone judgment and the injunction that was put into place. And I can assure you, we are doing everything to maximize that opportunity, and that's certainly built into the guidance that we've now given you for the rest of '14. And as far as the OTC channel, we do think that's an interesting channel; certainly, in some respects, even outside the U.S. more than inside the U.S. Because I think as you think about how these channels play against each other in Europe or with each other from a physician channel, a pharmacy channel and that OTC and given the independence of the pharmacies throughout Europe, there are opportunities to build that brand presence on both behind the counter and in front of the counter. So -- and as we stated, the Abbott transaction certainly gives us a beginning foothold on OTC. So I think we've got real opportunities to look at some of these brands that we're now acquiring, as well as perhaps add some products that would be very strategic, but allow us to build upon the Mylan equity through now all channels in Europe.","John D. Sheehan","Yes. And Sumant, I think we, through the -- indicated through the Abbott transaction that our leverage ratio will go down into the 2.3x, 2.4x gross debt to EBITDA, and that opens up substantial financial flexibility to us that we talked about a couple of weeks ago when we announced the Abbott transaction. And therefore, I'd say that we have been consistent that we're committed to our investment-grade credit rating. And I don't see any limitation for our being able to do what we want to do with -- in maintaining that rating.","Operator","The next question is from Elliot Wilbur with Needham & Company.","Elliot Wilbur - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","First question is for Heather with regard to the EpiPen franchise. Obviously, you're seeing a lot of noise in the market and a lot of shifting regarding formulary positioning. And I guess, despite the fact that EpiPen is a dominant product in the category; and sort of the price leader, it still maintained very strong formulary positioning. And I'm just curious sort of what the trend has been in rebating on the product. Whether that strong formulary position has come increasingly at the cost of higher rebates? And maybe you could just sort of talk about kind of ability to grow the products sort of in excess of the Rx volume growth trends that we're currently seeing in the marketplace? And then just as a second question here and just to confirm, Heather, delays in expected product approval activities are purely a function of FDA time lines that don't have anything to do with recent inspection and observations at any of your facilities.","Heather Bresch","Okay. Sure, Elliot. So what I'd say, Elliot, around EpiPen, obviously, when you've got a multiple epinephrine product marketplace, it leads to a more competitive positioning both with the pharmacies, as well as payers. I think that given the breadth and scope of our business that we've been able to manage and to obviously remain very competitive in that structure. But with that being said, we're going to do whatever we need to do to really maintain that market leadership, and like I said, and continue to look at ways that we can enhance and add to this franchise. So I think the strong script trends are just indicative of how much runway room is still out there because I think as we continue to educate, like I said, not only customers but truly everything from schools to establishments on how important to have access to EpiPen is, we just continue to see those campaigns very much take hold and very much continue to drive these script trends throughout the United States. So I think, like I said, it's just indicative of how much runway is left and the return on our capital being very high based on the demand that it's creating in the marketplace. And as far as the delays at FDA, I will absolutely tell you that there are no science issues, we don't have any facility issues, that it is absolutely administrative and timing on the FDA part. And we believe that we've got a couple of approvals that are imminent. So I think that while much slower than we would like, I think that we're just going to continue to have a stream of approvals that certainly are going to reflect what we're telling you right now. But there's absolutely no issue on any other front.","Operator","The next question is from David Buck with Buckingham.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just for Heather, first on the North American business, you talked about the approval delays. Some of the rationale for that? How much of that has been from the changes in GDUFA with backlog and just the trend of getting more complete response letters as opposed to outright approvals? Secondly, can you talk a little bit about pricing in the North American market, and U.S. specifically? And then finally, if we look at the commentary on inversions, Heather, you refer to it as speculation, but it's essentially one administration, one party. And is there anything that's being done on a lobbying basis from GPhA given that potentially 4 out of the top 4 companies would be foreign-owned and\/or inverted? To express your views about potential changes at Treasury or changes with the overall tax law and basically attacking inverted companies?","Heather Bresch","All right, David. So I'll start with North America. I believe that what we're witnessing at FDA really is almost all can be attributed to FDASIA and the implementation of GDUFA. I think they're going through a massive transformation, and I think we're obviously feeling that -- in the short term, that pain. I think in the longer term, it's the absolutely right thing to do. I think it will continue to level set the -- create a level playing field. I think it will raise the bar, and I think that it will continue to give us a tremendous amount of opportunity given our track record and our ability to have a truly reliable, high-quality supply chain. As far as pricing, look, I think that, that stability in our North American -- that core business is certainly why we're able to deliver the results we have today, which, like I said, despite those product delays, we see growth year-over-year. We've seen North America continue to maximize opportunities, not only with our core business. But as other companies have had problems in the marketplace, we've been able to remain very agile and be able to maximize those opportunities as they come our way. So I think the North America business has never been stronger, and that's why I look forward now to just a contribution when we do get these approvals. As far as the inversion, I think as I stated here earlier this morning, there is a lot of speculation. There's a diverse range of things being discussed. And I think, though, at the end of the day, it's going to be very difficult to take one piece of our tax code and try to be punitive for companies that are foreign-based or have chosen inversion. I think that we've been very clear that, that does not mean we'd stop paying U.S. taxes. We're obviously continuing to pay U.S. taxes, as well as a lot of these foreign companies are paying U.S. taxes and creating U.S. jobs. And I think that when you look at our industry, specifically, over 50% -- almost 50% of the products that are sold here in the United States come from outside of the United States. So as we've said, if we wanted to close our borders and not allow any products in -- which seems very impractical, I think that no one has complained about the $1 trillion that our industry has saved our country over the last decade. I think that, that will be continuous. And I think that for us to step back and try to act like we can just buy American, it's impossible in our industry. And that, being punitive and not allow us to be competitive, I do not believe is in our country's best interest, and I hope that prevails at the end of the day, our country's best interest.","Operator","The next questioner is Ken Cacciatore with Cowen and Company.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Heather, just wondering if you can give us as descriptive detail as you can to what you think Mylan will look like in 3 years and what component of Mylan is longer-duration, higher-margin products like an EpiPen?","Heather Bresch","Sure. So look, Ken, I think as you think about the next 3 years, there couldn't be a more exciting time for Mylan. I think when you look at things like our generic Advair, Copaxone, I think when you look at these complex products that we're continuing to bring to the market -- and then you look at EpiPen, but not just EpiPen, you've heard me refer to this franchise strategy. I think as we look at being -- taking an allergy leadership position, I think as you look at our respiratory, I think what you're going to continue to see Mylan doing is really building out excellence in some of these therapeutic categories that allow us to really start positioning full broad-spectrum patient solutions versus just product specific. So I think that, like I said, there couldn't be a more exciting time, I believe, in the history of our company than what we've teed up, the opportunities, what we've invested in, the organic growth drivers. As well as then to complement everything I just said with the transactions that we're looking at. That will just accelerate, I think, some of these opportunities that we have before us. So I think there's not a better time, and I think that Mylan's going to be well, well positioned for significant growth over these next several years.","Operator","Your last questioner will be David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have 2 questions, please. First, with respect to generic Advair, you had mentioned last August at your Analyst Meeting that you plan to file the generic Advair application in the first half of '15. I just wanted to find out if that's still the plan. And second, with respect to development of a new EpiPen device ahead of the June 2015 Teva settlement date, just wanted to get an update on that. And then if I can throw in a tidbit. Just, John, I'm hoping that you could comment on the $21 million Other income in the quarter.","Rajiv Malik","David, on Advair, as we said that every milestone which we have outlined for us, including clinical trial expertise, initiation of clinical trial expertise, but most importantly validation of our production scale manufacturing, everything is on track. But the filing, instead of the second -- first half, it will be in the third quarter of 2015. Not affecting our ability to bring the product in the market in 2016. So yes, there's maybe a month slippage on that or 1.5 months slippage. But everything else, from the science perspective, the dialogue with FDA remains on the track, and it doesn't impact our bring the product in the market to substitute the generic Advair in 2016.","Heather Bresch","And, David, as far as EpiPen is concerned, as I was mentioning earlier, I would really separate. We're not -- I wouldn't link any new product or product switching or any tactics in front of or parallel to this June date. As you know, I think we've been pretty vocal that one, we believe that's a very high barrier to entry for substitutable products to be with us in June. But notwithstanding that, we, as I said, will continue to build upon the brand equity and the customer loyalty we have about our current drug device, and anything that we do would be additive to that and not necessarily correlated to the June date.","John D. Sheehan","And I'll close with other income, David. So other income principally represents things like foreign currency transaction, gains and losses, including on derivatives, interest income, equity earnings. And the $21 million represents a little bit higher amount of foreign currency transaction gains and losses this quarter. It looks larger in comparison to the same quarter of the prior year because we actually had about $9 million of losses in the prior year quarter. So I think the comparison is fairly significant. However, I think if you were to look at other income, we do run pretty consistently in the $16 million to $19 million, $20 million range for other income. And so as I said, this quarter may be slightly larger than others, but it's definitely not out of the ordinary.","So with that, operator, you can close the call. And to all of our investors and analysts, we appreciate your continued support. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's meeting.

Hosting the call today from Mylan is Ms. Kris King, Vice President, Global Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay beginning at 1 p.m., Eastern Time. The dial-in number is (800) 585-8367 or (404) 537-3406 for international callers, with pin number 36921750. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Kris King. You may begin.","Kris King","Thank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Mylan's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; Chief Operating Officer, Hal Korman; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Sheehan.","During today's call, including the Q&A, we will be making numerous forward-looking statements pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements often may be identified by the use of words such as may, will, could, should, would, project, believe, anticipate, expect, plan, estimate, guidance, trends, forecasts, potential, intend, continue and variations of these words or comparable words.","Our forward-looking statements may today, including, among others, statements relating to anticipated business levels; trends in some European countries; planned launches of and anticipated exclusivity periods for new products; our ability to achieve forecasted full year results while absorbing the impact of negative pricing pressures; expectations for capital expenditures; expectations for R&D, SG&A and other spending; our guidance range, future earnings, planned activities, anticipated growth and other expectations and targets for future periods, including our expectations regarding the fourth quarter and for 2012 overall. Because these statements are forward looking, they inherently involve risks and uncertainties, and, accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.","Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors set forth under Forward-looking Statements in our recent earnings press release dated October 25, 2012, as well as the risk factors set forth in our report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2012, and our other SEC filings. You can access our Form 10-Q and other SEC filings, including our earnings press release, which we filed on Form 8-K, through the SEC website at www.sec.gov, and we strongly encourage you to do so.","In addition, during this call, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. It should be noted that non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted revenue, adjusted gross margin and adjusted diluted EPS, should be used only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, or as a superior measure to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP.","Please refer to today's earnings press release, which is available on our website as well as on the SEC website, as it contains detailed reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures we use to our third quarter results prepared in accordance with GAAP.","Before I turn the call over to Heather, let me also remind you that the material in the call, with the exception of the participant questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's expressed written permission.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Heather.","Heather Bresch","Thank you, Kris, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to announce that Mylan has once again delivered an outstanding quarterly performance marked by double-digit growth on both the top and bottom lines.","Our third quarter constant currency revenues rose 20% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 51% to $0.83. I'd like to note that we did more this quarter than we did in all of 2008 with essentially the same assets. This only further highlights the power of our organic growth capabilities. Of course, these milestones could only have been achieved through the hard work, dedication and commitment of all of our employees. On behalf of the Board of Directors and our entire management team, I would like to thank all of them.","Now with 3 very successful quarters behind us this year, we are raising our 2012 adjusted EPS guidance range to $2.50 to $2.60 per share. We also are reaffirming our 2013 target of $2.75 per share and our longer-term target of at least $6 per share in 2018. We expect to provide detailed guidance for 2013 in February when we release our fourth quarter and year-end results. We will discuss our longer-term outlook in July during our Investor Day event, which we will host in New York.","Our ability to deliver consistently strong results, take swift advantage of opportunities and become ever more efficient, all while mitigating risk and absorbing economic headwinds and price cuts, give Mylan a unique profile in this industry. With that said, our expectation of continued growth will come from a combination of things: first, from the continued organic growth of our very strong and powerful existing platform; second, from executing against the strategic growth drivers we outlined during our Investor Day; and third, and importantly, from our ability to continue generating significant free cash flows, which allowed us to accelerate our deleveraging and get to our current 2.6:1 debt-to-EBITDA, well below our target. Therefore, we are actively looking at a number of ways to use our increasing financial flexibility to help us accelerate our longer-term targets and enhance shareholder value.","Against this backdrop, I'd like to walk you now through Mylan's outstanding third quarter performance, which was characterized by strong double-digit revenue growth in our Specialty, North America and Asia Pacific businesses and a return to growth in Europe. In addition, our gross margin increased nearly 400 basis points year-over-year to 52%.","Starting with North America Generics business, we reported third-party net revenues of $831 million, a year-over-year increase of 19% at constant currency. Driving the increase were new product launches during the quarter, which contributed to $258 million and included Valsartan HCTZ in September with 180 days of exclusivity, Modafinil in August and pioglitazone and pioglitazone Metformin also in August, and both with 180 days of exclusivity. The launches offset lower pricing and volume on existing products.","As of the end of the third quarter, we had introduced 47 new products this year in the U.S., including 17 that were first-to-file or limited competition. In Canada, as of the end of the third quarter, we had launched a record 22 new products, revenue from which contributed to favorable year-over-year sales growth in that market.","In addition, revenues from our Institutional business grew by nearly 25% on a constant currency basis during the quarter with new products and higher volumes responsible for most of the growth.","In Europe, we reported third-party net revenues of $326 million, a year-over-year increase of 3% at constant currency. Many of our European markets realized increased sales, an encouraging sign that the region may finally be turning a corner. In addition, I'd note that as of the second quarter, the latest period for which data are available, generic utilization has risen year-over-year in the 19 European countries where we do business. As of the end of the third quarter, Mylan executed 200 country product launches in Europe during the year. These launches, along with favorable volumes on existing products, were the primary drivers of our improved performance during the third quarter. The higher product volumes included double-digit growth in France, Italy and Spain, which offset some lower pricing resulting from government mandates and competitive conditions.","France saw the most significant revenue increase in absolute terms as local currency sales rose 9% compared to last year's third quarter. In addition to new product launches, revenues benefited from the recently signed pharmaceutical convention, which contributed to a 7% point increase in substitution among repertoire-listed products from May to August. We also are seeing growth in the French generics market overall in volume and value, and we remain the market leader.","We observed similar trends in Italy where new products and higher volumes more than offset the impact of government-mandated price reductions. I'd also note that Italy's government has passed a law requiring general practitioners to prescribe INN products for patients starting new treatments for chronic and acute conditions. Italy is one of the fastest-growing generic markets in Europe, and we are the country's fastest-growing major player.","In Asia Pacific, we reported third-party net revenues of $339 million, a year-over-year constant currency increase of 21%. Our Mylan Lab subsidiary in India, along with Japan and New Zealand, all experienced higher third-party sales. India accounted for the majority of the increase due to significant sales growth of finished-dosage-form ARVs and significant growth in API.","In Australia, where we continue to maintain our leadership position, sales were lower operationally due mainly to steep price cuts made by the government during the year.","Sales in Japan rose as higher volumes, mainly in the distributor channel, and new product launches offset NIH pricing cuts that took effect during the first quarter. In addition, we continue to see increased generic utilization.","Also during the third quarter, we announced an exclusive long-term strategic collaboration with Pfizer to drive sustained growth for our combined Generics business in Japan. This unique partnership, unprecedented in our industry, leverages the core strength of both organizations and creates a powerful platform that we expect will be a leader in Japan in terms of scale, scope and quality.","Our Specialty segment, we reported third-party net revenues of $294 million, a year-over-year increase of 37%. Sales of EPIPEN in the U.S. accounted for most of the increase with a growth of more than 50% compared to the same period in 2011. Our third quarter is essentially the strongest for sales of this product, and our growth this quarter came off a very strong quarter last year.","I'd also note that we continue to see our efforts around market expansion pay off. Through the first 9 months of 2012, the percentage of at-risk individuals in the U.S. who have filled a prescription for EPIPEN auto-injector has risen from 7% to 10%. More importantly, the growth potential for this franchise remains significant.","As I move on now to some of our other drivers of growth through 2018, I'd like to reinforce that each driver in our broad basket of opportunities is weighted based on its unique risk-reward profile and projected long-term contribution. Our success and ability to achieve our targets doesn't depend on any one driver, and instead, our success is based on the global scale and leverage we have created and our ability to invest and execute on these opportunities.","With respect to our global Institutional business, we continue to grow and expand our relationships with key customers and invest in the future of this franchise. A few weeks ago, we agreed to purchase an oncology manufacturing facility in India from SMS Pharmaceuticals. The facility will produce active pharmaceuticals and finished dosage forms and begin commercial operation as soon as the FDA completes its inspection, which is expected to occur in the next few months. The transaction should close early in the first quarter of 2013.","With respect to geographic expansion, we launched commercial operations in India in August, entering the market with a comprehensive portfolio of ARV products for the treatment of HIV\/AIDS. We also were selected as a leading supplier of ARV drugs to India's National AIDS Control Organization. I'd note that both of these developments also support our ARV growth driver. And in addition to our expansion into India, we are poised to establish a physical presence shortly in Thailand.","Portfolio diversity is another important growth driver, and we remain excited about the women's health care franchise we are establishing in partnership with Famy Care. During the third quarter, we launched 2 oral contraceptives in Germany. We also launched one this week in Canada. And in addition, we have 34 oral contraceptives pending approval with the FDA and expect commercialization to begin in next year's first quarter.","With respect to our biologics driver, we have continued to advance the development of our 5 lead products. We have held positive meetings with the authorities in the U.S. and Europe to discuss our biologics programs. In addition, we are pleased to report that we initiated our first global Phase III clinical trial on Herceptin in October.","Clearly, Mylan continues to operate and grow from a position of great strength, and we look forward to leveraging that strength further to deliver even more value to our shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John, and I will look forward to responding to your questions.","John D. Sheehan","Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. I refer you back to Kris' comments at the beginning of today's call regarding our use of adjusted measures.","Let me start by saying by any measure, the third quarter of 2012 was an exceptional quarter for Mylan. I would like to highlight upfront some of our financial accomplishments.","Quarterly revenue of $1.8 billion, the highest amount of revenue in any quarter in our company's history, and revenue grew on a constant currency basis in every region of the world including Europe.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.83, more than we earned in all of 2008 and were achieved while continuing to invest in new product development and sales and marketing initiatives.","Adjusted operating cash flow of $469 million, the most ever for our company in one quarter, and free cash flow of $424 million, which allowed us to repay borrowings during the quarter of $459 million.","And to the end of the quarter -- and to end the quarter with a gross leverage ratio of 2.7:1, or 2.6:1 when you consider an additional $100 million of borrowings, which we repaid in early October.","On the heels of this strong quarter, we are once again increasing our range of EPS guidance for the full year 2012. We're now projecting adjusted diluted EPS of between $2.50 and $2.60 per share, increased from our previous range of $2.45 to $2.55 per share. We are also revising upward our free cash flow expectations for 2012. We now expect adjusted operating cash flow to be approximately $1 billion in 2012, which is at the very upper end of our 2012 operating cash flow guidance range of $900 million to $1 billion.","Additionally, as a result of the timing and rationalization of some of our capital programs, our gross capital spending in 2012 is now anticipated to approximate $300 million. The net of these 2 amounts represents our current 2012 free cash flow expectation of approximately $700 million, or $100 million higher than the midpoint of our previously communicated expectations.","Our remaining guidance metrics for 2012 remain unchanged, and I'll walk through each of them in a few minutes. And our targets for 2013 and beyond remain unchanged.","In February, in conjunction with our fourth quarter call, we will provide detailed 2013 financial guidance, which reflects recent developments and our most up-to-date outlook.","So Mylan has never been better positioned as a company. Today, we possess an unmatched vertically integrated footprint, a broad and growing product portfolio with a robust pipeline of future new product launches and longer-term strategic growth drivers such as our respiratory and biologics platforms.","Additionally, though, Mylan possesses today the financial flexibility to take advantage of shareholder value accretion opportunities. With our current leverage ratio now meaningfully below our long-term target of 3:1 and our growing EBITDA, today we have over $4 billion of financial flexibility for earnings accretive transactions. That said, Mylan will never do a transaction merely for the sake of a transaction or only for financial reasons. Any transaction must also be the right transaction strategically. Further, we remain committed to our 3:1 long-term gross leverage target. And if we increase our leverage above this target, we would be committed to deleveraging within an 18-month time frame.","With that introduction, let me now get into the details and walk you through our financial results for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2012. I will also provide an update on our capital structure and liquidity position.","Starting at the top of our income statement, total adjusted revenues for the quarter were approximately $1.8 billion, an increase of 14% over last year's third quarter revenues of approximately $1.6 billion. Year-over-year revenue growth on a constant currency basis was approximately 19%. The 5% unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation primarily reflects a stronger U.S. dollar in comparison to each of the other functional currencies of our major operations mainly in Europe and India.","Our top line growth was driven by higher volumes on a consolidated basis, including significant amounts from our 2012 new product launches as well as favorable sales volumes in Europe and Asia Pacific, which served to more than offset the unfavorable impact of lower pricing throughout the world. In fact, driven by higher volumes and new product introductions, each of the countries in Europe in which we have significant operations, with the exception of Germany, turned in favorable year-over-year constant currency sales growth.","For the first 9 months of 2012, total adjusted revenues were approximately $5.1 billion, an increase of 10% over revenues from the first 9 months of 2011, or 14% on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, our guidance range for total revenues for the full year 2012 is between $6.8 billion and $7.2 billion. Recognizing current exchange rates and using them to forecast the remainder of the year, we expect to be near the low end of this guidance range as a result of the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, however, we are projecting to be closer to the midpoint of the range.","Looking at our operating profitability measures. Adjusted gross margin for the 2012 third quarter at 52% was above our guidance range of 48% to 50% and represented an increase over the same prior year period of nearly 400 basis points. This increase was driven by new product launches and favorable volume and pricing on our EPIPEN auto-injector, partially offset by lower margin on existing products. The current quarter also saw margin improvement from our Indian subsidiary, where sales and gross profit benefited from the effects of a stronger dollar as compared to the rupee as a significant portion of its sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.","For the 9 months ended September 30, 2012, adjusted gross margins were 50% as compared to 48% in the prior year. We currently expect to be at the upper end of our gross margin guidance range for the full year.","Adjusted operating income was $513 million for the third quarter of 2012, a 32% increase from Q3 2011 and up 29% from the second quarter of 2012. The year-over-year increases, which is primarily the result of the favorable gross profit, was realized in spite of increased levels of investment in both R&D and SG&A.","R&D expense for the quarter on an adjusted basis was $104 million, or approximately 5.8% of total revenues, and up approximately 51% from the prior year. This increase was mainly a result of ongoing spending with respect to our respiratory and biologics program, including clinical studies.","At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was $324 million for the quarter, or approximately 18% of total revenues, and up approximately 5% over the prior year. The increase in SG&A in the current quarter is due in large part to increased selling and marketing in our Specialty franchise. Also contributing to the year-over-year increase were higher payroll and related costs as we continue to build out our infrastructure platform in certain targeted areas.","For the 9-month period, adjusted R&D expense was $277 million, up 28% over the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, R&D expense to date for 2012 is 5.5%. Our guidance range for R&D expense for the full year is between 5.5% and 6.5% of total revenues, and we continue to believe that the full year spend will be at or slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range.","SG&A expense on an adjusted basis for the 9 months ended September 30, 2012, was $964 million, an increase of nearly 10% and within our full year guidance range of 18% to 20% of total revenues.","Adjusted EBITDA was $567 million and $1.4 billion for the 3- and 9-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively. We expect to be near the middle to upper end of our guidance range of $1.75 -- of $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion for the full year.","Moving on to our consolidated, nonoperating financial metrics. Adjusted interest expense for the third quarter of 2012 was $61 million. We continue to benefit from low short-term interest rates. As of September 30, 2012, the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was approximately 5%. We continue to use interest rate swaps in order to target a long-term 70-30 fixed-floating debt portfolio, which we believe is an optimal ratio.","Adjusted interest expense for the 9-month period was $183 million and is forecasted to be at the low end of the guidance range of $245 million to $265 million for the full year.","Our adjusted effective tax rate in the current quarter was 26% compared to 27% a year ago. Our full year 2012 tax rate range is between 26% and 27%, and we continue to believe that we will be at the lower end of this range for the calendar year 2012.","Third quarter adjusted net income was $341 million, or $0.83 a share, a 51% increase from our Q3 2011 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.55 per share. For the 9 months, adjusted net income was $820 million, or $1.94 per share, a 28% increase over the same prior year period.","As I mentioned previously, our guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS is now $2.50 to $2.60 per share. Our estimate of diluted shares for the full year is approximately 420 million.","Turning to our cash flow metrics. Cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis, which takes into account the special items which are outlined in our press release, was approximately $818 million for the year-to-date period and a very strong $469 million for the quarter. Our GAAP cash flow from operations for the current quarter and year-to-date period was a very strong cash inflow of $460 million and $652 million, respectively, and left us with unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaling $366 million. As noted earlier, we are forecasting our full year 2012 adjusted operating cash flow to be approximately $1 billion, the high end of our guidance range.","We have been very focused throughout 2012 on operating working capital. On a constant -- on constant currency net sales growth of 19% in the third quarter and 14% through the first 9 months of 2012, we have been able to limit the growth in our operating working capital to approximately 9%, exclusive of FX impacts, as we continue to bring operational efficiencies to our global platform.","Third quarter capital spending was $61 million, bringing the total for the year-to-date period to nearly $160 million. And as a result of the timing of planned expenditures, we expect full year capital expenditures to approximate $300 million.","As I mentioned before, these updated estimates yield a current free cash flow estimate of $700 million for the year, which is $100 million stronger than our previously communicated expectation as we continue to generate an increasing amount of cash flow from our global platform.","To summarize, our third quarter exceeded even our high expectations and, as anticipated, positions us for a very strong finish to 2012. Our strong track record for organic growth, coupled with the long-term growth drivers which Heather discussed, and our significant financial flexibility all translate into what should be an exciting 2013 and beyond for Mylan.","That concludes my remarks. I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Maria?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Marc Goodman of UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, hi, a couple of questions. First, on the U.S. business, which obviously had a fantastic quarter, there were just a lot of launches. And given Diovan and Actos, I actually would have thought revenues would have been even a little higher. So maybe you can just comment on some of the launches there and just the absolute amount of the way we should be thinking about that. Second, Europe, obviously great news there. Can we talk about profitability and how that has changed throughout the year and what you're doing there to increase profitability? And then third, can you just talk about the Institutional business a little bit more? How many new products should we be expecting to launch out of that? And how big a business are you looking to build there?","Heather Bresch","Sure. So Marc, I'll start with the U.S. So I guess I'd like to first start off by saying against our estimates, our U.S. business performed right in line with where we thought it would be. So while we absolutely had a significant amount of launches that we forecasted and projected at the beginning of the year, that '12 would be a great year for our U.S. Generics business. I think that if you look at the timing of the launches throughout the quarters, and some of that pull-through even from launches we had earlier in the year, so all I can tell you is that absolutely performed in line with where we thought it would. We think it still is showing strength in the base business as well as our continued launches that we have for the remainder of the year. So from our perspective, U.S. business, hitting on all cylinders. Europe profitability, I think as we have talked about in the past that we constantly, through this entire macroeconomic situation throughout Europe, have balanced our top and bottom line growth. You've heard me quarter after quarter coming and saying we weren't going to chase the bottom, that there's been irrational behavior and that we would continue to hold steady and control what we can control. So in this period of time, we've done just that. We've continued to increase the profitability around our cost of goods by continuing to vertically integrate and be 100% responsible for our global supply chain. We've continued to make sure that we're structured in the right way with some of the evolving businesses and as they are continuing to change in the different countries. And I think most importantly, and why I wanted to point out in my script, that in all the countries we're doing business, we see an increase in generic conversion. And I think that should be the brightest spot of all because what it shows is that governments very much are beginning to recognize the long-term sustainability that generic utilization brings versus a onetime price cut. So we've seen additional initiatives in Italy, we've seen additional initiatives in France that are bringing those back up. So from my perspective, we certainly have always maintained the need to balance profitable and revenues. I think that our results this quarter are paying off from how we're operating our business in Europe. And lastly, on the Institutional side, in February, we showed our Institutional business being an important strategic growth driver for us. We are continuing to invest in that business. We have numerous launches. We're continuing to very much accelerate our own internal R&D pipeline around this businesses globally. So all I can say is that we certainly are continuing to invest and continue to see this as a very important growth driver for us in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Heather, both you and John, I think, were the most clear about the company's increased appetite for pursuing an accretive deal given the increased financial flexibility of the balance sheet. I'm wondering if you can just -- am I reading that right? In previous conference calls, we've talked about options on the table to enhance shareholder value: share buybacks, bringing down debt, strategic deals. But what I'm hearing from you today is I think a more outspoken commitment or desire to pursue something strategic. And then secondly, I'm very intrigued with the partnership that you signed with Pfizer in Japan, and I'm wondering if you could put some numbers around that, what you see in terms of revenue potential over the next 5 years and what that means to your bottom line? And is this the type of partnership that you see could be replicated in other countries, such as emerging markets where, again, Pfizer doesn't have the AND capabilities that you have and you don't have the feet on the ground that Pfizer has?","Heather Bresch","Okay, sure. So look, I think to your first question, hopefully you see that as our continued commitment to be transparent. When I -- what I spoke of in my opening remarks was a combination, if you'll remember. I said of us continuing to execute on our existing platform, continuing to execute against the growth drivers we pointed out. And then obviously, the last point was to looking at ways that we're going to use our increased financial flexibility. And I think, as you have seen, that has been a combination, and I think it will continue to be. There's a lot of ways to increase shareholder value, and I think what you can rely on is that we're looking at all of them. And we certainly are looking at any and all compelling acquisitions that would allow us to continue to deliver or accelerate the trajectory that we're already on. I mean, when you look at what we have put out there with our own assets at this time, a 15% CAGR in 2018 is an impressive growth target out there. And I think that as -- this financial flexibility just gives us all that much more ability to accelerate not only that growth but, like I said, in many different ways. As far as Japan goes, look, I think it's an unprecedented deal in our industry. I think it truly does take the core competencies of both of our organizations, and we believe that 1 plus 1 will equal 3-plus. It's about really leveraging the scale and scope and the quality of what we both bring to the table. So while we don't get into putting numbers out there around individual countries, I think you certainly can expect that we believe that this is accretive to our current stand-alone Generics business as well as accretive to their stand-alone Generics business, and that's why the rationale of this deal made all the sense in the world. And I very much believe that it could be a model in other countries where the troops on the ground are important, the brand is important, but having the breadth and the quality of a pipeline is equally as important. And that's where this makes all the sense in the world and very much could make sense in other countries as we move forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Shibani Malhotra of RBC Capital Markets.","Shibani Malhotra - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just going back to Jami's question on potential acquisitions and ways to enhance shareholder value, you did mention that you aren't going to do anything just for the sake of doing a deal. Can you talk about the kind of things you are looking for? And just expand on what you meant by that? Are you finding valuations too high? Or is it -- are you just not finding what you're looking for at the moment? And then second, a question on fenofibrate. You got the capsules approved a couple of days ago. Can you just give us your expectations around the launch of that product, including whether or not you had sufficient sort of quantities for the market?","Heather Bresch","Okay, sure. Thank you, Shibani. As far as acquisitions go, I think as we've laid out, certainly we don't do any acquisition just to do an acquisition and have not had a gun to our head to do an acquisition. I think what you hear us saying is that we continue to now generate significant free cash flows and have increased flexibility and are looking at all compelling acquisitions. And that could be anything that to be complementary to our current platform. So whether you look at the Specialty side, geographies, dosage form, therapeutic categories -- I mean, we have a voluminous number of different ways to continue to accelerate this growth trajectory and we're looking at all of them, as well as in combination to share repurchasing programs. I mean, I think that the great news is when you look at the kind of cash we have on hand, we have a lot of different ways to get at least to that $6 in 2018 and continuing to show that kind of growth year-over-year that we've, I think, now, hopefully, have shown that track record of producing year-over-year. So like I said, you're right, we're not just looking at a transaction for transaction's sake, but we certainly are in a position to be looking at all the compelling ones. And as far as your product question, yes, it was a good launch for us. But as you know, we're well beyond any single product launches, especially one of that size. I can tell you we executed on it. And it's just one of many that we've had this year and will have over the next several. Okay, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Ronny Gal of Sanford Bernstein.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","John, question on the CapEx. In the past, you talked about some leverage in the CapEx as we go from 2012 to 2014. Looking at the guidance for next year versus this year, still 7% to 8% growth in earnings at a minimum. How should we think about the CapEx? Should we grow linearly? Or should we have a step-up, a further step-up in the -- sorry, not the CapEx, in the cash -- in the free cash flow generation?","John D. Sheehan","So Ronny, I think that this -- I think that what you saw happen or you saw the results in this quarter was the cash flow generation, the strength of this global platform to generate and throw off cash. And also, as you could see, we reduced our expectations for capital spending for the year from $350 million to $300 million, the combination of those 2 increasing the free cash flow by $100 million and allowing us to bring our leverage down to 2.6x after paying $100 million back in the first week of October. To be honest with you, I don't really want to give future expectations as to what 2013 or 2014 is going to be. That's not the purpose of the call today. But what I can tell you, and it's demonstrated by the working capital efficiency that we've had here in 2013, is that our global operating teams are intensely focused on generating cash and then for our ability to put that cash back to work in the business for the benefit of our shareholders. And I think that for today, I'll leave it there.","Heather Bresch","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes of the line of David Risinger of Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","John, I was hoping that you could just walk us through the financials associated with that partnership with Pfizer and just help us understand how that impacted the revenue in Asia Pacific in the quarter and how it will impact things going forward just so that we can tease out whether there was an incremental positive from that deal in the September quarter that is noticeable in the financials and whether that will continue or whether it's really not noticeable in the financials.","John D. Sheehan","You don't -- you won't have to tease it out because although we announced the formation of the partnership, David, the partnership will actually be become -- begin operating here around the end of this year, early next year so that there was no impact of the partnership in our third quarter results. What you see in our Asia Pacific results represents the organic growth of our operations in Asia Pacific and will most likely be that way for Q4 2012 also.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gilbert of Merrill Lynch.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Heather, with the third quarter in a row of improving growth rates in Europe, are you ready to predict positive growth for that segment going forward? It sounds like your qualitative comments are quite bullish, too. And then, is there any doubt that your WELLBUTRIN XL generic product is fine in light of Teva Impax's issues? I think this is obviously important for Mylan and the broader public trust in generics and the trade, et cetera.","Heather Bresch","Sure. Thanks, Greg. So look, I think as far as Europe is concerned, we have seen continued improvement, and we don't really foresee that stopping. I mean, quite honestly, I think that when you compare everything, as I said, conversion rates increasing, our leadership position in our most important countries, I think, where we see -- obviously still see competitive pressures -- but see that volume offsetting that. Those are all the kind of things that certainly, we, from our measurements and what we're looking for, is important. And we start to see all 3 of those things hitting, and, like I said, we do foresee that continuing. So that's kind of is as far as I'm willing to go with my crystal ball. But I can tell you we're excited about the direction Europe is moving and see that continuing. As far as WELLBUTRIN, look, I think that it's very important to understand that this is a one-off issue and it really does not speak to the generic industry. I will say it speaks to the pharmaceutical industry overall. As you know, from time to time, as FDA continues to gather data and look at data, there are times where they've taken brand products off the market as well as changing guidelines and changing specs. So this is something that's constantly going on within the FDA in looking and working with companies. I think in this particular instance, it was certainly related to patient safety. FDA made a judgment call years ago around the 300 milligram. And when -- the data today that they're looking at has caused them to get to a different place. Certainly, we don't see this impacting our product and believe this was certainly in relation to just one in particular formulation. So I would tell you that our industry is alive and well, and I don't really see this having any impact on that whatsoever. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Elliot Wilbur of Needham & Company.","Elliot Wilbur - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Question for you, Heather, around your pending application for generic version of Lidoderm. Endo management made some very pointed comments about their perceived or their perceptions around your ability to obtain approval for their product based on its nonaqueous nature and the possibility of some excipient and adhesion issues. I'm assuming that you don't agree with that, but maybe you can just sort of comment a little bit on sort of their observations. And then with Watson now having obtained approval, still some ambiguity around the issue of exclusivity. The FDA made it very clear in the approval letter that Watson did not obtain approval within 30 months but did not actually make a decision on exclusivity. You said previously that you still thought generic Lidoderm was a possibility in terms of your ability to launch in 2013, and I'm just wondering if you still believe that to be the case based on anything new that's happening at the FDA with regard to the application and then based on the Watson approval.","Heather Bresch","Sure. So I'll start with Endo's comments. I guess what I would say, not only do I not agree with them, I have to believe that their credibility should be extremely tarnished at this point. I mean, they said all the exact same things about Watson -- Watson was never going to be able to get their approval. They had all kinds of issues. And certainly, Endo was proven to be wrong. I think when you look at Endo trying to stress that based on their experience and expertise in this development, this is not their product. They have end-licensed it. So I think to talk about what kind of science is out there and who has the capability, I can assure you we are manufacturing and developing our own product, and I believe we do have the expertise and the track record with FDA to know and to be able to guide you guys, as we have been, about what we're capable of doing. So I -- that's what I would say about Endo's comments. And we absolutely continue to see this as a possible opportunity in the second half of the year. As you know, FDA historically doesn't make exclusivity decisions until they have to. And so we maintain our ability to get this product approved in 2013 and be able to manufacture the quantities needed. And like I said, we still absolutely believe we have the potential for this to be upside second half of '13. So thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Schott of JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just 2 quick ones here. The first was coming back to some of the earlier business development comments. I guess does the financial flexibility you're talking about here open up transactions that you might not have been able to pursue in the past, i.e. larger transactions? I was just trying to understand here if the scope of what you're looking at has changed or if this is just kind of coming back to some of the assets that you've considered before? The second question was on your Europe. It seems like we're finally seeing encouraging macro trends. Can you talk a little bit more about the competitive dynamics you're seeing in the market? I think Teva last quarter discussed a bit of a shift, focusing more on profitability versus share in Europe, and I'm just wondering if you're -- how you're seeing the overall competitive environment kind of shaking out.","Heather Bresch","So look, quickly on the acquisition, here's what I would say. I mean, Chris, obviously, we came out to a commitment with the Street over the last several years that we were going to be deleveraging and executing on the assets that we had. And I think that, that's what I think this quarter culminates in that activity, one showing what this platform can produce while at the same time accelerating our deleveraging capability. So certainly, what we're in a position now to do is definitely of size and scope. And as I said, I'll just revert back to saying a very compelling -- there's a lot of compelling opportunities out there, and we're looking at all of them. And just quickly on the environment in Europe. I guess what I would say is we've always stressed the profitability as well as market share, as well as revenue growth and balanced all of that. I can't speak to other companies perhaps being as balanced as in their commentary around Europe, but that's why I wanted to stress that I think that has definitely paid off for us not only to maintain leadership position but be able to execute and control what we can. And we see that now, especially for our business in Europe, turning that corner.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gary Nachman of Susquehanna Financial Group.","Gary Nachman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Heather, on EPIPEN, anything you're doing differently to prepare for Sanofi's launch of Auvi-Q next month? And do you have a sense of what the pricing dynamics will look like with them in the market? And just what type of growth are you seeing in the market overall, if you could quantify that?","Heather Bresch","Sure. So first, I'd like to say that they -- that Sanofi has said they're not launching until 2013. But anyway, as far as it relates to -- look, I think when you have got a leadership position, like we do, at 98% of the market, our ability to build on that brand equity and make sure that we're continuing to stress the tried and true nature of EPIPEN, being around for over 20 years, delivering over 40 million scripts, and that's what -- that is our position in the marketplace. And as we've said before, another competitor coming to market in a sense then is just shared voice and increasing that awareness. I think that when you look at the -- what we have been doing to increase that awareness, as I said in my remarks, it's been paying off. We've now gone from where 7% of the people at-risk to now 10% of the people at-risk with an EPIPEN. So obviously, we still see tremendous growth and opportunity for this franchise and the disease state overall. So look, we're excited about EPIPEN, still have a lot that we're executing on and will be continuing to do so. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Faerm of Credit Suisse.","Michael Faerm - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two quick questions, one on the respiratory pipeline. Can you just provide an update on the status of the COPD candidate, if and when we might see Phase II data? And then a general question on the North American Generics business. What are some of the key drivers that will propel growth next year as you move into a year with fewer launches than you've had this year?","Heather Bresch","Let me -- I'll quickly take the North America question. Look, I think that what we've continued to stress is that we're not about any 1 country, 1 product. It is about literally being able to optimize and leverage the -- our global scale and platform in every country we do business in, the United States not being any different. We have tremendous opportunities from our existing base business, the launches we did have this year, coupled with the launches we have next year. I mean over the last 5 years, we've not had the same number of launches every year, but we certainly have been able to show a trajectory and, like I said, we see that continuing. As for our respiratory business, Rajiv, do you want to...","Rajiv Malik","Yes. So regarding respiratory products, I think one is our COMBO, which is on the nebulization stage, which remains on track, and we will kick off our Phase III somewhere in the early next year, early 2013. And the second product, which is Advair, is also -- remains on track for '15, '16 global launches.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Cacciatore of Cowen and Company.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to go back to potential future acquisitions or strategic developments. Is it usually by asset that is available, either brand or generic? Or do you have a -- do you have something in mind and you focus on that? Or is it kind of what is available to you at that moment in time?","Heather Bresch","Ken, what I would say is as I -- hopefully, everyone has heard me now loud and clear on this call is that we certainly believe that there are many compelling opportunities out there and we're looking at all of them. And just believe that we've got a lot of ability to bring in a lot of different complementary assets to this business in this existing platform that we have. And I'd say that's what I have to say.","John D. Sheehan","And it may or may not be on the market.","Heather Bresch","Yes.","John D.

Any more questions?","Operator","Our next question comes from David Buck of Buckingham Research.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","First one is on the Specialty business. Can you talk a little bit about what pricing was during the quarter? And then just on the settlement with Teva, can you talk about what your ability is to continue to pursue, if needed, the citizen [ph] petition route to make your case with the FDA on approval? And then just maybe for John, can you just talk about in terms of what you're looking at in terms of deals? Is there a commitment to not use any type of equity financing or convertible equity financing?","Heather Bresch","Okay. So quickly, listen. On EPI, we certainly had some pricing increases. We had 2 over the year. But, I mean, we certainly see, as I mentioned, volume increasing even more so than the price. As far as Teva and our settlement, we settled, just to be clear, on the IP litigation. We continue to believe they have significant hurdles to get an AB-rated product, and I can assure you we're continuing -- not only are we continuing to pursue that, but believe that there are, like I said, many hurdles and challenges for them to get an AB-rated product. John?","John D. Sheehan","And in terms of your question about M&A and currency that we would use in any transaction, I think it would be safe to assume that our focus is on use of cash for a transaction, as I pointed that out, in terms of the amount that we had available up to a ceiling of $4 billion or more. And so I think that use of a currency other than cash is not something we're currently focused on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Tong of Wells Fargo Securities.","Michael Kallai Tong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just one question, going back to business development. And as you look at how you evaluate different transactions, do you use any internal bar that -- or internal hurdles that you would compare a potential transaction like the type of accretion you would get from further deleveraging or share repurchases? Any color like that would be appreciated.","Heather Bresch","Well, Michael, I can assure you, we look at many, many, many parameters when looking at the sources and use of capital. And I can tell you that we have been doing that, and certainly, for any acquisitions, we'll be doing that going forward. Depending on what part of whether the platform, what kind of a transaction it is, what that contribution means, both near, medium and long term, I mean, all these things are taken into consideration as we compare them with other uses of capital. So I would say I would rest assured that we look at many, many different parameters and have many different things internally that we take into consideration.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky of Canaccord Genuity.","Randall Stanicky - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I have a fairly straightforward one. It can be Heather or John. Can you just identify specifically some of the public U.S. generic opportunities in the next year? So obviously, Lidoderm is one of those. And then, Heather, as you look at your U.S. generic base, obviously you have an expansive pipeline. What technologies don't you currently have that you would have an interest in potentially acquiring or developing?","Heather Bresch","Thanks, Randall. As far as for detailed opportunities in 2013, I think, as we mentioned earlier, we'll be coming to you with that in February. I mean, I think, obviously, there are some very -- there's already a lot of public news out there around the opportunities that we have in 2013. But we certainly will be highlighting those more in February. And what was...","John D. Sheehan","The technology.","Heather Bresch","Oh, the -- here's what I would say. When you look at where our strengths lie -- solid oral dosage, extended release, patch technology -- I think we can continue to see an injectable space, that, that would be an area that we can continue to further increase therapeutic categories that we're in and so forth. Topicals, dermatologics, that's an area that we certainly could look and, obviously, where we've already investing in the respiratory. So I would think it's not even so much a matter of areas that we're not in at all but areas, again, that we can look to accelerate those positions and our positions within the U.S. marketplace. All right, well, thank you, everybody, for the call, and we look forward to talking to you in February.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

Joining me for today's call are: Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Sheehan.","During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements may include, without limitation, statements about the proposed acquisition which I will refer to as the Perrigo proposal of Perrigo Company, which I will refer to as Perrigo by Mylan, Mylan's acquisition, which I will refer to as the EPD Transaction of Mylan and Abbott Laboratories' non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business, which I will refer to as the EPD Business; the benefits and synergies of the Perrigo proposal or EPD Transaction; future opportunities for Mylan, Perrigo, or the combined company and products; and any other statements regarding Mylan's, Perrigo's, or the combined company's future operations, anticipated business levels, future earnings, planned activities, anticipated growth, market opportunities, strategies, competition, and other expectations and targets for future periods.","Because forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties, actual future results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: uncertainties related to the Perrigo Proposal, and the consummation thereof; the ability to meet expectations regarding the accounting and tax treatments of a transaction relating to the Perrigo Proposal and the EPD Transaction; changes in relevant tax and other laws; the integration of Perrigo and the EPD Business being more difficult, time-consuming or costlier than expected, operating cost, consumer loss and business disruption being greater than expected following the Perrigo Proposal and the EPD Transaction; the impact of competition, situations where we manufacture, market and\/or sell products, notwithstanding unresolved allegations of patent infringement; any regulatory, legal or other impediments to our ability to bring new products to market; and those set forth under forward-looking statements in today's earnings release; and the risk factors set forth in Mylan N.V.'s Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2015, as well as our other filings with the SEC.","These risks, as well as other risks associated with Mylan, Perrigo, and the combined company are also more fully discussed in the Registration Statement on Form S-4 and includes an offer to exchange\/prospectus that Mylan filed with the SEC on May 5, as amended on June 9 and July 16, 2015, of which has not yet been declared effective, and the definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A that Mylan filed with the SEC on July 28, 2015, and began mailing to its shareholders on or about July 31, 2015, in connection with the Perrigo Proposal.","Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update any statements made today, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Under the Irish Takeover Rules, Mylan management is prohibited from discussing any material or new information or significant new opinion which has not been publicly announced. Any person interested in shares in Mylan or Perrigo is encouraged to consult Heather and her professional advisor.","Before I turn the call over to Heather, let me also remind you that the material in the call, with the exception of the participant questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's expressed written permission. An archived copy of today's call will be available on our website and will remain available for a limited time.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Heather.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Thanks, Kris, and good morning, everyone. Mylan had a great second quarter. Top-line sales totaled nearly $2.4 billion, a constant currency increase of 36% compared to the same period last year. This result represents double-digit growth in our legacy business, as well as enhanced double-digit growth with the addition of the EPD Business. I'll note as well that EpiPen continues to post strong results and maintains an 86% share in a multi-epinephrine market and has delivered double-digit growth year-to-date.","On the bottom line, our adjusted diluted EPS came in at $0.91 for the second quarter, up 32% compared to the same period last year and exceeding our expectations. Again, this result represents double-digit growth in our legacy business as well as enhanced double-digit growth with the addition of the EPD Business.","Our exceptional performance this quarter continues to underscore the underlying strength and diversity of our base business and our relentless focus on execution, even in the face of ongoing regulatory delays, as well as external activity.","Given the strength and momentum in our business, we are raising our 2015 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range to $4.15 to $4.35, an increase of 19% or 23% on a constant currency basis compared to our performance in 2014.","Our guidance now excludes any contribution from generic Copaxone and includes potential generic competition on EpiPen in the second half of the year. In addition, we see the potential for opportunities on the horizon, and we'll provide any updates as appropriate.","I'd like to take this opportunity to say thank you, more than ever, to all of our employees around the world for staying focused on executing and delivering great performance.","With respect to the external activity, you saw last week that Teva announced an agreement to acquire Allergan's generic drug unit and its withdrawal of its unsolicited expression of interest to acquire Mylan. We very much believe that this is the right outcome for both companies and their shareholders. We believe the transaction further differentiates Mylan as the industry's only predominantly global generics player and will enhance our ability to gain additional share in markets around the world.","We believe our offer to acquire Perrigo represents the right next step for Mylan, because it further diversifies our business that creates a paradigm shift in how we'll do business, and establishes a unique platform with the size and scale that allows us to continue being a leading consolidator in our industry.","Together, Mylan and Perrigo will create a one-of-a-kind global healthcare company with complementary businesses, unmatched scale in our operations, one of the industry's broadest and most diversified portfolio, and immense reach across distribution channels around the world, allowing us to mean the most to our customers and consumers.","We very much look forward to our shareholder vote on August 28; and as a reminder, we intend to take our offer to acquire Perrigo directly to its shareholders. We are confident that they, too, see the compelling value in our offer and this combination will support the transaction.","In addition, as an update to yesterday's press release, we have now executed an amendment with all of our bridge credit facility lenders that gives us full discretion to lower the acceptance condition from 80% to greater than 50%, if we so choose.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rajiv.","Rajiv Malik - President & Executive Director","Thank you, Heather. And good morning, everyone. As Heather mentioned, all of our regions and businesses contributed to the outstanding performance we delivered during the second quarter. With each of the regions, delivery is very impressive double-digit growth.","Our global generics segment generated third-party net sales of just over $2 billion and increased year-over-year, up 43% on constant-currency basis. In North America, sales totaled $937 million, up 47% year-over-year. Our legacy business grew by 22%. This impressive growth is attributed to continued strong performance of sales from new products at less stable pricing and higher volumes on existing products.","In Europe, sales totaled $571 million, a 62% increase as compared to the second quarter of 2014. This increase was largely attributed to contribution of our acquired EPD Business as our legacy business was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, whereas we benefited from sales of new products or higher volumes on existing ones, primarily in Italy and France, further enhancing our market share.","In our rest of the world region, sales totaled $547 million, a year-over-year increase of 51%. Sales from our legacy business grew 23% on a constant currency basis, driven by new product launches in Australia and Japan and higher volumes from our India operations, especially our anti-retroviral franchise.","As for our Specialty segment, revenues totaled $302 million, an increase of 5% compared to the last year's second quarter based on double-digit volume growth. We have made very good progress in integrating the EPD Business across the various regions. Overall, we have not only successfully arrested the decline of the business, but we also saw constant currency low-single-digit growth in revenues across the geographies, and the improvement in this business has come quicker than expected.","We expect this performance to remain stable this year on a pro forma year-over-year basis. Also, we continue to analyze on a country-by-country basis and explore how we can tap portfolio opportunities for additional value creations that build on our respective sales such as cross-leveraging channels that were not available to either organization on a stand-alone basis.","We look forward to executing on these value-creating opportunities to realize the full potential of this combined asset. We also continue to make progress executing against our key growth drivers and positioning Mylan for continued organic growth well into the future.","Starting with the respiratory, we remain on track to file our ANDA for generic Advair by this year end. In June, we launched the first and only bioequivalent alternative to GSK's Seretide under the brand name Sirdupla in UK. We only saw a couple of weeks' impact of this product in the second quarter. However, we were very pleased with this launch performance and the boost it gave our business in the UK. We also recently launched the product in Germany. It's worth noting that we leveraged our EPD sales force of this launch, another example of how we are creating value through the combination.","We continue to further build out our global respiratory pipeline. For instance, we announced an agreement with Pulmatrix for a clinical stage bronchodilator therapy being studied for COPD. It's the first small molecule formulation from the Pulmatrix, novel inhaled dry powder technology.","Regarding our Copaxone program, we were very pleased to see FDA's response to the final Teva CP, where they clearly laid out the general criteria for sameness of a generic Copaxone such as same fundamental chemical reaction scheme, same physical chemical properties and composition, same structural signature for polymerization and de-polymerization and the same response in a biological assay.","We are confident that we are fundamentally on the same page regarding the signs and criteria to demonstrate sameness with FDA. Furthermore, we have just recently received some additional clarifying questions from agency, which give us even more confidence that any residual concern of sameness are now behind us.","Turning to biologics, following our launch in India, we have now launched our trastuzumab products in several countries in Africa and are filing spending in additional markets across Asia, MENA and Latin America.","In addition, we have also begun filing marketing authorizations for insulin glargine in Africa, Asia, Latin America and MENA. The two global clinical trials for generic insulin glargine have made significant progress with recruitment for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes studies now complete. Our insulin glargine commercial manufacturing facility is now fully commissioned and we expect will be fully qualified by the end of this quarter.","We continue to progress the (14:11). Our trastuzumab and (14:15) Phase III clinical trials are progressing very well towards completion. We are continuing our Phase III study with adalimumab and we have also initiated a Phase I PK comparability study for our bevacizumab program.","With regards to our infectious disease growth driver, we launched our branded Sovaldi and generic MyHep, sofosbuvir product for treatment of hep C in India. Additionally, we are making regulatory submission with the multiple emerging markets. We are also developing other combination products for treatments of hep C.","As for the latest statistics, more than 150 million people are affected with hep C in emerging markets and Mylan is committed to provide access to the hep C drugs to the patients across these markets in partnership with Gilead. Our ARV products now have approximately half of all people being treated for HIV in the developing world, not just in sub-Saharan Africa, but also in markets such as Brazil and Thailand. Just last month, the United Nations announced that World Health met the target for reaching 15 million people with ARV treatment by 2015, and that the guidelines will now call for reaching 30 million people in the coming years. Mylan is committed to doing our part to reach that goal, which means continued, reliable and sustainable growth in this franchise.","Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we are on track to close our acquisition of Famy Care by end of the third quarter, which will further enhance our presence in women's health care. In addition to the strength of this business in the U.S. and other developed markets, we see significant opportunities to leverage this business through the Mylan's platform in emerging markets to enhance success with the contraceptives for more women.","We are excited about momentum we have going into the second half of the year. For example, we launched our generic Nexium in the U.S. earlier this week and believe that we are only the second generic to launch to-date. We believe this product has the potential to be a great opportunity for us.","I would also like to mention that we are seeing fairly good improvement from FDA in terms of dates of approvals and the level of transparency in communications from the agency. I believe this bodes well for the additional approvals we expect and our overall optimism in the second half of the year.","In closing, I would like to also give my sincere thanks to our employees, who have demonstrated unwavering focus on our business and our mission every day.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John D. Sheehan - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Thanks, Rajiv. Good morning, everyone. As Rajiv mentioned, our total revenues for the second quarter of 2015 were $2.4 billion, an increase of 29% or 36% on a constant currency basis from the prior-year period. Revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates by approximately $127 million in the current quarter, primarily reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to the euro, yen, rupee, and Australian dollar.","Additionally, third-party net sales were positively impacted by a full quarter of results from the acquired EPD Business of approximately $402 million, of which $250 million was from Europe and $110 million within our rest of world, with the remainder coming from EPD Canada. We will continue to provide EPD-specific quarterly revenue for 2015. However, by the beginning of 2016, the EPD and Mylan commercial businesses will be operating as one, and as such, separate revenue information will no longer be available.","For the six months ended June 30, 2015, total revenues were $4.2 billion, an increase of 26% on a constant currency basis from the prior-year period, which includes revenues from the EPD Business of approximately $550 million. Revenues for the first six months of 2015 were unfavorably impacted by current currency translation by approximately $221 million.","As a result of the impact of the strong U.S. dollar on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency operations into U.S. dollars, we now expect full-year foreign currency translation to negatively impact our reported U.S. dollar revenues by approximately $200 million versus the foreign exchange rates used for providing our 2015 guidance.","As such, without further weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the principal currencies in which our businesses operate, we expect that our actual reported 2015 revenues will be at the lower end of our 2015 guidance range.","Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter and the first six months of 2015 was a very strong 54%, up approximately 400 basis points for the quarter and 325 basis points in the year-to-date period. Our strong margins are primarily the result of the positive contribution from the EPD Business, new product introductions and increased margins on existing products in North America. We expect the strong margins we saw in the first half of 2015 to continue and we now expect our full-year gross margins to be in the upper half of our 2015 guidance range.","R&D expense on an adjusted basis was $168 million, an increase of 21% over the prior-year quarter as a result of continued investment in our respiratory, insulin and biologic growth programs, as well as the impact of the EPD Business. However, as a result of the strong increase in quarter-over-quarter revenue, R&D as a percent of sales fell from 8% to 7%.","For the six months period, adjusted R&D expense was $320 million or approximately 8% of total revenues. As we continue to invest in our key growth drivers during 2015, we expect adjusted R&D spending as a percentage of total revenues to be within our guidance range for the full-year.","At the same time, SG&A also on an adjusted basis, was $506 million, or approximately 21% of total revenues for the quarter, which includes the impact of the EPD Business along with investments in our infrastructure to support the growth of the company. For the six months period, adjusted SG&A was approximately $914 million or 22% of total revenues.","For the full-year, as a result of the strength of the expected revenues in the second half of 2015, we expect adjusted SG&A as a percentage of total revenues to be closer to the midpoint of our 2015 guidance range.","We continue to realize tax benefits from the EPD Transaction and inversion that was completed earlier this year. And as a result, we reported a second quarter adjusted tax rate of 18%, which includes the cumulative effect of reducing in the second quarter our annual effective tax rate to 19% from the 20% we reported in Q1. We are continuing to identify opportunities to reduce our overall adjusted effective tax rate and it is possible that in the second half of 2015, we will be able to further reduce this tax rate.","Our second quarter adjusted net earnings was $474 million or $0.91 per share, a 32% increase from our Q2 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.69 per share. This adjusted diluted EPS growth exceeded our expectations from the beginning of the quarter and was achieved in spite of delays in new product approvals and a negative $0.02 per share impact from the foreign currency translation that we encountered during the quarter.","Furthermore, foreign currency translation had a negative $0.05 per share impact on adjusted diluted EPS quarter-over-quarter from the prior-year. For the six months period, adjusted net earnings were $783 million or $1.62 per share.","Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics, adjusted cash provided by operating activities was $490 million, a decrease of approximately $69 million from the prior-year period, which is the result of the timing of customer remittances due to changes in contract terms and new agreements entered into in the current year. We expect the impact of this change will be mitigated in the third quarter. Year-to-date, capital spending was $122 million as we continue to invest in our business and growth drivers.","At the end of the quarter, our debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA leverage ratio was approximately 2.2:1. We continue to have ample borrowing capacity including our recently announced 2015 term loan, $1 billion of which is we utilized to redeem the 2020 senior notes in July and we expect the remaining amount will be utilized for the redemption of the cash convertible notes, which mature in September.","We remain fully confident to even \u2013 fully committed to our investment grade credit ratings, including after the successful completion of the offer to acquire Perrigo and including in the event that we decide to reduce the acceptance level of the tender offer to greater than 50%.","With regards to the full year adjusted diluted EPS, as Heather indicated, we are raising our full-year guidance range to $4.15 to $4.35 per share, even after considering the impact of potential generic EpiPen competition sometime in the second half of 2015 and including the removal of a Copaxone launch. The midpoint of this revised guidance range of $4.25 per share, represents a 23% constant currency growth in adjusted diluted EPS, reflecting the ongoing strength of our global business.","We're also forecasting that our full-year adjusted EBITDA will be in the upper half of our $2.9 billion to $3.3 billion guidance range. For the third quarter of 2015, we currently anticipate adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.39 to $1.45 per share, which would be a 22% increase over the prior-year quarter. This guidance range assumes no generic competition for EpiPen in Q3 and will be achieved without the launch of generic Copaxone.","That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Eric for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from Sumant Kulkarni from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a quick couple. Would you comment on your alternatives just in case of the Perrigo transaction does not go through? And on your lower threshold, would you find an impact in our credit rating there, just in case that comes to fruition from a lower threshold point of view? And second on Copaxone, is your pushing out of the product out of 2015 based on a specific target action date receipt? Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Hi, there. Good morning and thank you. So, as far as alternatives to Perrigo, I think that we have continued, ever since closing our Abbott transaction, to say that it was going to be the first of a series. Obviously, we believe Perrigo is the right next transaction for Mylan based on the strategic initiatives that we laid out. But as we said before, we like Perrigo, but we don't have to have Perrigo.","There's lots of assets available out there that we believe very much would complement our platform that we would be able to leverage the infrastructure, both commercial and operational excellence that we have in place today. So, we've been actively looking at many targets out there. And as I said in my opening remarks, we believe that there's many different ways to get to the scale and size needed for us to continue to be a leading consolidator in this industry.","As far as Copaxone, and then I'll let John take your other question on investment grade, look, we just did what we believe to be the financial responsible thing to do, given where we are in the year, given the momentum of our business, of our core business; and as we said, the ability to show not only a strong quarter raised our guidance that we don't need to keep uncertainty in there. So, as you get more into the year, the more we can take uncertainty out of the numbers. We thought that was the prudent thing to do.","I can assure you from getting the product approved, we are continuing to work as diligently as we ever had to get it approved. We think it's great. As we've said before, Momenta getting the first product approval, showing that it's possible to have generic Copaxone. We believe \u2013 as, I think, Rajiv laid out in his remark, we feel very confident that we've met the expectations of the agency, and we look forward to that approval. So, our bullishness on the product really has nothing to do with, I was just wanting to remove any uncertainty that we can from our numbers.","John D. Sheehan - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","And lastly, Sumant, with respect to your question in investment grade credit rating, as I indicated in my remarks, we are fully committed to our investment grade credit rating. And we do believe that should we decide to reduce the acceptance level of our tender offer to a level greater than 50%, that we would maintain our investment grade credit rating during the period in which we didn't have full control of the Perrigo business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Gilbert of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Can you hear me okay?","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Yeah.","John D. Sheehan - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, a couple for you, John. First, can you discuss those new customer agreements that led to the new payment terms? Is that for all major customers in the U.S. or the big buyer groups, and were there price concessions involved? And in exchange, you get any enhanced visibility, or is it the classic case of the big buyers sort of get what they want?","Secondly, can you comment, John, on trade inventory levels at the end of the quarter versus the last quarter or the end of the year, whatever you can provide? And then, lastly, for Heather, I appreciate your comments about there being other targets out there. I was going to ask if the Perrigo vote fails or if something else comes along for Perrigo and pays a bigger price, how quickly can you mobilize your financial resources and move on other transactions? Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Maybe I'll start and then I'll let John come back on some of the technical aspects. Look, I think, Gregg, you know us pretty well, I think we've shown our ability to move pretty swiftly and quickly. So, I think you should expect nothing less than that, that we will continue to be pursuing a lot of different pathways and be able to strike very quickly, just like we did Abbott and then on to Perrigo. So, there's nothing changed on that front, or certainly nothing changed about our personality or appetite for acquisitions.","And I'll just, maybe more comments on the customer in a macro level, and then I'll let John speak to the agreements. But, Gregg, what we have said and what we continue to see is with the consolidation of our customers, especially from a global perspective, our ability to have proven to be that global reliable supply chain continues to prove itself and continues to put us in a position that not only are we able to secure and maintain over a longer period of time our business, but are able to really, like I said, drive and benefit from the stability of our supply.","John D. Sheehan - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","So, I think, Gregg, first of all, we did during the quarter complete a agreement \u2013 or agreements with customers, and in particular one customer which had the impact of extending customer payment terms.","The business benefits coming out of that agreement, for us, far exceeded the cost of capital associated with the extended payment terms, and therefore it was absolutely the right business decision for us to take, and we did so with our eyes wide open. I would absolutely not characterize it as exactly how you said it, but as a big bully or something like that. So, it was a win-win, from our perspective, to conclude this agreement with customers. I think you also asked about trade inventory levels and I can assure you that we have been operating normal business, and there are no unusual inventory levels at our customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Ronny Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys, and thank you for taking my question. Can you just give us a feel how you're modeling Nexium contribution? Is this kind of like a month or three months or until the end of the year trajectory? When are you assuming additional players come in, just so we can understand the contribution here to the model?","And second, can you discuss, are there any complexities associated with reducing the share of Perrigo, in case, there are some Perrigo's shareholders listening, when you reduce their acceptance rate from 80% to 50%, if the result is in that range, 50% to 80%, how is that adds complexity or not to your ability to close the deal versus the result will be above 80%?","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Okay. So, Ronny, I'll start with your Nexium. Ronny, I would hope that especially demonstrating this quarter and us raising our guidance under \u2013 showing that underscoring the strength of our core business, not relying on any one product or any one territory. So Nexium, obviously, great product and right now, there don't seem to be any other final approvals and there was no one else really tied to the August 3 date because we were the only generic company that hadn't settled.","So, I won't speak or have a crystal ball on anybody else's approvals coming, but I can tell you that, as always, we're managing a whole basket of risk and opportunities around the globe. And so, we wouldn't be speaking to modeling of any one particular opportunity, except that it just continues to show the strength in our core business, as well as our ability to continue to receive approvals.","As far as the complexity, really, the way that the Irish Takeover Rules work and as we stated back on our \u2013 when we got the 2.5, giving us the ability to go directly to Perrigo's shareholders, we put in there that we had optionality to go down to the 50 plus 1%, and really the other \u2013 I would not say there's any operational complexity. There is a time period of perhaps one to two months of taking over the board.","And then, so once that happens, you've got full operational control of the company. So, it really allows you to be running the company with 50 plus 1% of the vote in a very short period of time. So anything that there would be, it would be a very small temporary blunt of time that we weren't in control.","Operator","Our next question comes from Elliot Wilbur of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Just a quick question, I guess relative to sort of external expectations around the Perrigo deal. Obviously, when you first announced it, there was a very strong initial brace of the industry logic that you guys had outlined around the transaction, and obviously you've been out and about meeting with a lot of investors since that time.","And I'm just wondering if things like confidence is sort of weighing in the transactions just sort of judging by Mylan's stock price. I'm just kind of wondering sort of based on your read of investment community, do you think it's a function on the fact that people were overly fixated on the type of transaction, maybe not paying enough attention to the standalone merits of the Mylan\/Perrigo combination, or do you think it's just a function more of unique considerations around the transaction that have sort of led to now a rather pronounced slippage, I guess, in terms of Mylan's equity value versus at the time when the transaction was first announced? Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Yeah. Thanks, Elliot. Look, I think we started in the right place, which was people's reaction in April, and that's instinctive both \u2013 I think instinctive, but the fact that it was strategic and compelling and the right natural fit. I think everybody got right off the bat. I think a lot of shares traded that day and settled out with us at that $68 range, and we felt that was the right range, and we continue to maintain that.","What then subsequently happened, I absolutely believe Wall Street became very fixated on a near-term what they believe to be an opportunity. And so we needed to get that behind us, so people could focus back again on the industrial logic of Perrigo.","And I think now that that has happened, sure, our stock \u2013 we've taken a little bit of a traumatic hit. There was trauma in the marketplace given Teva's actions, and I would say they're kind of disingenuous about maintaining that they were coming with a real offer and surprising the market by doing the Allergan deal.","And as I've said, I think that was the right deal for those companies, and this is a short-term, temporary bump in our stock. I think we know our value. We know what we've created for shareholders. We know what we'll continue to create both in the near, medium, and long term. And I think our results today just underscores the strength of our business, both in the \u2013 here and now, and then obviously, as we've demonstrated, by raising our guidance for the year.","And due to the Irish Takeover Rules, we can't say \u2013 give any forecast beyond that. But I can tell you, the strength and momentum in our business is strong, and I think our stock price will quickly come back to reflect that. And as you know, the tender to the Perrigo's shareholders won't be until the September-October timeframe, and we think, by then, all of this noise will have worked itself out.","And I think that we still feel, as we're talking to shareholders, that they're back focusing on the Perrigo deal, realizing the industrial logic of it and we believe the Perrigo's shareholders think that we have a very fair and compelling offer on the table. So, we're excited about the next steps and think that we'll see once we get to our vote and then move, hopefully, to the tender offer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Heather, would you consider buying back stock if it stays at current levels and do you have the flexibility to do that, while Perrigo is ongoing? And then, John, what's the year-on-year organic growth rate on revenues adjusted for FX and what drove the $500 million move in accounts receivable? Thank you.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Hi, Umer. Thank you. Yes, we absolutely have the flexibility to buy back our stock. And I would say, it's a great buy right now. So, it's a great inflection point for people to get back in, in this moment of, as the chaos that holds itself out, and like I said, I think as we've returned to the levels that we expect to be given, given our results and our performance. But I will tell you, we're committed to investment grade. So, while we have a ton of flexibility and optionality, we obviously stay very committed to our investment grade.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Got it.","John D. Sheehan - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","And, Umer, with respect to accounts receivable, the increase year-over-year in the accounts receivable is the combination of the acquisition of the EPD Business, that's the majority of it, plus the change in customer payment terms that I referred to during my remarks.","And as it relates to organic growth in the business, our business actually grew organically ex-FX, without FX, by \u2013 at the top line by 36% year-over-year and with the EPD acquisition representing 22% of that. So, our Mylan legacy business, as I believe Rajiv had in his remarks, grew double-digits.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Finkelstein from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Andrew J. Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks very much. I was hoping you could talk a bit more about the outlook with EpiPen, in particular, while you still anticipate the possibility of a generic in 4Q in the guidance. Was that part of the contribution to the increase in the range of guidance for the year?","And then as you look into formulary coverage and pricing for next year, as some of the exclusion lists come out and where your contracting has been, if there is no generic, where would you expect share and net pricing trends to come out for next year?","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Thanks, Andrew. So, look, our outlook for EpiPen remains unchanged. I think we stay very positive on EpiPen. It's been a great product. We continue to see growth, obviously, as I said double-digits so far this year. And it is not due to our raising the guidance. As we noted, we've continued to maintain EpiPen generic coming in the second half of the year. So, if anything, it's an opportunity.","And with that being said, I've maintained that I think there's a very high bar to get AB-rated approval. And so, look, we're already on a multi-epinephrine market, to your point. We're competing and we're very proactively competing for market share with our payers and formularies. And we'll continue to do so.","And if an AB-rated does not come out, my thought would be next year will look very similar to this year, as far as the competitiveness of us maintaining, one our market share and our positions with formularies. So, EpiPen continues to do great. And like I said, but we've done a financially responsible thing as factoring it in. And so, we'll just have to see how the year plays out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Just a couple of questions. Heather, what do you mean in your press release in your prepared remarks by saying that you expect potential opportunities on the horizon. I mean, don't most companies expect potential opportunities on the horizon? Can you just clarify that a bit more? And then maybe, Rajiv, if you could talk about the upcoming IPR decision related to Copaxone 40. What we should anticipate? How you expect the legal roadmap to look like there? Thanks very much.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Sure. Well, Jami, and I think, as I alluded to you earlier, obviously, as you know, we're under Irish Takeover Rules which prohibit really quantifying much from a forecast perspective. But I think given what we were trying to indicate is, given the strength and momentum in our business for the first half of the year, we see just a lot of opportunities in the second half of the year. And as we've said, we'll certainly update that as appropriate. But it was really just to signal, one, the strength of our business, and two, the opportunities we continue to see over the near and medium-term.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, that's not related to a specific M&A opportunity?","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Not related to anything specific, it's just opportunities, in general.","Rajiv Malik - President & Executive Director","And Jami, on Copaxone IPR, I think based on the legal arguments we see, and how it's going, we have been very confident on this IPR litigation or on IPR case and we are looking forward to the decision around end of August.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marc Goodman of UBS. Please go ahead.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. So, Rajiv, you had talked about Copaxone. I just want to make sure I understand. You said that you got feedback from the FDA and in those comments, there were not any concerns around the sameness of your products. So, there obviously were some other issues. Can you tell us what they were, whether just minor, procedural things that you quickly gave responses to and you feel really comfortable that the FDA has now gotten everything that they need? Were the things that they asked, were they surprising? I'm just trying to understand. I mean, I think we can understand why you would take it out of this year's numbers to be conservative, but it doesn't seem to make sense that you would be taking it out completely, given the commentary there.","And then second, Heather, maybe you can just talk about some of the key markets in Europe and the performance there, France and Italy. You mentioned the volumes and stuff. How is the pricing environment, what's going on with market shares? And mention the UK as well. Thank you.","Rajiv Malik - President & Executive Director","On Copaxone. Let me say, Copaxone has a \u2013 we all knew it's a complex product and if everything is not black and white, then there's a little bit of gray. So, the citizen petition response and Momenta's approval gave us a lot of confidence that, fundamentally, we are on the same page. The last bit of questions, the clarifying questions are around fine-tuning \u2013 I will not call exactly the fine-tuning, but there are some different methodologies which we have used, and we are trying to give them more information about some of the abstracts where they want to see more clarity. We just received that question. We're in the process of turning it around in the next couple of days. And then we will be working very closely with the FDA to take it to the next logical stage.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Yes. And, Marc, as far as Europe is concerned, look, I think we continue to be very optimistic. Our organic business was flat. However, we're still showing growth organically for Europe as far as the year is concerned. And our EPD Business was flat year-over-year for the EPD which, as you know, is a positive. They had budgeted and spoke about single-digit decline in that business, and we've been able to almost really accelerate the flattening of that business versus a decline in that business.","So, I think it, again, underscores it was the right transaction, given our portfolio and the complementary nature of the commercial infrastructure, as well as the products. I think the integration is going great. And as I look at France, we continue to regain market share in France. We've gained significant momentum in Italy.","As Rajiv spoke about earlier, we've launched the Seretide in UK. And while we only had a couple weeks under our belt for this quarter, we think that's going to be a great product and then look forward to that coming in Germany. So, look, I think there's a lot of momentum coming in Europe, and the business is doing great.","Operator","Our next question comes from Douglas Tsao from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question. So, first, Rajiv, maybe if you could provide a little bit more detail on the status of the Advair program. I mean, I think you indicated you'd be able to file the ANDA by the end of the year. And just maybe when you would be able to \u2013 or showing your plan to \u2013 if you plan to show the Phase III clinical trial results from that program. And then, John, if you could provide just an update on the pricing environment in just the base generics business right now. Thank you.","Rajiv Malik - President & Executive Director","Doug, on generic Advair, there are a number of studies which are currently underway. There are several PK, pharmacokinetic studies which are underway. We are expecting within the next few weeks or a couple of weeks, in fact, of the clinical endpoint data. We have a device robustness study which is coming around.","So, everything is aligned and progressing very well. Our commercial and manufacturing installation is not only installed, but now undergoing their qualification. So, we remain very confident about filing this ANDA towards the end of this year.","John D. Sheehan - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","And, Doug, with respect to the pricing environment, the way I would characterize it is extremely stable. For the year-over-year, the pricing environment, the price globally is really equal or zero, with positive pricing in the North America, mid-single-digit price declines in Europe which our volume more than offsets, and low-single-digit price in the rest of world. So, we're very pleased with the development of pricing around the globe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Louise Chen of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First question I had was just on Mylan as a stand-alone. Curious what your strategic priorities are for this year and beyond this year. Maybe if you could refresh us on that one. And then secondly, you had mentioned that you don't have to have Perrigo. So, if it's not Perrigo, what other areas are you interested in? Is it still generics? Is it brand, U.S., O-U.S.? Any color would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Sure. So, Louise, I would say our priorities right now is getting the Perrigo deal done. But as I said that if that does not happen, we obviously are actively looking at a lot of assets, and I think you should just expect there's obviously things for sale all over the globe. Starting with here in the United States, we see assets that would increase dosage form or therapeutic categories.","We see interesting bolt-on opportunities that will continue to enhance the infrastructure we have in place. We see assets in Europe that could, again, given now our commercial infrastructure with Abbott, EPD and our legacy business that would complement that. We continue to see other OTC opportunities that would allow us to continue to be able to fill out that OX (52:35) channel.","So, I would say that, like I said, we've been very clear about our priorities. But with that being said, we believe there's a lot of \u2013 from priorities and the dosage form and the channels which we want to reach critical mass, I mean the most to our customers and to the consumers, and we believe there's a lot of different assets that can get us there. It's just that the Perrigo kind of accelerates that for us and as well as for them. They talk about their base plus, plus, plus business, we get them to base plus overnight. So, we think that that synergy and complementary nature is why again it's the right next company for Mylan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gerberry from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Jason M. Gerberry - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First question for Rajiv, just on the Advair competitive landscape, any visibility into other companies that were recruiting patients to run these equivalent studies? You guys are the most open and visible about your development updates. So, just curious if you have any intelligence in terms of any other companies that might be on a similar timeline with you guys.","And then second question for Heather, just as you think about the evolution of the generics industry with the Teva\/Allergan combination, just kind of curious how you think that competitively impacts your business, if you think there's any risk to that deal closing. I know you guys raised some anti-trust issues with the Teva\/Mylan combination and given Allergan's book of businesses, pretty comparable in size, just kind of curious how you think about that issue? Thanks.","Rajiv Malik - President & Executive Director","So, Jason, I believe that our intelligence is not going to be far more than what you have. We have heard Sandoz-Oriel, sometime back we have heard Actavis having a program. We have also heard about 505(b)(2) between the Teva or some other programs. But, we are not actively or heard and seen that recruitment in the clinical, so we can't see anything more than that, but we believe that we are significantly ahead of others and we continue to maintain that momentum.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","And Jason, as far as the generic landscape goes, what's interesting is the FTC issues we've raised that obviously, there was the normal overlap consideration that the FTC should be looking at. But additionally, we said there is much more macro issues that they needed to take into consideration.","And in fact, I actually used the example that if you look at the four top players in our industry, three of them are predominantly in the brand. That leaves only Mylan as the true global generic company. And therefore, if one of the other three consolidated, which has now happened, you take Teva and Actavis, that we thought they brought to the marketplace would be much less significant than it's taking the only generic advocate out of the industry would be.","So, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, not only do I see it as different, I see it as a huge opportunity for Mylan. I mean, if we look historically at these large consolidations that take in place, we've been able to disproportionately gain market share as other use it as they divest and sell off assets. So, we see it as a great opportunity to build up our markets around the world.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Emil Chen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. This is actually Emil Chen on for Dave Risinger. Thanks for taking my question. John, earlier you mentioned that the pricing environment globally is relatively stable and apologies that I missed it, but can you just comment again specifically on the U.S. generic pricing environment? And then secondly, on EpiPen, what are the prospects for any potential future price increases? Thank you.","John D. Sheehan - Executive VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer","So, I indicated that in my remarks that with the overall global environment for pricing being stable, that the North American pricing environment was positive.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","And as far as EpiPen goes, look as I've said, we are being very proactive and competitive in the multi-epinephrine marketplace; and therefore as we said here today, we continue to take \u2013 look at EpiPen in a holistic manner and take opportunities as you would for a brand. So, you should foresee that just continuing as we continue to maximize the EpiPen franchise.","Emil Chen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our Q&A session.

As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Melissa Trombetta, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Melissa Trombetta - Mylan NV","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Mylan's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; Chief Commercial Officer, Tony Mauro; and Chief Financial Officer, Ken Parks.","During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial outlook and 2017 guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from today's projections.","Please refer to the earnings release we furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K earlier this morning, as well as our supplemental Q3 earnings slides and our investor presentations titled Built to Last, all of which are posted on our website at investor.mylan.com for a fuller explanation of those risks and uncertainties and the limits applicable to forward-looking statements.","Mylan routinely post information that may be important to investors on this website, and we may use this website address as a means of disclosing material information to the public in a broad, non-exclusionary manner for purposes of the SEC's regulation fair disclosure.","In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We will refer to these measures as adjusted and present them in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance.","Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measures as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to those GAAP measures are available in our third quarter earnings release, supplemental earnings slides and investor presentation.","Let me also remind you that the information discussed during this call, with the exception of the participants' questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's express written permission.","An archived copy of today's call will be available on our website and will remain available for a limited time.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Heather.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Before we get started, I'd like to send a special message to our employees in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, and thank them for their perseverance following the devastating hurricanes that struck there during the quarter.","We're extremely grateful that all of them are safely accounted for and are proud of how we all came together to support one another and people and surrounding communities in the storm's aftermath. Though we recognize that the journey to rebuild will be a long one, especially in Puerto Rico, which was affected most severely. We're glad to report that our plant there is operational, and we have not experienced any shortages of the drugs we manufacture at the facility.","Turning now to our business. I'm personally very grateful to say that after years of hopeful anticipation, it finally happened.","Early last month, we received FDA approval of our Glatiramer Acetate product for both the 20-milligram and 40-milligram strengths and immediately launched them into the U.S. marketplace. Being first-to-market with the 40-milligram strength as well as offering the 20-milligram is a milestone in many regards.","First and foremost, it underscores our scientific and regulatory capabilities to develop, secure approval of, manufacture and bring to market an extremely complex product, despite an arduous multiyear process.","Second, and equally as important, is our ability to continue to deliver on our mission of providing access to more affordable products to patients, and that's where our new Mylan MS Advocate Program comes in.","It's designed to help patients get started and stay on track with their physician's treatment plan for either dosage strength. It should be noted that this program also paves the way for the many other products in our pipeline that have special commercialization needs.","Lastly, I would be remiss if I didn't also mention how proud we are of all of our employees here at Mylan. Our success in launching this very important product, one of the largest generic launches in recent history, which could not have come at a better time, only stands as a reminder of why we get up every day and what we fight and stand for.","This single launch alone could have the effect of saving billions of dollars cumulatively for MS patients, taxpayers and the overall health care system.","This launch should also serve as an important reminder to all stakeholders in the health care system about the importance of our industry and the role that we play, especially as our industry continues to come under attack by those whom we believe may not fully understand or appreciate how our industry work. And all that's involved in bringing very important products like this to market.","Because of this, we applaud our industry's trade group, the Association for Affordable Medicine, for their hard work in helping educate all stakeholders interested in our healthcare system. With that said and while the U.S. healthcare system rebases itself, there are some fundamentals that will not change.","The demand for high-quality Generics will not be going away. Generics already fill 90% of all prescriptions dispensed within the U.S. as well as a growing proportion of scripts filled around the world. Meeting this global demand is exactly what we envision and have executed on over the last decade.","This is exactly why we moved out of the U.S. Generics and Specialty neighborhood and into a much larger and more resilient house in the global community. We've build our global platform to absorb and withstand geographic volatility, and it's through our product and channel diversification that Mylan has truly transformed itself from a single market, high-risk, first-to-file company into a resilient global business with strong durable cash flows.","To put a number to it, we now believe that approximately 75% of our more than $2 billion adjusted operating cash flows stem from predictable, recurring revenues across all markets around the world, leaving a 25% basket of smaller, less predictable products, primarily in the U.S. Generics market.","This model provides Mylan with a unique opportunity to meet the demands of individual markets around the world much more reliably, and as a result, it positions us very differently from our peers. We believe there is a real disconnect between our current valuation and the global business we've built.","I believe our depressed share price is reflective of investor sentiment regarding a U.S.-only marketplace, which, therefore, provides us an opportunity to educate and expand shareholders' knowledge base and therefore, our multiple.","I am personally committed to helping shareholders fully understand our transformation and who Mylan is today, so that we can reach our intended goal of fully realizing Mylan's value through total shareholder return accretion. As a part of that commitment, we will be embarking on an investor outreach program that will lay out how we intend to address this disconnect.","Specifically, we intend to effectively deploy capital for future growth, while maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet. We will continue investing on our existing pipeline and additional opportunities to further enhance our pipeline. We will continue to look for and execute on opportunistic bolt-on transactions to add our existing platform. And finally, we will do all of this while continuing to grow the top and bottom line.","Above all, the key message we'll be delivering is that, we have Built Mylan to Last, and that what makes us different is what makes us durable.","As a result, we now have a substantial number of opportunities that are unique to Mylan's growth profile. Having begun our transformation a decade ago, we have a huge start, and going forward, you can be absolutely sure, we'll be executing to the best of our ability to use our strength to matter even more to our customers, patients and healthcare systems around the world, and therefore, continue delivering growth and value to our shareholders.","You can find our presentation called Built to Last, in the Investor Relations section of our website at mylan.com. When you arrive at this site, you'll also see an invitation to learn more about Mylan's story and our global impact by providing access to medicine, innovation and science and public health policy. It's part of a campaign we've recently launched, called Better Health for a Better World, and through it, we intend to better tell our story to a much broader audience.","Turning to the third quarter, our results, which included adjusted EPS of $1.10, were especially strong considering the ongoing challenges we experienced in the U.S., including accelerated deceleration of EpiPen sales, both from our launch of an authorized generic as well as the contraction of the overall epinephrine auto-injector market.","Substantially moderating those challenges were our Rest of World and European segments, which together accounted for 60% of our third-party net sales during the quarter. Both segments showed continued strength, with our business in Europe again posting double-digit growth, a great example of the ability of our highly diversified global platform to absorb our industry's inevitable headwinds wherever they occur.","As for the fourth quarter, given our GA launch and the stability of our platform, we see a strong finish ahead. We are, thus, increasing the low-end of our full year total revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. Our new 2017 revenue range is $11.75 billion to $12.5 billion, which represents an increase of 9% at the midpoint versus full-year 2016. Our new 2017 adjusted EPS range is between $4.45 to $4.70 per share, a decrease of 6% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year.","What's more? We believe the momentum and growth we see ahead is sustainable, which is why we remain confident in our 2018 target of at least $5.40 in adjusted EPS. We look forward to bringing you detailed guidance for 2018 during our 4Q call.","We're once again continuing to deliver and differentiate Mylan in a rapidly changing industry. And for our third quarter performance, I'd like, on behalf of Mylan's board and our entire leadership team, to thank our employees around the world for their outstanding teamwork and execution and for their commitment to delivering Better Health for a Better World.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and unwavering focus on our mission, especially those who were affected recently by natural disasters. We are very proud of our employees who, despite personally going through this ordeal, were able to ensure that there was no significant disruption and drug shortages from our facilities.","Let me briefly turn to our third quarter results. I will provide an overview of our top line performance, and Ken will cover segment profitability. Overall, we delivered nearly $3 billion in total revenues for the quarter, a decrease of 2% compared to the prior year. We saw strong performance in our Europe and Rest of World regions, which again, represent more than half of our revenue. This helped to partially mitigate the expected decline in North America. All regions benefited from contributions from our acquisition of Meda businesses, which continue to perform well and meet our expectations.","Mylan integration is going strong, and we're excited to see the integrated platform come to life with no business disruption, while we brought various assets from Meda and Renaissance together. Now, we are continuing to optimize the assets we have acquired, and identify additional cost-savings, as well as revenue opportunities, beyond what we have previously stated and are expected to generate additional annual saving of more than $200 million.","In North America, our robust portfolio, rich pipeline, commercial infrastructure and our long-standing relationships we have fostered with our customers give us the unique ability to face the turbulence of this market. We expect to see sustainable cash flows from our hard-to-make, complex product portfolio, which generally have a high regulatory hurdle to climb, and oftentimes, require clinical trials and, thus, give relatively better visibility of emerging new competition.","Also, such complex products usually provide more predictable and durable cash flows. About 30% of what we believe to be our global durable cash flows come from North America. We also anticipate that our growing portfolio of injectables, OTC as well as Topicals Business will also further contribute to our stability and future growth in this market. I would also note that EpiPen, the one big reason for decline this year, is projected to be less than 3% of total revenue, and is not a meaningful contributor as we go into 2018.","A strong and sustainable performance in Europe is being delivered from our well-executed integrated platform of Mylan legacy, Abbott EPD and Meda businesses. Our European business is no longer primarily generic, but has approximately two-thirds of revenue coming from our Rx and OTC channels.","Our portfolio of key brands, like Creon, Influvac, DYMISTA, Dona, Betadine, Saugella and EpiPen, belongs to a class of hard-to-make complex products and provide us predictable and durable cash flows.","These brands have a great brand equity in these markets, and also, given the nature of these markets, do not get genericized overnight. About 40% of what we believe to be our global durable cash flows come from Europe. We will be further focusing on our global key brand portfolio, and we'll continue to make sustainable efforts to further grow and expand these across other countries.","Also, we're excited by the growth opportunities we see to further strengthen our business in our key markets, like France, Italy, Germany, Poland, UK and Nordics, where we are now in position to add many more exciting products from our pipeline, like biosimilars and through a cross-pollination of our vast portfolio as we go along.","Our Rest of World business currently represents approximately 60% of revenues from Generics, with the rest from Rx and OTC. This business not only is a significant source of durable cash flows, but will be a significant contributor for sustained growth in the future. We are focusing on expansion of our strong global portfolio into various markets, which came along with Meda acquisition like China, Russia, Turkey, Mexico as well as Brazil.","Our Australia and Japanese businesses will continue to show a sustained performance. Also, we'll continue to build on our successful track record of our ARV performance and expand this further globally beyond emerging markets of Sub-Saharan Africa.","For example, we recently announced a three-year volume-based contract with a consortium constituting of UNAIDS, CHAI, Gates Foundation, PEPFAR and Global Fund to provide the new anti-retroviral therapy of TLD for more than 90 countries. This is a significant step to accelerate treatment rollout as a part of global efforts to reach all 36.7 million people living with HIV.","This initiative will give this otherwise relatively volatile business more predictability, stability and growth over a period of time. About 30% of what we believe to be our global durable cash flows come from the Rest of the World.","Before I review our key pipeline programs, let me start by saying that we are very pleased to have received FDA approval of the first generic for Copaxone 40-milligram as well as another much-needed alternative to the Copaxone 20-milligram. We have always believed in our science, regulatory and intellectual property capabilities, and we are excited to bring this affordable and substitutable product ultimately to the patients who are dealing with this very difficult disease.","This approval is a perfect example of whole Mylan's mission of providing high-quality medicines to those who need them is consistent with FDA's focus on access to complex Generics.","We also are excited about the opportunity to launch the generic version of Copaxone 40-milligram with our partner Synthon in certain key European countries as we receive EMA approval in October. Each country will now follow its own process to obtain marketing authorization to launch in their country. We have already launched generic version of Copaxone 20-milligram in certain European markets.","From the future pipeline investments point of view, we'll continue to focus on the development and manufacturing of complex products, while we diligently invest in our core businesses, including ARV's, injectables, Topicals and oral solid dosage form. This is especially the case with our injectable portfolio as we are seeing more approvals come through for these products.","As you recall, we acquired Agila with a goal of becoming a reliable, global source of high-quality injectables for patients. With a period of enhancements to the acquired facilities behind us, this goal is now a reality. This year alone, we received more than 20 approvals of injectables in U.S. and more than 70 products are in our pipeline or pending approval.","Complex and hard-to-make products especially require substantial R&D resources and investments, a strong regulatory and intellectual property expertise, along with an ability to invest significant capital to manufacture and commercialize these products. We believe Mylan is well-positioned in all of these areas to execute on our other pipeline opportunities.","Turning now to some of our key pipeline programs. Starting with our biosimilar programs. The regulatory environment continues to be active over the last few months, while we believe additional changes are still needed to enable the U.S. biosimilar market, we are encouraged by the commitments expressed by Commissioner Gottlieb, and steps being taken by U.S. FDA in facilitating the views as well as their recent initiation of their efforts to educate physicians on the benefits and the cost savings of biosimilars.","We are also very pleased at the steps we saw last week on the (20:47) for the Medicare. Regarding our Biocon partnership, we continue to see progress with the submission and regulatory process. With our pegfilgrastim application in the USA, you will recall that FDA issued a CRL relating to certain CMC data from drug product facility inspection.","It is important to highlight the fact that the CRL did not raise any questions on biosimilarity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic data, clinical data or immunogenicity. We remain very confident that we will be able to respond to the CRL in the next few weeks.","On the GMP side, Mylan and Biocon have been in close collaboration with FDA, and we have a clear path towards it \u2013 clear path forward to resolve issues identified in the inspection.","For trastuzumab in the USA, we continue to work with FDA to resolve all outstanding issues, and we are hopeful to get this very important product approved very soon. Our BsUFA goal date for this product is December 3, 2017.","With respect to our pegfilgrastim and trastuzumab applications in Europe, Mylan along with our partner Biocon has completed the corrective actions for the inspection observations and continue to make good progress toward a re-inspection of the Bangalore site.","We are also making progress on the Marketing Authorization Applications. As per the administrative protocol, we have resubmitted both applications to EMA to restart the review. We'll keep you posted on the progress on these programs as we go along.","I also note that for pegfilgrastim, we have also completed our regulatory submission for Canada, Australia and South Africa. And for trastuzumab, we have also submitted marketing applications in Canada, Australia and 32 additional countries. And we have already received approvals in another 19 countries.","With respect to Insulin Glargine, in the U.S., we submitted our 505(b)(2) application, which is under active review with FDA. You have seen that we have been sued by Sanofi, which triggered a 30-month stay on our approval. This 505(b)(2) application includes vial and disposable pens with cartridges.","For our part, we'll continue to work on this submission with FDA to bring an interchangeable alternative Glargine to the patients as soon as possible.","For Europe, the insulin manufacturing facility in Malaysia has been given GMP clearance by EMA, and we continue to have an ongoing and productive interaction with EMA on our application. In addition to the submission in U.S. and Europe, we have also submitted marketing applications in Canada, Australia and 41 additional countries. We have already received approval in six other countries.","Moving to our Momenta partnership, our biosimilar ORENCIA received initial top line results from its Phase 1 study last week, and unfortunately, it did not meet primary PK endpoints. We are disappointed by these results, and we'll work closely with Momenta to fully analyze the data and determine next steps. Additionally, with respect to our next biosimilar candidate in this partnership, M710, we continue to plan for it to enter clinics in 2018.","On the respiratory front, you will recall that we have conformed with FDA that no further clinical or device-related studies are required for our generic Advair program. We have responded to the CRL, and continue to work with FDA for this very important product.","Also, we are encouraged that FDA is treating this complex product as a high priority. We remain ready from a manufacturing and commercial perspective, and are optimistic to bring this very important product to patients as soon as possible.","Our revefenacin collaboration with Theravance Biopharma continues to make progress, and just last week, we announced a presentation to the additional positive efficacy data from the three-month pivotal Phase 3 study at 2017 CHEST Annual Meeting. We are expecting to file this NDA for a novel nebulized LAMA treatment for COPD very shortly.","If you recall, we announced previously that we have entered into a partnership with the 3M for the development of generic version of Symbicort for the U.S. market. We are excited about the progress we are making in the development of this product and are confident that we are on track towards a 2018 ANDA 505(j) submission.","Pivotal PK studies are now complete with BE demonstrated (26:27) for both low and high-strength products.","Regarding our generic form of RESTASIS, we have made good progress on our application, and we believe that we have a product that adheres to the FDA's latest new guidance. Our bridging goal date is December 31 of this year. With this district court verdict behind us, we look forward to bring this very important product to patients soon.","In summary, I remain confident that we are poised for future growth with this incredibly unique and durable platform, and I'm excited about the progress we are making within our pipeline, our continued commercial diversification reaching across different channels and geographies and our ability to mean more to our customers around the globe.","With that, I will turn the call over to Tony.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV","Thank you, Rajiv, and good morning. As Heather and Rajiv commented, the strong global diversified business we have built over the past decade gives us more confidence than ever about our future and our ability to be a key supplier to customers and patients around the world.","Our unique commercial platform is fit to withstand change in our industry and continues to distinguish Mylan as a partner of choice during a time of further customer consolidation and globalization.","One of the most important drivers behind our confidence is the daily effort made by our commercial team of nearly 7,000 people around the world. Without them, our products wouldn't reach the patients and providers who need the most. We are beginning to reap the rewards of a long-term and significant investments in science and innovation that Rajiv outlined in his remarks with the much anticipated U.S. launch of the first generic for Copaxone 40-milligram as well as a generic version of Copaxone 20-milligram.","We are particularly pleased with our prescription uptake to date for the 40-milligram strength. For the week ending October 27, our share of new prescriptions was 16.2%, and total prescriptions was approximately 8%. We also are encouraged by the number of patients who are utilizing our comprehensive support services through our MS Advocate Program.","Some of these services include in-home injection training with an experienced MS nurse, educational resources and a 24\/7 patient support center. We view this launch as a critical opportunity to provide an affordable alternative for patients and payers, while still optimizing conversion and delivering value for Mylan.","We look forward to successfully commercializing both strengths of this product in other key markets around the world as we receive appropriate regulatory approvals.","In addition to generic Copaxone in the U.S., we are pleased with the strong performance of some of our global key brands around the world such as DYMISTA, Dona, Betadine and Elavil. These important products, which were acquired through our Meda transaction, experienced significant growth this quarter and continue to exceed our original expectations. We expect this growth to continue as we leverage our strong commercial infrastructure in key markets, like Italy, France, Germany and the emerging and expansion markets.","I'd now like to provide an overview of our regional performances beginning with North America. As anticipated and outlined last quarter, this segment declined about 22% to just under $1.2 billion. Sales of EpiPen declined by $245 million this quarter, as the overall market contracted when compared to the robust growth from the same quarter the prior year, as well as experiencing additional competition.","Excluding EpiPen, North America declined 6% as anticipated and as outlined last quarter, primarily due to the impact of significant first-to-market products losing exclusivity over the prior year, as well as increased competition. We are still estimating annualized price erosion in the high single digits for the region for 2017.","Despite these challenges, we continue to see momentum and be excited about the future for this region. We've been pleased with the launches of several limited competition products this quarter, most notably, the launch of Imatinib tablets further strengthen our robust U.S. oncology portfolio, which now contains more than 40 products.","This is a very important therapeutic area for Mylan, globally, which would bolster even further in the coming years with the introduction of several biosimilars to treat cancer.","That said, I am pleased to report that the geographic diversity of our platform, which we have been building over the last 10 years, also has been balancing pressure in North America.","In Europe, sales totaled more than $1 billion, a year-over-year increase of 24%. These strong results were due to incremental sales from our Meda acquisition and favorable pricing and volume trends in the region. This includes mid-single-digit organic growth in the region, specifically in some of our largest markets, such as France, Italy, Germany, UK and the Nordics.","We also continue to be excited about the stability and performance of our strong brands in the region, such as Creon and Influvac, as well as new growth from brands like Betadine and DYMISTA. This quarter's growth from our acquired assets reinforces our confidence that building scale in Europe under our One Mylan approach has us well positioned within the region.","In our Rest of World segment, sales totaled $740 million, a year-over-year increase of 9%, driven primarily by our new Meda assets and strong performance in emerging markets.","We are also seeing strong performance from some of our key brands in this region. Amitiza, for instance, delivered robust growth of more than 20% for the quarter in Japan, and we will continue to seek ways to optimize our assets and partnerships in this market.","Overall, for the third quarter, we saw, as expected, global generic price deflation in the mid-single digits, and we continue to anticipate this for the full-year 2017.","In summary, we believe our unique product mix of Generics, brands and over-the-counter medications across a range of therapeutic categories and sold in multiple sales channels, combined with an expansive geographic reach and strong commercial platform, position Mylan better than any other company in the industry to serve our customers and deliver better health for patients.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results for the third quarter, total revenues in the quarter declined slightly year-over-year to approximately $3 billion. Rajiv and Tony have already taken you through our top line results for Mylan, in total and our segments; I'll now take you through the rest of our financial performance, which was in line with our expectations.","In the third quarter, our adjusted gross margins were approximately 53% compared to approximately 57% from the same period last year. The decline is the result of lower gross profit from the sales of existing products in North America, primarily EpiPen, partially mitigated by new product introductions and contributions from last year's acquisitions.","Moving on to our operating expenses, on an adjusted basis, R&D was approximately 6% of total revenues, which was in line with our expectations and down slightly from the prior year period due to the timing of clinical activities related primarily to our respiratory programs. SG&A expense, also on an adjusted basis, declined 3% to $586 million, or approximately 20% of total revenues and also in line with our expectations. In the quarter, the benefits from our ongoing Mylan integration activities more than offset the incremental SG&A from our Meda acquisition.","Our adjusted tax rate was 17.5% for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date tax rate to 18%. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be in the range of 18% to 18.5%.","Moving on to segment profitability, as a result of the declines in third-party sales, including EpiPen, segment profitability in North America declined 27% in the quarter to $576 million. Partially offsetting this decline, segment profitability expanded in the Europe and Rest of World segments, reflecting contributions from the Meda acquisition as well as new products sales. When compared to the prior year period, Europe segment profitability was up 15% and Rest of World segment profitability was up 16%. Adjusted net earnings in the quarter declined to $590 million, and adjusted diluted EPS declined 20% to $1.10.","Briefly turning to our results for the nine months ended September 30, total revenues increased to approximately $8.7 billion. That's a year-over-year increase of 11%. Acquisitions contributed approximately $1.4 billion in net sales during the nine-month period, and adjusted earnings for the nine months ended September 30 decreased by $26 million to $1.7 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS decreased 5% to $3.13.","Now, turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30 compared to approximately $1.9 billion in the prior year period.","Capital expenditures totaled $156 million compared to approximately $240 million in the prior year. As we said previously, we are fully committed to continuing to deleverage and have demonstrated that by paying down our debt by approximately $1.2 billion in the first nine months of the year, which includes approximately $420 million in the third quarter.","As a result of our continued strong cash flow generation, for the full year, we expect to deliver on our initial cash flow guidance of between $2 billion to $2.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow, net of our revised capital expenditures range of $300 million to $350 million.","Our ability to generate strong cash flows reflects the strength and durability of our portfolio, resulting from the decade-long transformation of our business into a global diversified player, and is supported by the power of our balance sheet, which provides us with the financial flexibility to invest in the future of our business.","At the end of Q3 2017, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio as calculated under our credit agreement was 3.6 times and was in compliance with our covenant requirements. You may recall that following the Meda acquisition, we elected to increase the leverage ratio covenant as permitted under our credit agreement to 4.25 times through the second quarter of 2017.","Just last week, on November 3, we entered into amendments to the agreements for the 2016 term loans and 2016 revolving facility to extend the leverage ratio covenant of 4.25 times through the December 31, 2018, reporting period. These amendments provide us with the additional financial flexibility as we manage our capital structure during 2018.","This does not change in any way our commitment to our deleveraging strategy or maintaining our investment-grade credit rating as we continue to work towards our long-term average debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio target of approximately 3.0 times.","Moving on to the revised guidance, primarily due to the approval and subsequent launch of generic Copaxone in the U.S. market, we've increased the low end of both our full year total revenue and adjusted EPS 2017 guidance ranges.","Our revised total revenue guidance range is $11.75 billion to $12.5 billion, which represents an increase of 9% at the midpoint versus full-year 2016. Our new adjusted EPS guidance range is between $4.45 to $4.70 per share, that's a decrease of 6% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year. This year-over-year decline reflects the ongoing North America generic business dynamics as well as the more than $500 million impact from the rebasing of our EpiPen brand.","Moving to 2018, as Heather mentioned, we're continuing to target at least $5.40 in adjusted EPS, which is an increase of more than 18% from the midpoint of our new guidance range for 2017. This target factors in the launch of generic Copaxone as well as the deferred launches of complex products from 2017, including generic Advair.","It also includes incremental savings from integration activities and cost actions, continued growth in our Europe and Rest of World segments as well as the continuation of a challenging North American environment. We'll provide further details of our 2018 outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call.","Before I turn it over to Q&A, I urge all of you to take a closer look at the Built to Last presentation that Heather spoke about earlier and which is posted on our website this morning. We're very proud of the business that we've built over the last decade, and this presentation highlights our transformational journey as well as the path we plan to take to fully realize the value transformation and our differentiated portfolio. We believe that our differentiated business model, our performance and our stable, durable cash flow generation are not yet reflected in our stock price valuation.","With that, we'll now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Elliot Wilbur from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","(42:45). Thanks. Good morning. A question for Heather and the team, I guess, as you head into the year-end and you think about the budgeting, planning and, obviously, forecasting process, certain things like uncertainty and variability in the U.S. generic market is going to remain high elevated for the foreseeable future...","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Elliot, I'm sorry. Operator, if you could \u2013 we're not being able to hear you, Elliot at all on your questions.","Operator","","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Could you hear me now?","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Much better.","Operator","You may proceed with your question sir, your line is still open.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Sorry about that. A question for Heather and the rest of the team, I guess, as we head into year-end budgeting, planning, forecasting process, obviously, uncertainty around where generic market is going to likely remain high for the foreseeable future.","So just wondering, what you're thinking about in terms of or how you would characterize what you think are the greatest risks or the greatest unknowns at this point, whether it's continued uncertainty around FDA approval timelines for pending pipeline products, the impact of additional competitive entrants on portfolio products or sort of ongoing or evolving consortium purchasing dynamics. Just maybe sort of comment or kind of rank order, where you think the greatest risk among those factors lie with respect to the base business? Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Sure. Thanks, Elliot. Look, Elliot, what I would say and hopefully, this call continues to underscore the global nature of our business. I think all the weaknesses you just laid out are all primarily U.S. driven. And as we continue to show, both from our European as well as our Rest of World segments, our ability to continue to grow at double-digit in the case of Europe and high single-digit in Rest of World, that as we continue to leverage our assets, our products in these areas and continue to bring complex Generics as we'll be launching Copaxone throughout Europe. I think those are very important to telling the story of how we're continuing to be able to absorb the volatility in this U.S. Generics market, and which is why I made the commentary that just to remind everyone that we moved out of the neighborhood of just U.S. Generics and Specialty and into this global community, that's helping us absorb that, and the Mylan that we built today is able to continue to deliver and on our growth profile as we continue to bring these products to market.","As far as the U.S. Generics, we continue to see those headwinds are going to continue for the foreseeable future, but I think again, the dynamics of our portfolio of the products we're launching, Rajiv spoke of the multiple injectable products we've launched and the 70 that are in our pipeline. So the durability again of what we are launching from complex to injectables as well as continuing to deliver on our outside of the U.S. platform is what's able to give us the confidence to say that at least $5.40 next year. Given all those things you just mentioned, taking into consideration. So what I would say is just again the message of the durability of our platform and our ability to absorb the volatility, which we believe really distinguishes us from our peers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Heather, maybe if you could just take a step back and would love your thoughts on what you're seeing industry-wide, obviously the industry has been decimated with all the factors we've already talked about. But that's leading to in some cases, consolidation, other companies like Novartis, Mallinckrodt, maybe others are talking about selling their generic businesses.","Where do you see Mylan fitting in with all this change? Are you in a financial position to be able to take advantage of some of these assets coming to the market, presumably at lower prices? And, I guess, Ken, to that question, I'm just wondering if \u2013 you've talked about your goal of getting your debt-to-EBITDA to three times or better. How flexible would you be on that if the right deal were to come up? Thanks very much.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Hi, Jami, so thank you. We have been pretty staunch since the Meda acquisition that we really had the assets that we needed to leverage this global commercial platform and have that infrastructure in place.","With that being said, we've continued to say as we see bolt-on opportunities that we can now use this commercial platform that we've built to be able to continue to feed this platform, we'll do so. And I think to your point, it truly is a buyers' market, because there's lots of great assets out there for sale and we think at reasonable prices.","So I can assure you that the financial flexibility that we still have today and are maintaining because of our \u2013 the generation of our cash flows, that we're going to continue to be balanced as far as, yes, paying down debt and staying committed to investment grade, but also have the flexibility to be able to bring the right products or dosage forms into our mix, both whether it's U.S., Europe or Rest of World, and I think you're going to continue to see us execute on that.","And the last thing I'd say, because I think your point about the decimation of the industry, I think one thing I would just ask, and I've said this before, but I think it's continuing to play out is the continuity of our management team and the tenure of it. We've been together a decade, as we've continued to not only manage at the peaks, but in the valleys.","And I think that's where you see a management team that has \u2013 had a strategy out there, we've executed to it. We've continued to navigate the waters, I think, better than anybody else out there.","So hopefully, that differentiation is what continues to put investors at ease with not only the credibility we've now hopefully amassed on the scientific side, but also just being able to continue to maximize this global platform and absorb what the industry is going through here in the U.S.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","Listen (49:29), Jami, I would just add on that on the financial discipline side and flexibility, you've seen us last year even with the Meda acquisition and a leverage ratio covenant extended to 4.25 times that we really never reached more than 3.8 times, and we remain committed to bringing that down as you've seen last quarter and this quarter down to 3.6 times under our credit agreement calculations.","We did say, and I did say in this call that we've asked and obtained an extension from our banks at 4.25 times for the balance of 2017 and 2018, and that doesn't mean we're not committed to continuing to de-lever. But it actually speaks to the strength of our cash flows, and we talked about that a lot during the call today, as well as the fact that, as Heather said, in this environment, there are assets out in the marketplace that we just are going to continue to take a look at for potential bolt-on opportunities. And the banking group supports us, and that's why we have continued to de-lever, but have asked for that extension at 4.25 times. So there is a little bit of flexibility in our financial decision there, but obviously, with the discipline that over the long-term, we target a 3.0 times EBITDA leverage ratio number.","Operator","Thank You. Our next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS. Your line is open.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Just in the U.S., Tony, can you talk about the Econdisc and WBAD, the latest consortium to get together. I'm just wondering if you're starting to see any impact from that in this quarter. When do you expect we'll know what type of impact to expect there?","And then, just in Europe, I mean, it was a pretty big number, and I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of was there any major launches? I mean, was Copaxone a big number in the quarter? Or biosimilars? Just give us a sense of was there anything unusual, because it was pretty good. Thanks.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV","Thanks, Marc. Around the global customers we're speaking of, in particular WBAD and Econdisc, we continue to work very closely with them and all of our customers to ensure that we're identifying not just risk, but opportunities. We feel like the markets we're in globally gives us a very good advantage in terms of how we overlay our portfolio with those particular opportunities. And as Econdisc joins WBAD, we feel like we reviewed it and looked at it and feel confident that we have the opportunity to grow in the future as these customers get larger with more scale across multiple markets, so.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","And for Europe \u2013 Marc, this is Rajiv. I think we see a slew of launches; not of big launches, but the multiple countries and multiple launches. But more importantly, the portfolio expansion and the focus and attention these brands are getting, not only to sustain, but continue to grow, that's driving it basically. That's driving the growth in Europe.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","And one other \u2013 as you think about how the numbers come together, remember that we closed the Meda acquisition in early August of last year. So the year-over-year results do have an incremental month of Meda in them, especially in Europe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, everybody. Good morning, congratulations on the result (52:56). Two, if I can sneak one in. One, you've got a corporate contingency in your cash flow statements of $275 million. Can you just let us know what that is? And second on Advair, do you have a target action date? And do you expect one?","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","So on the first question, Ronny, I think what you're seeing is that in the reconciliation in the back of the press release, there's an add-back of $275 million to get from GAAP operating cash flows to adjusted operating cash flows. As we called out, we paid for about half of the DOJ settlement in the third quarter. The other half has already been paid in the fourth, but that's essentially what makes up the $275 million.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","And Ronny, for Advair, yes, we have a target action date of June, middle of June. But at the same time, given this GDUFA I and GDUFA II, the bridging goal date, this being a high-priority product to the FDA, we continue to work with FDA very closely on this to better (54:03) that date.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","And I would just say, to add to that, that with the new Commissioner Gottlieb, his emphasis on complex Generics and being very mindful of bringing products to new market formation, we continue to know that generic Advair stays a priority review. And to Rajiv's point, we're hopeful as all the science behind us that we will continue to stay very close and work with this administration on what they've stated as real priority for them as well. So we find that very encouraging.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Your line is open.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. I have two, if I may. First, maybe for Heather. Heather, is there an EPS number between $5.40 and $6 for 2018, which could serve as a threshold for additional compensation for senior leadership? Is there a $5.70 EPS, for example? Just wanted to understand that.","And then, secondly, Rajiv, could you just give us some more color on RESTASIS, specifically, what you meant? The bridging date is end of December 2018. So does that put your potential target action date in second half of 2018? I just wanted to make sure we fully understood that. Thank you.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Hey, Umer, so thank you. So first, Umer, what I would say is that our target of at least $5.40 is just that: our target. And when we come out in Q4, we'll certainly give detailed guidance and, at that time, provide ranges and everything, as appropriate. And I think any of the other disclosures are certainly out there that you can go check on our website, but I would just say that's why we feel very confident in our at least $5.40.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Yeah. And on RESTASIS, actually, if you have tracked, we had a target action date, Umer, on September, and that's when we received a IR (56:00) based on that new guidance change, which was immediately addressed and submitted. And this bridging goal date is now, basically, the December end is a bridging goal date, and there is no \u2013 we believe we have addressed every aspect of science (56:13), and we can be technically looking us getting over the threshold and getting approval of this very important product by this date.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","And I think, Umer, that just underscores what we had said earlier, what \u2013 our mission of continuing to fight for and bring affordable Generics to the marketplace, globally, is what drives us, and I think this is a great example of persevering through what I would call pretty desperate legal maneuvers to try to maintain a monopoly that should have been gone a couple of years ago, and our ability continue to fight not only in the courts, but with the science and have a clear pathway to approvals. So we're looking forward to bringing this important product to the market.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Another two-parter. I was hoping, Tony, I know you're not emphasizing the U.S. part of the generic neighborhood today. But on the generic price in the U.S. excluding the effect of your launches or the semi-exclusive products, was the erosion on your base of products, let's say, that they have been on the market more than a year, the same as it's been in recent quarters, or did it get better? Did it get worse?","And separately for Heather and Ken, you both commented on dissatisfaction about your valuation. Would your acknowledge that part of the valuation disconnect can be accounted for by investor perception around shareholder friendliness and corporate governance. And if so, what are you doing tangibly to address those? Thanks.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV","Thanks, Gregg. On the U.S. Generics portion of the business, certainly, we've been discussing and talking about a full year number of mid-single digits, and I would say for Q3, we talked to you last quarter about it being a little bit choppy as well as Q4 just due to specifically around some significant first-to-file products in the previous year for the quarter that we're measuring against.","So, I would say it was exactly where we thought we would be. And, at the same time, looking from a full year perspective, we feel high single digits is the accurate estimate that we have for 2017.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Yes, Gregg. And as far as our discontent with the valuation, I think, as I said, I'm personally committed to get out there and educate and sit down with our shareholders to really talk about the business we have today, because I think that what you'll find in the presentation that we provided, Built to Last, is that when you look at Mylan in the portfolio, we have in each of these segments and you look at peers within, especially Europe and Rest of World and some of the valuations that are happening around their businesses where we have as good, if not, better businesses within those geographical regions, I think that's where a multiple expansion is certainly warranted when you now put our whole global product mix together.","And I don't believe that's rooted or grounded in governance, I think that as we continue to have shareholder meetings and certainly stay open-minded and have these discussions, again, what I can say is, we look at companies out there around the globe with a whole host of governance issues from family-owned to a whole wide array of how they're on the public markets. We really believe it's the fundamentals that should drive that valuation, and we believe that the shareholder outreach program is going to go a long way to help rebase and have honestly us get credit of the company we've built over the last decade. And believe that we've got a real strong lead ahead of anybody else out there and have a real opportunity to really be the bellwether of this industry.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","Couldn't agree with Heather more, and I would just say, look, from a finance perspective, the presentation just went out there this morning. I would ask you to just really take time and take that presentation apart, because what you'll see is that under kind of any kind of measures, you would look at the performance, you would look at the global footprint, you look at the stable, durable cash flows of this business, and it is truly, truly undervalued.","And the message that we're all trying to get across today and over the coming months, because we'll be out there talking to you more as we put this together, and we think the solidification of the business transformation has effectively been completed is we'll talk about that opportunity. But what I would challenge you to do is look at the numbers, look at the math, look at the compares and any case, the stock price, the company is not fully valued yet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Douglas Tsao from Barclays. Your line is open.","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Just a question on the Copaxone launch. If we look at the scripts according to IMS, the traction in the 40-milligram seems to be going very nicely, not necessarily being reflected in terms of the 20-milligram. Just curious if we should expect that to upturn? Or do you see most of the opportunity lying in the 40-milligram? Thank you.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV","What I would say Doug certainly, we knew from launch on onset that the 40-milligram made up almost 85% of the market. However, the 20-milligram is still very important to us as well, and we're very encouraged the 40-milligram script trend is (1:01:29), specifically new prescription trends over 16% after three weeks of launch, we feel like this is a tremendous opportunity, as well as an opportunity to look at market expansion, with 17 brands in MS space and only a one generic with the 40-milligram, we think there's an opportunity to expand on that product and expand the market at the same time. So yes, the 20-milligram is equally important to us, although the 40-milligram is the larger opportunity.","Operator","Thank you.

Welcome to the Mylan Third Quarter 2018 Financial Results. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] We will have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Now it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call to Melissa Trombetta, Head of Global Investor Relations. You may begin.","Melissa Trombetta","Thank you, Carmen. Good evening, everyone. Welcome to Mylan\u2019s third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me for today\u2019s call are Mylan\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; Chief Commercial Officer, Tony Mauro; and Chief Financial Officer, Ken Parks.","During today\u2019s call, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial guidance for 2018. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from today\u2019s projections.","Please refer to the earnings release we furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K earlier today, as well as our supplemental earnings slides, all of which are posted on our website at investor.mylan.com for a fuller explanation of those risks and uncertainties and the limits applicable to forward-looking statements.","Mylan routinely posts information that may be important to investors on this website and we use this website address as a means of disclosing material information to the public in a broad, non-exclusionary manner for purposes of the SEC\u2019s Regulation Fair Disclosure.","In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We will refer to these measures as adjusted and present them in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance.","Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measures, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to those GAAP measures, are available in our third quarter earnings release and supplemental earnings slides, as well as on our website.","Let me also remind you that the information discussed during this call, except for the participants\u2019 questions is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan\u2019s express written permission. An archived copy of today\u2019s call will be available on our website and will remain available for a limited time.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Heather.","Heather Bresch","Thank you, Melissa. Good afternoon and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. While we are continuing to see the global healthcare environment evolve at a rapid space, Mylan\u2019s third quarter performance was in line with our expectations and we delivered solid year-over-year growth. However, in the market search for stability, analyzing certain indicators and isolation can exacerbate volatility.","We will discuss our perspective related to several examples of these during today\u2019s call whether that be Mylan\u2019s pending generic Advair approval, utilization of biosimilars and complex generics or the overemphasis of the impact of commoditized oral solid dose products within our North America business.","Our ability to deliver long-term growth is not dependent upon the timing of any one approval, any one country\u2019s market dynamics or any one dosage form, but rather the broader, more complete context of Mylan\u2019s global diversified business model.","More than 7,500 products around the world divided almost equally between generic and brand sales, market leadership in countries around our geographies and a scientific platform that has generated a record number of complex generics and biosimilar launches for Mylan year-to-date. We continue to believe Mylan is built to last.","With all this said, we remain committed to our full year 2018 guidance provided in August and this confirmation is not dependent on any single product approval or launch.","In North America, while our business is predominantly generic, we are benefiting from a broader mix of dosage forms well beyond oral solids and are seeing continued stabilization of the pricing environment. Year-to-date, we have launched nearly 40 new products in North America with two-thirds of these being injectables.","In Europe, our business benefits from an equal mix of branded generic and over-the-counter products. Year-to-date, we have launched nearly 300 products across all of these channels. Our commercial infrastructure in Europe allows us to maximize key launches such as our insulin analog and the first wave of our biosimilar to Humira across countries in this region.","In our Rest of World segment, Mylan\u2019s smallest but fastest growing region, we have seen consistent double-digit growth for the year, with more than 130 new product launches year-to-date. We also continue to benefit from organic and inorganic new product opportunities in this region, including Sebivo and TOBI.","These results are made possible, thanks to the successful integration of our differentiated global platform, which allows this management team to be 100% focused on executing and maximizing the organic shareholder value contribution of all of our global assets.","We are in opposition to explore opportunities to drive capital market discipline down into every segment of our business, distinguishing between value creating and value consuming growth, and then focusing our strategies and investment, while driving economically profitable growth.","As we look ahead, we are very optimistic about our long-term growth prospects. We have secured almost all regulatory approvals necessary for our key 2019 product drivers around the world. But given the reality of today\u2019s operating environment, we know that it\u2019s not enough"," We still have the important work of ensuring our products get pulled through the system and into the patient hands who need them. Perseverance and adaptability are prevailing, and we continue to see utilization uptick with our Glatiramer Acetate, our HIV portfolio and our biosimilar to Neulasta as prime examples.","Our employees are critical to this effort, each of them contribute to our mission to provide the world\u2019s 7 billion people access to medicine, and I\u2019d like to thank them for their hard work and continued dedication to Mylan.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rajiv to provide you with some greater details on developments from this quarter. ","Rajiv Malik","Thank you, Heather. Let me start by celebrating the broad contribution impact of our Morgantown facility, restructuring and remediation which began in the second quarter of this year on our North American business, as this may have been misunderstood by the investment community.","Our U.S. business is much more than commoditized oral solid doses and consists of a broad portfolio of injectables, drums, semisolids in addition to hard to make oral solids. Currently, only one of our top 10 and eight of our top 50 gross margin generating products for North America are manufactured in Morgantown. It should be noted that we did not expect to have any significant new product launches from the site in 2019.","As we work to reduce the complexity of this facility, we have proactively discontinued a number of products, while also transferring some to other sites. These actions have led to a temporary disruption in supply of certain products for our customers and reduced volume in North America generic sales. However, the value related to the rationalize product is not proportionate to the reduced volumes of those commoditized products.","While we are executing on our commitment to FDA, the plant continues to supply products for the U.S. market. Our remediation and restructuring activities will continue in the near-term. We understand that this current and temporary situation post a burden on our customers and appreciate their ongoing confidence in Mylan, based on our outstanding historical track record.","As one of world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical market, the U.S. remains a key market for Mylan. We will continue to focus on providing a broad range of products, including industry-leading new launches and maintaining a meaningful market share across a diversified portfolio. No matter, where our products are produced in our network, our goal is to ensure the highest quality and service levels to our customer and optimal volume value mix.","As Heather mentioned, over the past 12 months, we have had a record-breaking year of scientific accomplishments, representing a significant milestone in the company\u2019s nearly 60-year history and validating our strength in managing and executing on complex product approvals. This is a culmination of year\u2019s long scientific investments and endeavors to bring complex generics and biosimilars to the market.","Our team\u2019s managing designs and working closely with our partner have consistently delivered remarkable results and we are looking forward to continuing this momentum as we close out 2018 anticipating approval for generic Advair, Wixela and revefenacin, YUPELRI. Mylan will continue to differentiate itself by leveraging its site platform and adding more complex products to our portfolio over the long-term.","Regarding Wixela, we are in the continuous and ongoing discussions with FDA regarding the progress of the review. Based on our latest update from agency, they are in the final stage of labeling review. We continue to believe that FDA will be able to resolve any outstanding issues very soon.","Now I\u2019d like to take opportunity to elaborate on the previously disclosed acquisition of worldwide rights to cystic fibrosis products TOBI Podhaler and TOBI solution from Novartis. This is a meaningful and strategic addition to our respiratory platform in U.S.A. and a very complementary and durable addition to our Creon Franchise in Europe, Australia, Japan and Canada, and also broadens our portfolio of dry powder inhaler and nebulized products.","Such bolt-on acquisitions must first and foremost be strategically aligned to boost our franchise, as well as deliver on our financial metrics, such as EPS accretion and ROIC. This asset acquisition is not only strategic but checks all of our financial metrics softness.","Before I turn it over to Ken, I would like to expect my appreciation to our employees around the world for their hard work, dedication and many contributions. Thank you.","Ken Parks","Thanks, Rajiv, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll take a few minutes to provide a quick overview of our financial results for the third quarter. Total revenues of $2.9 billion were 4% lower than the prior year or 2% lower, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange.","On a constant currency basis, Europe, which was up 2% and Rest of World, which was up 11% help to mitigate a 13% decline in North America. The decrease in North America net sales was primarily driven by lower volumes on existing products, including EpiPen, partially offset by new product sales, including the recent launch of Fulphila.","The decline in volumes was primarily driven by the timing of purchases of our products by customers and actions associated with the restructuring and remediation program at our Morgantown manufacturing facility.","In addition, North America net sales were negatively impacted by approximately $50 million related to the implementation of the new revenue recognition accounting standard at the beginning of 2018. North America net sales excluding the $50 million impact were down 9% versus the prior year.","Adjusted net earnings increased 10% to $648 million and adjusted diluted EPS increased 14% to $1.25 during the quarter. That includes benefits from ongoing integration activities and the lower share count following the completion of our $1 billion share repurchase program in the beginning of the year.","Moving to segment profitability, excluding approximately $98 million of expenses related to the Morgantown restructuring or remediation program, North America adjusted segment profitability declined 6%, which is less than the rate of the sales decline, and primarily due to the impact of new product launches and favorable product mix. Europe\u2019s profitability grew 7% during the quarter, mostly driven by new product sales and favorable product mix also.","Rest of World profitability expanded 45%, mostly driven by new product sales, including those in our ARV franchise, Australia and China. Both Europe and Rest of World continue to benefit from our ongoing Mylan integration activities, as we execute on our plans to further optimize our cost structure.","Adjusted free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 totaled $2 billion, an increase of 6% compared to the prior year, reflecting favorable working capital performance and lower capital expenditures.","Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow conversion was healthy at approximately 119% of adjusted net earnings, another measure of the strength and durability of the cash flow generating capabilities of our business.","At the end of Q3 2018, we reduced our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio to 3.8 times. As anticipated, our capital deployment priority is focused on deleveraging in the second half of 2018 and we expect this to continue into 2019. We intend to repay at least $1.2 billion of debt, maturing through the end of 2019, including \u20ac500 million maturing later this year and the balance maturing next year.","Our solid free cash flow generation could allow us to repay additional debt in 2019 and we will provide an update of our complete 2019 debt repayment and leverage targets when we provide our 2019 outlook.","We remain fully committed to our investment grade credit rating and to further reducing leverage as we work towards our long-term average debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio target of approximately 3.0 times.","Finally, as you heard earlier, we are reaffirming our full year 2018 guidance. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $11.25 billion to $12.25 billion, which is roughly flat at the midpoint versus 2017.","We also expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.55 per share to $4.90 per share, which represents an increase of 4% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year. For cash flow, we continue to expect to generate between $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion of adjusted free cash flow, which is consistent with our initial guidance for 2018.","As we discussed over the last few quarters, we are continuing to evaluate metrics other than EPS that better reflect how we manage and measure the performance of the business. We expect to utilize those metrics, as we provide guidance externally on the outlook for the business and we will provide more detail when we update you on the 2019 outlook call early next year.","With that, we will now open up the call for questions. Carmen? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Elliot Wilbur","Thank you and good afternoon. I guess, specifically, wanted to get a little bit more color and insight into some of the segment profitability metrics. I guess, specifically, North America and Europe both were very strong despite some constraints on the topline, in fact, I think, you are close to a record level since you began the new segments disclosure reporting a couple of years ago, wouldn\u2019t have expected that North America kind of given the absence of EpiPen contribution and not really sure what kind of drove this strong year-over-year and sequential profitability trends in Europe as well. So maybe just a little bit more insight into those to name it would be helpful. Thanks.","Ken Parks","Hey, Elliot. Thank you for the question. You are exactly right. I mean, this was a strong profitability growth quarter, not just for Europe and for North America, but also for the Rest of World.","And as we talked about in the comments, as I talked about specifically in the comments and you can see when you look at our press release, our gross margin ratio increased from a little more than 52% on an adjusted basis, last year in the third quarter to more than 55% this year.","Called out, basically the two drivers in both places, number one -- both places being North America and Europe. Number one, our product launches, new product launches and we have talked about that as we move through the year.","We specifically said that new product launches in Europe will be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year, and we saw both in Europe and North America exactly the expectations that we had moving into the quarter. Those new product launches tend to run at profitability levels slightly higher than the overall Mylan average. So that was a positive contributor in both North America and Europe regions.","Secondly, I would call out for Europe specifically, we have talked about as we have come into 2018, the focus and investment into our global key brands. Some of those global key brands are other than the legacy Mylan business, some of them are out of the EPD business we acquired a couple of years ago and some of those come out of the Meda business that we acquired in 2016"," We called it out, because we said, as we moved into 2018, we were going to continue to reap the benefits from our Mylan integration activity and we able to reduce our overall G&A cost, and at the same time, take that money invested back into selling and marketing to support those global key brands that are very sensitive to advertising promotion and selling efforts in the countries across Europe specifically and that\u2019s exactly what we have done this year.","We had the savings from G&A and we have had the discipline and focus and leadership and teams to support these global key brands in not just one market but multiple markets. So that should give you a little bit more color. It\u2019s really about product launches. You have heard scientific capabilities and that\u2019s turning into revenues and profits and then the focus on our global key brands.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Ronny Gal","Good afternoon. Congratulations on a very nice quarter. I wanted to touch on two things if I can. First, I noticed that UNH contracts were your preferred brand for their plan, so nice execution there on a commercial marketing side. And just you can let us know what roughly the pricing is for this product versus its list price or some other metric whether this is more of a generic level pricing or more of a branded level pricing. And similarly with most of the European adalimumab contract already in, can you give us a fair an assessment of where your volume will stand -- your volume share will stand in 2019 in Europe?","Ken Parks","Yeah. Ronny, thanks for the question. First of the UNH, I think thank you for recognizing this. It\u2019s a great opportunity. We think this partnership we have with United really provides enormous amount of access and affordability to this marketplace and we think this unique contracting opportunity really will drive opportunity not just in 2018 but in 2019 as well.","And as it relates to Hulio, our Humira products in Europe, it\u2019s just beginning, we are seeing tenders as you have noted across many of the European markets like the Netherlands, Norway and Denmark. Certainly we feel like there\u2019s a huge -- a tremendous opportunity within Europe, not just in the tenant markets but in the markets where we have physician substitution. So we are excited about the beginning of the launch, winning a few tenders in select markets and really expanding on that going forward into 2019.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Chris Schott","Great. Thank you very much for the question. The first one I have is on Morgantown, any additional color you can provide in terms of the impact, the remediation is having on both your top and bottomline adjusted results, as well as any more granularity on when in \u201819 we can expect operations to begin to normalize that facility? And just a quick second one just is an update on the strategic review, any timelines where we can think about an uptake here and directionally any color in terms of what the committee is spending its time evaluating? Thank you.","Rajiv Malik","Thanks, Chris. I\u2019ll take Morgantown and Heather will comment on the second part. Chris, as you will anticipate, when we have taken -- undertaken the remediation and the restructuring. Because we mentioned in our quarter two, calls that just to manage the -- manage to keep pace with FDAs revolving standards we need to rationalize and simplify the plant and reduce the complexity.","So we had undertaken certain discontinuation of commodity products, as well as moving these products within our network to some other sites. So we -- I think, if we separate qualitative and quantitative, it\u2019s more a qualitative issue for us, because it has set off from the customers service level point of view our reputation as a reliable supplier.","That\u2019s where I think we have seen the more pain rather than the quantitative one, because what -- where we have lots of doses is mostly on commodity products with the, yes, you see a couple of billion doses going down. But there -- as we mentioned, disproportionately, they are not from the value point of view there.","So we -- as we go in 2019, you will see us restructuring in Morgantown, that\u2019s number one, but basically balancing the network so that we can optimal delivery the meaningful market share, the value and the volume mix, so that\u2019s where we are heading.","Heather Bresch","And Chris, as far as the strategic review, as we just announced it last quarter. I can assure you the Board is busy looking at lots of things as we talked about unlocking that value, and I think that, when they are ready for an update we certainly will put that out. But we have put no timeframes around that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Liav Abraham with Citi. Your line is open.","Liav Abraham","Good evening. A couple of quick questions, firstly, can you just provide a little more granular details on the Fulphila launch and how that\u2019s progressing. And then, secondly, Ken, in the past you have provided us with a breakdown of revenue for new products in the quarter, broken down into U.S. and Rest of World. Could you provide that for this quarter as well? Thank you.","Tony Mauro","Yes. Thank you. On Fulphila, maybe just to give you kind of what\u2019s been our approach when we talk about this surgical launch, we really had been focusing on community oncology clinics as well as hospital-based outpatient clinics. So as we continue to watch weekly, we see our weekly movement into these clinics such as going to 700 units a week to 800 units a week here and we see that continuing to grow. Last week alone we are a little over 8% of the pre-filled syringe market, which makes up almost 50% of the entire Neulasta marketplace.","So we are very happy. We are very happy where we are at today and where we continue to see our trends are grow and continuing to build upon that oncology practice experience, and really building out relationships with the GPOs and the IDMs in terms of how we can look at long-term value continuing to grow in capital share in this very, very large U.S. marketplace.","Ken Parks","And Liav, so for the quarter we had slightly under $300 million of new product launch revenues, which I would say, about half of that came out of North America overall and the remainder of it was split between Europe, our API and ARV business, and then the remainder was in just kind of the Rest of World segment. So that would be kind of the highest level breakdown on where that\u2019s coming from.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Nachman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Gary Nachman","Hi. Good afternoon. With generic Copaxone you have been taking more share in the last couple of months. So what types of formulary wins have you been getting and how much additional price did you have to give up to get that share? And if generic Advair is approved soon, what do you expect market formation to look like at this point? Thank you.","Tony Mauro","Maybe just to hit upon Copaxone, what I will say is, we had said the last quarter and the previous quarter, we weren\u2019t happy where our market share was, and we have been continuing to focus on this with pharmacies, with PBMs and with payers.","And you are right, over the last quarter, we have seen sequential 25% gain in market share, up 5% total market share gaining Q2 to Q3, at one point in Q3 new scripts were getting the 30% level for the first time. So we are very excited where we are going but we are not finished and we have got more to do and more to work with as it relates to that. And as it relates to Advair? ","Heather Bresch","Yeah. I would just add as it relates to Advair, whenever the market does form, we believe it\u2019s going to be an important product for a long period of time. As you know, a very high barrier-to-entry, very complicated product, we look forward to bringing it to the market, but believe that, as we have continued to learn about and as the continued dynamics evolve with how to pull product through, I can assure you we will be launching in a smart as we can to ensure that we are able to get into the patients hand. So we look forward to the launch as soon as it can happen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore. Your line is open.","Umer Raffat","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. First on EpiPen, my question is you are filing say no more than 3% of any product is -- no more than 3% of your revenues are any single product. So that would imply EpiPen and its authorized generic being something like 350 million. But we are seeing Pfizer report 174 million first nine months alone or 230 million run rate. So that Pfizer run rate doesn\u2019t quite reconcile with EpiPen and its AG being 350. Is it fair to say, EpiPen\u2019s 350 and the AG\u2019s another 200? And as Ken, for your debt paydown schedule, are you assuming any significant change in your working capital or any new securitizations?","Ken Parks","So I -- Umer number one, your statement, the reiteration of our statement around no product accounting for more than 3% of total revenues is absolutely correct and so the math would get you exactly where you laid out for us. I can\u2019t speak to what Pfizer has out there, but I can tell you exactly what we know, which are the numbers we manage and the sales that we account for, and your first statement is exactly debt on and consistent with our earlier statements.","On the debt pay down, what I would tell you is, we have shown over the last couple of years consistent improvement in working capital velocity. The couple of days per quarter in a year-over-year comparison of improvement and working capital days on hand, which is exactly what we are driving towards as we move to the balance of this year and into 2019. And we are going to have a lot of opportunities to take a look at where that working capital velocity will come from.","We have talked in some of the settings, including in our Investor Day earlier this year, how we got Europe combined all on a single ERP system instance, and in doing so that gives us ability to reach out and look at receivables from one spot instead of 35. We will get payables from one spot instead of 35 and we built in and are doing specific activities to drive those days in the directions that they need to be moved to.","So your question around debt paydown is number one, we certainly have the debt repayments outline that are coming due in this year and next year. And I will tell you that we also expect to continue to drive working capital velocity improvements not just in the balance of 2018 but through 2019, and I would even suggest going forward.","When you put numbers around that everyday of working capital for Mylan accounts for about $40 million of cash flow, so the continuation of working capital velocity is high on all of our list and specifically mine.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Chiang with BTIG. Your line is open.","Tim Chiang","Hi. Thanks. I noticed that you guys had gross margin improvement this quarter of 55% approximately. Is this a number that you think can be repeated in future quarters and also you are benefiting from lower SG&A spending, also lower R&D spending, is that also something that\u2019s going to continue?","Ken Parks","On gross margin, what I\u2019ll tell you is we watch every quarter as it occurs. We certainly had a period as I outlined $300 million or so of new product launches and you hear Rajiv, Heather and Tony, all talking about the pipeline and we are investing in those products that are more complex, those that bring more value not only to us but to the patient, and in doing so, those tend to be slightly higher profitable products.","The timing of new product launches could drive a quarterly movement in what gross profit looks like. But what I would tell you over time is this pipeline that this team has built over multiple years is set to deliver gross products -- gross margins at nice rates over the long-term, but I won\u2019t call out any quarter alone.","Secondly, your question around SG&A, I go back to say the statements earlier around SG&A, which is we continue to look at these assets that we brought together through acquisitions. We find opportunities to continue to improve the G&A part of that SG&A and still invest in the selling side of that equation.","So we have opportunity -- when you say is it sustainable? Yes. We continue to find opportunities to do things in our, quote-unquote, back office, more streamlined more improved, which just gives us more dollars to drop either to the bottomline or to invest where we need to grow products. And then I will let Rajiv comment on the R&D question.","Rajiv Malik","Yeah. Look our commitment on R&D is very well highlighted and illustrated as we mentioned in Heather\u2019s remark, as well as in my remarks. So R&D spend is a timing issue and not a trend.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Irina Koffler with Mizuho. Your line is open.","Irina Koffler","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. As you are labeling discussions on Wixela proceed, can you reassure us that it\u2019s still a substitutable product that we are talking about and your confidence level around that? Thank you.","Rajiv Malik","Yeah. Absolutely we can reassure you that it\u2019s a substitutable product and we are very active optimistic and we believe FDA needs to do what they need to do and we would expect the same, but at the same time, we had have been very confident about the possible comment earliest.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Jennifer Kim","Hi. This is Jennifer Kim on for Louise. Thanks for taking my questions. I just had two quick ones. First, I think, you mentioned that there was a volume decline for EpiPen this quarter due to the timing of purchases and I\u2019m wondering then would you anticipate the volumes to sort of operate themselves in the fourth quarter?","And then the second question is, with the recent approval of a second biosimilar for Neulasta, how does that affect your thinking about the market? Thanks.","Tony Mauro","Maybe if I had on EpiPen very quickly. What I would say is traditionally Q3 for us is the highest volume quarter just due to the seasonality of the product. So what I would say is, I think, Q4 will rebalance itself out to probably 20% of the annual volumes as we have seen in traditional years of past.","As it relates to another Neulasta product, like I said, this is a $4 billion product and oncology, the largest biologic product available in the oncology therapeutic world and right now we are tracking a little bit above 8% in the pre-filled syringes.","So I think there\u2019s opportunity for more. I think there\u2019s a great opportunity for Mylan, and I think, we will continue to see our product grow and will stay very surgical on track with our plan as we are very happy with results and very happy where it\u2019s going.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gerberry with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jason Gerberry","Hey. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a question on biosimilar Lantus, I\u2019m just curious, is this some product you guys think is one that you can get an acceptable gross profit margin on and I asked in lieu of Merck\u2019s decision to walk away from this citing profitability metrics, and I know about a year for you guys, so just kind of curious if you can help us think about that one? Thanks.","Rajiv Malik","I will take it then, Tony, please feel free to add. We believe Lantus is a very important product and we remain confident first of all in science, and in fact, we continue to work with FDA to find a substitutable product.","At the same time, we believe there\u2019s a market and there\u2019s a need, and we have been very confident from our costing point of view, from the backward integration, which we have done with our partner Biocon that we will be able to have positive drop margin when we come to the launch of this very important product.","Tony Mauro","And maybe just that to add as Rajiv said this diabetes franchise is one that continues to grow globally, and I think, each market will be unique, each market will have its own sets of opportunities and we will be very focused on the markets we concentrate to grow and ensure our market share is available and bring access that is important patient community.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ami Fadia with Leerink. Your line is open.","Ami Fadia","Hi. Good afternoon. I\u2019ve got two questions, firstly, on Fulphila, could you give us a sense of your capacity with regards to supplying to demand in the market?","And secondly, on Advair, when it gets approved what type of a ramp are you anticipating, would you expect a relatively slow ramp kind of like the way we have seen with Copaxone or would you anticipate a more typical generic ramp? Thank you.","Rajiv Malik","So, Ami, regarding Fulphila, I think, we -- our capacity is exactly as we had planned and as we had anticipated this launch. So we don\u2019t see any capacity constraints from our marketing perspective. And you\u2026","Heather Bresch","And as far as Advair, I mean, mean here is what I would say, Ami, as we have talked about these complex products being pulled through that chain and I tried to reiterate this in my opening commentary that it\u2019s not just good enough to get a product approval, the regulatory burden, but also our work about pulling it through.","And I can assure you that we are absolutely doing our part as we look at how this is going to be positioned with our end goal being that it reaches the patient\u2019s hands who need them and being that access and affordability to this marketplace.","So as -- once we do get the product launch we will obviously stay close and report back, I think, that we have taken very appropriate and conservative assumptions, and I think, it will be something that\u2019s got a very long tail to add longevity and contribution from this product.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, there. Dushan [ph] here for David Reisinger. Could you please provide more color on the new financial metrics that you are considering to focus the Street on?","Ken Parks","Yeah.","Rajiv Malik","Go ahead Heather.","Heather Bresch","Yeah. Yeah. Sure. And then anything would ask. Look we have been continuing to indicate that we don\u2019t believe that the EPS and the short-term is kind of around that projection is the right indicator for what\u2019s really fueling our long-term viability, our performance over the long-term and really quite honestly, where we are focused as a management team. So these are things -- we are looking at a lot of things, and obviously, when we come back with 2019 outlook, we certainly will share them with you, as well as our rationale.","Ken Parks","And the only thing I would and I completely agree with everything Heather just said, and I would just say, consider how you see our financial results come out, which are that EPS is certainly a number that certain people like to take a look at and we certainly want to make sure and drive that to be as optimal as we can.","But what I would also tell you, is what we really also want to do is make sure not just focus on EPS in a quarter, but consistent solid cash flow generation and conversion of EBITDA and net income into cash, so we can continue to delever, continue to invest in our business and continue to build that pipeline.","So you will see us looking at things around what\u2019s driving value to the business from an economic perspective and what\u2019s driving cash into the -- out of the business and then back into the business to make sure that we are keeping our balance sheet healthy and our company strong and ready to deliver on the business plans that we have set for ourselves not just for the next quarter or the next year but the next few years. So, as I said, we will give you more color around those specifics as we continue to look at it when we get in front of you in late February timeframe with our outlook for 2019.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A and program for today.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mylan Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remark, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Melissa Trombetta, Head of Global Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Melissa Trombetta","Thank you, Lisa. Good morning everyone. Welcome to Mylan's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Chairman, Robert Coury; Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; Chief Commercial Officer, Tony Mauro; and Chief Financial Officer, Ken Parks.","During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial guidance for 2019 and the proposed transaction pursuant to which Mylan will combine with Pfizer Inc.'s Upjohn Business in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause further results or events to differ materially from today's projections.","Please refer to the earnings release we furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K earlier today, as well as our supplemental earnings slides, all of which are posted on our website at investor.mylan.com for a further explanation of those risks and uncertainties and the limits applicable to forward-looking statements.","Mylan routinely posts information that may be important to investors on this website, and we use this website address as a means of disclosing material information to the public in a broad, non-exclusionary manner for purposes of the SEC's Regulation Fair Disclosure. In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We will refer to these measures as adjusted and present them in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance.","Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measures, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to those GAAP measures, are available in our third quarter earnings release and supplemental earnings slides, as well as on our website.","Please note that this call released to Mylan's third quarter 2019 earnings and we will be limited in what we can speak about during Q&A regarding the new company, and we will not be speaking about Upjohn Business. Let me also remind you of the information discussed during this call, except for the participant questions is a property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's express written permission. An archived copy of today's call will be available on our website and will remain available for a limited time.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Robert.","Robert Coury","Thank you, Melissa. Good morning everyone with a special hello and welcome to all my own employees around the world and to the Upjohn employees who will be soon joining forces with us. I would like to provide you with a brief update regarding the proposed combination of Mylan and Pfizer's Upjohn Business, which we announced in July. But before I do, I would like to briefly remind all of our Mylan's stakeholders, some of our Board's rationale for this very powerful strategic and financial transaction.","The Mylan has a standalone company. This transaction represents an acceleration and combination of our own long stated goal of building a truly one of a kind global platform, positioned to serve and deliver high quality affordable medications to patients around the world. The transaction will be what I described as Mylan's final legacy transaction. The combination with Upjohn, not only achieves our original goal, but it does so well expanding the geographical reach and scale that Mylan start to create on its own.","In that context, it also allows Mylan to accelerate the expansion of its broad product portfolio in future pipeline, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region for example in countries like China. At the same time, we do expect Mylan's existing business to benefit greatly from the significant assets that Upjohn will bring to the new company. In particular, the new company will have the benefit of Upjohn's own high quality iconic brand portfolio. Its own highly talented workforce, needed bench strength and expertise, especially in the emerging growth markets and an enhanced commercial platform.","Overall, I am very impressed with the talented and committed to Upjohn team members, whom I've met since the announcement. And I know that the Pfizer and Mylan teams are continuing to work hard to transfer all the requisite commercial and other assets to a standalone Upjohn prior to the combination with Mylan, taking into consideration, these two expected transaction benefits, as we have listened to input from many of our shareholders and other stakeholders overtime.","And in light of Mylan's recent strategic review intended to find ways to unlock the unrealized value that we believe still exists in Mylan today. The Mylan Board of Directors decided to take this opportunity to create a new company, Newco. By combining Mylan with Upjohn's business, two highly complementary businesses establishing a truly unique new company profile with no direct pharmaceutical peer set.","Newco will represent more than just a new name. Once the transaction closes, Newco will have a new strategy, a new operating model and a further differentiated product portfolio as compared to Mylan today, as well as even a stronger balance sheet with new financial profile that will emphasize a renewed focus on capital returns to shareholders through anticipated dividends and softly purchases.","Newco will also be a Delaware company with a shareholder concentric governance model and then expand the new management team comprised of both Mylan and Upjohn executives to support the new operating model going forward.","With that said, one thing will never change at Newco, neither from the perspective of Mylan nor Upjohn, and that is our steadfast commitment to provide high quality medicines to patients around the world, while serving Newco's employees, our customers, the communities in which we operate, and Newco truly will create a new champion for global health.","We also envision that Newco will be placing much more emphasis and focus on total shareholder return and striving to earn multiple expansions from a market. We believe that once investors have had the opportunity to learn more about the newly created company and its unique profile, its differentiated platform and its ability to deliver sustainable and more predictable results overtime. Investors will eventually afford Newco a rerating in this market multiple relative to Mylan on a standalone basis.","This is obviously something that is not going to be automatic, but instead will have to be earned and earned overtime and I assure you Newco will be up for the task. The Mylan Board of Directors set the clear first example, when it signal to investors that is willingness on its own accord to return the Company back to the United States and organize the Company in Delaware. We continue to make good progress on the integration and other regulatory steps to be taken prior to closing.","We will also at the appropriate time continue to visit and speak with both the Mylan and Pfizer shareholders over the coming months, as well as sell-side analysts to communicate our commitment to the success of a new company and help them better understand and appreciate the value creation opportunity that can be derived for all stakeholders.","Since the announcement, I've been spending a considerable amount of time with both, Michael Goettler, the new company's incoming CEO; and Rajiv Malik, Newco's incoming President, both independently as well as together. To discuss Newco's anticipated key company initiatives, considerations and priorities, I'm very pleased to report that the Mylan Board is very encouraged with their progress and collaboration today.","We truly believe that Michael and Rajiv represent the right combination to deliver the real power of what both organizations are bringing to the table. In addition, I've spent time with other executives on both Mylan and Upjohn teams and can already see and feel the power of what those individuals will also be bringing into Newco.","I would like to thank our current CEO, Heather Bresch for not only her continued leadership here at Mylan but for also playing a key role and working very closely with Pfizer, Michael and Rajiv to help lead our integration planning efforts for Newco. I would also like to thank Ken Parks for his continued contribution and his efforts for this critical stage of transition. In terms of the new CFO search, things continue to progress well and we fully expect to have one announced before closing.","I am excited about Newco's new management team and other future senior executives of Newco who will be playing a significant role in optimizing total shareholder return by demonstrating their ability to execute flawlessly on Newco's new strategic plan, while consistently delivering on their financial objectives. This will be one of the most critical variables, if we are truly to earn the multiple experiences that I discussed above.","I would also like to note there since our announcement, I have been on the road with Michael and Rajiv and others as well, to meet with shareholders, in addition to sell-side analysts to not only discuss the transaction, but also what we believe to be a solid roadmap for Newco and its management team to focus on and to execute against.","And lastly and before I turn the call over to Heather, to discuss what today's calls really all about, which is Mylan's third quarter and year-to-date performance, I would like to comment on one question we received on the S-4 that was recently filed in connection with the transaction.","I would simply like to point out that the internal financial projections in the S-4 are not and should not be used as financial guidance for Newco. The financial guidance for the new company will only be delivered by Newco's management at or around the time of closing, which is still on track to occur in mid 2020.","What I can tell you is when Newco's management does provides initial financial guidance and targets to investors, I fully anticipate that you will be given a strong range of revenues, EBITDA, EBITDA margins, and shown significant free cash flow generation and provided other financial metrics that will be very important for shareholders.","My expectation is that the guidance they provide will also fully account for all the questions that have been swirling around and the new ones that even may come up, whether it's the VPP in China or Lyrica and the United States, or Lyrica in Japan, et cetera and on and on. The new companies management will fully incorporate their assessment of the potential risk, but even more importantly, the potential upside opportunities known at that time.","In closing, I can certainly tell you that everything I have learned on both sides of the equation. Since the announcement has only further confirmed my excitement, my competence, and not only the powerful rationale for this transaction, but the anticipated strength of a combination of these two highly complementary businesses, and the ability of the new companies that deliver real value to shareholders based on our new business model over the long and sustainable future ahead.","I will now turn the call over to Heather, but we'd like to emphasize what Melissa mentioned that we will be limited and what we can speak about on the Q&A regarding the new company and we will not be speaking about Upjohn's business. Thank you.","Heather Bresch","Thank you, Robert. Good morning everyone and thank you again for joining today's call. I would first like to reiterate Robert, the Board and management's continued enthusiasm for the progress we're making on the path for the successful close for the combination of Mylan and Pfizer's Upjohn business. As Robert highlighted, the combination not only makes good financial sense, but also will make a meaningful difference for the patients we serve.","Importantly, the deal also has the potential to create opportunity for Mylan and Upjohn colleagues around the world. For those Mylan employees joining us on today's call, thank you for all that you continue to contribute to bring our mission to life each day. I'd also like to welcome any Upjohn colleagues who may be listening in. We look forward to continuing to collaborate with you as we work towards next steps and the successful combination of our two companies.","As we prepare for the closing of the Upjohn deal, we are still continuing to focus on the previously announced transformation of Mylan business. You'll recall from previous calls, we view this work as an opportunity to unlock latent value within the organization and instill additional focus on economically profitable performance. We have now begun the execution phase of our transformation.","Rajiv will share more detail in his remarks. However, at a high level, we have applied a highly disciplined financial lens to the assets we've integrated and built throughout the Company in order to streamline our portfolio, right size investments and improve the efficiency of our company's operating model.","Our approach across the board with business transformation has been very purposeful. Purposeful and how we rationalize operations and purposeful and how we invest. You'll see some of the levers we've been pulling reflected in this quarter's results. However, it's important to note that our meaningful transformation will be a multiyear process. So one quarter cannot be a proxy for the long-term profile of the Company.","At a minimum, it would be best to view our results on a year-to-date basis, where you will see that we are aligned with the ranges we provided in the beginning of the year. The strength of our performance highlights our holistic, intentional and focused approach to managing the overall health of the Company for today and the long-term. Today, steps we've taken to rationalize value consuming volume from our global portfolio of products are reflected in the top-line this quarter.","Notwithstanding, we grew every region year-over-year on a constant currency basis. And on a year to date basis, we achieved 3% growth in total net sales, with all segments contributing to the positive results on a constant currency basis. Adjusted gross margins were down slightly for the quarter; however, despite ongoing pricing headwinds and changes in the competitive environment this year. We have been able to maintain our target total company adjusted gross margins of over 53% year-to-date.","For the balance of 2019, we remain confident the Company's ability to execute and in fact have already achieved the milestones necessary to reach our expected full year results. Year-to-date, we've already launched 800 million and new products and remain on track to have more than a billion for the year including our launch of Ogivri, our biosimilar to Herceptin, which are expect to occurred within the coming weeks.","We also see adjusted free cash flow sequentially improving in Q4, resulting from the normal cadence of the business along with realized benefits from targeted working capital initiatives. The strong cash flow generation will help fund the remaining portion of the 1.1 billion of debt pay down we committed to at the beginning of the year.","As we close out the year, we will remain extremely focused on execution in order to deliver on our commitments. To that end, we are tightening our guidance within the ranges we provided at the beginning of the year including $11.5 billion to $12 billion in total revenues and 422 for 440 in adjusted EPS, while maintaining our expected adjusted free cash flow range of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv and Ken for additional detail on the quarter before opening the line for Q&A.","Rajiv Malik","Thank you, Heather. I would like to echo my excitement about the proposed combination between Mylan and Pfizer's Upjohn business. As we continue to plan for integrating the Company, I look forward to working with Michael and other members of Upjohn management team to ensure our shared success. At the same time, I can assure you that we as Mylan today, have a steadfast dedication to our standalone execution and are highly committed to finishing the year strong.","I'm proud of all of our employees who work tirelessly across the world to increase access to the medicine each and every day. I would like to take a moment to thank them for their continued commitment and hard work. I also would like to welcome any Upjohn employees who are on this call. Let me start by providing an overview of our business results by region.","Starting with North America, we had high single-digits net sales growth of 8% in comparison due to previous year. The increase was primarily influenced by the strong execution and performance of several key products.","Starting with Fulphila, we have been able to accelerate the expansion of manufacturing capacity and are optimistic to operationalize within the very near term. With the entire backfill growth to market going at a high single-digit and only 23% of the total Neulasta market converted to biosimilars, the underlying demand is there and we're confident that we will play a meaningful role as a continued expansion of this market.","Next, the launch of our novel once daily LAMA, Yupelri has met our initial expectations and is now gaining further momentum. Yupelri today has 83% market share of nebulized LAMA market. We see this as a short-and long-term opportunity in a critical therapeutic disease state.","Moving onto generic Copaxone, we have strong demand with current market share exceeding 35% as we continue to meet patient needs on this important product. We continue to see uptick on growth as the new prescriptions are now greater than 40% market share.","We also are happy that Wixela is steadily gaining market share and that's now cost 30% despite a very aggressive share attention strategy taken by the bank. We remain optimistic that it will continue to steadily grow and remain durable for the product as we look ahead to 2020 and beyond.","And last but not the least, we continue on our journey to expand access to our biosimilars stress road map, Ogivri. We have secured regulatory approvals in more than 75 countries globally and are on track to launch in U.S. in coming weeks. We expect to be the first company to bring core strength of the product the 120 milligrams and 150 milligrams to the market.","Moving to Europe, net sales were up 6% on a constant currency basis in line with our expectations. We are making good progress across daily markets and being prudent where we invest to optimize market returns. Influvac, Creon, DYMISTA performed above expectations, and are continuing to go year-over-year. We were especially pleased with Germany's growth for key products including Hulio, our biosimilar to Humira and Influvac.","In the rest of the world segments, net sales were up 4% on a constant currency basis. This increase was primarily driven by the new product sales in Australia and emerging markets and higher volumes of existing products including growth in our global key brands such as Dona and Elidel as well as our biosimilar.","I would like to share a few highlights related to our pipeline. For bevacizumab, a biosimilar to Avastin in collaboration with Biocon, the top-line clinical results for our Phase 3 study, a non-small cell lung cancer have met the necessary endpoint criteria. Mylan is on track to submit the U.S. BLA by the end of this year. The EU submission will follow in Q1 of 2020. Additionally, we have initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial for insulin aspart. Our U.S. regulatory application was accepted for review at the end of October.","Our FDA submission is on track to be submitted mid next year, and we are projecting to launch the product in the second half of 2021. For insulin glargine in collaboration with Biocon, we have received more than 40 regulatory approvals and recently launched in Australia. For the U.S. market, Mylan received a complete response letter in August 2019. The CRL confirm that the scientific matters of the review were closed and found acceptable.","Biocon and Malaysia are addressing the Malaysia facility concerns and are committed to resolve these in a timely manner. We are working closely with FDA and remain optimistic for a first quarter approval prior to the transition date to a biology. Regarding Hulio, our biosimilar to Humira, with our partner FKB, we remain on track for a 2020 launch in USA. We now have regulatory approvals in nearly 30 countries.","For our biosimilar to EYLEA [indiscernible] being developed in collaboration with Momenta, under Mylan lead, our pivotal global Phase 3 clinical trial is underway and we continue to target U.S. submission for quarter one of 2021.","Regarding our partnership with Revance for a biosimilar to BOTOX, the FDA meeting has earlier this year showed the biosimilar pathway to be viable. We extended our decision timeline with Revance to the first part of 2020. In the meantime, Revance will be working to provide some additional deliverables related to the program.","Our partner Mapi recently announced the enrollment of the first patient in its Phase 3 study for Glatiramer Acetate once a month depot. This is a key clinical study for our U.S. submission. We are excited to have this phase underway and continue to be encouraged by the scientific success of this program.","Now I would like to further build up on Heather's comment on our business transformation program. We have completed a holistic review of our business plan and developed an integrated transformation plan for Mylan's standalone business. We have already begun the implementation of this plan which will continue into 2020 prior to and concurrent with Upjohn integration.","The business transformation program includes; rationalization of products not earning their cost of capital, refocusing commercial resources to promote further growth of our most responsive product, while improving margins of unresponsive product, and further centralizing and rightsizing our commercial and operating infrastructure.","Let me walk you through some examples, our first area of focus was on product rationalization. For example, in U.S., the customer consolidation and market dynamics have continued to put pressure on prices of some of our oldest commodity products, and as a result, product margins have been driven below fully loaded economic cause. To date, we have decided to rationalize more than 350 SKU across all solid doses.","Throughout this process, the FDA shortlist has been top of our mind along with the patient and customer specific needs. While the rationalization does not impact us from the bottom line, it does have an impact on our top line results. Another area of review was on refocusing our commercial resources.","A comprehensive assessment of the sales responsiveness of commercial investment has been conducted across all major markets, and at the general product level to determine where we should direct our future commercial spending. This work has highlighted the opportunity to further optimize for SG&A expenses in the near-term, while evaluating potential revenue growth in future years. We'll continue to assess the return on our commercial investments going forward.","Regarding capital allocation for the future, we comprehensively renovated our R&D pipeline and rationalized investments taking into consideration that evolving industry landscape regarding commoditized products while focusing on our stated objective of moving up the value chain with our scientific platform.","Lastly, we are focusing on centralizing and price sizing our commercial and operating infrastructure by creating shared centers of excellence and consolidating our production capacity. As an outcome of this exercise, we will be eliminating the standard costs across the organization.","As you can see, we have a lot of exciting initiatives underway and remain focused on the performance in 2019, while looking ahead to our next journey in 2020 and beyond.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.","Ken Parks","Thanks, Rajiv, and good morning everyone. I'll take the few minutes to provide a quick overview of our financial results for the third quarter. Total revenues of $2.96 billion were 3% higher than the prior year. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, constant currency total revenues grew 6% with all segments growing year-over-year.","The growth was primarily driven by new product sales of approximately $247 million with approximately two-thirds of that number, and our North America segment primarily driven by Wixela and Yupelri sales. The remaining amount was split evenly between Europe and the rest of world. This growth combined with higher volumes from existing products was partially offset by the impact of the lower global pricing.","In the third quarter, our adjusted gross margins were approximately 53%, compared to 54% in the prior quarter and approximately 55% in the same period last year. The declines for both comparisons are primarily the results of higher sales of the authorized generic version of EpiPen, which carries a lower than company average margin, as well as changes in the competitive environment on certain products.","In addition, there were certain inventory write-offs, the largest of which is dated Wixela product resulting from the later than expected approval and launch date for that product. These inventory adjustments are not expected to recur in the fourth quarter.","Moving to segment profitability, excluding approximately $58 million in 2019 and $98 million in 2018, relating to the Morgantown restructuring and remediation program, North America adjusted segment profitability grew 1% quarter-over-quarter, which reflects contributions from new product sales, partially offset by impacts from lower pricing and volumes on existing products due to changes in the competitive environment including the loss of exclusivity onto Tadalafil along with higher investments in selling and marketing.","Europe segment profitability expanded 5% driven by benefits from new product sales including Hulio, our biosimilar to Humira, higher volumes on existing products and lower restructuring costs. These increases were partially offset by the expected higher selling and marketing investments and lower pricing. Rest of the world was down 12% versus the prior year mostly driven by lower gross profit on ARV sales resulting from higher API costs, expected higher investments in selling and marketing and lower pricing, which was partially offset my contributions from new product sales.","Both Europe and rest of world reflect unfavorable impacts from foreign currency translation. Adjusted R&D was down 10%, compared to 2018 for the third quarter due to reprioritization of global programs. For 2019 full year, we continue to expect to invest between 4.5% and 5.5% of total revenues to fund the long-term health of our business. During the quarter, adjusted SG&A increased 6% compared to the third quarter of 2018, reflecting the expected incremental investments in selling and marketing partially offset by benefits from existing restructuring activities, along with business transformation initiatives.","In addition, the prior year included the favorable impact of reversing certain performance based incentive approvals. As previously indicated, we'll continue to make our investments as efficiently as possible monitoring and managing such costs to support top-line expectations and growth opportunities. For the quarter, we reported adjusted net earnings of $604 million and adjusted EPS of $1.17.","The year-over-year decline is primarily driven by unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange, and the increased SG&A that was previously discussed. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was favorable to our expectations at $542 million year-over-year adjusted free cash flow was slightly lower by $156 million as a result of the expected increase in operating net working capital required to support the new product launches in the year.","In 2018, North America revenues were essentially flat from Q2 to Q3 requiring little change in working capital. In 2019, North America revenues grew 6% sequentially from Q2 to Q3 generating trade AR build in Q3 of the current year that will result in incremental Q4 cash collections and cash inflow. We're ahead of our year-to-date expectations for adjusted free cash flow and remain on track to deliver between $1.9 billion and $2.3 billion of adjusted free cash flow for the year, including ongoing working capital velocity improvement initiatives.","During Q3 2019, we repaid the remaining $100 million of our outstanding term loan and reduced our credit agreement debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio to 3.8 times. On a year-to-date basis, we repaid approximately $650 million of debt and expect to repay additional depth in Q4 to reach our target of $1.1 billion of debt repayment for the year. We remain fully committed to our deleveraging strategy and our investment grade credit rating.","Finally, as you heard Heather mentioned earlier, we've narrowed our full year 2019 guidance range. We now expect total revenues in the range of $11.5 billion to $12 billion. We narrowed our revenue outlook to the lower end of our previous guidance range for two primary reasons. Currency movement is expected to generate approximately $250 million of headwinds versus our budgeted expectations along with slightly lower expectations for new product revenues.","While our Launch of Wixela has been very successful, full year sales are anticipated to be a bit short of original expectations as a result of the aggressive share retention actions by the brand that Rajiv mentioned. In addition, the approval of generic Restasis continues to be delayed. Despite these headwinds, we remain on track to deliver adjusted EPS at the midpoint of our original ratings due to proactive cost management through the year and are narrowing our adjusted EPS outlook to $4.20 to $4.40.","Based upon year-to-date strong cash flow generation as a head of our initial expectations, we're maintaining our outlook for adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion for the full year 2019.","With that will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky of RBC Capital Markets.","Randall Stanicky","Just two quick ones. One, just going back to the comment on, not viewing the S-4 projections as guidance with Newco guidance coming at closing, should we still be doing the initial Newco guidance when the deal was announced as appropriate targets?","And then the follow-up for Rob, the bigger picture one on business development, now that you can become a bigger -- have a bigger brand footprint and given the fragmentation of the smaller cap specialty brands space and there's a huge opportunity to therapeutically consolidate that space. Is that something you guys are looking at? And can you start to looking at, pursuing that now? Thanks.","Robert Coury","Thank you, Randall. Let me start with the last question. I think you're spot on. I've read some of your prior notes and have been following you very closely. I think you're really onto something there. I think what we're most mostly excited about in terms of the future outside and you're exactly correct, we are definitely -- Mylan was already moving up the value chain.","But with the size that we are now, our investment in partnering especially in the potential to look at future capital allocation and what areas of concentration, the answer is, yes, I do see further alignment to participate in that. Because our portfolio that we're going to be bringing, especially to the Asia-Pacific region is going to present huge potential upside. And I think as a time of the closing, I fully expect that we're going to outline as we talk about future capital allocation and touch on some of these points.","In terms of the numbers we gave in July, we absolutely and I understand, I wasn't on Pfizer's call. But look, we stand by what we gave in July for 2020. I'm simply just reminding people to level set them on a going forward basis. Obviously, we have -- I think, very clear vision about what we're faced with. And nothing I see today that has been brought up, not even any new issues that were raised by some who are now getting a better understanding business. Does anything to remotely change my absolute excitement about what we created with the two combinations? And I'm very much anxious and looking forward to be able to show you that once we can get closer to close.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan.","Chris Schott","First one here, can you just comment on the China opportunity for the pro forma company, in light of the temporary dynamics that's being enrolled out is obviously a lot of focus on that market by the street. So maybe just talk a little bit about, what is China look like for the pro forma Company overtime? And just another comment on the pro forma guidance, does it fully anticipate some of these tender dynamics?","Second really quick one, can you talk earlier this year about this step up in SG&A investment in the portfolio? Does the Upjohn deal change either the priorities for that investment or the size of those investments as you think about the much broader business that you'll be running over time? Thanks very much.","Robert Coury","So thank you, Chris. And I'll just start with your second question, because it really applies to my commentary on the S-4. When you bring it to organizations together, what was in the S-4 or 2 internal companies projections, internal independently company projections. One of the things that you can't see, that's actually well underway to your exact question is. Those projections do not take into consideration for example, the regulatory overlay, what products we may have to divest. Product rationalization between the two organizations and then where do you now put your emphasis when you bring the two organizations together.","So your question is well founded, and I want you to know that work is underway. And I do believe between now and closing, we'll have that all sorted out and be able to lay that out for you in terms of, how we see whether it's SG&A, or other costs allocation for the business model and a going forward basis.","In terms of China, there is nothing really happening in the China, to be very honest with you that we've not -- I can't say that we didn't anticipate. Now, there's always nuances, I'm not going to say that we're Nostradamus and we can predict everything, especially in China, but there's nothing really there other than there could be a tweak and some of the new rules that they're putting out that that may cause some changes.","But I would say in large part overall, there is an anticipation on our side, not for just what's happening in China today, but there's an anticipation for a continuation as that healthcare system over there changes. And what, the reason why we continue to be extraordinarily bullish, is because we now got a true commercial infrastructure over there that is well situated in suited, especially with the massive product portfolio, which that we've bringing. And by the way, this is a product portfolio that's very much needed over there.","So, we think that all the stars are aligned to move our massive product portfolio that has already been identified to move into the China pipeline. And also to Randall's question, some of the opportunities we see that we can also, as we go up the value chain, to bring and leverage now the strong commercial infrastructures that the Pfizer Upjohn division now brings us.","Operator","The next question comes from a line of Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James.","Elliot Wilbur","Couple questions, I guess, most appropriate for Rajiv. First, Rajiv, could you clarify your earlier commentary around the portfolio rationalization process? I wasn't clear to me if that was more of a retrospective comment or perspective. I think you said 350 SKUs and talk about the negative revenue impact. I'm assuming that was largely on that historical not a going forward basis but maybe just clarify that please?","And then just a follow-up on insulin glargine, should we be expecting to hear nothing from FDA until March '18? I believe meaning that there would not be a tentative approval, only a final approval issued on that. I'm not sure what is going to happen on that product. And obviously, March 20 is sort of a key date with respect to hitting the FDA deadline?","Rajiv Malik","Regarding the portfolio rationalization, what I had given you was just an example in USA, that what we are undertaking that that if the products are not -- if the products have been commoditized to an extent that they're not earning their cost of a capital, more you sell them, it doesn't make any business rational. So, yes, if when you rationalize those products, these are --there can be some top line impact, but there's no significant bottom line impact. And we have extended this not just to USA, but we have evaluated our global portfolio from that point of view.","Now why do we see that this not a onetime exercise, because this is a new discipline we have created. It will be on an ongoing basis. But you would not see a bolus like this, but what I just said, 350 SKU because once you clean it up on our going forward basis, there will be some products here and there will be not bolus like that.","Regarding insulin, we absolutely expect to hear from them. I think before March, we believe that this concern about Malaysia facility which we are in the process of addressing will be behind us, in the early first quarter. And yes, the final approval is on the date of the March 20th or something around that that's a date. And we are very confident that it will be -- we'll get our final approval before the transition date to biology.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore.","Umer Raffat","Robert, you mentioned you're comfortable with the numbers previously communicated for 2020, but 2020 still influx because of things like Lyrica, Japan, which will still be part of 2020, but not pro forma or 2021, if I may. So I guess if we were to focus on true pro forma number for the combined Newco and I realize a lot of work is going on. A lot of the street debate is aggregating around number closer to 18 billion than not. I'm curious to what extent you're willing to comment or able to comment on that?","Secondly, I'm curious the magnitude of divestitures that might potentially be required because I think that's one of the things that perhaps isn't baked into a lot of the street numbers where they've just put the two together and trying to model out China. So, I'm curious, any early feedback on that?","And finally, one for Ken as if I may. Ken, I've looked at the purchase accounting amortization numbers and the share magnitude of it always confuses me a bit. So I was going to ask you, in simple words, what exactly is that? And do you expect it to stay 1.5 billion for the foreseeable future?","Robert Coury","Why don't you go first Ken?","Ken Parks","Sure. So, over the 1.5 billion is truly as you know when you go to purchase accounting of a certain amount, this, but in goodwill, any other certain amount that's attributed to customer portfolios, products, valuations of assets, and that goes into this amortization bucket that gets amortized over various lives depending on the estimated remaining live with the appropriate asset.","The short answer to your 1.5 billion question is and this is on a mile and standalone basis, obviously, there will be other work done, once the Newco transaction occurs, but that that's billion prior should take down slowly overtime, because each year some of the amortization or some of the intangible falls off. So I would expect for the near-term, it may take down slightly, but it will continue for a period of time, because many of these underlying assets have long lives. Especially things like customer assets and products.","Robert Coury","I think on the divestitures, at least what I'm being told now Umer. I don't see it as a real significant number, but I don't want to jump out in front of the regulators because they can actually go in one direction or the other, whether it's our products or even their product that they would require to be divested. So I prefer not to jump out front, but I think we said this before and I feel very comfortable. I don't see it as significance, but there obviously is going to be some and my understanding that those discussions are progressing quite well.","In terms of, I mean look Umer, I think that's, I really can't comment more on the numbers that we put out that, -- as we were trying to say with the assumption if we looking forward, by the time we anticipate the clothes, I think it was July 2020. Here's kind of sort of what we saw the organization looking like that range that we've given you, that is what it is. Since then and since we've been out trying to discuss with investors and we're not giving any guidance, I actually been following a lot what you have been trying to rationalize.","I actually think you're doing a pretty damn good job forgive me, but I really think you're doing a great job and trying to also find that light level set. I cannot wait until we can get closer to close get some of this work done and really clear up for investors just where is, that starting point. And I've made it abundantly clear that starting point from everything I can see and know today without giving any guidance. I am extremely confident that the street will be very pleased about wherever that starting initial guidance is.","And the strong EBITDA that's going to come with it because remember, what you're going to see is the rationalization of the portfolio, rationalization of costs based on what we can see out in the future and then the synergies coming in. So that's why we feel very confident that will give you a very strong range of revenue, without me telling you exactly where that starting points going to be. And then an even a stronger range of EBITDA due to the synergies that we intend on bringing in and the cost rationalization that we can see, as we adjust for the various healthcare market, the markets around the world.","Operator","Your next question comes to my mind is David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","So I have a follow-up question for Rajiv. Could you just provide a little bit more clarity so the 360 SKU rationalization. What is that timing? What inning are we in now? Or are we in the first inning? And then for the 360 that you've identified, is that going to be done in a year or two years? Just wanted to understand that in terms of that constraint on the global revenue line?","And then Ken a quick question, you mentioned inventory adjustments in the third quarter. Could you quantify the negative impact on COGS and gross profits in the third quarter?","Rajiv Malik","David, that 350 was a U.S. specific number and as, as you go along, the business transformation in USA, as long as, as well as mortgage down remediation, which was more driven -- resolving the complexity issue of the site could not have come like a better time. So both of these are facts, if any of those commoditized products were adding to the complexity, so it was very natural for us to take that block and rationalize it right up front. So, I would say for the U.S., almost 80%, 90% of rationalization is already been done, and it's behind us as we go along rest of the world and the European rationalization will be I think the second phase.","Ken Parks","And David on your question around the inventory adjustments and the COGS impact. In the quarter, approximately 30 to 40 basis points on the gross margin, rate, and as we called out, the biggest chunk of that was this, David, Wixela inventory. That was, as we were preparing for commercialization and launch, we built inventory to be sure we could launch on a timely basis and the launch was delayed. I think it's important just to reiterate again, that we do not want an explanation for the third quarter, we have no reason to believe that will require in the four.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gilbert with SunTrust.","Greg Gilbert","Rajiv, can you give us your thoughts on the environment that you'll be launching into for the biosimilar Herceptin in terms of your supply situation? And what launch trajectory you're expecting?","And then for Robert, going back to you setting the bar in 2020, and then providing outlook from there, You've had some experience, you in the board and might have had some experience setting long-term guidance for the standalone company in the past that seemed to create concerns and controversy around your ability to hit it, whether this step would be required et cetera, et cetera. So my question to you is. How will you and the board approach the concept of long-term guidance when the deal closes and perhaps what was learned from the last time?","Robert Coury","I have to tell you, that's a great question. But Rajiv, why don't you go first and then let me respond.","Rajiv Malik","Let me go ahead with Herceptin, and Tony and Kenneth, please feel free to add. First of all as for as the capacity that's not a constraint, capacity for Herceptin is the only constraint, and we have ample capacity to still -- so it's adequate market. Second, I know why we are second, Amgen has been there yet, but we will be the first one to bring in. Hopefully, we are expecting to be the first one to bring in the bold strength, and we will be launching it for a couple of weeks. Yes, there are already, four more approvals out here. We see that.","But again in this one, I would say, the two differences if I have to compare. One is part B and the incentives are very well aligned. Also, in this case of, if we have to compare with the Neulasta biosimilar, we see a slower ramp because it will be more. If it will not, it will be lesser of a switch but more prescribed to the newer patient. So you can see a little bit slower ramp on that as compare to that, but we see that shift-wise, ultimately leading to the decent conversion of this road to the biosimilars. Tony, you want to add something?","Tony Mauro","No, I just might add that our 15 sales reps who are going to be selling this oncology, these very viral products to the marketplace and trained and ready to go. And I think as Rajiv articulated, we're well positioned for success with this launch in the coming weeks.","Robert Coury","So, Greg, let me hit what I consider to be a very powerful and potent question, quite frankly. And I think a very fair question. Let me start with the frustration that we, the board, and has had in the past in deal just with the point that you have outlined. And let me tell you why I do not see the same things on a going forward basis. It comes in two parts. The first is in the past, what was -- what management was trying to predict was predominantly, in my opinion, a North American story, a North America story.","I don't know what more to say, the U.S. generics business we had a very high class issue. We have some really rare, powerful large opportunities in the pipeline to launch. And when we planned, when we invested in those original programs, I don't think anybody could have anticipated the structural changes that have been put into -- that have come into play in the U.S. market in the North America region, that you had two things happen.","And there was a tiny issue of when we would get the approvals from the FDA and then you have the structural changes that actually were occurring and it was almost like one after the other. So, the frustration that the board and I'm certain that a lot of shareholders had, was the predictability of such, a powerful pipeline was very large opportunities And if you don't -- these things don't line up, well, it causes a tremendous amount of oscillation, variability, uncertainty, unpredictability.","And then if you put on top of that, the fact that investors have told us time and time again, that if we're not as transparent about all these things that I'm now explained to you, and it seemed like that we were, coming forward after the fact, to try to explain these things. And one of the things I learned and speaking with investors and also sell-side analysts, is how we can do a much better job, if on the inside we can envision and see all of this potential risk, then why not come to investors and sell-side analysts as quickly in advance as we can and to lay out what we potentially could proceed.","So that people don't get frustrated that the Company is not being as open as transparent, not provided the right type of disclosures for analyst or investor the right to model, and not wait to the actual events occur. So I'm taking my time articulating all this because if we're not aware of ourselves and if we're not aware of what went wrong in the past, there's it's going to be we're just kidding ourselves about correcting all this as we move forward in the future.","Now as we move forward in the future, one of the other reasons why I'm helping level set everybody, and I do look, I think Homer is done a great job in his quest to really dig in deep, and really try to understand, and I think, what I can assure you, what we're doing is identifying all those potential risks that we could see in front, we don't see anything that we have not that really has surprised us. But what we haven't had a chance was to talk about all the other opportunities.","And so one of the things I think would be helpful is that once these LOEs of the Upjohn portfolio is out of the way, which we're fully incorporated, we're fully anticipating the final LOE that will go out of the way. You're going to find even a broader and more diversified portfolio that actually has a lot less oscillation to it. And that way we're to get investors comfortable going forward is, let me give you an example.","If we decide to report the business on three regions, let's just say, developed markets, emerging markets and Asia Pacific markets. And if there's one particular market very large, like China and Asia Pacific will carve that out. But I think doing what we promised both all you analysts and investors, we're going to sit with each and every one of you and we're going to walk you through and do a SWAT analysis around each particular region, each particular country.","And as we talk about the strengths, the weaknesses, the opportunities and threats, rather than you relying on us solely to being the only ones giving the, telling you what we anticipate. I think once we go through that exercise, and have our discussion about our views about how we're looking at the business going forward, your views, how we should look at the business going forward.","There's going to be discussions about how we report on our business, uncertain there's going to be three buckets. Metrics that we absolutely cannot give you, metrics, we absolutely are very easy to give you, and the middle bucket, those metrics that I think can provide some great dialogue, and really come to a compromise but make sure that the starting point. Everybody is on the exact same page.","I don't think I want you investors going forward as you analysts to rely solely on management, if we do a good enough job, giving you all the information that we have upfront, being even more transparent than maybe what we have them and allowing you all to reach your own judgment. So I do feel that going forward to summarize, I think it's going to be a combination of a less volatile business with not as much oscillation to it, the way we're going to level set and demonstrate this new diversified global platform that we have. I think we can get people comfortable with that.","And then look, we're trying to bring in a different kind of a management team who really is focused on execution. When I think about where we're taking the Company and we're going to definitely need this 2, 3 year transition period, I'll be honest with you, we're moving the Company to something quite different in terms of a business model. And when it comes to execution, which does require a different mindset, a different managerial mindset, I think we were well on our way with the beginning of the transformation work that was done. That was going to take time.","And -- but I do believe that this transaction has only forced us to accelerate the strategies that we were doing on our own anyway. And I think that Michael and others, I do believe represents more of a future of where we're moving the Company, because they are much more driven through surely, executing our numbers and delivering our numbers. Well be just very humbly honest with you, up until this point, my land from 15 years ago, we built it spend our entire time building a true, one of a kind, global platform that is second to none.","There is not another peer set that matches what we have built. And that's why we're so excited about Randall Stanicky, what he's going around this concentration of therapeutic categories, because we really have a global platform to leverage the return on our future investments. And so I think, look, all this is culminating together, and I hope, I apologize for the long-winded answer. But I really thought that was a pretty powerful and potent question that's on everyone's mind. And I hope I was able to answer that.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry with Bank of America.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [Sean] for Jason. Two questions here, please. So first is, your partner Biocon is guiding to $1 billion in biosimilar sales by financial year 2022. How does that impact your thinking about some of the opportunities that you have in front of you? And then the second question is more around 2014 standalone Mylan. It seems like you have the tailwinds of a better biosimilar Advair in International Pharma, but not major U.S. ANDA launches. So, are those some of the major pushes and pulls or are we missing anything?","Rajiv Malik","Let me give you the first part, from the Q2 to Q4, we've been very confident and we can go geography-by-geography. There are very gratifying drivers of this Q3 to Q4 ramp whether it's Yupelri in USA, continued market -- Ogivri launch, or Fulphila and Wixela for performance. Europe is being driven by products like Creon, DYMISTA, Brufen and Herceptin, we see that momentum behind these products.","And the rest of world whether it's our ARV portfolio, Amitiza, Sebivo and [indiscernible]. So, we have mapped this very carefully and we've been very confident about that. Now about Biocon spend, I cannot -- it's not for us meant on Biocon billion dollar plan. We have shared with you very clearly the portfolio the weather its glargine, aspart, Avastin biosimilar launch of Herceptin. We have our own business case and we remain very confident behind that.","Ken Parks","And I'll add the comment on 2020 is that. Look as we get closer to the normal time that we'll speak here about 2020, we'll look at the -- in my term, lay of the land, how close are we to the transaction. Does it make sense to provide Mylan standalone outlook? Or does it make sense to look at the new company together? The reality is, at this point in time, we typically wouldn't start talking about the next year yet. And as we move closer to those dates, we will keep you obviously fully appraise of the Mylan numbers as well as the push and pulls in those.","Operator","This does conclude today's Mylan third quarter 2019 earnings call and webcast.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.","I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Kris King. Ma'am, you may begin.","Kris King - Mylan NV","Thank you, Brea. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Mylan's conference call discussing our third quarter 2016 earnings. Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; Chief Financial Officer, Ken Parks; and Chief Commercial Officer, Tony Mauro.","During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook and 2016 guidance, EpiPen Auto-Injector, the integration of recent acquisitions, certain targets, such as $6.00 in adjusted EPS by 2018, and leverage ratio of approximately 3.0 times by the end of 2017, and other matters related to the company and its business, including regulatory matters, product development and acquisition. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from today's projections. Please refer to the earnings release we filed with the SEC on Form 8-K earlier this afternoon for a fuller explanation of those risks and uncertainties as well as the limits applicable to these forward-looking statements.","In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted total revenue, adjusted gross margin, adjusted cash provided by operating activities, constant currency third party net sales, constant currency total revenues, net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA leverage ratio, adjusted R&D expense, adjusted SG&A expense, and adjusted tax rate, and are presented in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance.","Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measures, as well as the reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to those GAAP measures, are available in our third quarter earnings release, which is posted on our website at newsroom.mylan.com. Let me also remind you that the information discussed on the call, with the exception of the participant questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's expressed written permission. An archived copy of today's call will be available on our website and will remain available for a limited time.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Heather.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Thanks, Kris, and welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us this afternoon. Before we get into the specifics of the quarter, I'd like to provide some perspective on the current state of affairs. As we've stated many times, Mylan's great strength lies in our highly diversified and differentiated platform and the tremendous operational and commercial scale we've built over the last decade. This foundation is what allows us to continue to successfully withstand headwinds whenever and wherever they occur. Currently, those headwinds are originating in the U.S., where the healthcare system is undergoing rapid and extraordinary change. As we see, for instance, greater attention being paid to the complexity of pharmaceutical pricing and a rapidly growing number of high deductible health plans, which are shifting significant out-of-pocket cost to consumers.","We've been living this reality firsthand with EpiPen, and as I've said previously, I wish we had better anticipated the magnitude and acceleration of the rising out-of-pocket costs for a growing minority of patients who may have ended up paying full WAC or more when they went to the pharmacy counter. This is why we took the swift and unprecedented actions of increasing our savings card program from $100 to $300, doubling the eligibility for our patient assistance program and announcing that we will launch a generic at a WAC price of $300. We expect the launch to occur during the first half of December.","I'm also pleased to note that we filed our application for a new formulation that will extend the product shelf life. We believe that these steps were the right ones to ensure immediate and a sustainable cost savings directly to patients in the healthcare system. I'd like to reemphasize that Mylan is much more than any one product and our reach goes far beyond any one market.","Throughout these past several weeks, we've drove the discussion about how the U.S. healthcare system and the supply chain operates, and the challenges that lie within it. We have acknowledged that the current system, which we didn't create, but which we must compete in, was not built for consumerism. It cannot be fixed overnight, and it needs to be completely reinvented. It's precisely this opportunity to set new standards in healthcare and fulfill our mission of providing the world's 7 billion people access to high-quality medicine that led Mylan a decade ago to begin its transformation into the globally diversified organization we've become today.","Put another way, we've built Mylan to ensure our sustainability for many years to come. We look forward to being an innovative, constructive and powerful change agent with respect to helping shape the industry's future. In the meantime, we're going to continue optimizing our platform for efficiency and leveraging it for growth. As a part of this process, we're now focused on what we call Mylan's Integration. Rather than merely folding our recent transactions, meaning EPD, Famy Care, Renaissance and Meda into Mylan's existing structure and processes, we're looking for even better ways to organize, optimize and operate our new and expanded company so as to maintain our long-standing track record of delivering strong performance.","For example, for many years, we've been reporting financial performance in terms of two segments: Generic and Specialty. But now that our product portfolio will be effectively integrated across generic, branded, and OTC products, we'll move to three reporting segments: North America, Europe, and Rest of World starting with the fourth quarter. We will now manage our global platform as one business across all products and channel types.","Turning to the quarter, our performance was consistent with our revised full-year guidance. On the top line, we generated total revenues of nearly $3.1 billion, a year-over-year increase of 13%. This result was fueled by strong performance across our Europe and Rest of World regions as well as solid performance across our North America region. On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $726 million, or $1.38 per adjusted diluted share, a year-over-year decline of about 3%, which was primarily driven by the significant contribution in the prior-year period of new products. As we look ahead to Mylan's next chapter, we believe we now have the commercial and operating scale needed to fulfill our mission. As such, our BD efforts going forward will emphasize bolt-on deals. We also remain committed to our investment grade rating.","As for our full-year financial performance, we remain on track to achieve adjusted EPS within our revised range of $4.70 to $4.90. The majority of the revision is the result of the previously announced changes related to EpiPen, and much of its impact occurred in the third quarter. In addition, we remain committed to our $6 adjusted EPS target in 2018, with the targeted growth in the low teens in both 2017 and 2018. We are anticipating that EpiPen's contribution to be approximately 6% of total sales in 2017. We look forward to discussing Mylan's future, including our guidance for 2017, in greater detail during our next Investor Day event, which we'll host in conjunction with fourth quarter earnings. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees around the globe for remaining focused and steadfast and executing to deliver better health for a better world.","Before turning the call over to Rajiv, I'd like to conclude by stating that while the world may be filled with uncertainty and the future of the U.S. healthcare system may be unclear, one thing is certain. The world can count on Mylan to maintain our unwavering commitment to our mission and strategy and continue operating, executing, and delivering for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.","Thank you. Rajiv?","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Thank you, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. As Heather noted, despite the public attention paid to Mylan and our EpiPen franchise during the past several months, we remain focused on managing our global business, integrating our acquisitions and executing on the future drivers of our growth.","While our sector continues to face challenges, we are very confident in the strength of our business, our future opportunities, our pipeline, and our ability to continue to create value for customers, patients, and healthcare systems globally, while also continuing to deliver for shareholders. The credit for this goes to our 40,000 employees around the world who continue to remain focused on our mission of providing the world's 7 billion people with accessible, high-quality medication. Thanks to each and every one of them for their commitment to our cause.","Now, turning to the third quarter. Overall, our Generics business delivered third-party net sales of approximately $2.6 billion for the quarter, an increase of 17% compared to the prior year quarter. Meda contributed $324 million of these revenues, in-line with our expectations. In North America, our Generics business grew approximately 1% to just about $1.1 billion on a constant-currency basis. Growth came primarily from our acquisitions of both Meda and the Renaissance topicals business as well as new product introductions. Note that we have a challenging year-over-year comparison this quarter due to significant contribution from the new products in the last year's third quarter, especially Esomeprazole, Lidocaine and Bexarotene. We also experienced increased competition with new entrants on a number of other key products.","The Generic pricing environment was again consistent with our expectations and previous guidance. Tony will elaborate on this topic shortly. In Europe, sales totaled $842 million, a year-over-year increase of approximately 39% on a constant-currency basis. This strong result was mainly due to contributions from Meda, as well as stable pricing of our portfolio, and sales of new products. In Rest of World, sales totaled $670 million, a year-over-year increase of 20% on a constant currency basis. This strong growth was due in part to the contributions of Meda business in new expansion markets. We also saw volumes increase across the region, specifically as our HIV tender volumes improved and returned towards our expected levels. Additionally, Japan, Australia and the rest of emerging markets showed favorable sales on existing products as well as benefits of the new product introductions.","Our Specialty division delivered revenues of $419 million in the quarter, a year-over-year decrease of 4%. This decrease was primarily the result of the timing of wholesaler purchases of EpiPen, which resulted in lower volumes, as well as the actions taken during the quarter to improve access to EpiPen, such as the increase in our Coupon Program and Patient Assistance Program. We are making very good progress in what we are calling Integrating Mylan, as we bring together all of our recent acquisitions; Meda, Renaissance, the EPD business, and Famy Care with legacy Mylan. We continue to see significant opportunities to optimize our cost base as well as create value by integrating across our branded Generics and OTC platforms in all of our regions and operating as One Mylan.","As we continue to learn more about these businesses, we had even greater clarity on the opportunities to create meaningful efficiencies and truly maximize our business for the future in a differentiated way. We will provide details about this enhanced potential during our Investor Day. That said, all of our work today provides us with greater confidence that we will not only achieve the operating synergy estimates provided upon the Meda closing but potentially exceed them. We also continue to see revenue synergy opportunities as we apply our One Mylan approach to our combined portfolio. With that said, let me turn to some of the significant progress we have made on our key pipeline programs.","Turning first to our biosimilars portfolio, yesterday, along with our partner Biocon, we announced the FDA submission of our BLA for our proposed biosimilar trastuzumab through the 351(NYSE:K) pathway. This is our first FDA biosimilar submission, and we believe it has the potential to be the first submission of a proposed biosimilar trastuzumab in the U.S. The submitted BLA includes a comprehensive package of analytical similarity, non-clinical and clinical data. The clinical data consists of two PK studies and a HERITAGE Phase 3 confirmatory efficacy and safety trial. The results of the HERITAGE trial were presented at this year's ASCO and ESMO Congress. Our applications for trastuzumab, pegfilgrastim, and glargine have already been accepted for review by European Medicines Agency.","For pegfilgrastim, the results from our Phase 3 clinical efficacy and safety study as well as our PK and PD study that supported our EU application were also presented at ESMO. Our insulin glargine EMA filing announced last week included analytical, pre-clinical, and clinical data. Our pre-clinical package included our PK and PD studies, demonstrating bioequivalence of our insulin glargine compared to Lantus. Finally, the EU registration relies upon an efficacy and safety clinical trial in type 1 diabetes patients, which successfully demonstrate equivalence of our insulin glargine with Lantus.","We are on track to file our applications for pegfilgrastim and glargine products with FDA. We continue to generate additional data and work with FDA to establish an interchangeable pathway for our insulin glargine program. 15% of world's pharmaceutical spend will be on diabetes medicines by 2020, and there's a significant unmet need around the world for more affordable versions of injectable insulin products. Turning to our partnership with Momenta. We announced last week that dosing has begun in our Phase 1 study to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of M834, a proposed biosimilar of ORENCIA. This is the first product in our portfolio of six biosimilars in development with Momenta to advance to clinical trial.","We also recently signed a development and commercialization agreement with Mabion, a Polish biotechnology company for a license to rituximab in all European countries and non-European Balkan States. Through these various collaborations, we have access to a combined portfolio of 16 biosimilar and insulin analog generic products in development, which gives Mylan one of industry's the largest and most diverse portfolio. We remain committed to robust investments in this portfolio.","It's also worth noting that we have also filed applications for trastuzumab, pegfilgrastim, and glargine in more than 30 other markets around the world combined. It's our broad portfolio of biosimilars, insulin, niche respiratory products as well as our strong HIV basket and Hep C products that will fuel the organic growth of our expansion market platform, which has been further enhanced by addition of Meda footprint in these countries. On the respiratory front, we announced with our partner, Theravance Biopharma, positive results from two replicate Phase 3 efficacy studies of revefenacin, an investigational LAMA and first once-daily, nebulized bronchodilator in development for the treatment of COPD. The data confirms that revefenacin has the potential to offer meaningful benefits to patients with moderate to very severe COPD and represents another exciting milestone in Mylan's robust global respiratory pipeline.","Additionally, we look forward to the completion of an ongoing Phase 3 safety trial in 2017 with the goal of filing an NDA by the end of 2017. We believe Mylan's strong experience with nebulized products and experienced salesforce in the respiratory segment, which has been further enhanced through our Meda transaction, will help ensure this product's success when approved. Our generic Advair, we remain confident in our application, as we continue to be actively engaged with FDA and move towards our GDUFA goal date. We also had some good developments on generic Copaxone program this quarter.","In September, we launched a generic version of \u2013 20-milligram version of this product in Germany known as Clep (20:25). Multiple sclerosis medicines are among the top-class drivers in Germany and we believe that the generic version can help provide meaningful cost savings for the German healthcare system. In the USA, we are very encouraged that our ANDA for our Glatiramer Acetate 20-milligram product is moving forward. We very recently received some additional clarification and questions from agency, but based on the type of questions, we can say that we are in the final stretch, and we look forward to bringing additional competition to this marketplace.","With regard to Copaxone 40-milligram, we're pleased that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ruled in favor of Mylan in our IPR proceeding, finding all claims of three challenged Copaxone 40-milligram patent to be unpatentable. We believe the board's decision is highly persuasive in detaining the basis for the invalidity of these patents. Last week, we also filed an IPR on a fourth patent covering Teva's 40-milligram Copaxone product. In USA, we were pleased to have received approval of our AB-rated generic version of Concerta, further demonstrating our ability to develop and manufacture such complex products. The details on the launch of this product are subject to a confidential settlement.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on the commercial landscape. Thanks.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV","Thank you, Rajiv. As Rajiv noted, we have continued to see growth across our global generic business, including in the U.S., where the pricing environment continues to be a topic of much focus. Throughout our history, we have seen many evolutions in our industry. However, our primary keys to success have remained constant: maintaining one of the industry's broadest portfolios, consistent execution of new product launches, and being able to reliably supply significant volumes to our customers. Because of this, our relationship with customers continue to not only remain strong but to thrive given the strength of our portfolio, our reputation for reliability, our shared excitement around our pipeline and our commitment to continuing to deliver high customer service levels.","As we have said consistently, we continue to see pricing across our very broad generics portfolio to be in line with our expectations, with year-over-year price erosion in the mid-single-digits, including in the U.S. We continue to anticipate price erosion in the mid-single-digits for the remainder of the year. Our business model has never been premised on price increases for our growth, and this remains the case today. In fact, the generic industry is based on vigorous competition driven by supply and demand. Occasionally, prices increase due to market conditions, but in the vast majority of periods, our business has experienced a net deflationary price environment.","Looking ahead in our generics business, we recently launched with exclusivity, our generic versions of Benicar and Benicar HCT with annualized sales of almost $2 billion based on IMS. And we expect this to be a strong launch for us. We also see the potential for several other important launches in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we have continued to see growth across the majority of our global brands and are pleased with our performance. With respect to EpiPen, while we saw scripts increase quarter-over-quarter, volumes were down due the lack of wholesaler purchases in the quarter in anticipation of our upcoming generic launch.","We have been in extensive dialogue with our customers to ensure successful launch and at a wholesale acquisition cost of $300, we believe our authorized generic will create significant cost savings for patients and the healthcare system. The new assets we have acquired had even further strengthened our expansive portfolio offering for our customers. Our EPD brands are already doing well as part of the One Mylan Platform, and we see significant potential to translate this success and our learnings to our recent acquisitions.","As we bring Meda and Renaissance into our commercial business, we continue to see opportunities to do more with our combined product portfolio as we optimize our salesforce, bring new products into new countries, and maximize high potential brands. Additionally, by now having OTC products along with our strong Gx and Rx businesses, we have a broader commercial reach than ever before and greater flexibility and optionality to successfully expand in any geographic market, especially the emerging markets.","With these current assets combined with our strategic growth drivers, we have a portfolio and pipeline that we believe is second to none. Further, we are well-positioned to continue to reduce healthcare costs for payers and patients as we bring more affordable versions of key drivers of rising pharmaceutical costs to markets around the world.","With all that said, we recognize along with many stakeholders in the pharmaceutical industry the challenging dynamics at play and that we will need to evolve to reflect these dynamics. As Heather said, we will do our part to lead this dialogue while continuing to serve as an important partner to our customers to ensure that we address these challenges in the right, balanced way in order to enhance patient access to affordable medication, preserve and reward innovation, and allow for a robust and competitive industry.","With that, I will turn the call over to Ken.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to our financial results, third quarter revenues grew to $3.1 billion, that's an increase of 13% over the third quarter of last year, and as Rajiv already noted, our Generics segment grew 17%, while our Specialty segment declined 4%. The generics pricing environment was consistent with our expectations, declining at a mid-single-digit rate overall in the quarter. The year-over-year impact of currency translation on our third quarter revenues was insignificant. Adjusted gross margins for the third quarter of 2016 were 57%. That's down approximately 100 basis points due to significant contribution from new products in last year's third quarter.","Moving on to our operating expenses on an adjusted basis, R&D investment expanded to $176 million as we continue to invest in our respiratory, insulin and biologics programs, yet it remained at approximately 6% of total revenues. SG&A expense, also on an adjusted basis, increased to $605 million or approximately 20% of total revenues. The increase is primarily due to the impact of acquisitions. Our adjusted tax rate was 16% for the quarter, which was in line with our expectations.","Adjusted net earnings decreased by $7 million to $726 million compared to $734 million in the prior-year quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.38 compared to $1.43 in the prior-year quarter. As previously announced during the third quarter, we accrued $465 million for a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and other government agencies that was related to the classification of the EpiPen Auto-Injector for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Mylan continues to work with the government to finalize that settlement. In addition, during the quarter, we agreed with Strides to settle substantially all outstanding claims associated with our acquisition of Agila. As a result of the recent settlement, we'll have access to approximately $80 million of currently restricted cash in the fourth quarter of 2016 and we recorded approximately $90 million of expense in the third quarter of 2016.","For the nine months ended September 30, total revenues grew to $7.8 billion, a year-over-year increase of 13%. Adjusted gross margins for the same period were 56%, up approximately 100 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted R&D expanded to approximately $533 million and remained at approximately 7% of total revenues, consistent with the prior year. Adjusted SG&A expense expanded to approximately $1.6 billion or approximately 22% of total revenues. Again, the increase in SG&A was mainly due to the impact of acquisitions. Resulting adjusted earnings for the nine months ended September 30 increased by $188 million to $1.7 billion and adjusted diluted EPS increased 7% to $3.31.","Turning to our cash flow and liquidity, adjusted cash provided by operating activities was strong, $1.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, compared to $1.6 billion for the prior-year period. The record performance in the current quarter was the result of continuing to tightly manage our business and effectively manage working capital. We have no amounts outstanding in our accounts receivable securitization and revolving credit facilities. At the end of Q3 2016, our net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA leverage ratio was approximately 3.8 times, which includes Meda debt. We are fully committed to our investment grade rating and reducing our debt and leverage during 2017 towards our target leverage ratio of approximately three times by the end of the year 2017.","We have the financial flexibility to achieve this goal while still deploying capital strategically for bolt-on acquisitions. In addition, as we continue to optimize our capital structure and align it with our more balanced geographic profile, we remain committed to the Euro bond market. Subject to prevailing market conditions, the terms and specific timing are to be determined. We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 535 million shares for the fourth quarter, and that's including the full impact of recognizing the shares issued for the Meda transaction. We also expect our diluted share count for the full year to be approximately 520 million shares.","We look forward to ending the year strong. We're in the process and feel confident with our ability to continue to integrate Meda into Mylan, leveraging our existing outstanding global operating platform. We remain fully committed to our revised 2016 guidance, as communicated in early October, and to achieving our $6 adjusted EPS target in 2018.","With that, we'll now turn the call over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. And I'm going to try to do one housekeeping and one content. On the housekeeping, the common question we keep getting this afternoon from investors, if you can give us some comparable number about your North America business, that is excluding the acquisition, what was the price and volume trend? And then the question I actually have is around glargine. I think you mentioned you filed in Europe. Can you let us know where you stand in terms of filing in the United States and confirm that you're both filing \u2013 both the vial and the pen in the United States given that the vial market is still quite substantial?","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Thanks, Ronny, for your question. Let me start with glargine. Yes, we are on track to file glargine for U.S. with the FDA and it will be in a very \u2013 over the next few months in a very short period of time. And yes, we remain on track to file both pen as well as vial. And your first question was about the pricing. We basically \u2013 we track our pricing across our global business, across our \u2013 including various markets, but even for \u2013 if I have to just take U.S., we believe \u2013 on a consolidated basis, we are still in the single-digits, in the mid-single-digits as far as the price erosion is concerned.","Kris King - Mylan NV","Next caller, please?","Operator","Once again, ladies and gentlemen, to ensure everyone has time to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question. Our next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Let me just try to ask the question this way. I think this is what Ronny was trying to get at. Ken, can you just provide us the contribution this quarter from Meda and Renaissance? And if I just kind of back into it based on what our numbers look like, and I want you to confirm this. It seems that the overall Generic business is about flat with last year. And I'm wondering if you could just kind of take a step back, you and Heather, and talk about what's happening in the marketplace?","It does feel that pressure is building across your portfolio, along with many of your peers. And many of your peers, as you know, this week have described a worsening pricing environment driven by consolidation of buyers, potentially a change because of the Teva\/Allergan deal. So I'm just wondering if you could talk about the state of your business. Am I right that the business is about flat? Describe what's really changed. And how do we think about this business on a go-forward basis? Thanks.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","So, Jami, let me give you \u2013 thank you for the question. Let me give you \u2013 and it'll be kind of reiteration of points out of some of the prepared comments. We said that \u2013 Tony said that Generics pricing was down mid-single-digits overall, and he said the U.S. was relatively consistent with that. So that should give you kind of an indication of pricing. Meda contribution, we're not going to break out by region, but we did indicate that Meda for the quarter contributed about $330 million of revenue. But that's across the world. The third comment I would say is, is that, when we talked about North America, we said the third variable that you're looking for to kind of triangulate is excluding the impact of acquisitions, the business was \u2013 the volumes were relatively \u2013 the revenue was relatively flat.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","And Jami, just \u2013 I'll kind of high-level and then let Tony or Rajiv fill in. Look, I hope and tried to convey in my opening remarks our \u2013 not only excitement and the opportunity that we see ahead, given both our organic pipeline and the assets that we continue to complement now given the commercial and operational scale we have, and we believe really this diversification around geographies, around products and channel. So our ability to really maximize and optimize how we go to market in every country, I think we've never had a better opportunity to do so. And when I think of the U.S. space, and I, again, look at our portfolio and our mix, it's why I think we are able to talk about mid-single-digit erosion, and that has been what we have seen over the recent quarters and years.","And I think it's that mix and the breadth of our portfolio, over 630 products here in the United States alone, over 2,000 globally. But it's that mix, that portfolio, and our capacity and capability of supplying the demands that's needed out there is what's allowed us to continue to compete in a market that I would say has always been competitive. And lastly, I would just say that, again, I think as you look at the transactions and the acquisitions that we've done, we've said it's about what we can do with those assets. And I think we have continued to execute, and as we said in our remarks, these next couple of years really give us the opportunity to leverage the economies of scale. And so, I think the future is bright both here in the U.S. as well as around the globe.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV","And just maybe to add, Jami, certainly I think based on both our diversification and differentiation of those 635 products across the U.S. portfolio, I've always felt like there's been pressure in the U.S. Generic business. I don't think that's going away. But what you need is a broad portfolio. You need best-in-class service levels. And with these assets, you can certainly keep erosion to a level that we believe is mid-single-digits, like we've commented on.","Kris King - Mylan NV","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. Same question or same line of questioning, maybe different data points. Probably maybe just best answered by Tony to start with. But with respect to expected growth in the Generics business, at the beginning of the year when you announced year-end numbers and the Meda acquisition, the global Generic business was expected to grow 20%. Year-to-date, it's up 12% year-over-year. Obviously, you have kind of stuck with the same metrics in terms of pricing realization in the U.S. market but it seems like something else isn't working or isn't going necessarily according to plan. So maybe you could just comment on price and volume trends in ex-U.S. markets versus expectations at the beginning of the year and also maybe a little bit further commentary on the new product cycle in the U.S. and sort of timing of realization of pipeline assets versus original expectations? Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Hey, Elliott. Maybe I'll kick it off and then let, again, Tony, Rajiv comment. Elliott, I guess what I'd start off by saying and you've probably heard me say this a lot of times, not all good things happen at once, not all bad things happen at once in this very dynamic volatile marketplace. And what we've said, is our continued ability to diversify and differentiate and have the operational scale that we do allows us to mitigate these headwinds and how we manage the business and execute, I hope what our actions and track record speak to, is our ability to do just that, manage this business and deliver what we have stated that we'll do. And we get there sometimes at the beginning of the year and the end of the year. How we achieve it, obviously looks a lot different from launches that you expect happening that don't happening, market dynamics. As you know, there's many, many different levers. But I think the overarching point is given the amount of levers that we have to manage this business, we're able to execute and deliver on our stated targets.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","And I would say, let me just, Elliott, go around the wall a little bit over here. We remain very confident with our business in the Rest of the World market, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and other emerging markets. We had some initial hiccups early in the year on our HIV tenders, which have come back to normal and we see that normalcy come back. Europe is, in fact, very stable, pricing is stable. Our EPD acquired products are doing very well from the growth perspective. And when you come to USA, it's about the diversity of this product mix, with the Mylan Institutional \u2013 with so many injectable products we have and so many other complex one. Yes, we said that this quarter there has been some challenge on the growth because previous year, this quarter we had some huge new product launch contributions like from products of Esomeprazole, Lidocaine, Bexarotene, and that's where you see that, this volume shift. But this has been like always, so this \u2013 we're not seeing anything different.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV","Yeah, maybe just to add. We are certainly pleased with our European business from a volume and price stability standpoint. And just adding to the U.S. it really is about portfolio mix, dosage form mix across multiple channels in that breadth of portfolio that allows for this to happen.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Irina Koffler with Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Irina R. Koffler - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I was wondering if you could help us with the amount of destocking for EpiPen? And then just looking out into next year with the launch of the AG, do you expect to capture more patient volume? I'm just trying to understand a bit more about your remark about 6% of next year's sales being EpiPen. Does that assume any additional volume growth? Thanks.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","Maybe just to start off, certainly from an inventory perspective, it's fairly typical in the U.S. business when you're launching a generic, the wholesalers will bring down inventories to lower rates than they're normally holding, and that's what we're experiencing.","And I think the second question was around...","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Volume growth \u2013 for next year (43:45)","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","Yeah. We're very hopeful that our authorized generic converts like a traditional generic from a volume and a conversion perspective, in the high 80s, I believe, we've commented on. So that would be our aim and our goal entering 2017.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Can you help us bridge a little bit from the $4.80 midpoint of your EPS guidance range this year to that $6 target in 2018? I know a lot of questions we've been getting is with just the pressures on EpiPen next year and beyond. How do we get comfortable that that $6 number is achievable? What assumptions go into that? And maybe just a little bit more color to help us understand how you still have confidence of hitting that type of number? Thanks so much.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Sure. Thank you, Chris. I think if we step back for a second, Chris, and I'll go back to our Investor Day when we put the $6 target out there that, at that time, obviously, perhaps for different reasons, but at that time we said that by 2018 that we assumed EpiPen would only account for about 5% of revenue. So obviously, as I said for other reasons and for \u2013 as we looked at the competitive landscape, we didn't have that as a major driver, 2017 especially then going into 2018. So yes, has that pulled forward? A little bit. That's why we tried to quantify and say that we're estimating \u2013 anticipating that about 6% of revenue next year would be to EpiPen.","So again, I think that as you look, and as you guys know, that we're much more than any one product and much more than any one country, that all of this differentiation and our product portfolio mix again, as I said, has allowed us \u2013 this platform has allowed us to absorb these headwinds when they hit, to mitigate them and to manage them. And I hope that in both our response to the EpiPen situation but again, managing this overall business is allowing us to deliver and giving us the confidence about that $6 target.","And as we also said, we see this low, mid-teens growth, 2017 and 2018. And we look forward to coming to you in Investor Day, in conjunction with fourth quarter, to really detail that out more. But hopefully that gives a little bit, when you think about the launches we've got coming, when you look at the business, again, across the globe and now the diversification outside of the U.S. that you can start seeing a real clear pathway to how we're going to get there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Heather, what feedback are you seeing from PBMs on your portfolio, especially on the larger products as you head into 2017? And on that note also, I noticed gross margin this quarter was similar to 2Q even though EpiPen was bigger and Meda was in, and Meda is a higher gross margin business. So I'm just trying to understand, what are you seeing on gross margin level? It seems like there's some pressure in 3Q.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","So look, Umer, I'm going to let the guys operating and running these businesses talk about it. Maybe Tony can hit PBM and Rajiv can hit gross margins.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV","Okay. Yeah, thank you, Umer. Yes, we've certainly had dialogue with all our customers over the last quarter and we continue to do that. Like I said, I think both our strength of portfolio and the partnership we have from a pipeline perspective and our future outlook of growth drivers allows this dialogue to be one of a bilateral nature. And I continue to feel that way moving forward with our EpiPen Generic launch coming here in the coming weeks and in any other new products we have as well.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","And, Umer, yes, there's a little bit of drift of the gross margin, and I'll attribute that to the product mix.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. About the $6, how does the amount of capital you've had to deploy to get to the $6 compare to your expectations, and how does that play into management comp if you achieve the $6 but had to spend a lot more to get there? And second, some would say you've thrown the supply chain under the bus. Others would say that you've highlighted what has long needed to be highlighted in terms of the complexity of the system. I guess my question is \u2013 and you've been a proponent of wanting to have a dialogue, what is the next step in this dialogue? Is there anything specific you have in mind, or is it just sort of take it as it comes? Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Thanks, Gregg. So I'll start, and then turn it over to Ken. Here's what I'd say. I think that we certainly continue to look for the opportunity for the facts to catch up to the story and the headlines that have been out there, and I think with the election behind us, that opportunity for our facts to be heard in a better digestible way, we're going to continue to work on that. As far as blaming the system, again, that is not what we said. What we did is start a discussion about the transparency that's needed and that people understand the complexity around the pricing.","And I think that, obviously not only did we, yes, start that discussion and happy to see that that discussion has continued with many other company executives talking about the gross to net and that the entire \u2013 everybody needs to come together and sit around the table and talk about a solution, that you can't do it piecemeal, you can't try to do it by legislating a certain slice of it. So we absolutely hope and will obviously continue to drive not only that discussion but look for solutions. As I said in my opening remarks, we need to \u2013 this system needs reinvented across the healthcare, across the entire U.S. healthcare landscape. And we look forward to those next steps being looking for solutions, not just driving certain headlines. With that, Ken, you want to...?","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","Yeah, so the $6 when we launched it back in the 2013 Investor Day, certainly included a component for acquisitions because that's part of what we've been doing with the business and a lot of the discussion you've heard today around broadening the portfolio inside the U.S. as well as across the world. So there is an acquisition component to that. We'll update you on what that roadmap might look like when we do Investor Day to give you a little bit more specifics around it. But I'll tell you, you've heard us say since we've done the Meda acquisition the words around capital redeployment have been more around bolt-on acquisitions. So you should anticipate that you're going to see us invest in those that create good, positive profit streams going forward, and add on to the portfolios that we have already. And at the same time, remain committed to our investment grade credit rating.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Heather, can I just follow-up? What do you guys mean by bolt-on? Because I think at one point you called Perrigo a bolt-on deal. So when we think about the capital deployment for opportunities that you see, is that a $2 billion opportunity or is that a $10 billion? And then the one thing that we haven't discussed is share repurchases given where your stock is. Can you talk about how that factors in as well? Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Sure. So Randall, I'm not sure who referred to Perrigo as a bolt-on deal. I certainly, I think we talked about it as a transformational acquisition of those companies coming together. So I would say what we mean by bolt-on deals is \u2013 look, product lines \u2013 we don't need to do any big acquisition. We've got the commercial and operational scale that we need but as we look across channels, therapeutic categories, products, as we want to complement just like we did around injectables, Renaissance around the derm. So, look, and we think, look, it's a buyer's market. I think there's great assets out there that we could complement and leverage our economies of scale. But first and foremost, our focus these next 18 to 24 months is integrating Mylan, truly leveraging our assets, optimizing them. And like I said, I think we've never had better opportunities around the world in these countries to have a great go-to-market strategy now having scale across all the channels, OTC, Generics and brands.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV","And on your point around share repurchase, we have an authorization for an incremental, right now, $930 million of share repurchase. That is in our toolbox. You hear us talking about right now, we're focused on post Meda driving down our debt, reducing our debt and reducing our leverage, and then keeping dry powder in the short term for these bolt-on acquisitions that Heather talked about.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Melissa, Head of Global Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Melissa Trombetta - Mylan NV","Thank you, Terence. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Mylan's first quarter 2017 earnings conference earnings. Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; Chief Commercial Officer, Tony Mauro; and Chief Financial Officer, Ken Parks.","During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial outlook and 2017 guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from today's projections. Please refer to the earnings release we submitted to the SEC on Form 8-K earlier this morning, which is also posted on our website for a fuller explanation of those risks and uncertainties and the limits applicable to forward-looking statements.","In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We will refer to these measures as adjusted and present them in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of financial performance.","Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measures, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to those GAAP measures, are available in our first quarter earnings release, which I just mentioned and which can be found on our website at newsroom.mylan.com.","Let me also remind you that the information discussed during this call, with the exception of the participant questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's expressed written permission. An archived copy of today's call will be available on our website and will remain available for a limited time.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Heather.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call.","Mylan's first quarter results marked the start of what we believe will be another great year of performance for our company. On the top line, we generated total revenues of more than $2.7 billion, a year-over-year increase of 24%; and on the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $500 million, or $0.93 per adjusted diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 22%.","Not only is this a strong performance as the quarter goes, it also once again demonstrates the resiliency of the global platform we've built and our ability to absorb both our industry's natural volatility as well as additional headwinds, related to particular product and\/or markets.","Over the past few years, our strategic acquisitions and ability to truly integrate Mylan had allowed us to transform ourselves into a highly differentiated and diversified organization, as evidenced by our geographical reach, our broad portfolio, our extensive pipeline, and our ability to expand the world's access to high quality products.","This organization enables our unique go-to-market approach in-country, optimizing our brand, branded generic, generic and OTC products. In fact, it's precisely this unique profile and approach of how, to how we now run and drive our businesses that led us to change our reporting from product-focused segments to geography-focused segments. For these reasons, we remain confident in our ability to meet our full-year adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.15 to $5.55, which is not dependent on any one product.","Our strong first quarter results are set against a backdrop of the global debate regarding healthcare and, to a degree, unprecedented here in the U.S. The current debate continues to focus both on how healthcare has delivered as well as its price, and we are encouraged by the recent multiple actions of players across multiple industries that help reduce the burden to patients.","As a leading generics company, Mylan has a 55-year history of providing access and serving as part of the backbone of healthcare systems around the world that help supply affordable medicine, and we fully intend to keep doing our part to deliver better health for a better world.","I'd like to take this opportunity on behalf of Mylan's board and our entire leadership team to thank all of our employees around the world for their outstanding teamwork and execution during the quarter and for their continued commitment to serving all of our stakeholders around the world.","In addition, we continue to build our bench strength and I'd like to welcome Dan Gallagher, who joined Mylan last month as our Chief Legal Officer. His extensive experience in regulatory matters, financial markets and corporate legal affairs and governance makes him an excellent addition to our senior leadership team and further depth to our already strong legal organization. He will prove invaluable as we maximize our many opportunities.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I too would like to thank our employees around the world for their continued dedication and hard work as well as their unwavering focus on our mission and business objectives. It is this focus from each and every one of them that allowed us to again deliver strong performance around the world.","Let's turn to the first quarter results where we have reported according to our new regional segments. I'll provide an overview of our top line performance and Ken will get into segment profitability. Overall, our total business delivered revenue of approximately $2.7 billion for the quarter, an increase of 24% compared to the prior year. This performance is once again driven by the strength, diversity and the resilience of the assets we have assembled and successfully integrated.","The global pricing environment was again consistent with our expectations and previous guidance. Tony will provide an update on this topic shortly. In North America, our business grew approximately 5% to more than $1.2 billion. This increase was primarily due to net sales from the acquisitions of Meda and the Renaissance Topicals Business. These increases were partially offset by the net impact of lower net sales from new products and existing products.","As anticipated, sales of EpiPen Auto-Injector declined in the current quarter as a result of increased competition and the impact of lower priced authorized generic. Excluding the impact of EpiPen, our North American business would have been up approximately 20%. This year, EpiPen will represent less than 5% of global revenues and less than 10% of sales in North America.","In Europe, sales totaled about $900 million, a year-over-year increase of 53%. The increase was primarily the result of net sales from acquisition of Meda. We continue to grow our leadership position in key European markets, such as Italy, where we recently became the generics market leader, and France. We also continued to experience sustained growth in our key products across the region.","In Rest of the World, sales totaled about $580 million, a year-over-year increase of 34%. This increase was primarily driven by acquisition of Meda. In addition, net sales from existing products increased, as high volumes offset lower pricing throughout the segment. We were especially pleased to see a return to strong growth in our ARV franchise, with double digits year-over-year growth. We look forward to continued opportunities for growth in ARV with the launch of our TLE400 product in the developing world.","We continue to make good progress in the integration of Mylan and are on track to realizing our synergy targets, as evidenced by the decrease in our SG&A spend on a percentage basis year over year. We also continue to leverage revenue synergy opportunities by operating as One Mylan. With now three quarters under our belt, these acquisitions are exceeding our expectations, and we are well-positioned to leverage these assets and see continued benefits from these assets.","With regards to our operating platform, Mylan has always had a deep and unwavering commitment to quality everywhere we operate. FDA standards for our industry continue to evolve, and this continues to raise the bar for every player in our industry, which is something we very much welcome. For Mylan's part, we are dedicated to continually enhancing our systems and processes with a deliberate and thorough approach to ensure sustainable quality across our entire network of facilities, working closely with FDA to resolve any issues that come our way.","As you are aware, we recently received a warning letter at our Nashik site in India. We are working closely with the FDA to respond to and address the issues raised in the letter as comprehensively and expeditiously as possible. Production from Nashik site continues uninterrupted, and we anticipate no material impact to Mylan's overall business as a result of this warning letter.","At the same time, we have successfully completed remediation efforts at the three sites acquired from Agila that were under FDA warning letters. The warning letters have been lifted at both SFF [Specialty Formulation Facility] and SPD [Sterile Product Division] sites and we are pleased with our progress at OTL [Onco Therapies Limited] site, which also was very recently inspected by FDA.","I note that during the quarter, we had 15 inspections by various global regulators across our 50 facilities. In fact, the Nashik site is in good standing with other global regulatory entities, including WHO and MHRA, which inspected the site following FDA and issued a GMP compliance certificate.","Turning now to some of our key pipeline programs, with regards to our biosimilar portfolio, we continue to make good progress on our applications and are working closely with the various health authorities on the reviews and with regard to the GCP and GMP inspection of our facilities. We remain on track with all key programs, including insulin glargine.","As a reminder, during the quarter we announced that we agreed to the terms of a global settlement with Genentech and Roche in relation to patents from Herceptin, which provides Mylan with global licenses for our trastuzumab product, excluding Brazil, Japan, and Mexico. This global license will provide a clear pathway for Mylan to commercialize its product in various markets around the world commencing on the license effective dates. As of this quarter, we now have approval for our trastuzumab biosimilar in 15 developing markets.","On the respiratory front, we received a Complete Response Letter from FDA regarding our ANDA for generic Advair Diskus. We have carefully assessed the CRL, which represents a full review of the ANDA from all FDA disciplines. Although it's designated as a major CRL, we have a difference of opinion with the agency on certain items raised in the CRL. We believe that the resolution of some of these points, based on our previously agreed-upon protocols with FDA, can potentially change this major designation of the CRL. In any event, the agency has again explicitly confirmed that they consider this application a high priority. For these reasons, it's important for us to have this interaction with the FDA before we can comment further upon the potential impact of the CRL. Regardless of the timing, we remain confident that there will be a significant market opportunity for a substitutable generic to Advair and that demand for this product will be strong.","I would also like to note that we are ready from both a manufacturing and commercial perspective to launch upon approval. It's important to note that our Dublin manufacturing facility was inspected by FDA in June of 2016, and we have been informed that this facility is in good standing.","Turning to Copaxone, we have a target action date for both the 20-milligram and 40-milligram for next month. We see no reason that these dates cannot be met. We believe that all scientific questions have been resolved to FDA satisfaction and we also believe that there are no facility GMP issues that should be a barrier to approval of this ANDA.","Generally speaking, we believe that the process for approving complex generics continues to be an area that requires greater focus and clarity. And we believe that FDA is committed to enhancing its capabilities and approach in this area. We are encouraged by the comments by the new FDA Commissioner that this process will be a priority for him, as he assumed his new office.","We remain very committed to investing in complex products through our robust R&D efforts. Mylan is distinguished from many of our competitors as a result of our willingness to make the substantial investments required over the long term to continue to bring these needed products to the patients. Although you will continue to see some variability in our quarterly R&D spending due to the timing of program spend, there is no change to our overall commitment to investment in R&D.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on commercial landscape. Thank you.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV","Thank you, Rajiv, and good morning, everyone.","As Rajiv noted, we have continued to see growth across all of our regions, with very strong double-digit growth in Europe and Rest of World and solid performance in North America. We also continue to see growth from our global key brands around the world.","As in previous recent quarters, the pricing environment remains a topic of much discussion throughout our industry. We are pleased that as a result of our diversity from a product, channel and geographic perspective, our expectations for the global pricing environment are unchanged, and we are still predicting mid-single-digit price erosion globally for the year. This quarter, we actually saw price erosion in the low single digits on a global basis. While price erosion in our U.S. generics business was in the mid-single digits.","Looking ahead in the U.S., we have several meaningful first-to-market products that launched in 2016 that have come off their exclusivity periods, which will cause fluctuations and skew year-over-year comparisons in the coming quarters. This being said, excluding these products from our future outlook, we expect that our U.S. base business will continue to maintain annualized erosion in the mid single-digits.","Let me reiterate again that we continue to believe we will see mid single-digit price erosion for our global business for the remainder of the year, including all products.","With respect to EpiPen, the authorized generic continues to gain traction and now represents almost 40% of the epinephrine auto-injector market. Additionally, we have seen market growth pick up to more than 10% year over year for the category. The AG also continues to have the lowest wholesale acquisition cost of any Epinephrine Auto-Injector on the market. That said, competitive activity in the space continues to be robust and our overall shares declined from last year.","You are aware of the worldwide recall of 20-plus lots of EpiPen by the manufacturer Pfizer's Meridian Medical Technologies. We quickly implemented a voucher program for patients to replace any impacted products and have successfully been executing on this program. We in partnership with our customers continue to communicate to impacted patients and replace their product as efficiently as possible while ensuring these patients have no additional out-of-pocket costs. We also note that Meridian Medical Technologies is contractually responsible for the recall costs.","We continue to be very pleased with the contribution from the assets we have acquired, which have even further strengthened our broad portfolio offering for our customers. For example, during the first quarter, we completed our acquisition of Cold-EEZE, as we continue to expand our OTC business. Cold-EEZE is now Mylan's largest U.S. consumer healthcare brand and we look forward to serving this loyal customer base and supporting this well-known brand.","With that, I will turn the call over to Ken.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Let me add a little more detail on our financial results.","First quarter revenues grew to $2.7 billion, and that's an increase of 24% over the first quarter of last year. This increase included growth in third-party net sales of 5% in our North America segment, 53% in our Europe segment, and 34% in our Rest of World segment.","The key drivers to these increases were net sales from the acquisitions of Meda and the Renaissance Topicals Business, which totaled approximately $607 million in the quarter. These increases were partially offset by an $86 million net decrease in the combination of sales driven by the impact of new product launches and lower volume and pricing on existing products.","For the quarter, we continued to experience global generic price deflation in the low single-digits. As Rajiv mentioned, net sales from our North America segment reached $1.2 billion and grew by 5%, up approximately 20% excluding EpiPen Auto-Injector.","Net sales from acquisitions contributed approximately $182 million of the sales growth, and partially offsetting this increase was a net decrease in sales from the combination of new product launches and lower volume and pricing on existing products. In addition, segment profitability increased 3%.","Net sales in our Europe segment increased by approximately $308 million or 53%. The acquisition of Meda contributed approximately $338 million of the sales growth and this increase was partially offset by a net decrease in sales from the combination of new product launches and lower volume and pricing on existing products as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 4%. Segment profitability in Europe increased approximately 88% year over year.","Net sales from our Rest of World segment increased by approximately $146 million or 34%. This increase was driven largely by the acquisition of Meda, which totaled approximately $87 million. In addition, higher volumes from existing products, primarily in our antiretroviral franchise, plus an increase in new products more than offset ongoing pricing headwinds. Net sales in this segment were favorably impacted by approximately 3% due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Segment profitability in Rest of World increased approximately 159% in the quarter.","Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter of 2017 were 53%. That's down less than 60 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to the impact from the launch of the EpiPen Auto-Injector authorized generic, as well as additional competition and partially offset by the contributions from prior-year acquisitions.","Moving on to our operating expenses, on an adjusted basis, R&D declined to $151 million, equating to approximately 6% of revenues, which was in line with our expectations.","SG&A expense, also on an adjusted basis, increased to $592 million, primarily as a result of selling and marketing costs from the acquired businesses. However, SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues declined by 1.3 percentage points to approximately 22% of sales, as increased revenues from the acquired businesses and benefits to Mylan integration were realized in the quarter. Our adjusted tax rate was 17.5% for the first quarter of 2017, which was also in line with our expectations.","Adjusted net earnings increased by $114 million to $500 million in the quarter and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.93 compared to $0.76 in the prior-year quarter.","Turning to cash flow and liquidity, adjusted cash provided by operating activities was strong at $536 million for the first three months of the year compared to $202 million for the prior year. The increase in the current quarter was mostly driven by favorable timing of working capital, including receivables, due to the December launch of EpiPen authorized generic.","We have no amounts outstanding on our accounts receivable securitization or revolving credit facility. At the end of Q1 2017, our debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA leverage ratio declined to approximately 3.7 times as compared to 3.8 times at the end of 2016. On a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA basis, we were at 3.5 times at the end of the first quarter. We are fully committed to our investment-grade rating and to reducing our debt, as evidenced by our voluntary prepayment of $550 million on our 2016 term loans during the first quarter.","We have no significant near-term debt maturities and we remain committed to moving towards our long-term average target leverage ratio of approximately 3 times EBITDA. We have the financial flexibility to achieve this goal while still deploying capital for strategic acquisitions.","As you can see, we started off the year strong and we're very pleased with our operational and financial results for the first three months of the year. We remain committed to our previously communicated full year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.15 to $5.55, which keeps us on track to realizing our $6 adjusted EPS goal in 2018.","In terms of phasing, we continue to see the relative percentage contribution from the first half of 2017 to be consistent with the percentage contribution of the first half of 2016.","With that, we'll now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Elliot Wilbur from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. First question for Heather, Rajiv, Tony. I guess specifically with respect to the evolving consortium dynamics and particularly the McKesson-Walmart collaboration, a lot of small to mid-sized manufacturers have pointed to this dynamic as having a significant negative impact on their business or at least creating a potential to having a significant negative impact on their business. I'm just wondering what Mylan's position is on the evolution of that particular consortium, whether or not you're actually seeing a current impact or this is something that you think is going to play out over the next couple of quarters, and then just maybe conceptually how much risk that creates around your mid-single-digit pricing erosion assumption.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Okay, Elliot. Thanks. I'll start off and then Rajiv or Tony can chime in. Elliot, I think this is no different than the consolidation we've seen over the last several years. When you look at our customer base, the consolidation, especially from a global perspective, what we've said then and remains true today is that consolidation is really a benefit to a company like ours at Mylan, given our portfolio, our breadth. and our geographical reach, our ability to not only supply the level of demand that is needed but to be able to do so on a global basis.","And I think what we've seen as a continued strength as these customers have consolidated our ability to really leverage our entire portfolio as well as our pipeline. We've got some important products coming. And what I would say is I can appreciate some of the players that are in one country or geographically landlocked or from a product perspective not being able to meet some of the supply and demand needed on a global basis. So I think this further underscores Mylan's differentiated and diversified platform and is allowing us to meet and exceed quite honestly what we have done in the past with some of these players as they're looking at a different business model.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV","Thanks, Heather. And, Elliot, yes, historically we've seen consolidation and the consolidation of businesses and aggregating these models together have some effect on erosion. What we continue to see, though, is that we have this differentiated platform with a diverse portfolio of products, best-in-class service levels, and the inclusion of new products into this mix in terms of always adding to what we've had. So we're excited to service McKesson, Walmart, and all our customers, and we want to mean more to them in the future. So I think that scale along with our geographic overlap plays a very important role into our success in that business.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","And I would just add that we have taken into consideration this alliance into our projections.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","And that reminded me and, Elliot, I don't think we can underscore this enough, we mentioned this at Investor Day, but the continuity of our management team. We've been together over a decade working with these customers and bringing that leadership. And I think as we look at all that's happening externally and the environment around us, that's continued to play a critical role in our ability to leverage our business. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Gary Nachman from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Gary Nachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, good morning. On generic Advair, can you give some more color at a high level on what the key differences are between you and FDA? What areas are they focused on? And then it sounds like timing is a bit up in the air. When do you think you will be able to meet with them?","And on Copaxone, just describe your readiness to launch that product, both the 20-milligram and the 40-milligram, if you actually get the approval at the action date next month.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","So let me take the easy one first, which is Copaxone, and just talk about our readiness. Yes, you will expect us to be in a state of readiness from the manufacturing point of view \u2013 from commercial manufacturing point of view in anticipation of the target action dates.","Regarding generic Advair, so let me reiterate that this submission was done in complete accordance to the product-specific guidance and pre-agreed protocols. And we have not been asked to do any additional clinical endpoints or device-related studies at this juncture. What we have been asked is now that some of the studies, especially the device-related studies, we have now been asked to analyze and report our findings of our study against the newly issued industry draft guidance for conduct of human practice studies \u2013 draft guidance. So that's what we want to go back and discuss with FDA, and we can get this meeting any day. We have been waiting for this meeting and it can happen any moment or any day. And we can only comment upon the potential impact of the CRL once we have these discussions behind us. So that's what we are waiting for before we comment upon any impact on timing.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Ken, maybe for you, and I just want to say I do appreciate the increased transparency. We always want more, though. And based on our math, it seems that most of the miss in North America was EpiPen. And if you could, just confirm that that was the case. Based on triangulating your numbers, it seems that EpiPen came in at around $123 million, which was well below what we were thinking. And I'm just wondering if that's related to the recall. Is that the new level of sales that we should expect? Will that continue to erode? Help us to think about that.","And secondly in terms of your revenue guide, which I don't know that I heard you reiterate \u2013 if you do want to, this is a good opportunity. If not, that says something too. But to hit the low end of your revenue guide would seem to require about $350 million in the new product sales. I think you had talked about $850 million in new product sales at your Analyst Day. So obviously, some things work; some things don't work. But if you could comment on that math, I would appreciate it. Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","All right. Jami, I first have to jump in and just say thank you for the acknowledgment on transparency. As we said, many of us have had many discussions. And we told you, I personally said that, look, I want to continue to try to give the right visibility into this business. That's what we're here to do. We've got a lot of moving pieces and parts. We're trying to be reflective of how we're running and driving this business, which is completely leveraging all of these channels from generic brands and branded generics and OTCs and how we're leveraging those in country. So I really appreciate your recognition of that, and we're going to continue to do so.","And the one thing I'll just say on EpiPen and then I'll let Ken get into some of the financials is that, as we said on Investor Day, Jami, we anticipated a big change in EpiPen, and we knew that it would continue to be a mix between the AG and the brand and we continue to see that conversion. But the reality is people had a very strong loyalty to the brand EpiPen and it's continued to be an education to let them know that it's the same product. But what I will say about EpiPen, it's what we expected, and obviously that continues to be into the guidance that we reiterated this morning.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","I'll also say thank you for the comment because we are truly the way we put the release together and including providing you a number for North America excluding EpiPen, we'll still allow you to have that visibility into what's going on with the EpiPen product. With that number, you've done the math, you can model it, you're right in the ballpark.","As far as projecting out the year, we don't give any quarterly kind of run rate on EpiPen. But as Heather said, what happened in the quarter was very consistent with what we expected. The recall did occur. We've disclosed both in the Q and in our commentary that the costs of the recall are recoverable. That has driven a little bit of change in trend and some of the sales number, but nothing of significance.","But to reiterate, we said at Investor Day that year-over-year EpiPen profitability at the operating profit level will be down $400 million year over year, a huge number. $500 million at the gross profit level, offset by some reduction in spending in sales and marketing. And that's exactly where we're moving through right now. So, you've done the math, you're right in the right ballpark, and everything is exactly how we expected it.","As far as new products, we said we'd have $850 million of contribution this year year-over-year for new products. And at this point in time, we're working towards that roadmap. It's a long list of products. And whether it would be at the low end, the mid, we're generating those new product launches in order to drive to $850 million.","Operator","And our next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, team. In the interest of transparency, have you thought about giving an EPS target for next year that does not include the help of capital deployments?","And then for Rajiv, two quick ones, one on Advair. Your comments seem to suggest you're not confident that your data would fit with the draft guidance. Maybe I misread that. But could you state how you feel about the draft guidance as a potential stumbling block? And on biosimilar Lantus or glargine, can you talk about the legal and regulatory steps between now and launch? I believe there's a stay at a minimum. Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","All right, Gregg. Thanks. I'll start and then I'll let Rajiv take on the products. I guess Gregg, what I would say, I am not sure how somebody gives guidance without talking about capital deployment, whether that's in business development opportunities. I think we were very clear and transparent on Investor Day of what we said of our assumptions leading to that $6 target that we continue to walk through over the last five years. And that deployment of cash while maintaining our balance sheet being able to bolt-on important product acquisitions, as we've done already this year and we'll continue to do so. So, look, we continue to be executing towards the roadmap that we laid out in March and we'll continue to update as appropriately. But what we laid out on Investor Day is what we're executing against.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Yeah, Gregg, on Advair, I mean, there is nothing in my voice you should hear that we don't feel comfortable about interpreting our data to the new guidance, but we have a difference of opinion at a policy level that agency is applying a draft guidance as against a pre-approved or pre-agreed protocol. So that's what we're trying to discuss and negotiate with them because it all adds to the timing and the classification of the CRL.","Second, on Lantus, we are very much on track and you should expect to hear from us anytime now about our regulatory filing in USA.","Operator","And our next question comes from Douglas Tsao from Barclays. Your line is open.","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So just, Rajiv, not to sort of beat a dead horse, but just following up on Advair again. Maybe if you could just walk through what the sort of the next steps are for you providing some \u2013 or providing the Street some clarity in terms of the roadmap forward and resolving the sort of difference of opinion? And would you pursue or think about pursuing sort of like dispute resolution within the agency?","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","It's too early for us. We have sought a meeting and we have been told that FDA is working on to grant us a meeting, or very soon we'll hear from them. And I don't want to comment anything beyond that. We should be able to be in a good position to talk about it once we have this meeting behind us.","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just in terms of the warning letter at the Nashik plant, I believe that was primarily antiretrovirals. Just curious if it was limited to that. And has the warning letter had any impact on potential approvals converting to final that you might have had tentatives on? Thank you.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Nashik is not limited to antiretrovirals. Nashik is a global site and does produce some U.S. products and some of the U.S. launches will be potentially impacted by that. But as I confirmed, they are not material to our overall Mylan's business.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tim Chiang from BTIG. Your line is open.","Tim Chiang - BTIG LLC","Hi, Rajiv. Just one last follow-up question on Advair. In assuming that you go down the pathway with the FDA and you still have this disagreement on the draft guidance, would you guys consider still trying to launch your product, but launch it without an AB rating, just go as a 505(b)(2) or launch it as a branded generic?","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","No. There's no discussion in this complete response letter or a point being made about this being not 505(j) or being about 505(b)(2). And we don't see because it is exactly \u2013 the product is exactly as per the guidance issue by the FDA. It has been accepted as 505(j). So I don't want to even think and comment about that because it's not real. So I don't want to speculate on that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Heather, I have a few, if I may. Heather, you mentioned acquisitions are exceeding expectations and I wanted to clarify, was that a comment directed at Meda, Renaissance or also at the Abbott EPD.","Ken, perhaps, a quick clarification on your end. I know you're reiterating EPS guidance. Are you also reiterating revenue guidance? Just wanted to confirm that.","And then, Rajiv, we noticed Vytorin and Seroquel XR approvals for some of your competitors, but haven't seen that press release from you guys yet. So I just wanted to understand what the cause for the delay was or is there anything at any specific facility we should be aware of? And I just wanted to stop there.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Okay, all right. Hi, Umer. I would say we exceeded on all fronts. When we acquired the Abbott EPD business, they were showing kind of a trajectory of a flat to declining business and we said, it's not about what the business is doing on a standalone, but what we believe we can do with that business. And I think we were able to show last year that we turned that to a flat to increasing in business.","And then as we look at bringing on Meda and Renaissance, we continue to see our ability to leverage now the infrastructure around these countries that are allowing us to maximize the products that each of these acquisitions brought us, the Mylan legacy, the Abbott, as well as now with Meda. And so we continue to see our ability to get more out of that asset than they were doing on a standalone basis in conjunction with our existing businesses.","So, yeah, we couldn't be more pleased and I think we will continue to bear fruit, the results in our really integrating Mylan and leveraging this platform will continue to show in our results.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","And, Umer, thank you for the question. I actually should have answered it because it was in Jami's queue of questions a little bit earlier. Yes, the componentry of the revenue guidance we're reaffirming as well.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","And, Umer, Vytorin launch has been impacted by the Nashik warning letter.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Hi, Heather and team. I have three questions, please. The first is, with respect to the U.S. price decline commentary, could you just educate us on how you calculate that? I know that Teva I think at one point was excluding price declines associated with competition after first-to-file products face competition, for example. And also I've heard that some generic companies exclude it when they have to discontinue a product due to price decline, they exclude that from their price calculation. So, if you could just educate us on how you calculate U.S. price declines, that would be helpful.","Second, with respect to Biocon, could you please review the economics, how Mylan books revenue and profits associated with Biocon products? And I'm guessing that may differ by geography.","And then, finally, you disclosed global Meda and Renaissance revenue of $606 million. Now last year, we had run rates, and I thought these were provided by the company, or I'm not sure where we got these from, but we had a total revenue run rate of about $650 million from the two. That was $555 million from Meda and $95 million from Renaissance. So just wanted to see if indeed those numbers are accurate and the business has decreased maybe due to divestitures. Any more color on that would be helpful. Thank you.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Okay, David. I'll maybe take some at a high level and then others can chime in. I'll start with the acquisitions.","Look, as we've done for this quarter and we will do this year is break out acquisitions and that contribution. I think I'm not sure where your numbers are \u2013 if those are old numbers, but what I will tell you, again, it's what we're doing with the asset in combination. So while we're breaking out for one year post-acquisitions to give that visibility on our legacy business to try to start now dissecting between the acquisitions, I don't think would be useful because it's really what we're being able to drive out of this asset in totality that is driving the results that you're seeing.","As far as Biocon, I don't believe we've given the contractual relationship. What I can tell you, obviously, we have a very important partnership with Biocon and continue to be very happy with the performance both in the products that are already approved in marketing and those that are in the pipeline. So that continues to be a very important partnership.","And as far as price decline, I think, Tony laid it out. I don't know if there is any other visibility. But I think that's why we try to give the dynamics around the fact that \u2013 where you have a first-to-market opportunity and you're the only player in the market and then there's five or six players in the market overnight, that certainly can drive a little bit of anomaly and volatility as you look at a year or comparisons year over year, which is the point we were trying to make. However, all products in and looking at everything across our globe, we're still saying our generic price erosion is in mid-single digits without excluding anything.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","Heather, I think you said it very well. David, our U.S. price erosion methodology really is about like-to-like from a year-over-year perspective. And the one thing we were noting, yes, we feel very strongly about mid-single digits globally. And in the U.S. in 2016, we had several meaningful first-to-market launches that certainly don't have the same valuation in the corresponding period for 2017. So we wanted to note what that base business corrosion would be without those in it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS. Your line is open.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about Europe a little bit and just describe the trends that you're seeing there. Have there been any major changes in any of the key markets that you're in. And maybe you can also talk about changes from a government perspective, pricing perspective, any major stuff. And then if you could, just talk about your performance in some of your key markets. Thank you.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","So I'll just start. I would say that, Marc, this is one of the areas where I think you really see the strategic acquisitions really paying dividends. When you look at the Mylan legacy business now with Abbott and Meda and those assets both from a geographical portfolio perspective that we've been able to pull together, and as I mentioned in my commentary, really gives us the unique go-to-market in these country strategies. You have seen us continue to bolster our number one position in France, and I would say Italy is closing in on and we currently are number one in Italy. So you've seen us really strengthen the strong positions we've had.","And in addition to that, some of these up and coming markets that Meda brought us to really bring critical mass where we see nothing but opportunity from places like UK and some of these areas where now we have a very robust product portfolio and a really strong sales infrastructure to maximize. So I don't know, Tony and Rajiv, any other countries, but I just couldn't be more pleased myself with what these assets coming together and what our team has been able to yield.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","And I think that one of the questions was do we see any more government instituted price cuts and all that. No, Marc, we don't see at this time what we saw a few years back. And this Meda acquisition and Abbott acquisition has so well positioned us to leverage anything we drop in and add on to that platform now.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV","And maybe just to close, we do feel very good about the growth we've seen in our leadership markets in France and Italy as well, as some of the up and coming, like Heather said, UK, Germany, Poland, and Nordics, all of them did well.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I've got three. First one staying around with the same of Europe, can you just describe the natural seasonality of revenue and operating profit from that region? There clearly is some significant one with lower contribution in the first quarter. Just help us figure out what the gross margin will be throughout the year.","Second, we've noticed a decline if you look at IMS in just your total generic volume. I guess both sequentially and year over year about 5%. Can you talk a little bit about when you decide it's about time to stop selling particular products? Is it something we should expect a strategic direction the company is taking to walk away from unprofitable business?","And then last, obviously one of the things we're trying to do always is cross over between the previous quarter and this quarter. Can you help us understand a little bit the contribution decline from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the one quarter of 2017 of the new product launch in the fourth quarter, just so we have an ability to separate the baseline from differentiated products?","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Okay. So, Ronny, let me try. I'm not sure I quite understand your seasonality of the first question. You look at our global business today, over half of which is coming from outside of the United States, and the fact that we've got over 2,000 products on the market, there's not a real seasonality. With that being said, I think Ken at Investor Day laid out what we saw corresponding quarters and proportionality from 2016 to 2017 that would help for modeling purposes if you look at the percentage of the businesses.","So again, I think what we couldn't be more excited about is the resiliency of this platform and the fact that the seasonality for any product or given market, we're able to now really absorb that and show this contribution continuing to grow in a meaningful way and not being so much subjected to seasonality.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","And so if you think about that, because I know what you're trying to get to, which is as we move through the year, how do you look at gross margins. What we told you about the first quarter was gross margins were down 60 basis points year over year, and that is consistent with what we projected and gave you an outlook for, for the full year. So even though seasonality may move around a bit, and you've followed us long enough to know that the second half is a bigger half than the first half is, we don't see a significant amount of variation in that. We saw in the first quarter what we have an outlook for, for the year.","Specifically, as far as new product introductions, new product launches this year we indicated would be heavier obviously in the second half. Last year, I would say if you're looking at fourth quarter to first quarter, not significantly different because they were lighter new product launch quarters.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","And just on your point about unprofitable business, I would say, I try to state in my opening remarks, we've had a long history of being committed to a very broad portfolio. And as we've said, we have over \u2013 just even here in the United States over 630 products at an average selling base of $0.25. So there's a lot that goes into that mix. And we've continued to be committed to mean the most to our customers, and we'll continue to look at that. But I will tell you that meaning the most to our customers and having a robust portfolio is important. But that's not to say that we don't evaluate. And if something doesn't make sense at a certain period of time, certainly I think by the sheer number of what we've got in the market, it should suggest that we're very committed to continuing to offer a broad range of products.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Finkelstein from Susquehanna Financial Group. Your line is open.","Andrew Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could talk a bit more about in terms of pricing how the relationship is evolving with the large customers. You talked about the importance of the differentiation of your scale. But does that mean a different conversation than some of the smaller players have? One of your competitors this morning talked about the consortiums coming around to understanding the need to support as partners, companies that are in generics for the long term. So does that play into your pricing expectations and also what tends to be a more back-half weighted U.S. generics revenue figure?","And then secondly on business development. You talked about at the Investor Day having a number of potential opportunities this year. Can you comment at all just about how the environment is evolving and how you think about valuing assets and being able to forecast the prospects for these assets or companies in an environment of some uncertainty? Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Andrew, thank you. And thank you for your questions. I think what we've continued to say and what we continue to see is it absolutely is driving a different conversation. And as the external environment has been in, I'll call it, chaos and we've seen these cycles before over the last couple of decades that it really provides an opportunity for people to really do work about a company, their portfolio, their platform and that all generic companies aren't created equally, all branded companies aren't created equally, and all hybrid companies aren't created equally. And I think what we've continued to show is that the assets that we've pulled together on a global basis have allowed us to drive not only a different conversation but a reliable supply chain. Our commitment to generics over the past 55 years and certainly the investment we've made in important complex generics, like generic Advair and our biosimilars, was one of the largest pipelines in the industry.","So not only do our customers see us as valuable to be able to have a global partnership, but certainly our pipeline drives much of that conversation and relationship and the importance that we are to each other. So I absolutely can't underscore enough that how the platform and our differentiation is absolutely allowing us to have very different conversations than if we were just in one country with a niche portfolio.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","And, Andrew, regarding business development, we are executing to the plan, which we shared with you on our Investor Day. We have a very exciting and active and rich pipeline, which we are trying to close certain deals and bring products home. So we see many tuck-in opportunities out there.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much. Just a couple of questions here. Just circling back to Advair, would you be able to make the low end of your 2017 EPS guidance range in the event that Advair was delayed out to 2018? I know you usually don't comment on specific products, but just given the focus on this one, I think that would be helpful.","My second question also on Advair, if your dialogue with FDA is unsuccessful, can you just give us some rough timelines on how we should think about a generic Advair approval? Is mid 2018 a reasonable timeframe to think about it, if you are unsuccessful?","And my final question was actually shifting gears to biosimilars and biosimilar Neulasta in the U.S., it seems like a large and very attractive market. Is that something that could be a contributor for you in 2018 or are there still IP hurdles we need to think about there, assuming you're approved later this year? Thanks so much.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","All right. Thank you, Chris. And I'll start. This is \u2013 yes, our EPS guidance range that we've reiterated this morning and I put in my commentary is not dependent on approval of any one product, to your point. Approvals are important \u2013 are an important part of our business and we have a lot of moving pieces and parts in our guidance. So I wanted to certainly point out, it's not \u2013 that range is not reliant on any one approval. So I think that's the point of having the range and thus being able to come out and reiterate that we're committed to this guidance range.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","And, Chris, as I earlier mentioned, it will be prudent for us to wait for this dialogue before we comment on the potential impact on any timing our Advair launch.","And with regarding your question on Neulasta, you can expect us to have this product end of \u2013 towards the end of 2018 or early 2019.","Operator","And at this time, I'm showing no further questions.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","All right.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Thank you.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Thank you, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Melissa Trombetta, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Melissa Trombetta - Mylan NV","Thank you, Terence. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Mylan's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President Rajiv Malik; Chief Commercial Officer Tony Mauro; and Chief Financial Officer Ken Parks.","During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial outlook and 2017 guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from today's projections. Please refer to the earnings release we furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K earlier this morning as well as our supplemental earnings slides, both of which are also posted on our website at investor.mylan.com, for a fuller explanation of those risks and uncertainties and the limits applicable to forward-looking statements.","In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We will refer to these measures as adjusted and present them in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measures as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to those GAAP measures are available in our second quarter earnings release.","Let me also remind you that the information discussed during this call with the exception of the participants' questions is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's express written permission. An archived copy of today's call will be available on our website and will remain available for a limited time.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Heather.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call.","To say that times are changing would be an understatement. However, as history shows, it's during times like these that industries and companies transform themselves. The generic as well as the entire healthcare industry is now at an inflection point, and every company's intersection with this point is unique.","Our transformation from a domestic company started a decade ago when we committed to a strategy of globalization, diversification, and scale. As important as developing our strategy is how we have consistently executed against it and further derisked our platform. We have been very purposeful on the types of acquisitions we do, and we are very disciplined about integrating them.","We undertook this strategy because of the volatility inherent in any geographic or product-centric model. Since 2007, this strategy has allowed us to overcome periods of intense competition, consolidation, unpredictable regulatory environments, and geographic economic fluctuations around the world.","At times, this may have seemed like the road less traveled. But given the industry environment today, I believe the path we chose and our patience and commitment to deliver over the long term is paying off, given our guidance and especially our outlook in the face of the significant headwinds in the US market. In fact, there has never been a better time to recognize how unique our intersection with the industry is.","We have built a global pharmaceutical company that is a leader in each of our geographical regions and which no longer resembles the companies that are focused solely on running just generic and\/or specialty pharmaceutical businesses. This is precisely why we introduced new geographical reporting segments at the end of last year. In doing so, we're providing investors with visibility into how we are running and driving our business and at current valuations believe we are also distinguishing Mylan's differentiated platform as an opportunity, creating yet another new entry point for investors to come into our security.","Our second quarter performance is a testament to the importance of diversity and building for the long term. We generated total revenues of close to $3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase, that was driven by growth in our Europe and Rest of World segments, which now account for more than 50% of Mylan's overall revenues. On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted net earnings of $590 million or adjusted EPS of $1.10, down 5% compared to the same period in 2016.","While Europe and Rest of World grew significantly, as expected, our North America segment was down considerably year over year due to delayed launches on EpiPen. We expect these dynamics to continue for some time and for approval delays to persist this year, as the FDA continues to reorganize and adapt its processes and priorities.","As we look ahead to the rest of 2017, we continue to have great confidence in our underlying business in every region. However, given this unpredictability and an abundance of caution, we have removed Copaxone and Advair from our 2017 financial guidance and have simply deferred them to 2018.","As a result of rebasing our North America business, we now expect to deliver total revenues this year of between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion and adjusted EPS of between $4.30 and $4.70. Our outlook for Europe and Rest of World remains essentially in line with our previously stated expectations. And similarly, we expect no further adjustments to what we already have laid out with respect to EpiPen.","I note as well that given our broad diversification and ability to matter more to customers, our outlook reflects global generic pricing erosion in the mid-single digits, which now takes into account high single-digit erosion in North America generics.","Turning to 2018, we're moving our targeted adjusted EPS to at least $5.40 for the year, revised from $6.00. This new target represents 20% growth over 2017 based on the midpoint of our revised range. It incorporates a rebasing of the impact of deferred key US launches and their associated contributions to profitability, AB generic competition to EpiPen, further optimization of our commercial and operational platforms, and capital deployment as we utilize our financial flexibility.","So yes, this was a tough quarter, and it will be a challenging year due to the volatility and uncertainty in the US, the world's largest pharmaceutical market, but we haven't in the past and still are not managing this company quarter to quarter. We're managing it for the long term. And that's why today we've been able to maintain our business while continuing to invest and build for sustainable growth.","Further, as CEO, I can assure you that given our depressed share price, I'm very focused on continuing to engage and educate investors about the true value of Mylan's unique and highly differentiated platform. Indeed, when we step back and look at our business holistically, we find ourselves more confident and optimistic than ever about Mylan's prospects. We have a product portfolio and pipeline that is exceptionally deep and broad, covering numerous important therapeutic franchises, including medicines for which demand is very strong and growing rapidly, such as respiratory products and biosimilars. A great example of the latter is our proposed biosimilar for trastuzumab, which recently received a unanimous vote recommending approval from FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee.","As impressive is the sheer scale and scope of our operational and commercial infrastructure, which positions us to truly expand the world's access to high-quality products and meet the needs of the industry's dynamic and rapidly consolidating customer base. We also continue to have financial flexibility given our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation.","In addition, unlike many of our peers, we have a very stable and perhaps one of the most experienced leadership teams in this industry. We believe its continuity reflects the soundness of our strategy, our unwavering focus on building for the long term, and the resilience of our culture. For all of these reasons, we believe that Mylan's best years lie ahead, which is particularly meaningful given the 25% CAGR in adjusted EPS that we delivered between 2008 and 2016.","For making this opportunity possible and for our second quarter performance, I'd like on behalf of Mylan's board and entire leadership team to thank our employees around the world for their outstanding teamwork and execution and for their continued commitment to delivering better health for a better world.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone.","Before I begin, I too would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and continued unwavering focus on our mission and business objectives despite the challenges that come our way.","Let's turn to the second quarter results. I'll provide an overview of our top line performance, and Ken will get into the segment profitability.","Overall, we delivered nearly $3 billion US in total revenues for the quarter, an increase of 16% compared to the prior year. As Heather noted, this performance is a result of the breadth, diversity, and resilience of our global integrated platform, which has given us the strength to manage the headwinds and ensure long-term sustainability.","This quarter, the headwinds came primarily from the US, where challenging market dynamics accelerated. However, our performance in our Europe and ROW segments delivered on our expectations. I'm especially pleased with the performance of our Meda and Topicals business acquisitions, which continue to meet and exceed our expectations in their contributions.","Let me provide some more detail on the challenging environment in North America, especially in the US, which resulted in third-party net sales declining by 9% to about $1.3 billion. I note that the region would have seen an increase of 4% if not for higher than anticipated negative impact from EpiPen Auto-Injector.","During the quarter, we saw increased competition resulting from FDA's focus on accelerating the approvals of third, fourth, or fifth generics. Unfortunately, we have not seen the same for the first generics nor for more complex and niche products, which we believe have been impacted by the recent ongoing reorganization within FDA. However, while the timing of realizing some of these opportunities may be delayed, our confidence in our ability to bring these products to market and maximize their potential has not changed.","To be prudent, we have taken contribution from the major product launches in US out of our guidance for 2017. That said, we continue to remain optimistic based on commentary by Commissioner [Scott] Gottlieb and other senior FDA officials that the FDA is committed to enhancing its capabilities and approval process for complex generics.","Another consistent pressure point in our industry is pricing. Here again, our approach of operating at global scale and diversity continues to help us manage these challenging conditions. While we will continue to see choppiness in pricing across individual markets, exemplified by increasing pressure in the US, the global generic pricing environment this quarter was again consistent with our expectations and previous guidance. However, given the environment in the USA, we have adjusted our expectations for price erosion in our global generics business to mid-single digits for the year. Tony will further elaborate on this topic.","Turning to Europe, sales totaled more than $950 million, a year-over-year increase of 59%. The increase was primarily the result of contributions from the Meda acquisition. In Rest of World, sales totaled approximately $690 million, a year-over-year increase of 29%. This increase was primarily driven by the Meda acquisition along with sales from new products and higher volumes from existing products, which more than offset lower pricing.","Shifting to integration, we continue to make good progress in the integration of Mylan, as evidenced by a 150 basis points decline year over year in our adjusted SG&A spend as a percentage of total revenues. In recognition of challenging environment we are operating in, we continue to identify additional cost synergies as well as revenue synergy opportunities that we expect to realize in 2017 \u2013 2018 timeframe.","Let me now talk about generic Copaxone and generic Advair. Regarding Copaxone, we are disappointed with the execution by FDA of this complex ANDA, as the administrative timeline continues to move despite a number of interactions as well as meeting all of the criteria as for the product-specific guidance issued by FDA. Having said that, we strongly believe in our science and have no pending scientific questions or any additional studies required at this time and are looking forward to this long-pending approval.","On generic Advair front, we very recently met with FDA with regards to the Complete Response Letter, which we received in late March. We were pleased with the highly constructive nature of our dialogue with the agency, and we were able to clarify and resolve a number of key points raised in the CRL. Based on this interaction, we can confirm that no further clinical or device-related studies are required, and we plan to submit our response to the CRL in the next couple of weeks.","We believe that the agency continues to consider this application as a high priority, and we continue to be ready for both a manufacturing as well as commercial perspective to launch upon approval. However, given the unpredictability of timing and in an abundance of caution, we have removed Copaxone and Advair from our 2017 financial guidance and have simply deferred them to 2018. Given all of this, we are very confident in our revised guidance for 2017.","With regards to our operating platform, we are in constructive dialogue with the FDA regarding the warning letter that our Nashik site in India received earlier this year. We are working closely with the agency to comprehensively resolve their two observations as expeditiously as possible. The site remains in good standing with other global regulatory entities, including WHO and MHRA. Unfortunately, the warning letter has delayed new US launches from this site.","We are pleased to have had the warning letter from Agila oncology site lifted during this quarter, joining SFF [Specialty Formulation Facility] and SPD [Sterile Product Division] in being cleared by the FDA. With this warning letter now lifted and new approvals from these sites accelerating, we see the opportunity to further support the unmet needs in the injectable space.","Turning now to some of our other pipeline programs, which will be key drivers of our future growth, starting with our biosimilar portfolio, we are very pleased with the progress of our programs from a development perspective. We received unanimous approval from FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee for our proposed biosimilar trastuzumab last month. This is a very important milestone, not just for this product, but also for our overall biosimilars program, and demonstrates the strength of our science in this complex area. We continue to execute on the review of our global submissions of trastuzumab and pegfilgrastim and working closely with our partner Biocon, and has the authority to address any outstanding issues.","In addition, our proposed biosimilar bevacizumab, also in partnership with Biocon, recently received approval from the Indian drug regulator. We look forward to bringing a more affordable alternative for metastatic colorectal cancer and lung cancer to patients in India and other Rest of World markets.","Our programs with Momenta are also are progressing well. We expect to report top line data for the Phase 1 study for our biosimilar Orencia candidate by the end of the year. We are also advancing the development of M710, the next biosimilar candidate that we and Momenta are developing as part of our collaboration, and plan on starting clinical studies in 2018. As a reminder, we have no material contributions from biosimilars in our guidance for 2017 or in our 2018 target.","With regards to our insulin glargine program, we presented data from the INSTRIDE study at the American Diabetes Association's scientific session in San Diego, which demonstrated the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of Mylan's insulin glargine in comparison to Lantus in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Our regulatory applications are in active review for Europe, Australia, and Canada. From the US commercial manufacturing strategy point of view, we have decided to include the manufacturing site variations from Bangalore to Malaysia up front in the application rather than as a post-approval change. We are meeting with the FDA very shortly to reach agreement regarding their expectation in this regard for the US filing.","Our revefenacin collaboration with Theravance Biopharma for COPD continues to deliver results at every step along the development path. We recently announced positive results from a 12-month Phase 3 safety study, which demonstrated that revefenacin was generally well tolerated and no new safety issues were identified. We now feel that we have all the data necessary to support a successful NDA filing later this year.","Turning to our infectious disease franchise, our ARV business has been further strengthened by the first approval from WHO for new ARV combinations, specifically TLE400 and a TLD, a triple combination with dolutegravir, which both have tentative approval by FDA under PEPFAR. We also recently received first approval from WHO Prequalification of Medicines Programme for our generic version of Gilead's Sovaldi, which will be available in developing countries.","As we said, the foundation of our business remains strong, and the rebased 2017 business provides opportunities for us going forward. Let me now provide you some backdrop to our revised adjusted EPS target of at least $5.40 in 2018, which represents 20% growth from 2017 based on the midpoint of our revised adjusted EPS range announced today.","In revising this target, we took into consideration the current headwinds we face in the USA, including increased competition on our base business, and have assumed that they will continue through 2018. We have also assumed that launches deferred from 2017 will happen in 2018. However, we have adjusted our expectations for the contribution from these new launches. This includes anticipated launches of generic Advair and generic Copaxone.","We have also taken into account the full impact of an anticipated launch of an AB substitutable generic to EpiPen. Further, we continue to identify additional cost savings opportunities from the continued rationalization and optimization of our platform above and beyond the targets communicated at Investor Day. We have recognized that the US industry outlook has changed substantially, and we are rapidly adapting our business to reflect these new market dynamics. That said, we see additional growth opportunities outside the USA as we successfully integrate our platform and operate as One Mylan in these geographies.","We also have maintained financial flexibility in order to ensure we can pursue additional business development opportunities as they arise. There are many assets becoming available, and we will be opportunistic and prudent in pursuing those that will be a right fit for our business, filling our product or geographic gaps. With the commercial footprint we have in place, there are great opportunities to drop in the right (23:44) products and get more out of them as part of One Mylan.","In summary, as a result of the platform, portfolio, and pipeline, we have built and have proven the capability to execute. Mylan remains extremely well positioned to meet the needs of customers and patients around the world. Our industry can be a challenging one, but we are built to overcome and weather these challenges like few other companies are, and we have more opportunities than ever before. As a result, I am very confident in our future.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on the commercial landscape. Thank you.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV","Thank you, Rajiv, and good morning, everyone.","I would like to reiterate the confidence you heard from Heather and Rajiv in the underlying strength of our businesses around the world, our proven ability to overcome adversity in our business environment, and the many opportunities we have for continued commercial leadership and sustainable growth.","I would now like to provide a framework for the management and commercial execution around our business from a geographic segment perspective, selling our broad portfolio across all channels in a holistic manner as One Mylan as we focus on being a partner of choice to our customers.","We will start with our strong performance in Europe, which demonstrates what we've been able to build in this region over the past several years through continued and consistent execution and effective integration of the entire Mylan platform, most recently the Meda acquisition.","As a result of the focus on execution, Europe now makes up more than 30% of our total revenues. We have been able to successfully maintain and expand upon our leadership positions in countries like France, Italy, and Portugal, while capitalizing on meaningful growth opportunities in the UK, Germany, and Spain.","Our European business is also diversified across channels, with strong positions across brands, generics, and now OTC, where we have an established presence from the Meda acquisition. We are encouraged by the growth potential of our brands in the region, such as Dymista, Creon, Influvac, Brufen, and Betadine, and we are also excited about our strong future pipeline.","Our Rest of World segment continues to show double-digit revenue growth and now makes up more than 20% of our total revenues. While our ARV business continues to perform strongly, we are very pleased that the integrated platform we have built in key geographic markets is also yielding benefits. For instance, we saw strong performance of 20%-plus revenue growth in Australia, a market where we have successfully integrated our platform and are now selling across all channels.","We continue to be the market leader in New Zealand and have experienced growth in Japan. Today, we are one of the top five generic companies in Japan, and we continue to seek ways to optimize our assets and develop new partnerships in this market. We also have high expectations for growth opportunities for many of our products in key emerging markets such as China and Russia.","Further, we are excited about the integration of Meda products around the region. We see key brands such as Dona, Elavil, and ArmoLIPID being additional growth opportunities for us.","Moving to our business in North America, which now represents less than 50% of our total revenues, we have built a comprehensive business in this region, focusing on generic retail, institutional, branded, and a small but fast-growing OTC business. As in our other regions, we are selling our portfolio across this entire platform as One Mylan.","As Rajiv discussed, we have had a challenging quarter in North America, with pressures arising from both accelerated new approvals on our existing generic products and continued consolidation of our US customer base. Specifically, contributions from new product launches in the US was one of the lowest in recent history. At the same time, we are seeing increased competitive pressure on our existing products, as FDA focuses on bringing more competition to already genericized products through accelerated approvals. As noted in industry reports, in Q2 we saw a much higher number of approvals for competitors on our existing base business than we've seen historically or anticipated.","While these dynamics have continued to put pressure on pricing in the region, overall price erosion in our North American generics business remained in the mid-single digits for the quarter, in line with our expectations and global trends. However, as we noted last quarter, we expect fluctuations in the pricing environment in the third and fourth quarter due to having several meaningful first-to-market products that launched in 2016 come off of their exclusivity periods as well as accelerated competition on our base business.","As a result of these factors, we expect to see full-year price erosion for our North American generics business in the high single digits. We were able to offset some of this choppiness through our global diversity, with several bright spots in the US and elsewhere, which is why our global generics price erosion for the quarter and expectations for the year are mid-single digits.","Turning to EpiPen, the decline in this product was more than forecasted, primarily due to increased competition and the impact of the launch of the authorized generic. We now represent more than 70% of the total epinephrine auto-injector market through our branded and authorized generic products. While the competition in this market remains robust, our customers and patients continue to value this product.","Despite the many challenges this quarter, we firmly believe that our underlying business in North America is solid and that our scale and breadth will serve us well for the long term and continue to differentiate us.","As the industry transforms, like it has many times over the last 20 years, and customers consolidation continues, success in this region will be defined by those who offer the most robust and diverse product offerings across channels, deliver industry-leading customer service levels, and commit to investing in complex new products with longer opportunity horizons. Those attributes define Mylan.","While we always will see fluctuations on a quarter-by-quarter basis in relation to specific products in individual markets, and sometimes these fluctuations may be dramatic, over the long-term horizon we believe we can deliver consistent and sustainable growth by focusing on supply, diversification, and new product introductions. In fact, I feel like we are just getting started on maximizing our powerful commercial platform, and I continue to be very excited about the commercial opportunities we see in each of our regions.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone.","Turning to our financial results and summary, in Q2 we delivered total revenues of approximately $3 billion. That's an increase of 16% over the same period last year. This increase included growth in third-party net sales in both our European and Rest of World segments, which were up 59% and 29% respectively. The growth in both segments was largely driven by contributions from our acquisitions last year of Meda and the Renaissance Topicals business. Acquisitions also contributed to our North America segment more than $150 million, which helped to mitigate some of the impact associated with the decline in our EpiPen business along with mid-single-digit generic price erosion that Tony just spoke about.","As a result of these headwinds, our North American segment third-party net sales declined 9% year over year. And excluding the decline in EpiPen, North America was up 4%, demonstrating the strength of our portfolio and our ability to absorb the ongoing challenging dynamics in the US.","On a consolidated basis, we reported adjusted gross margins of approximately 54% in the current quarter compared to approximately 56% in the same period last year. The decline is the result of lower gross profit from the sales of existing products in North America, including EpiPen, partially mitigated by contributions from last year's acquisitions.","Moving on to our operating expenses, on an adjusted basis, R&D was approximately 6% of total revenues or $171 million, which was in line with the prior year, including the incremental impact from acquisitions. Adjusted SG&A increased to $583 million, primarily due to integrating the acquired businesses. However, I'll point out that adjusted SG&A as a percentage of total revenues declined 150 basis points to less than 20%, driven by increased revenues from the acquired businesses along with benefits of Mylan integration.","Moving to profitability, in Q2 adjusted earnings from operations was up approximately 15% when compared to the prior year. Similar to total revenue, this strong performance was largely due to increases in the European and Rest of World segments, partially offset by declines in North America associated with the impact of EpiPen and the US market dynamics discussed. Europe segment profitability was up 114% and Rest of World segment profitability was up 197%, both reflecting contributions from the Meda acquisition as well as new product sales.","Adjusted EPS was $1.10, which was down 5% when compared to the second quarter of last year. The decline was due to a higher adjusted effective tax rate reflecting the impact of key product launch delays. In addition, our adjusted net earnings were also impacted by higher interest expense and share count when compared to the prior year resulting from the acquisition of Meda.","Briefly turning to our results for the six months ended June 30, total revenues increased 20% to $5.7 billion. That includes acquisition contributions of approximately $1.2 billion. In addition, our adjusted net earnings for the six months ended June 30 increased $111 million to $1.1 billion, and adjusted EPS increased 6% to $2.03.","Now turning to cash flow and liquidity, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was very strong at $664 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. That compares to $485 million for the prior year. The increase in the current quarter is driven by favorable working capital performance. I'll note that on a year-to-date basis, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion compared to $687 million for the prior year.","For the full year, even with our new adjusted EPS guidance range, we still expect to deliver on our initial cash flow guidance. In 2017, we said we expect to generate $2 billion to $2.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow net of $400 million to $500 million of capital expenditures. Our ability to generate strong cash flows continues to support the strength of our balance sheet and provide financial flexibility to invest in the future of our business.","Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio for the 12 months ended June 30, 2017 was approximately 3.8 times, and that's in line with the level at the end of 2016. While we continue to execute on our commitment to deleverage, as evidenced by a voluntary debt prepayment of more than $800 million in the first half of the year, we expect our leverage ratio at the end of the year will be higher than we had initially indicated. As a result of our revised EBITDA guidance, we now forecast our year-end debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio to be closer to 3.7 times. We remain fully committed to our deleveraging strategy, to compliance with our covenant requirements, to our long-term average debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio target of approximately 3 times, and most importantly, to our investment-grade credit rating.","In our earnings materials this morning, you saw a comprehensive table detailing our revised 2017 guidance ranges. Before I conclude my remarks, I'd like to comment briefly on a few items in that table. As you heard earlier, as a result of the impact from delayed approvals by the FDA for complex products, including generic Advair and generic Copaxone, as well as the impact from the accelerating competitive US market dynamic, including further price erosion in the US, we've revised our full-year 2017 guidance ranges. We're lowering our previous total revenue guidance range of $12.25 billion to $13.75 billion of revenues to our current range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, which now represents an increase of 8% at the midpoint versus full-year 2016.","As a result of the lower top line expectations along with the dilutive impact it will have on our adjusted gross margins and effective tax rate and despite incremental cost saving actions, we've also revised our adjusted EPS guidance down from the previous range of $5.15 to $5.55 per share to our new range of between $4.30 to $4.70 per share. That's a decrease of 8% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year.","As both Heather and Rajiv have already noted this morning, we're targeting at least $5.40 in adjusted EPS in 2018. We'll continue to work through our planning process and will provide further updates as we get closer to setting our official 2018 guidance.","With that, we'll now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Just, Heather, maybe you and others on the phone can comment on just overall operating margin. Clearly, we're all in a new environment. It's a tough environment for all of these companies, but this is also an industry that has maintained roughly 30% operating margins over a long period of time with improvements year on year. Now we're entering in a period where we're seeing margin degradation. Where are we in the cycle of things? In other words, how much lower can margins go? And on the other hand, can they get back to where they were before? It seems to me that it's all entirely dependent on new product launches. But assuming product launches don't occur, how much lower can those margins go?","And if I could just stick in another one, and it's related, Heather, can you just talk about how your scale gives you leverage over the consolidated customers? It seems that Teva has said that scale really hasn't helped them. And based on the new guidance for this year for Mylan, it would appear that scale may not be helping you either. So if you could address those two topics, I'd appreciate it. Thanks very much.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Sure. Thanks, Jami. So yes, I'll start off, and then anyone else who wants to jump in can. So I guess here's what I would say. I think this goes back fundamentally when you talk about the margins and what does this business look like going forward. I think again, if we just stick within the United States, the diversity of your product portfolio I think is incredibly important. And I think that as you hear us continue to talk about not only that diversification from institutional to retail to continuing to build upon our OTC footprint, that kind of diversity within a segment absolutely helps maintain the margins that you've been used to, and I think importantly to your comment, new product launches, when you think about complex new market formation and as we enter the biosimilar arena. So I do believe that those are going to be able to maintain the levels that you've been used to.","Now with that being said, I think we're at a moment in time with the FDA that it's those launches that have continued to have some delay in timing, but they will come. And I think it's companies who have been able to invest, and we continue to maintain that investment in R&D and bring those important products to market, is what will continue to differentiate companies that are able to maintain I think those margins that this industry has been used to for some time. But I don't think \u2013 as always, one size doesn't fit all, and I don't think everybody is going to be able to maintain that. And I think having the levers to manage and maintain your portfolio to account for that is going to be very important.","I think as far as scale goes, again, I think you have to differentiate scale. I think that as you referenced Teva, where they really doubled down on scale in the last few years was in the United States. And I would say that as we see this market changing dramatically and transforming itself that perhaps more of the same in this market isn't going to get you very much. And I think that we've been pretty vocal and consistent about that over the last couple of years.","When you think about scale building, scale over the global platform, as you look at Mylan today with over 50% of our revenues coming outside of the United States and us really doubling down over the last few years about building not only Europe\/Rest of World, but our global supply chain, our vertical integration, it's that sustainability and differentiation that I absolutely believe will continue to pay off.","Yes, are there challenges in this US market, which is the largest pharmaceutical market in the world? Absolutely, and we're not running away from that. What we're saying is Mylan's ability to withstand those challenges and I think come out stronger in this US market is definitely what we're confident in. but it's our global scale across these regions both from an operation and a commercial perspective which I think is what we'll continue to be able to differentiate ourselves. And as I said, I can assure you I'm committed as CEO to get out there and make sure we're engaged and educating that investors really have the opportunity to understand our opportunities outside the US as well as those that are coming with the all the pipeline products that Rajiv spoke about.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I'll try to sneak two if I could. They are factual, so it's going to be easy. First, I completely hear you about delaying the large launches to 2018. But are there still response points from the FDA on both Copaxone and Neulasta this year? Your partner suggested there are. I just want to see where they are and why.","And second, thank you for breaking down the revenue by region. Can you give us a feel for the profitability division by region? If you look at your US business in terms of gross profits or operating profit, what percentage of the business is it today, just to give us a feel? Thanks.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Okay, Ronny, I'll take your question on Copaxone. And as I talked about, having met all the possible \u2013 in this case we have specific product guidance out which we have delivered from the sameness perspective. And I've cited out administrative delays, and it's truly there's no science we are dealing with anymore. There are not any pending studies which FDA has asked from us or something like that. So it's perplexing because somewhere this whole reorganization within FDA that's coming into play, and we see this playing on complex and niche products, which are in this bracket. Having said that, as I told you, we remain very confident. We see no issue of bringing it to market, and it's a timing issue and that's what we are trying to adjust.","On Neulasta, we continue to work with the FDA. We continue to work on the science as well as on the GMP front. And as you know, we have not factored in any revenues even in 2018 in any meaningful way from biosimilars. But if there is one upside which I can see from biosimilars and where how the competitive landscape is lining up between other different players who are ahead of us, Neulasta might be the one. But we'll give you more visibility as we go along.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks, Rajiv.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","And, Ronny, on segment profitability, one of the things that we have included and put out on our web as we released the press release this morning are a few additional earnings and financial-related slides, and one of those slides will break those numbers out for you. We actually show segment not only sales, but profitability.","But just to highlight the numbers, the North America segment is continuing to run at about 50% segment profitability level, while the expansion in profitability in both the European and Rest of World segments shows that Europe is running now north of 25% profitability, and you know the numbers a few years ago were significantly lower than that. And in Rest of World for the quarter, it was about 33% segment profitability, so expansion in that segment nicely as well. But that data is out there available for you if you just click on the website and download those slides.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Elliot Wilbur from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. I have a simple straightforward question, but probably not really a simple straightforward set of answers to it. For Heather and the team, I guess if we think about the adjustment to your profitability expectations this year, just simply EPS, could you just maybe give us a little bit of insight or just rank order? Of all the factors that we've talked about, accelerating pricing pressure and the ongoing impact of the evolution of the consortiums and the rebidding process or the push-out in new product launch expectations, is there any one factor that stands out much more than the others in terms of leading to the revision in your expectation?","I'm just trying to figure out where the team was probably most surprised with respect to those dynamics, because I certainly think pushing out $500 million in product sales is quite a bit different in terms of the implications than suggesting there has been a $500 million permanent impairment on the base. So I was just hoping to get a little bit more insight into the different dynamics there. Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Thank you, Elliot, and I think your observations are correct. I would say first and foremost, it's launches. When you look at on both fronts the continued delay on new complex key market or key product launches, and as we've said and I can't underscore this enough, we honestly see the administrative as the barrier and not the science. And I think we are, I can assure you, working diligently to daily be in contact with the FDA and work through these issues. And I'm highly optimistic that given even the new commissioner's recent commentary that this is a very important area, they recognize that getting these products to market are important.","But if you say the delay of those launches as well, if you look over the last two months, I think the acceleration is almost near double of approvals in these already commoditized generic products. So when you're bringing number three, four, five, six to the market, and approvals I think jumped up last month to over 90 approvals, all falling in that bucket, which is why we acknowledged that increased competition on the existing products and recognized and called out this high single-digit in North America or US generics.","I think both of those really were the primary driver. And to your point, the first one is the most important because this isn't a permanent hit, it's a deferred one. And that's why we did what we thought was the most prudent thing to do of pushing those into 2018. But I can tell you we're fighting every day to have them come as soon as they possibly can.","So after that, I think things like EpiPen, when you think of all of the different compounding factors that have culminated right now, I think that's finding its footing, and I think important to recognize that we're down to it's going to be less than 5% of this company's profit going forward. So I think it's definitely rebased itself and we see that final settling of where EpiPen is and what it means to us as a product. And I would say those are your two big factors.","And as we step back, because of that unpredictability, it's why we took the moves we did. And know that we pride ourselves on giving you guys that visibility and transparency as we see it. I think over the last year, we've talked about why there have been challenges in the industry. Mylan had been able to continue to absorb those challenges and that volatility. And when we get to a moment where we say you know what, the impact of both of those things moved pretty dramatically over these last couple of months, which is why we made the steps we did, but we couldn't be more confident in what we've put out there. And I think most importantly excited about still offering 20% year-over-year growth as we look into the target we put out there for next year. So, I don't know if anybody \u2013 okay, thank you for that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much, just a question on the challenges facing the North American market right now. What do you think we need to see for a more stable pricing environment? It seems like you're highlighting these accelerated FDA approval rates as destabilizing price. It doesn't seem like that's going to subside anytime soon. So should we be thinking about a high single-digit price erosion as something that's likely to continue for the foreseeable future?","And second quick question, which is on generic Advair, I believe you commented that you're going to be responding to the CRL over the next few weeks. I guess given that near-term refiling, can we assume that there weren't any issues as you reanalyzed your device studies against the FDA draft guidance I think was one of the requests that you talked about from FDA on last quarter's call? Thank you.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Thank you, Chris. I'll start off, and then I'll let Rajiv go into generic Advair. And just to follow up again, I missed this part on Elliot's last part of his question on consolidation and how that's factoring in. I think that we see this high single-digits as probably here for the foreseeable future, and we've accounted for that in everything that we've put out there both for this year and next year.","I would say that the consolidation, obviously, you continue to see, I think we're down really now to about three buying consortiums here in the United States. I do think importantly, we'll point out that they're also not just buying for the US. These are global now buyers coming together, and from our perspective, that being able to supply globally as well as having these important products come to market.","So while they're deferred, it doesn't take away their importance, speaking of generic Advair, which I think we still feel confident that even though deferred, we're going to be that first to bring this product to market. So I think that our ability to partner and leverage our global scale with these global buying consortiums, that we're best positioned to take our entire product portfolio across the globe and be one of the best partners out there.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Heather, I'll just add one line to what you said. It's one thing to have global scale, Chris, and it's managing the global scale. Our global integrated platform and our segments allow us to run this and manage this business globally.","Now coming back to Advair, I think I would like to take this opportunity to clarify and explain one of the remarks I made about how reorganization with FDA can impact it. Take Advair, generic Advair. It's been a nine-year long journey, and we had an intense collaboration with FDA till the submission of this ANDA. It saw many face-to-face meetings and agreement on several protocols. As the FDA transformed over the last two, three years and the emergence of OPQ [Office of Pharmaceutical Quality], and between OGD [Office of Generic Drugs] and OPQ, many new players have come in and many new drug guidance [ph] resources (55:05), even this year in the beginning of this year, which was on devices.","So there can be different opinions which can come at a point, and that's what led to this extensive CRL which we received. We took this opportunity \u2013 FDA took about four months to give us this meeting, but this was one good meeting to put everything on the table and come to a good spot and agree with the FDA that whatever we have provided them as per the product-specific guidance is good enough. We don't need any more data. We don't need any more clinical study or device-related studies. And that's what I meant from how sometimes reorganization of this transformation can impact some such, especially the complex and the first approvals. Having said that, we are in the process of consolidating this response, and this response will be out on its way to FDA within the next couple of days (56:04). And we continue to work with FDA for this high-priority product.","Operator","And our next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS. Your line is open.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, on Copaxone, I just want to make sure I understand. You had two dates back in June. After you missed the first date, there was still commentary that you thought you would get approval by the end of June for that one, and that didn't come, the second one didn't come. So I just want to try to understand. Are there new times now that we're waiting for that you could point us to? Are the issues for both dosages the same? You just expanded on Advair a little bit. Maybe you could expand on Copaxone.","And then secondly, can you talk about the ARV franchise? What was the growth rate in the quarter? What's the growth rate that you're going to see for the year? Just give us a sense of how big this franchise has been for you now. Thanks.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Yeah, on Copaxone, you are right about the target action date. But first of all, let me say that issues or questions, both 20-milligram and 40-milligram are the same. There is no different issue between 20-milligram and 40-milligram.","Second, why we didn't do \u2013 when I talked about the lack of predictability, yes, we have still a target action date, one target action date with us for mid- (57:20). And I didn't put it out there because we just need to get to a place with the FDA and have a better understanding rather than give you another date. And that's why, just through an abundance of caution, we have moved it and said okay, let's just move it and defer it to 2018.","Now on generic Advair \u2013 sorry, on ARVs, our growth YTD is about single-mid-digit growth on ARV franchise, and we continue, especially this launch of \u2013 first approval and launch of TLE400 and now getting the first approval for TLD, that's where the whole market is shifting \u2013 gives us again \u2013 these are the two things, the product portfolio, leading product portfolio, the scale and ability to serve this market have \u2013 what has given us this leading position in this. And we continue to strengthen these three parameters.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","So growth for the year you're expecting to be in the single digits as well?","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Finkelstein from SFG. Your line is open.","Andrew Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could just clarify a little bit with the original guidance approach versus the new approach. You talked about the assumptions for the timing of the launches, but you made a comment about adjusting the expectations for them. So if you could confirm how and in what form those are factored into the $5.40 for next year and the role of capital deployment.","And then, in terms of FDA and what you talked about, administrative issues, can you talk at all about the difference administratively from some of these subsequent approvals versus first approvals? And is the scheme for prioritization of ANDAs being implemented as intended in your view? Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","All right, thank you, Andrew. Here's what I would say. As we defer those key launches to next year, we don't call out product by product. As you know, we've got just here in the US alone over 630 products, and we have had a historical approach of really risk- basing as we put products in and key products into our assumptions. I think that's why we called out we were taking a prudent step to put them into 2018. And we've also not just deferred everything as it all looks the same being deferred for a year. So as my commentary noted that not only were we deferring US key launches, we were taking into account their contribution. And so again, it's looking at this whole portfolio and risk-adjusting for that, but we've taken that same approach, and then like I said, prudent as we think about their contribution in 2018.","As for the FDA and the prioritizing of ANDAs, look, is it where we would like it to be? No, if it was where we'd like it to be, we would be seeing I think approvals of important products that have no generic competition into the marketplace. But I'm hopeful that we continue, that FDA is focusing on their processes and prioritizing. We're certainly doing our part working with them, and I believe we will get there. It's just again sometimes when you're in this transformation, FDA themselves is in a transformation. And continuing that performance while you transform is sometimes difficult, but I'm truly hopeful that we get to where ANDAs are prioritized in the backlog and getting important first-to-market products to the market are at the top.","Operator","And our next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. First, Ken, can you give us a sense for how much launch revenue you have in the 2017 outlook and confirm whether there is any BD or not in the 2018 outlook that you revised?","And for Heather, I was hoping I could ask you a bigger picture question about the industry structure. Paul Lazzaro commented earlier that the FTC may have missed something in allowing three generic buyers to become as powerful as they are. Needless to say, manufacturers might need to find a distribution channel aside from those. I'm curious on your thoughts on those comments. Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Sure, Ken?","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","So, Gregg, on the new product launch revenues, when we were with you at Investor Day, we outlined that we had about $850 million of new product launch revenues globally in our roadmap and initial guidance for 2017. Clearly, with the revision that we just made reducing key product launches, including generic Copaxone and generic Advair, that number comes down relatively significantly. We haven't sized it specifically, but you know that those are relatively large pieces of the launch revenue.","As far as 2018, we will continue to utilize capital to continue to invest in the business. Clearly, we are immediately and primarily focused on continuing to deleverage and bring our leverage ratio down. So we will maintain our discipline with that, continue to focus on our investment-grade credit rating and maintaining that. But with that said, with generating good solid consistent free cash flows, we'll have the ability to continue to look at things to roll into our portfolio of products.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","And as far as the larger industry question, what I would say is that I do believe as you look at the landscape and the entire supply chain, from the manufacturer to the product getting into the patients' hands, one of the things that we continue to try to be vocal about and work with policymakers on is that, while nobody wants a more effective and efficient market with the FDA and the manufacturers getting approval out of the FDA than I do, I continue to caution that you can put as much competition in that generic marketplace as you want. But as you look to the right of the supply chain, the lack of competition, everything to the right of the manufacturer has continued to constrict. So not only are you down to just three buying groups, you're down to every single step along the way until it reaches the patients' hands has become a very constricted and less competitive marketplace.","So I agree that I believe that as FTC and other looked at that landscape, there could be unintended consequences to letting that entire supply chain become very less competitive, meaning at the end of the day I think that this country's got to continue to find a solution for is ultimately the product getting in the patients' hands and doing it as competitively and market-driven as possible.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Kris King, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Kris King","Thank you, Destiny. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Mylan's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Sheehan.","During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements relate to, among other matters, the proposed acquisition by Mylan of Abbott Laboratories' non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business; our expected or targeted future financials and operating performance; results metrics and plans and expectations related thereto; the ability to obtain regulatory approvals and planned launches of and anticipated exclusivity periods for new products. Because forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties, actual future results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the timing, accounting and tax treatment of the proposed acquisition; conditions to the completion of the proposed acquisition, including the receipt of approval of Mylan's shareholders; the regulatory approvals required for the proposed acquisition; the integration of Abbott's non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business by Mylan, being more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; operating cost, customer loss and business disruptions being greater than expected following the proposed acquisition; the impact of competition, situations where we manufacture, market and\/or sell, notwithstanding unresolved allegations of patent infringement; any regulatory, legal or other impediments to our ability to bring new products to market; those set forth under forward-looking statements in today's earnings release and the risk factors set forth in our Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2013, as updated by our Form 8-K filed on August 6, 2014, and Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2014. We undertake no obligation to update any statements made today whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Today's call should be listened to and considered in its entirety and understood to speak only as of today's date. In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are presented in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance. Please refer to today's earnings release, which is available on our website as well as the SEC website, as it contains detailed reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.","Before I turn the call over to Heather, let me also remind you that the material in the call, with the exception of the participant questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's expressed written permission. An archived copy of today's call will be available on our website later today and will remain available for a reasonable amount of time.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Heather.","Heather Bresch","Thank you, Kris, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Mylan had an exceptional third quarter, helping to fuel what is turning out to be yet another outstanding year for the company. All of our regions and businesses experienced year-over-year growth, which is a testament to what makes Mylan truly unique, including our tremendous diversity of our portfolio, our global supply chain, which we leverage to reliably serve our customers, and our proven ability to swiftly execute to take advantage of opportunities whenever and wherever they present themselves. These qualities allow us to continue to shape the company's destiny and to withstand challenges, such as the regulatory ones which we have been experiencing in the U.S., where the FDA continues to struggle to implement GDUFA and has simply been unable to perform efficiently as it transforms.","While we find the resulting lack of transparency and timeliness of approvals frustrating, we continue to benefit from our ability to successfully leverage our global network to fill supply gaps resulting from market disruption. And that's why we remain focused on continuing to do what we do best, which is controlling what we can control and leveraging our global operating platform to continue delivering strong performance.","Turning to the quarter. Our adjusted diluted EPS increased 41% to $1.16, and revenue increased 18% to nearly $2.1 billion. This outstanding performance was driven, as I mentioned, by our continued ability to leverage our global platform. Our earnings also benefited from an agreement with Strides for compensation for lost revenues in 2014, resulting from supply disruptions that resulted from ongoing quality enhancement activities initiated at certain Agila manufacturing facilities prior to our acquisition of Agila in 2013.","During the quarter, our Generics segment delivered revenues of $1.61 billion, an increase of 15% as compared to the third quarter of 2013. In North America, sales totaled $842 million, up 20% year-over-year. This impressive performance was the result of launching new products and capitalizing quickly on unanticipated market opportunities. Again, a tribute to the quality and scale of our network.","I'd also note that our Institutional business delivered exceptional revenue growth year-over-year due in part to new product launches and sales related to our Agila business. In Europe, sales totaled $352 million, a slight increase as compared to the third quarter of 2013. The growth was driven by higher volumes in Italy and France and new product launches throughout the region, and we achieved it despite lower pricing throughout Europe. We maintained strong positions in the market, and because generic utilization continues to rise, we continue to view the region as a long-term contributor to our growth, all of which only underscores the strategic rationale behind the Abbott transaction, where we look forward to leveraging their physician channel and our pharmacist channel to build upon our strong position throughout Europe.","In our Rest of World region. Sales totaled $414 million, a year-over-year increase of 19%. This very strong growth was driven by our India business, particularly our ARV franchise whose products serve approximately 40% of people being treated for HIV\/AIDS in the developing world. In addition, sales in Australia rose as a result of new product launches. I also would note that our business in Brazil is gaining traction, and we are excited about opportunities we are incubating in the country.","Our Specialty segment totaled $462 million, an almost 30% increase compared to the third quarter of last year. This very impressive performance was driven by higher EpiPen sales, a significant portion of which was due to volume growth as both EpiPen and the epinephrine auto-injector market expanded at a double-digit rate. We maintain our leadership position and continue to expect EpiPen to become, this year, our first billion-dollar product.","As for our outlook for the rest of 2014, we are increasing our guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS to $3.54 to $3.60. We look forward to discussing our impressive growth story when we provide detailed 2015 guidance in conjunction with our fourth quarter earnings.","With respect to Abbott, we remain extremely excited about this acquisition and continue to view it as the right next strategic transaction for Mylan as it builds on our strong vertically integrated platform, expands and further diversifies our business and maximizes our ability to execute on our growth drivers. We expect the transaction to be immediately and significantly accretive. And as noted in our 8-K filing last week, we expect the amendment to our agreement to enhance the accretion. We continue to expect the transaction to close during the first quarter of 2015. This transaction also will further enhance our financial flexibility, opening up even more opportunities for us to create additional value for shareholders. We continue to actively pursue opportunities and we are eager to put this enhanced financial flexibility and capital structure to use.","Finally, we continue to see potential to accelerate achievement of our 2018 adjusted diluted EPS target of at least $6.","Before turning the call over to Rajiv, I'd like, on behalf of Mylan's board and our entire management team, to thank our employees around the world for their loyalty, dedication and hard work. Thank you.","With that, Rajiv?","Rajiv Malik","Thank you, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. As Heather noted, this quarter again demonstrates the diversity of our global business and the breadth and depth of our global portfolio. FDA's implementation of GDUFA has provided both challenges and opportunities for us. We did not receive a number of key approvals that we had anticipated, most notably, Copaxone and Lidoderm. However, on the flip side, we have seen our competitors experience the same and have seen opportunities as a result. Further, GDUFA also has resulted in supply chain disruptions at certain of our competitors, and Mylan has always been well positioned to maximize the opportunities that have presented themselves. This has underscored the importance of having an integrated quality global supply chain as well as the value of our commitment to one global quality center across our network.","We also have seen additional opportunities arise as the result of global consolidation among our customers. As to Copaxone, we continue to be engaged with the FDA on our application. As we told you last quarter, we have responded to all FDA requests to date in terms of our ANDA, and we remain confident that we are well positioned to receive approval for our application. On the Copaxone litigation front, we appreciated the opportunity to present our arguments to the U.S. Supreme Court a few weeks ago and remain confident in our position. We look forward to receiving the court's decision.","We also announced that our ANDA for a generic version of 3-times-per-week Copaxone 40-milligram per ml has been accepted for filing by FDA. We believe we are one of the first companies to have filed a substantially complete ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification, and we expect to be eligible for 180 days of marketing exclusivity in the U.S. upon final FDA approval.","Now let me provide an update on some of our other key growth drivers. As you have seen, we have initiated a Phase III clinical trial for our generic version of Advair. The trial will evaluate the influence of our product to Advair when administered by inhalation in adult asthma patients. We continue to believe that Mylan will be the first to bring to market an AB-rated substitutable generic form of Advair.","We continue to seek additional opportunities to build on our respiratory franchise. We also initiated a Phase III clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of Mylan's insulin glargine with that of Lantus in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients. We expect to be one of the first to bring to market an interchangeable insulin analog to Lantus. While the science for both these products is complex, building commercial scale manufacturing assets is equally challenging and complex, and we have made significant progress in commissioning these manufacturing facilities. The introduction of such complex products, in addition to the hundreds of others in our pipeline, will continue to diversify our portfolio and further differentiate Mylan with our customers.","With regards to our injectables franchise. We are bringing to reality the benefits that we had anticipated from the Agila transaction. We are very pleased with the contributions from Agila this quarter, particularly to our North American and Rest of the World businesses, and we remain excited about the outlook for this important business.","On the regulatory front, our quality team has continued to make progress in implementing Mylan's one quality standard across Agila. We continue to work diligently with FDA on our remediation efforts and we anticipate putting these issues behind us soon.","Turning now to our ARV franchise. Over the years, we have invested significantly in our product portfolio and supply chain. And today, our entire portfolio is vertically integrated. During this quarter, we further strengthened our leadership position in ARVs in developing markets with a","number of recent product approvals under PEPFAR, including nevirapine extended-release and 2 taste-masked pediatric formulations of Abacavir and Lamivudine. We are also building out our ARV franchise in developed markets such as the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., we recently launched Lamivudine and Zidovudine tablets, and this week, we launched nevirapine extended-release tablets.","We also continue to expand our product portfolio around the world through various business development activities focusing on key markets and product franchises. Notably, we announced the acquisition of U.S. rights to Arixtra injection and authorized generic of Arixtra from Aspen. The addition of Arixtra is an attractive opportunity to broaden the range of therapeutic categories we market in the U.S. and further adding to our growing portfolio of complex injectables to better meet our customer needs. We expect to see sustainable value from this product.","We also announced our latest agreement with Gilead. The agreement provides nonexclusive rights to manufacture and distribute Sofosbuvir marketed by Gilead as Sovaldi in low-income countries where Mylan is building on a successful base of fighting HIV to now reach millions of people living with hepatitis C. Mylan and Gilead are also working towards concluding additional agreements in the fourth quarter, including an exclusive distribution agreement for Sovaldi brand in India, which will be an important expansion of our commercial operation in that market.","With regards to our pending acquisition of Abbott's non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generic business, we are making good progress in our pre-integration planning. We are very excited about the talent pool and assets we are gaining through this transaction and the enhanced potential of this business in Mylan hands. We also see this transaction as another opportunity to mean even more to our customers. We eagerly anticipate closing this transaction so that we can begin to realize the significant value we see from this combination.","Let me now turn the call over to John. Thanks.","John D. Sheehan","Thanks, Rajiv. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. I refer you back to Kris' comments at the beginning of today's call regarding our use of adjusted measures.","I'd like to begin today by walking you through our third quarter financial results, which were at the high end of the increased guidance range that we announced at the beginning of October. These results represented yet another strong quarter for our company with contributions from all regions. With our revised guidance for the calendar year, which we issued this afternoon, we expect that we will achieve the full year results, even without the anticipated 2014 launches of generic Copaxone and generic Lidoderm, which is a testament to the strength and diversity of our world-class platform.","Now let me turn to our third quarter financial performance. Starting at the top of our income statement, total revenues for the quarter were $2.1 billion, an increase of approximately 18% when compared to revenues of $1.8 billion in the prior year. For the full year, we expect that our total revenues for 2014 will be in the range of $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion as compared to our guidance from earlier this year of $7.8 billion to $8 billion. The revision of revenue guidance results from delays in key product approvals and the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. We estimate the negative impact foreign exchange rates will have on 2014 revenues is nearly $150 million.","Looking at our operating profitability measures. Adjusted gross margin in the third quarter of '14 -- 2014 was a very strong 54%, up over 300 basis points from the same prior year period. Our strong margins are primarily the result of new product introductions in North America and the growth in sales of the EpiPen Auto-Injector. We've increased and narrowed our full year 2014 adjusted gross margin guidance range to between 52% and 53%.","Adjusted operating income was $659 million for the third quarter of 2014, an increase of $198 million. The increase in adjusted operating income is primarily the result of the strong gross margins we experienced throughout 2014. In addition, during the current quarter, we recognized a gain of $80 million as a result of an agreement with Strides Arcolab to settle a component of the contingent consideration related to the Agila acquisition. We've included the gain within adjusted operating income due to the lost injectables revenues we experienced in 2014, combined with the corresponding positive impact on our cash balances.","Our 2014 injectable revenues have been negatively impacted as a result of supply disruptions due to the ongoing quality enhancement activities initiated at certain Agila facilities prior to our ownership. We look forward to the completion of these activities, along with the continued growth of our global injectables platform.","R&D expense on an adjusted basis was $157 million for the third quarter or almost 8% of total revenues and at the upper end of our guidance range. As I indicated earlier in the year, we expected R&D spending to increase throughout 2014 as we continued to invest in our biologics and respiratory programs. Our guidance range for adjusted R&D expense for the full year remains between 7% and 8% of total revenues.","At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was $396 million or 19% of total revenues for the third quarter. We continue to expect to be within our adjusted SG&A guidance range of 18% to 20% of total revenues for 2014. Factors contributing to the increase in SG&A include our continued investment in the EpiPen Auto-Injector, including our direct-to-consumer marketing campaign, along with investments in infrastructure to support the growth of the company. Additionally, to support anticipated new launches within North America, we've experienced increased legal and marketing cost during 2014.","Adjusted EBITDA for the 3 months ended September 30 was $736 million, an increase of 38% when compared to the prior year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.35 billion and $2.4 billion for the full year.","Adjusted interest expense for the third quarter of 2014 was $63 million. While adjusted interest expense increased slightly when compared to the prior year quarter and year-to-date periods, our total debt outstanding is up $1.4 billion over the prior period. We continue to benefit from low short-term interest rates as the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was slightly below 4%. Additionally, to further enhance our capital structure, we have announced our intention to redeem our 2018 senior notes this November.","I'd also like to mention that during the third quarter -- over the third quarter of 2014, we received approval from the regulatory authorities in India to legally merge our Agila Indian subsidiaries into Mylan Labs Limited. The merger resulted in the recognition of a tax benefit of approximately $150 million as the goodwill from the Agila acquisition will now be deductible for tax purposes in India. The impacts of recognizing the tax benefit are excluded from our adjusted results for the quarter. However, we have incorporated future tax deductions into the long-term tax rate projections and have narrowed our 2014 adjusted tax rate guidance to 24% to 25%.","Third quarter adjusted net income was $463 million or $1.16 per share, an increase of 43% from our Q3 2013 adjusted net income of $324 million or $0.82 per share. We expect our Q4 adjusted EPS of between $1.03 and $1.09, implying a full year adjusted EPS range of $3.54 to $3.60. The increase in Q4 adjusted EPS when compared to the prior year is the result of new product introductions during 2014 in North America, continued growth in the Specialty segment and to a lesser extent, growth generated from our business development activities. Although we continue to look forward to and expect FDA approval of generic Copaxone and generic Lidoderm, the fourth quarter guidance range excludes the potential launches of these products.","Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis was $1 billion, which is up 42% from our 2013 comparative amount of $727 million. We are narrowing our full year 2000 (sic) [ 2014 ] adjusted operating cash flow target to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion.","Capital expenditures for the 9 months ended September 30, 2014, was $220 million as we continue to invest in our strategic growth drivers. And we expect full year capital expenditures to be within a range of $300 million to $350 million.","At the end of the quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio is approximately 3:1. We continue to have ample borrowing capacity and financial flexibility and remain committed to our stated M&A parameters, that any transaction be accretive to earnings and maintain our long-term gross leverage targets at investment grade levels. As previously mentioned, our financial flexibility will be significantly enhanced through the pending Abbott transaction.","To summarize, our third quarter was outstanding and provides another example of the strength and diversity of Mylan. We look forward to a strong finish to 2014 and the completion of our transaction with Abbott in early 2015.","Before I conclude my remarks, I'd like to briefly update you on the recent amendment that we entered into with Abbott. As you know by now, the amendment, which is contemplated by our transaction agreement, defines the terms under the product supply arrangements that we will enter into as part of the transaction. The amendment will also increase the number of shares that we will issue to Abbott to 110 million shares, valued at approximately $5.5 billion based upon our recent share price range. As a result of the amendment, the multiples at which we are acquiring the business have declined slightly. For example, the adjusted EBITDA multiple, including cumulative operational efficiencies of $200 million, declined from 6.6x to 6.4x.","Finally, in conjunction with our fourth quarter call, we will provide detailed 2015 financial guidance that will reflect recent developments and our most up-to-date outlook.","That concludes my remarks. And I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Destiny?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ronny Gal of Bernstein.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","A few questions. The first one is on Abbott, first. I don't think you -- I might have missed it, but can you just remind us if you will be able to do the tax inversion through this transaction now that you know the details? And just the big-picture question about this transaction is, I guess, the concern that investors have raised to me was, \"Look, this might be a great strategy in the next couple of years. But afterwards, Mylan will have a fairly large business unit which is saddled with declining assets. And when interests go up and you can no longer grow this asset through acquisition, Mylan will not be able to grow.\" So if you can just perhaps give us a little bit more perspective on your vision. It will be appreciated. And the same questions around insulin. Rajiv, you kind of brought it up, so I've got to ask. Have you gotten guidance from the FDA about interchangeability of insulin? Do you know what you need to do? And does the current set of trials that you're conducting enable you to ask the FDA for an interchangeable label to your insulin?","Heather Bresch","Okay. So I'll take your first couple and then I'll let Rajiv speak to insulin. So Ronny, yes, we do believe that our Abbott transaction will be a successful inversion. And as far as the business, the strategic rationale, I -- as we look at what Abbott -- so first of all, strategically, we believe that being able to have critical mass now around the physician channel throughout Europe, combined with our retail channel, certainly will give very positive upside synergies about how we're able to make 1 plus 1 equal 4 and how we can serve that market. As you know, it doubles our size in our top 10 markets outside of the United States. So first and foremost, that strategic rationale, I think, is very sound. So what we've said, because of the truly enhanced financial -- the significant financial flexibility we will receive because of the -- because of what Abbott, the cash flows that we'll generate, that we will be adding immediately. In fact -- and I'd called out in my remarks that we are actively -- currently actively pursuing many opportunities. So we are certainly putting it to work immediately and certainly, continue to put it to work after the Abbott transaction closes so that we can take that financial flexibility and continue to complement then this platform across the globe with other high-growth areas.","Rajiv Malik","And Ronny, as regarding insulin. As you will recall, insulin -- -- Lantus was approved as an NDA and not as biologic. So our discussion with the FDA around 505(b)(2) route with interchangeability is a theme so far. So every discussion around this protocol has been around this theme, and our clinical program, which we have agreed with the FDA, is around this theme.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Douglas Tsao of Barclays.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just to perhaps touch on a little bit your thinking in terms of executing another strategic deal. I mean, this has obviously been something that's been featured in each of your earnings releases over the last couple of quarters, your sort of willingness and readiness. Is this something that we should anticipate by year-end? Or is it that you're still just not going to do something just to do something and you're looking for the right opportunity? And the direction, are you thinking Generics or Specialty?","Heather Bresch","Sure. Like I said, we are actively, aggressively pursuing many things. But to your point, we have remained consistent that we wouldn't just add or do a transaction for the sake of doing a transaction. But the good news is there's plenty of transactions out there that do make strategic and financial sense. So we have not certainly put out a time frame other than to say we will -- I think you've seen us in action before, and we are able to move swiftly. And when we find the right target, we certainly act upon it. So I would say that as from a timing perspective, just know that we're out there actively looking at a lot of things. As far as Specialty versus Generic, again, we really are looking across this platform and thinking more about franchises. So -- and as you think about versus -- a generic versus a brand, when you look at how complementary some of our therapeutic categories are, whether allergy, respiratory, you look at everything from a generic Advair to Perforomist, to having nebulization expertise. So I would say, again, we are looking at how we can best complement, either critical mass or add to from a therapeutic category. And that's why, again, having -- after being able to close on the Abbott transaction, being able to leverage these multiple different channels, whether they're physician or retail, it really lets us maximize a portfolio across these channels versus just thinking of something on a product-by-product basis, whether that's a brand product or a generic product. So it's about really leveraging our entire portfolio within these channels that I think gives Mylan the unique opportunity to be very differentiated across the pharmaceutical sector across the globe.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","John, a question for you on the Abbott transaction. Just wondering if we should anticipate any changes to your future projections as a result of the treasury notice. Specifically, I'm referring to the elimination of hopscotching, decontrolling, et cetera. Will that impact your expectations for what the tax rate might look like going forward? And also, do you see any risk of future changes imposed to the newly inverted companies such as earnings stripping? What's your comfort level that, that doesn't change?","John D. Sheehan","So Jami, with respect to the first part of the question on the taxes, we'll be filing our S-4 here in the next week, as early as the next week. And I think that there will be more disclosure around the whole tax and tax inversion as part of that. But we do still, as Heather indicated, just a little bit in response to the first question, we do still to see ourselves having a successful inversion and with the tax rate projections that we talked about in July. And quite honestly, as to where tax reform or changes to tax may go, quite honestly, I'm not going to speculate in that area to the second part of your question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Elliot Wilbur of Needham & Company.","Elliot Wilbur - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","First question for Heather. Your 2 biggest competitors in the U.S., at least with respect to their European businesses, have talked about scaling back sales growth in exchange for profitability or more profitable growth. And maybe that's a function of the fact that the same guy is making the decision of both companies, but just wondering sort of how you're thinking about that with regard to your European platform, anticipating making any changes along similar lines? And then the second question is can you just maybe elaborate a little bit more on the $80 million payment related to Strides? I'm just trying to figure out if this is sort of reimbursement for direct costs incurred in addition to lost sales? Or whether or not there's also inabilities incorporated in there? I'm just trying to figure out sort of what the P&L risk going forward, may be. I think there was originally $250 million held back. I mean, are you protected only up to the $250 million? Or are there additional protections built in if in fact issues such as inabilities continue to arise?","Heather Bresch","Okay. Thanks, Elliot. Look, as far as Europe -- as it relates to Europe, I would -- if you remember, I think now going back several years ago, that was our answer when Europe -- when the economic kind of crisis and crash came and that ability to be managing our profitability. Because as you know, going back then when we had acquired Merck, 70% -- 75% of their portfolio was in licensed. And so they didn't really -- that -- they didn't have as much control over their own destiny from a supply chain perspective. As we then brought in Merck, as you know, one of our priorities was converting and flipping that, that at least 75% of what we sold we would manufacture. So as we were going through that transition, I remember saying to the market when we were experiencing declining growth in Europe, that we were very much being mindful in managing that profitability. And I think that what we're enjoying today is that discipline that we applied in getting our global supply chain where it is today of truly across the globe manufacturing 80% of what we sell. And we're benefiting, quite honestly, in Europe. We did show year-over-year growth. Yes, we have volume offsetting -- continued price cuts but I think that our ability to control that global supply chain and our ability to have truly this vertical integrated network gives us a lot of flexibility, a lot of room for continued growth, and that's why we see it continuing to be a longer-term growth driver. And now when you couple that with, like I said, what the Abbott platform brings us, we really believe that 1 plus 1 equals 4. So I think that we took those steps several years ago, and it is in allowing not only us to have profitability today, but growth year-over-year, and we see that continuing. And I'll let John and Rajiv hit the Agila.","John D. Sheehan","Yes, so Elliot, with respect to the Strides compensation. That was for revenues that we were unable to realize here in 2014 as a result of the ongoing remediation activities at the Agila facilities and the lack of product as a result of, as I said, the remediation going on. We had -- you're correct, a $250 million hold back from the purchase price from Strides. We did transfer $150 million or settle with Strides for 100 -- them to receive $150 million of that, and $80 million of it was for the lost revenue that we were talking about -- we're talking about here and $20 million relates to another separate issue that had been agreed at the time of the closing of the transaction. So it is not for -- the compensation that we received is not for reimbursement of cost. There is a separate escrow account that is set up and the remediation that's been ongoing has been reimbursed out of that escrow account. This compensation was for lost revenues.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Cacciatore of Cowen and Company.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","My first question is -- just wondering how you think about growth versus accretion when it comes to future M&A. There's clearly a lot of assets that will provide accretion, but wondering how you view growth and maybe even durability. That's the first question. Then the second question is it seems that -- it sounded as if you're frustrated with the FDA. That's my interpretation of your earlier comments. I was just wondering is it because of your own poorly formulated products? Or is it actually issues with the FDA? So just trying to understand seeming placing blame on them and wondering maybe it could be with your own formulations.","Heather Bresch","Thanks, Ken. So look, I think as far as growth versus accretion, look, I think our track record pretty much speaks for itself. I think that we have added some great complementary strategic assets and accretion. I think we've been very clear about the parameters around M&A that they absolutely would be accretive. And I think that just as I gave the explanation around Abbott, we can bring in an asset that's very complementary and gives great strategic and financial rationale and we'll continue to put that cash to use to ensure that we maintain that strong growth momentum that we've now delivered for 8 years. As far as your FDA question, I am frustrated as I think the industry is. I guess, as far as Mylan is concerned, I'm not aware of any poor formulated products that we have -- have ever had or have in our pipeline. So I'm not sure what your reference there is. I do think that by their own admission, they're having a difficult time efficiently performing while they transform and meeting the metrics that, as you know, we championed GDUFA to level the playing field. And we're working closely with them to enhance and improve the transparency and the timelines and to get us where we need to be -- where they need to be by the end of year 5 in GDUFA. This is the first year -- this is year 3 we're into, and the metrics and so forth, they'll be coming out. So look, I think it is back to a timing perspective, and we look forward to continuing to work with this agency. I think we received -- so with that being said, we've received more product approvals than any other company out there. So while I'm frustrated, I will tell you, Mylan has received more than -- more approvals this year than any of our competitors to date.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marc Goodman of UBS.","Marc Harold Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Heather, maybe you can give us a flavor for what's going on in some of the key European countries. Your press release refers to some pricing pressures. And obviously, France is key and Italy. Talk about, specifically, in those countries, what's happening, the dynamic, how the markets are growing and volume versus price and how you guys are doing.","Heather Bresch","Sure, Ken (sic) [Marc]. So as I mentioned, we have continued to see pricing pressure there. We have continued to see some volume offsetting that. I would say more so in Italy than France. We continue to see utilization on the rise and the market growing. I would say this about the French market overall. It's been -- from a pharmaceutical perspective, has been fairly flat. So we have obviously maintained our market leadership position there. We've continued, I think, again our durability around our cost of goods, our agility to really be able to key upon key launches there have -- able to let us maintain that. We're excited about launching direct-to-consumer advertising there in France, I think really building upon this leadership. And as far as the other markets outside of just even Italy and France, like I said, we continue to be encouraged by generic utilization increases. And as we've said, nothing happens overnight in Europe throughout the entire region. It is an incremental build, and that's why, again, I go back to being extremely excited around Abbott and our ability to really leverage on both channels, the physician and pharmacy, and really offer something into that market that doesn't exist today, which is a true patient portfolio to the physicians to be able to offer those patients in these therapeutic categories that we're going to have great critical mass around, be vertically integrated in and be able to offer benefit with that pull-through from the pharmacy level.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Schott of JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. I just had 2 here. First, can I just get your view on broader consolidation of the generic industry? I guess, specifically, do you believe consolidation among the larger manufacturers is possible? Or if it makes sense in light of some of the customer consolidation that's occurred? And then second question is coming back to just the next steps post this Abbott transaction. Can I just -- just so I'm clear here, are other established product divisions that may be for sale from some of the large pharma companies of interest to Mylan? Or are you looking at other types of assets given some of those kind of franchise-level kind of comments you made earlier?","Heather Bresch","Yes, Chris. Thank you. Look, I think -- I used to refer to our industry as hypercompetitive. I'd say now it's hyper-consolidating. And I don't know that I see that stopping. So I think, again, you've got to step back, and look, I won't speak for any of the other large companies. I will speak for Mylan. And I think we've been very vocal that we'll continue to be an acquirer of some great assets that are out there. We believe that we do have the scale and size today with this -- our -- not only the global platform we have, but I'll go back to manufacturing and having the capacity not only to manufacture and put into the market what we do today, but what we're forecasting from our pipeline perspective. And I think that, that really tees us up to serve these global customers. Because I do think that as we continue to see the disruptions in the market, the lack of reliability and some of the positive that a GDUFA has brought, which is I think taking products and some of that capacity out of the market that wasn't where it needed to be from a quality perspective. And I think we certainly are being able to seize on these opportunities. I think, as far as established product businesses, I think what we're in a position to do not only -- as I've said, we're kind of actively looking at everything. We're also, now with this infrastructure in place, able to also cherry-pick products. So I wouldn't think of it that it's an all-or-nothing proposition. I think now building out the infrastructure, not only that we have in the U.S. but throughout Europe, we'll be able to add some great strategic assets whether that's all of an asset or part of it, in addition to standalone companies and obviously, things that would make sense. And certainly, as we continue to think of the emerging markets, especially in Latin America and how we may grow there, there certainly would be opportunity along those lines as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. So my first question is for John. So going back to your slides from July, you had indicated adjusted EBITDA for the Abbott business of $600 million, and I just wanted to make sure that I understand the math correctly. So starting with the $600 million, investors should be adding $200 million in future synergies. So that would bring the number to $800 million. And then should investors be subtracting some dollar amount that's now lower after your negotiation for the extra cost of goods sold or pricing terms? Is that the way to think about it? And could you also put that in perspective in terms of what those extra pricing terms may amount to? And then second, could you -- could someone on your management team just provide some more detailed comments on the Lidoderm issues and your expectations for approval timing?","John D. Sheehan","Sure, David. Thanks. And what I would say to you, number one, is, is that if you go back to the slides that we provided back at July that you're referencing, you'll see that one of the metrics that we provided was an adjusted EBITDA multiple of 6.6x based upon that transaction. And that what I was trying to provide in my prepared remarks was a comparison today that as a result of the revised transaction, including the issuance of the 5 million shares to Abbott that, that comparative metric is now 6.4x, which reflects the benefit of the improved pricing that came out of the conclusion of the negotiations with Abbott as well as the issuance of the 5 million shares to them. And you'll see further information on that when we file our S-4. And I'll let Rajiv...","Rajiv Malik","On Lidoderm, I think we continue to work very closely with the FDA to close any outstanding issue. And that's why -- while we are prepared to launch as soon as we get the product, we have taken it out of this year's guidance just on financial prudence.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gilbert of Deutsche Bank.","Gregory B. Gilbert - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","One on Abbott, John. Is there an opportunity to improve gross margin on that business once you take control of the manufacturing, whenever that might be? And then for Rajiv. Do you still believe that generic Copaxone could be approved at any time? You've been saying for some time that you've resolved all issues or questions. So I want to make sure that you believe an approval could happen at any time and wondering why you link that to GDUFA slowdowns. I'm not sure if you are linking those 2 things or not.","John D. Sheehan","Absolutely -- yes, on your first part about the gross margins, Greg, I absolutely believe that not only is there the opportunity to increase the gross margins over time, but I think that we have a proven track record of improving gross margins. If you look at the experience over the last 5, 6 years here at Mylan as we have integrated the Merck acquisition, the Bioniche acquisition, our margins have steadily increased. So I definitely see opportunity as well as a proven track record in that area.","Rajiv Malik","And Greg, as far as Copaxone is concerned, as I said in my prepared remarks, that we do not have any scientific issue -- outstanding scientific issue to date. We have responded -- the last set of questions were responded maybe 6, 8 months back. And we have been working and staying very close to the FDA and we have been guiding The Street accordingly what we have been hearing from FDA. Obviously, the transformation at FDA, the rolling out of GDUFA and all, we have seen overall impact, a huge impact, and that is a slowdown. So we don't see any outstanding issue at this time where we stand. That's why we imply that, yes, we can see approval any time. But again, being prudent, we have taken it out of this year's guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sumant Kulkarni of Bank of America.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The first one is in a couple of product-specific ones for Rajiv. Are you still on track to launch generic Advair in 2016 because I think you said market formation today? The second one is what is the latest on generic Vivelle-Dot? And then for John, on accretion, could you give us any color on where the source of the additional accretion comes from, from the manufacturing agreement? Is that due to adding sales, better cost positions or due to some other nonoperational source such as tax?","Rajiv Malik","On generic Advair, all I can tell you, that every milestone which we have identified ourselves way back 2 years when we launched this product, we have been hitting on the track, and the Phase III study has been initiated as we have scheduled. Every manufacturing activity, the commissioning of the plant and everything is on track. And I would say that beyond that, you will hear from us on -- in 2015, our Investor Day. As well as Vivelle-Dot, again, no scientific outstanding issue to date. We have responded to everything and we are expecting approval anytime.","John D. Sheehan","And then on your second question regarding the accretion as a result of the amendment and the 8-K filing. I think we indicated in the 8-K filing that the accretion was the result of improved pricing surrounding the transaction. So it's really on the pricing of a product perspective.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason Gerberry of Leerink Partners.","Jason M. Gerberry - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on Ronny's question about the Lantus program. Can you just confirm, is your Phase III -- do you have a vial or a pen delivery there? I'm just sort of curious if you're going after interchangeability to the vial or the pen delivery? I know that your partner had a pen? And then this is my second question. Just as we think about the Abbott transaction, can you just confirm your old pro forma guidance as it related to the, I guess, the pro forma tax rate for the combined entity, which I think was down in the low 20s and then to the high teens over time?","Rajiv Malik","As far as the insulin trial is concerned, yes, we have a pen as a part of this trial.","John D. Sheehan","And Jason, I think actually I had intended, in response to Jami's question, to be indicating that the tax rate was as a result of the inversion that we were still expecting a tax rate in the 20%, 21% range next year and into the high teens thereafter.","Operator","And our last question will come from Randall Stanicky of RBC Capital Markets.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Heather, just back on the end of backlog, is there anything that you can point to like a greater volume and complete response letters that could be a leading indicator that things are at least troughing or potentially getting better? And how much of an impact do you think these -- the OGD delays are going to give you for having on broader industry pricing?","Heather Bresch","So Randall, I hope that, as I stated, October starts the beginning of the third year of GDUFA, which should really be the transformational year as far as metrics and starting to get to the -- and starting to get to where the overall vision of GDUFA was in the first place, which is to accelerate approvals to be able to raise that bar on quality and enhance the transparency. And I, unfortunately and disappointingly, tell you it's gone every -- the wrong direction up until now. I think FDA is aware of this. I hope that going into the very early part of next year, we will be able to see a market -- a markedly different metrics in place for applications that were filed after October 1. I think that where we have been vigilant on with FDA is the backlog issue. So anything before October 1 of 2014, that would have been filed, how they prioritize those. We've been very vocal about, first, generics, how important that is to the market. I think there are certainly broad implications around the lack of approvals that we've had this year. I mean, I think it's been quantified into the billions because of the inability to get products approved at market formation. And I think that as Congress continues to take a hard look at that, I think as a lot of the consumers, that that's really a driving factor and that's what we keep reminding people that we've got to get those approvals in. That's what -- that's the mission statement around OGD. That's what -- that driving force should be there to deliver that to the United States, both as a taxpayer and as to the consumers to get affordable medicine out there. So I can assure you we've not lost sight of the broader mission picture and we'll continue to do our part to make sure everybody else is understanding that, that needs fixed before anything else. Because if we can't get approvals, really fixing anything else isn't going to be very meaningful. And as far as the pricing implications, look, I think -- I continue to say that I think that's a supply-and-demand issue. So yes, do I think there's been opportunities around certain products? But I will say, overall -- I have continued to say generics, overall, per dose or pennies. So it's really, I think, looking -- really looking at the wrong end of the spectrum of where we should be looking at, and it's not the pricing of generic drugs that's driving anything around this health care system, it's really we need to get products approved and get them into the hands of the patient. So with that, thank you.","John D. Sheehan","And operator, you can close out the call.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for participating in today's conference.

An archived copy of today's call will be available on our website and will remain available for a limited time.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Heather.","Heather Bresch","Thank you, Kris, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We have a lot of great news to share with you today. We'll be discussing the Meda transaction, reviewing highlights from 2015, and providing guidance for 2016, with or without Meda, given that we expect to close by the end of Q3 this year.","Turning first to the transaction we just announced. We have agreed to acquire Meda, a leading international specialty pharmaceutical company via a recommended public offer and a transaction valued at $9.9 billion. We are receiving, including synergies, approximately $1.1 billion in EBITDA.","In addition to the Meda Board's recommendation, I am pleased that Meda's two largest shareholders, representing approximately 30% of outstanding shares, have irrevocably committed to tender into the offer and intend to remain long-term shareholders of the combined company.","The strategic rationale for a combination of Mylan and Meda has long been very clear. In addition to being partner since 2011 on EpiPen in Europe, we have had numerous discussions over the years about other ways to collaborate, including our proposal to acquire the company in 2014.","Since 2014, the rationale for this combination has only been further enhanced by Meda's acquisitions of Rottapharm and our acquisition of EPD, with the ability to leverage this infrastructure especially in Europe and emerging markets. This combination continues to accelerate the execution of the vision and strategy we laid out over a decade ago.","The global competitiveness of our industry and consolidation of our customer base continues to drive the importance of scale, and this combination creates a global pharmaceutical leader with 2015 combined revenues of $11.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $3.8 billion, a portfolio of more than 2,000 products and critical mass across all commercial channels, including a $1 billion OTC business.","By offering one of the industry's broadest portfolios of products across all customer channels, including Rx, Gx, and OTC, we'll be able to mean even more to our customers, which is increasingly important in light of the evolving payer and distributor environment.","Geographically, we're gaining more balanced and expanded global footprint with an even stronger presence across Europe, a leading U.S. specialty business, and an expanded presence in emerging markets, including several new and attractive ones such as China, Southeast Asia, Russia, the Middle East, and Mexico.","Together, we will also become a leader in the global respiratory allergy market and achieve scale in many other therapeutic areas, including dermatology and pain, offering us even greater opportunities for growth in these categories.","As you know, we have always been very active in looking at various opportunities. We revisited the Meda opportunity this past summer and continued conversation throughout the fall. During this time, the fundamentals and the inherent value from this combination become even more apparent, the more we dug into the business during due diligence, leading to our announcement today. This combination will create tremendous value for our shareholders as well as other stakeholders.","On a cash flow basis, at 12.9x 2015 adjusted EBITDA and 8.9x adjusted EBITDA with synergies, we expect to achieve substantial annual operational synergies of approximately $350 million in year four. We believe we are paying an attractive multiple that is in line with market precedence for such scarce, high-quality asset.","The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Mylan earnings with accretion increasing significantly after the first full year 2017 as synergies are realized. Most importantly, the transaction creates the opportunity to achieve $0.35 to $0.40 accretion in 2017 and to accelerate achievement of our previously stated $6 adjusted diluted EPS target to 2017 versus 2018.","We expect to see accelerated earnings and EBITDA growth going forward as well as substantial cash flows and enhanced margins. Even with the financial commitment to this transaction, we still have ample financial flexibility for business development activity, for additional share buyback, all while keeping our commitment to investment grade.","Giving our long history together, we know Meda's business, their people, and their culture extremely well. We believe that we will be able to quickly and smoothly integrate this business. I look forward to working with and welcoming Meda's leadership team and talented workforce to our organization. They have built a terrific company, and I believe we will be able to achieve great things together.","With that, let me turn now to the highlights of our performance during 2015. Mylan again had an outstanding year delivering exceptional financial results, while continuing to execute on our long-term growth drivers.","On the topline, we generated adjusted total revenues of approximately $9.4 billion despite considerable FX headwinds, representing a year-over-year constant currency increase of 28%. On the bottomline, adjusted diluted EPS came in at $4.30, a 21% year-over-year increase even after absorbing $0.11 of FX headwind, which put us at the high-end of our guidance range.","We also had a record year with respect to cash. Adjusted free cash flow more than doubled and adjusted free cash flow stood at 87% of adjusted net income. In addition, we closed on two strategic acquisitions during the year. First was Abbott's EPD Business, which has surpassed our growth expectation and has proven to be a solid revenue contributor. Second was the Famy Care transaction through which we are now well on our way to creating a leading women's healthcare franchise.","Also noteworthy during 2015 was the further strengthening of our EpiPen franchise and our continued efforts to increase awareness and expand access to the anaphylaxis market. One point of note, while we saw higher sales of EpiPen due to higher volume that resulted in part from the Auvi-Q recall, we saw the same net payer pricing dynamic that existed throughout 2015, and we don't expect material changes to the environment in 2016.","We also continued to make good progress across our strategic growth drivers. In our respiratory program, we recently announced that we submitted our ANDA for generic Advair. We are extremely excited about this opportunity, and we continue to believe that Mylan will be the first company to bring generic Advair to the U.S. market in 2017.","In building on our successful Biocon partnership, we announced earlier this year an exclusive global agreement with Momenta that expands our portfolio of biologics with up to six additional products and broadens the scope and scale of our capability. The combination of this program and our Biocon partnership positions Mylan as a worldwide leader in the biologics space.","In summary, 2015 underscores the power of the exceptional global platform we serve and our ability to absorb volatility and maximize opportunity. It also reflects the superb execution and teamwork by Mylan's employees around the world, and on behalf of the Board of Directors and our entire leadership team, I'd like to thank them for an outstanding year and a job very well done.","Now, turning to 2016. We look forward to delivering another year of outstanding financial performance. On the topline, we expect growth of approximately 16% compared to 2015 and a guidance range of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion. On the bottom line, we expect growth of approximately 16% year-over-year with guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS of $4.85 to $5.15.","Our guidance ranges include a quarter's worth of contribution from Meda. However, we are also committed to these ranges without Meda. And as mentioned earlier, we see opportunity to accelerate the achievement of our $6 adjusted diluted EPS target to 2017.","I'd now like to take a minute to thank John, who's retiring from Mylan on April 1, for his service to our company. During his six years with us, John helped shape the company's ongoing transformation into a global leader in healthcare. We are all wishing him the very best with the entrance of new chapter of his life.","Before I turn the call over to Tony, I'd also like to take a moment to congratulate him on being appointed Mylan's Chief Commercial Officer, which became effective earlier this year. Tony has been with the company for nearly 20 years and most recently successfully led our largest commercial business in the North American region for the last four years. In his new role, Tony oversees all of our commercial businesses around the world.","With that, I'll turn the call over to him to discuss the performance of our core business during 2015.","Anthony Mauro","Thank you so much, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. As mentioned earlier, Mylan had a phenomenal year, with constant currency adjusted total revenues rising 28% compared to 2014, coming from 9% growth in our legacy business and 19% from EPD. All of our regions and businesses contributed to the strong performance.","In our North America generic segment, revenues totaled nearly $4 billion, a 16% increase compared to 2014. Growth came mainly from sales of new products and to a lesser extent from the EPD business. Also contributing were higher volumes on existing products, partially offset by lower pricing.","In Europe, sales totaled $2.2 billion in 2015, a year-over-year constant currency increase of 67%. Growth came primarily from sales generated by EPD and to a lesser extent from new products. Higher volumes on existing products, mainly in France and Italy were offset by lower pricing throughout the region.","In the rest of world, sales totaled $2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 38% constant currency. The growth came from EPD, new product launches in Australia and Japan and higher volumes in India, predominantly of ARVs, and in Brazil. Increases were offset somewhat by lower volumes on existing products in Japan and lower pricing in the region.","Our specialty business delivered revenues of $1.2 billion in 2015, an increase of 1% compared to 2014. In addition to the strong performance of EpiPen, as Heather referenced, sales of Perforomist and ULTIVA increased by double-digit percentage points from the prior year. I would also like to note that our EPD business grew 2% year-over-year, demonstrating again our ability to take a declining business and drive growth ahead of our expectations.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John Sheehan","Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone. As Heather and Tony both mentioned, we're extremely pleased with our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, highlighted by the strong growth in our generic segment and the exceptional adjusted free cash flow we generated.","Our total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $2.5 billion, an increase of 24% on a constant currency basis from the prior-year period. Revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation by approximately $91 million in the current quarter when compared to the prior-year period.","Adjusted total revenues for 2015 were $9.4 billion, an increase of 28% on a constant currency basis from the prior year, which includes revenues from EPD business of approximately $1.5 billion. Revenues for the full year 2015 were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation by approximately $432 million when compared to the prior-year period and more than $300 million compared to the FX rates we used for providing our financial guidance at the beginning of the year.","For the fourth quarter, third-party net sales were positively impacted by the contribution from the acquired EPD business of approximately $456 million, of which approximately $286 million was in Europe and $123 million was in our rest of world region, with the remainder coming from EPD Canada. As a reminder, beginning in 2016, the EPD business and Mylan commercial businesses are operating as one. As such, separate revenue information will no longer be reported.","Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015 was a very strong 56%, up 200 basis points for the quarter and approximately 320 basis points for the full year. Our strong margins are primarily the result of the positive contribution from the acquired EPD business combined with new product introductions.","R&D expense on an adjusted basis was approximately 6% of total revenues for the fourth quarter and approximately 7% of total adjusted revenues for the full year. R&D expense for the quarter and full year increased due to the impact of the acquired EPD business as well as the continued development of our respiratory, insulin and biologics programs. At the same time, SG&A also on an adjusted basis was approximately 20% of total adjusted revenues for the quarter and full year, which includes the impact of the EPD business.","Throughout 2015 we continued to realize additional tax benefits from the EPD transaction, and as a result of our ongoing efforts to optimize our tax structure, we had an adjusted effective tax rate for the full year of approximately 17%. We continue to look at additional tax planning strategies for opportunities to further reduce our annual effective tax rate in 2016 and beyond.","Our fourth quarter adjusted net earnings were $620 million or $1.22 per share, a 16% increase from our Q4 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.05 per share. For the full year 2015, our adjusted net earnings were $2.14 billion or $4.30 per share, a 21% increase from 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $3.56 and at the high-end of our previously communicated guidance.","It's important to note that U.S. GAAP requires EPS to be calculated for each individual period, based on the average outstanding share count for that period. As a result of the issuance of shares to Abbott in the first quarter of 2015, our adjusted diluted EPS for the calendar year and the sum of the quarters does not add by $0.04 per share.","Our 2015 EPS growth was achieved in spite of unrelenting foreign currency headwinds, which reduced our calendar year adjusted diluted EPS by $0.11 per share versus our guidance rates at the beginning of the year, and by $0.18 per share versus 2014's actual FX rates. Our very strong 2015 adjusted diluted EPS resulted from the strength of our global operating platform, including the acquired EPD business and the organic revenue growth across our legacy generics business.","Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was impressive $2.2 billion for the calendar year, representing an increase of approximately $1 billion from the prior year, which is the result of the growth in the adjusted earnings combined with our ongoing working capital initiatives. Through diligent cash flow management, our adjusted free cash flow totaled $1.9 billion for 2015.","As a result of our strong operating cash flow at the end of the year, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was less than 2x. We have no amounts outstanding on our $400 million AR facility or our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility, and we have full access to more than $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet.","As we look towards 2016, we remain fully committed to our investment grade credit rating, including after the successful completion of the offer to acquire Meda, and we continued to have ample borrowing capacity and financial flexibility. As a reminder, we have fully committed financing to fund the acquisition of Meda.","To summarize, we finished the year stronger than ever and began 2016 with ample financial flexibility. Our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results were outstanding, as we continue to experience the positive impact of the EPD business combined with the continued organic growth of our legacy business and the strength of our global operating platform.","I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv to review the Meda transaction in more detail.","Rajiv Malik","Thank you, John. At the outset, I would like to echo Heather's sentiments and say that I very much look forward to welcoming and working with Meda's leadership team and workforce. As Heather noted earlier, this transaction suit out to us, because Meda is an extraordinarily attractive strategic fit for Mylan.","We have always been active in evaluating many different strategic opportunities, looking for companies and assets that would compliment our existing strength and capabilities, make our company financially stronger and better position us to achieve our mission, strategy and sustainable growth. This acquisition delivers on all of those categories in a powerful way.","Meda is a highly profitable and durable business, delivering total sales of about $2.3 billion in 2015 and with estimated growth through 2018 of about 3% in revenues and about 5% in adjusted EBITDA. Meda brings us a very attractive portfolio, including about 900 branded OTC and generic products, with strong positions in respiratory, allergy, dermatology, pain and GI. Through this transaction, we are adding nearly 4,500 employees, including Meda's robust sales and marketing organization of more than 2,600 people with strong businesses in Europe, U.S. and exciting businesses in key emerging markets.","Meda also brings a complimentary network of seven manufacturing facilities in Europe, U.S. and India, which further strengthens our operating platform and provides us with nice capabilities in nasals, topicals, liquids and DPIs. While you can see that this is a very attractive asset, this is not just about what Meda is delivering on a standalone basis, but what we can do together. Let's look at that now.","On the next slide, you can begin to see what Mylan and Meda look like on a combined basis, and see how Meda further diversifies and strengthens our business by both geography and by channel. On a 2015 combined basis, we'll go from having two-thirds of our revenues from generics to generics making up just more than half of our business. Combined, our specialty business will represent more than a third of the business and OTC above 10%.","As you can see, the combined company will have a diversified portfolio of more than 2,000 branded OTC and generic products, and the addition of Meda's portfolio expands Mylan's branded and OTC portfolio in all regions. Geographically, we continue to enhance the balance of our business between North America, Europe and emerging markets, with an even larger European business and more diversified emerging markets business. Our continued focus on diversification across portfolio, channel and geography helps to both de-risk our platform and strengthen our ability to capitalize on our high-value future launches.","Turning to the next slide, you can see the diversity of this combined portfolio broken out by the sales contribution of each therapeutic area. To give you a sense of the enhanced scale, we'll have in key therapeutic categories, we expect to have six $1 billion franchises at close, respiratory\/allergy, GI, cardio, CNS, diabetes and metabolic and infectious disease.","Further, we will have significantly enhanced our presence in other areas such as dermatology, women's health, anesthesia and pain. We see a great deal of opportunity to begin building total patient and pharmacy solution around these franchises, given the breadth of our presence and ability to meet customer and patient needs.","On this next slide, you can get a sense of this portfolio and pipeline breadth and depth in some of these large strategic therapeutic categories across branded, generic and OTC products. First and foremost is our combined allergy\/respiratory franchise, where we see opportunities to really leverage our breadth and scale commercially with products, including EpiPen and Dymista, and position ourselves to maximize upcoming launches such as generic Advair and Revefenacin.","Derm is another exciting opportunity for us and One Mylan has been eager to expand in. As you can see Meda's branded portfolio with market leaders like Elidel, nicely complements Mylan's largely generics portfolio and provides opportunity to enhance our presence in this space across channels. Similarly, in pain, the Meda portfolio is complementary to Mylan's portfolio, which was enhanced significantly through the acquisition of our Abbott EPD business.","As you can see, these are leading durable brands that lie in Mylan's core areas of strategic focus. Meda enhances our already strong expertise and market knowledge in these areas, together we have the platform, capabilities, speed and agility to maximize these portfolios. In addition, the Meda business will benefit from our steadfast dedication to our robust R&D efforts, product innovation and the combined business will be fueled by Mylan's commitment to R&D and expansion of our product portfolio.","Again, this transaction delivers on one of Mylan's key strategic imperative comparatives, expansion in the OTC market, and Meda's strength in this area was an important differentiating factor for us, when evaluating this transaction. Meda has a substantial OTC presence in Europe and emerging markets, and an exciting platform for growth in U.S. This combination instantly creates $1 billion global OTC business and a foundation for further expansion.","I would like to note that Meda's portfolio is not a private label business. It's all branded OTC products, which yield much higher margins and it contains some very well-established and differentiated OTC brands.","We see many opportunities to leverage this OTC portfolio through our combined global platform. And we are confident in our ability to accelerate growth in this business through marketing and line expansions. Further, we see exciting possibilities for future business development and M&A. We'll continue to maintain our strategic and opportunistic approach in this regard.","Turning to the next slide, you can see how Meda will expand Mylan's geographic footprint. Meda provides us with entry into 16 new countries and builds real critical mass, commercially across Europe and emerging markets, while deepening our presence in Americas. The combined company will sell into more than 165 countries around the world with their direct commercial presence in about 60 markets. Our combined sales force will number approximately 5,900 people.","Looking at this map, you can see that we are increasing our sales headcount by about 50% in both Americas and Europe, and nearly doubling in emerging markets. Especially in Europe, we are adding very significantly to our manpower in critical growth markets, giving us a breadth and scale we need to continue building out our portfolio of products and services.","As we look at our enhanced and diversified geographic profile, we also believe we have an opportunity to optimize this infrastructure and accelerate our growth, especially our EPD business and across emerging markets.","On the next slide, you can see another differentiating factor for Mylan, and for the combined business, our unmatched manufacturing and supply chain platform. We are excited to deploy this platform to Meda and see opportunities for efficiencies and integration along the supply chain, providing opportunities for synergies.","With that, I would like to turn it back over to Tony to walk through in greater detail the geographies we are strengthening through this transaction.","Anthony Mauro","Thanks, Rajiv. I too would like to express enthusiasm for welcoming Meda's team to organization, and working alongside them to deliver better heath for a better world. As you have seen this combination creates an even strong commercial platform around the world.","On a next slide, you can see how Meda adds considerable strength and scale to already robust business in Europe. The combined company generated about $3.8 billion in 2015 revenues from Europe, about 60% more than Mylan would have had on a standalone basis. As you know, scale is very important in this reason giving the highly competitive market dynamics.","On the chart on the right, you can see that we have increased scale across each of our key European countries, with significant enhancements through our businesses in Germany, the Nordics, Italy and France among others. Meda's business complements and builds on the strengths of our EPD assets to create a deeper, stronger and more diversified platform across Europe that can further maximize market opportunities and weather challenges.","Meda also provides us with a strong and durable OTC business in Europe, which makes us a leader across all channels. I also note that the transaction consolidates EpiPen for us in Europe. Meda has been marketing this key product for us in the region for several years and we believe that bringing this product into our combined commercial infrastructure with a greater ability to leverage our global expertise in this area will allow us to drive greater performance from this product.","On the next slide, you will get a sense of how this transaction will dramatically accelerate Mylan's growth in emerging markets, while creating a diversified scale of business of $1.5 billion in 2015 pro forma revenues. The 16 new countries we're adding to this transaction are in the emerging market area, with Meda providing us entry into exciting new markets, such as China, Russia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Turkey and Mexico.","China has long been an area of interest for us, but we have been very deliberate about how we get into this market. We are pleased that Meda has a strong history in China, having established its business there in 1994 and that it has operated the business as an owned affiliate since 2011.","Importantly, Meda has a direct sales presence in many of these key markets, not relying on a contract sales organization in these important countries. For instance, Meda has reps on the ground in China, Russia and Turkey among other countries. Meda also has done a great job establishing strong brand in these markets. Some of the key ones are listed here and we look forward to leveraging our combined portfolio across the regions.","We see longer-term opportunities to bring Mylan's differentiated portfolio into these new markets, especially in infectious disease, biologics, insulin and women's health. While our presence in many of these markets is still small, it provides an exciting foothold and opportunities to build upon.","On the next slide, we come back to our core mission of providing access to 7 billion people. This combination means we will be better able to serve the evolving needs of our customers across all channels, while being able to offer them a greater diversity of products and by selling One Mylan around the world.","We have already seen the value of our One Mylan approach with EPD and our existing specialty and generic businesses, in terms of being able to leverage our powerful platform to bring more value to our customers through a broader range of products and services, and total patient and pharmacy solutions. Further, by working together across all our channels, we have been able to leverage commercial best practices in customer relationships to deliver more.","Now, John will walk you through the deal structure and resulting financial profile of Mylan.","John Sheehan","Thank you, Tony. Let me start by providing a quick overview of the transactions terms. This transaction is structured as a recommended public offer to the shareholders of Meda to tender all of their shares to Mylan. An announcement, the value is equal to a SEK165 for Meda's share, consisting about SEK132 in cash and the remainder in Mylan ordinary shares for a transaction value of approximately $9.9 billion. The Meda Board has recommended the offer and Meda shareholders representing approximately 30% of the outstanding shares has irrevocably committed to accept the offer.","As I mentioned earlier, we expect the transaction will close at the end of the third quarter of 2016, subject to receipt of typical regulatory clearances, acceptance to the offer by more than 90% of Meda's shareholders, and satisfaction of other customary conditions. The offer is not subject to any financing conditions or approval by Mylan shareholders.","As Heather outlined earlier, this transaction provides compelling financial benefits for shareholders and others stakeholders of both companies. As mentioned earlier, we see opportunity to accelerate the achievement of our $6 adjusted diluted EPS target to 2017. We also will complete the integration by the end of year three, realizing the full financial benefit of approximately $350 million in synergies in year four.","As you know, we have a proven track record of achieving our synergy targets, and we are confident that these synergies are highly achievable. As you can see on this next Slide, the transaction will deliver significant accretion with a CAGR from 2015 to 2017 of more than 18%.","Moving to the next slide. The implied multiples for this transaction are in line with relevant market precedents for scale high quality assets like Meda. As you can see, we expect the trailing synergized multiple of 8.9x.","On the following slide, you see just how Mylan will continue to have a very strong financial profile post-transaction, and that we are positioned for continued growth. We expect our pro forma leverage to be approximately 3.8x debt to adjusted EBITDA at transaction close. We also expect, we will maintain our investment-grade credit ratings, which again is an important attribute for any deal we pursue.","As you can see on the chart, we expect debt to adjusted EBITDA of less than 3x by the end of 2017. With our significant pre-cash flows, highly leverageable infrastructure and a competitive global tax structure, we continue to have the financial flexibility to competitively pursue the right additional opportunities as they arise. We intend to continue to serve as a leading consolidator in our industry in a way that meets our mission and business strategy, and continues to deliver value to our shareholders.","I would now like to walk through our financial guidance for 2016 in further detail. At the bottomline, we are projecting adjusted diluted EPS between $4.85 and $5.15 per share, the midpoint of which is an increase of 16% from 2015 adjusted diluted EPS. This EPS guidance range is based on the following income statement line item guidance metrics, all of which are on an adjusted basis with the exception of total revenues.","Total revenues are projected to be between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion, the midpoint of which is an increase of 16% from 2015 total adjusted revenues. This guidance range includes a quarter's work of contribution from Meda. However, we're also committed to these ranges without Meda. Excluding Meda, our generics business is expected to generate revenue growth of approximately 20% in 2016, while specialty is expected to generate revenue growth of approximately 8%.","Revenues from new business including Meda and EPD for the full year are expected to be between $800 million and $900 million, and the remaining increase in revenue will come equally from increased volumes on existing products and new product launches. Adjusted gross margins will increase again to be between 55% and 57%. Drivers of the increase include new product revenues and the strength of our North American generics business, as we continue to benefit from an improved product mix.","Adjusted SG&A will be between 19% and 20% of total revenues, which includes a full year impact of the EPD business. Adjusted R&D will be between 6% and 7% of total revenues, as we continue to invest in our future biologics, insulin and respiratory programs. Using these guidance metrics, we project adjusted EBITDA of between $3.5 billion and $4 billion. Also, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 17%.","Based upon the 2016 guidance metrics for adjusted operating cash flow of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion and capital expenditures between $400 million and $500 million, we're projecting adjusted free cash flow in the range of $2 billion to $2.1 billion.","Finally, we are projecting an average diluted share count of between 520 million and 530 million shares, which includes the weighted average shares issued for the acquisition of Meda and the settlement this April of the warrants related to the cash convertibles notes, which were cash settled in 2015.","As this chart demonstrates, our 2016 financial guidance provides significant operating leverage, including increasing adjusted growth and EBITDA margins, and declining adjusted R&D and SG&A as a percent of revenue resulting in our adjusted diluted EPS growth of 16%.","Looking at the bridge to 2016 revenue guidance, revenues from new product launches combined with volume growth and our base service will serve to offset price erosion on existing products. In terms of base pricing assumptions in the generic segment, as we traditionally have, we assume low-to-mid single-digit price erosion.","In specialty, we have assumed high-single digit growth in terms of pricing. We expect revenue from the Meda acquisition to contribute approximately $500 million to $600 million of incremental revenue in 2016. In addition, revenue from new business includes a full year impact of the EPD business. As mentioned previously, our 2016 guidance FX rates do not result in a significant year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on our 2016 revenue guidance range.","This chart provides a projected bridge between our 2015, actual 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.30, and the midpoint of our 2016 guidance range of $5, showing a year-over-year increase of 16%.","New product launches from our legacy business and to a lesser extent margin expansion will drive our earnings growth in 2016. Partially offsetting this earnings growth will be increased investment in R&D spending and higher interest expense largely due to the financing of the Meda acquisition.","From a phasing perspective, we expect the quarterly development of our EPS for 2016 to be similar to 2015 with Q1 being relatively flat to the prior year, Q3 being our highest quarter of the year and followed next by Q4.","That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Heather.","Heather Bresch","Thank you, John. Well, as promised, we delivered a lot of great news today. And as our track record suggests, we have been consistent in our philosophy of making acquisitions based on the belief that we can do more together than they could do on a standalone basis. Meda is no different, and we believe we can do more with this asset than they could alone, and we see significant opportunities for accelerated growth.","Further, by successfully executing on our vision and strategy for the past decade, we have delivered exceptional results for our shareholders with an earnings CAGR of 26% through 2016. Again, with this Meda transaction, we have the opportunity to accelerate our 2018 earnings target of $6 and adjusted diluted EPS to 2017.","I now look forward to taking your questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Chris Schott","I guess, just two here. First, what type of organic growth should we expect from the Meda assets over the next few years? I think it's a business where a lot of us are just trying to get their hands around, and just how fast do you think you can grow the topline for these acquired assets?","And the second one is just to elaborate on the price paid here. It does seem like a large premium, particularly in this market. I know it's strategic, I know it brings accretion, but just again, how did get comfortable with this type of price given the current market dynamics out there?","Heather Bresch","I'll start, and then I'll let Rajiv weigh in a little bit on the business. I think it's important to first point out that we certainly don't make long-term decisions that will create shareholder value on short-term price fluctuations, and I think that certainly there is significant macro-dynamics that play with the market today. I think we see that systemically across, especially the healthcare sector.","And I think that we were fortunate to have a very high-quality process and have the ability to do due diligence, and the more we dug, the more comfortable we are not only with the strategic and the compelling rationale, but as I mentioned, it even then was much more enhanced with their addition of Rottapharm, which we had looked at several years ago and very much liked that asset as well as our Abbott EPD business and how that's going to allow us to really leverage infrastructure in Europe as well as bringing on 16 additional countries, where we'll be able to now have infrastructure to lever the Mylan current portfolio as well as pipeline.","So the strategic and fundamentals of the company have not changed. And when you look at just over the last couple of months like I said, I think it's much more to the macro-dynamics. And we believe the long-term decisions are much more in line when you look at the multiples. They are very much in line for assets such as this scarce high-quality. And so we believe the value really speaks for itself of what we're creating for shareholders and what this combination can do going forward, and like you said, immediately accretive.","Rajiv Malik","And I think, Heather, you answered it all. The other part of the question is not so relevant, they don't stand alone, and a topline is 3% projected growth with the 5% growth on EBITDA. But as Heather mentioned, that's not much relevant, because the pooling effect we see between our Rx, Gx, OTC channels are leveraging this platform from the geographic point of view, exciting opportunities, its presence also on the emerging markets. So we see a lot more to this than just standalone growth of 3%.","Heather Bresch","And I think just lastly, it's important to note that it's not the trading multiple right now, if I go back to what's happening in the environment, it's the deal transaction multiples, which I think even in times where there is a lot of volatility in the marketplace, you don't really historically see those change to the transaction multiples or translating the transaction multiples.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin","Just a follow-up on the question concerning price, Heather. It does seem like a lot of money to pay just to accelerate your earnings growth to $6 by 2017. Can you now update your -- I think you had said before, you expect to do at least $6 by 2018. Now, with Meda in-hand, can you at least sort of update what you expect the earnings progression to look like with this asset in-hand over the next three years, say, out to 2020? That would be helpful.","And also, John or Heather, can you just enlighten us on what exactly happened with EpiPen this quarter? In terms of the pricing dynamics, you had mentioned that you expected those dynamics to continue into 2016, what changed?","Heather Bresch","So let me start with the $6 being the opportunity to accelerate the $6 into 2017 versus 2018. That by no means -- that's just a beginning of what Meda and Mylan combination will bear. I think importantly, not only does it accelerate near-term accretion and shareholder value, but over the longer-term I think as we've said, the strategic rationale speaks for itself. The complimentary nature of the product portfolio will now have over 2,000 products across multiple geographies, expansion into emerging markets to allow us more leverage.","Our portfolio, when you look over the next 10 years to our biologics, insulin, I mean the opportunities to truly maximize these launches in these territories with this infrastructure is just, in our opinion, going to be unparalleled. I think that Mylan will be positioned as a truly diversified global generic and specialty pharmaceutical company that's able to deliver through our unprecedented global supply chain.","To be able now to apply that, and in addition, to now have the kind of commercial infrastructure and operational infrastructure that will allow us to continue to add on whether it's other dosage forms, we've talked about everything from derm to ophthalmic to new therapeutic category.","So honestly, we just see the $6 in 2017 as the beginning to continuing the growth trajectory that our shareholders have enjoyed over the last 10 years. And certainly, as we close the transaction and we move forward, we will be giving continued guidance and updating the longer-term trajectory. But I can assure you that this platform will continue to deliver as it has in the past.","As far as EpiPen, Jami, I think that I tried throughout 2015, especially in beginning of the year to point out that Mylan have been very proactive in maintaining our market share in a very competitive multi-epinephrine marketplace. And that involve entering contracts with our payers, long-term multi-year contracts.","And I think then when the unprecedented event of Auvi-Q having to do a complete product recall, while we absolutely enjoyed volume increases, and we see obviously that continuing through 2016, what I pointed out is the net price from the payer was mainly what it had been throughout 2015 and we don't see that materially changing.","I mean, I think it's important to remember that we're dealing with a whole portfolio of products with these payers that it's not about any one product. And while we will continue to be opportunistic, I think that as I've said, EpiPen, very important brand for us and brand franchise going forward, that it more and more represents as a much smaller part of Mylan. And certainly, now with the Mylan and Meda combination, again the diversification is taking away from any concentration from any one product.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein.","Ronny Gal","I have just two points of puzzle, I mean, I'm sorry I'm kind of trading a little bit on what people have said already. You were saying about $10 billion on Meda and your market cap is about $25 billion today. So you're generating about 10% accretion level. Well, if you've just taken the same amount of money and bought back shares, you would have bought back 40% of your share comp.","So yes, maybe it's not that efficient, but it looks likes there's a huge miss adjustment here between what you can do with the shares, buying back shares, rather what you do with your transactions. So I'm kind of struggling with it, unless you are seeing some fantastic growth going forward for the Meda asset, it's hard for me to see it working.","And then, if you don't mind, I'll sneak in two more. On EpiPen, I distinctly remember conversation with the management team including Robert, when I was told specifically about you guys that now that Auvi-Q is out of the market, you're in a great position to drive a higher net price from EpiPen. So is this -- if you can comment more broadly on what have changed from that perspective?","And last and this is more for Rajiv. Rajiv, you guys kind of mentioned, or Tony, you guys kind of mentioned a beachhead in additional market. I kind of took a look through the Meda statements, presentation for the third quarter, I mean they've got $60 million or so in Mexico, if we just take the third quarter and multiply it by four they've got $30 million Russia. It sounds like all of those businesses are kind of like borderline profitable. Is that enough of a beachhead for you? It sounds like it will take several years before you guys can really turn those business into profitability.","Heather Bresch","Well, Ronny, you certainly maximize one question. So let me start with the overall, again, coming back to Mylan and our philosophy on uses of capital. I think we've been very clear that we are opportunistic. I think the board is constantly looking at buybacks and everything else in the marketplace.","So with that being said, we've also very much focused on growing topline, as well as bottomline and striking that right balance. So I think when you think over the longer-term and the value to shareholders, there is much more value in continuing to build a sustainable platform that's going to deliver out into perpetuity versus the short-term centric viewpoint of just looking at share buybacks and isolation from any kind of M&A or BB activity.","John Sheehan","And I guess, Ronny, I'd also point out, and I'm sure you appreciate that Mylan cannot go out and borrow $10 billion, maintaining it's investment grade credit rating and doing share repurchase program. The $10 billion also comes with all of the EBITDA and earnings that Meda has. So I'm not sure necessarily that there is an apples-to-apples of $10 billion acquisition versus $10 billion of share repurchase, that's not realistic.","Heather Bresch","And as far as EpiPen is concerned, Ronny, I obviously were in many, if not, all those meetings, I never remember discussing that price. I think what we did say is that we were very proactive, and I had very, I think, very straightforward conversations with all of the investors and shareholders that we were maintaining market share, and to do so that requires aggressive rebating, and that's why, that we absorbed much of that during 2015.","And so when the Auvi-Q recall happened, we absolutely had the opportunity to not only increase our market share and increase volumes, we're continuing to invest to increase the overall market. We still think there is runway room around growing the anaphylaxis market. But nothing has changed. And that's why I wanted to point out that those contracts are in place and we'll continue to, like I said, be opportunistic. But that's on EpiPen, Rajiv?","Rajiv Malik","And on markets, I think I would like to, again, say, it's not about what Meda had done on standalone, but Russia $35 million, for example, or Mexico, these are nice entry points for us to load or download our own portfolio and what we bring, because we have been incubating product portfolio in all of these markets and we were looking forward to create a infrastructure. And we know what we have done with the foothold in Brazil and we are on a nice trajectory over there. So for us these are nice entry points into these markets, which we have been looking forward to build upon.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert","I have a few, hopefully, quick easy ones. First of all, you've mentioned a couple of times you've submitted generic Advair. Can you comment on whether it's been accepted or not for filing? And secondly, Heather and Tony, any change in pricing dynamics in the U.S. generics market late last year, early this? I know, you're forecasting a similar to how you've done in the past, but any interesting sort of color you can provide on whether things are changing on the margin or not or have changed, that would be helpful.","And lastly, Heather, what are your M&A priorities? I know, we just announced the new deal, but the company has gone to great lengths to talk about continued flexibility. So are we looking to just shop for while, but not buy, what are your priorities over the next six to 12 months on M&A beyond convincing folks that Meda is the right deal?","Rajiv Malik","Gregg, yes, we've submitted generic Advair application towards the end of December and we expect to hear from FDA anytime now.","Anthony Mauro","And as it relates, Gregg, to your question on pricing, we believe that your U.S. generic-based business will continue to be stable for 2016. I think John had articulated low-to-mid single-digit range. And we feel very good about our generics business and the stability of it moving forward.","Heather Bresch","And as far as M&A is concerned, we absolutely, as I mentioned, still looking at assets out there that would now just even be that much more complementary with the global infrastructure we have. And as I have mentioned, whether it's dosage forms around our dermatology or ophthalmic, and also therapeutic categories, that we still believe we have a great opportunities to build out critical mass now across all these channels, Rx, Gx and OTC.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","So my question is on EpiPen and then the guidance please. With respect to EpiPen, obviously the sales growth was dramatically below the Rx growth due to pricing. My question is with respect to the contracts that you mentioned, Heather, maybe you could just provide a little bit more color on the length of those?","I'm assuming that you may have contracted more aggressively to potentially blunt the risk of Teva generic EpiPen launch. Just wondering if that is a realistic assumption that I'm making that you were considering that when you priced more aggressively. And then just a quick tidbit of a question, in terms of your $6 number for 2017, does that include an assumed launch of generic Advair?","Heather Bresch","So I guess let met start with EpiPen. Price volume was no different in Q4 from other quarters of the year. So I'm not quite sure what you're referencing there. As far as the contracts that I mentioned, look we were -- as I mentioned in 2015, the aggressiveness came from the current multi-epinephrine market and the players that were in there including Auvi-Q and Sanofi.","So like I said, we were maintaining market share. And I think where a bit of a disconnect came as that people believe the once Auvi-Q was recalled, that the world would go back to pre there never have been an Auvi-Q in the market. And it's a very unprecedented event that I don't know that really has ever happened before.","And so I think as we look forward, we said we're managing our whole portfolio of products with these payers. The contracts are all different in nature, and so certainly we're not going to comment on any individual contract. I'm just trying to get some flavor to and feeling that EpiPen is an extremely important brand franchise. We think it has great brand equity and it will be an important franchise for us for years to come. It's just more and more represents a much less portion of Mylan's overall business, and especially our now combined Mylan and Meda front.","John Sheehan","I think that your other question, David, with respect to 2017, as we've previously indicated, we expect to receive approval for being able to launch generic Advair in 2017, and with all other products we consider the risk weighting of that product and when providing our guidance. So yes, we do expect to launch the product in 2017, and yes, it is on a risk-weighted basis included in the guidance or target -- sorry, I don't want to use the word guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao from Barclays.","Douglas Tsao","Just Heather, you've spoken about wanting to be a consolidator in the industry, and we've seen with first Perrigo and then obviously what this deal, the Perrigo offer and then this deal, sort of the moving to OTC. Just curious in terms of how you're defining consolidator? I mean should we be thinking within generics or more broadly outside of generics?","And then just also a couple, another follow-up in terms of the thinking behind the partnership with Momenta, and maybe talk a little bit about what they can provide that you couldn't get from your ongoing partnership with Biocon? And then, just one quick, maybe John, if you can provide some commentary on the trends in EPD versus the third quarter on a constant currency basis, that'd be great?","Heather Bresch","So let me start with the consolidator. You're absolutely right, we have said that we will continue to be a consolidator in the industry. And look I think that you should consider us as continuing to diversify. I think as we said OTC was an important channel, this certainly puts us a great leap forward and is starting to delve a foundation for OTC, but I think importantly its also diversification around reimbursement.","So as you look at the different models from payers and across the different geographies, that continue diversification amongst channels, amongst geographies and with Rx, Gx and OTC. So again, the beautiful and powerful thing about now this combination is the infrastructure we have in place to truly maximize now products that we can pull-through through any of this channel.","So I think it's extremely exciting and I think it gives us more opportunity to have more accretive, strategic acquisitions to now bolt-on to the platform. I'll let Rajiv comment on Momenta?","Rajiv Malik","On Momenta, I think Biocon is focused on seven to eight programs, which are between now and 2022, and we found Momenta programs, some of those programs, they already initiated some of these products, which are beyond 2022, so we then need to put all our eggs into one basket. It was a product not just focusing our passing with Biocon, but we've been focused on the products, and the pipeline and we found Momenta to be a right partner and able partner in this phase.","John Sheehan","And lastly, Doug, on your question, surrounding the EPD business and the revenue of 2% up for the year, I tell you we couldn't be happier with that. You recall that in Abbott's hand the EPD business was declining mid-single digits 4%, 5% per year.","And we had indicated last year when we were acquiring the business that our objective was to get to stabilize, get to sales back to breakeven in terms of maintaining stability, and quite honestly we did that in less than a year, and so at 2% growth year-over-year on a constant currency basis for that business, I think we're very pleased with that.","Yes, in the third quarter we saw year-over-year for that quarter alone 5% growth, but as we've said at that time, one quarter does not make a trend make, and so I think a longer term view here of a full year of positive too is a much better indicator of the strength of that business and what it did for us in our hands this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of [ph] Sumit Kulkarni from Bank of America.","Unidentified Analyst","First, what are your assumptions on the timing of entry of generics in EpiPen and on the potential re-entry of Sanofi's Auvi-Q Second, could you break down the components of synergies and could you confirm if there are any revenue synergies built into your $6 EPS target? And third for, Rajiv, has your Restasis ANDA being accepted for filing by the FDA?","Heather Bresch","So as far as EpiPen is considered, we are factoring and are assuming a [ph] BX approval in the second half of the year. Again, I think we've been pretty vocal on the high par that we believe in AB-rated claims. But anyway those are the assumptions that are built into our 2016.","And as far as Auvi-Q again, I think it was an extremely unprecedented action that took place. And all I can say is I think it's unprecedented to try to come back from something like that. But again, I don't want to say for Sanofi, but we certainly haven't heard anything about them contemplating any kind of re-entry. Rajiv you want to head on penetration?","Rajiv Malik","The synergies pretty dominantly are based on the cost structure, the G&As, the sales and marketing as well as the cost of goods. And about your question on the Restasis, yes, we received our acceptance and it's under active review. In fact, we received our acceptance in the middle of 2015.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman from UBS.","Marc Goodman","First thing is, Europe just seems a little weak in total, I mean even if you include FX. So I was hoping maybe you could just give us some sense of what happened in some of the countries, some of your key countries? And the U.K., France, Italy, where were you strong, where you weak and just relatively?","And then, I just want to make sure we're clear on the U.S. pricing. Can you just tell us in 2015 for the whole year, where did the base business U.S. pricing come in? Was it flat for the year? Was it in fact low-to-mid single-digit? I think what you were saying is you started the year with '15 guidance of low-to-mid single-digit decline and that's why you're keeping the same guidance for '16. But I'm curious, how did they come in '15? And then just remind us how do they come in '14 for the full year, U.S. base business pricing?","Heather Bresch","So Rajiv, do you want to take Europe?","Rajiv Malik","So Europe, I think in our key countries, which is Italy -- France, we didn't see in the last quarter a huge growth, but we didn't see any losing of the market share. Italy, we saw some good growth. U.K. was very strong, in fact about 30% growth. So we don't see any weakness in our key European countries per se, and as we said, one quarter doesn't make a trend.","Heather Bresch","And as far as I guess pricing, the only thing I'll point out, then I can let Tony weigh in, is that I think Marc you know that driving pricing has never been a driver. We've been I think a very responsible generic player with hundreds of products into the market and have shown very responsibly price erosion. We've said it's a very competitive marketplace. There has been opportunities that we've had over the course of time, but certainly never a driver of our generics business whatsoever.","Anthony Mauro","And then I think just to add certainly in 2014 and 2015 the market was relatively flat from a base business perspective. There were moments of opportunity and certainly at the same time a moment of deflationary activity happens everyday in our business. So like I said earlier, I feel very good about where our business is at. I feel it's very stable from an erosive perspective and that's about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur from Raymond James.","Elliot Wilbur","And congratulations Heather and the team on the Meda deal. I know that's an asset that's been in your sight for a while. And I guess looking at combination of all the pieces, all geographically in terms of assets, where it looks like a very strong transaction for the company. Obviously, there is concerns about price, but I want to focus on another issue and just go back to some of Rajiv's commentary with respect to growth, and make sure that I understand this correctly. So the business basically currently is doing about $2.3 billion and then projected growth is around 3% topline and 5% adjusted EBITDA. I want to confirm those metrics and see whether that adjusted EBITDA growth in fact does include -- if that's a fully synergized growth target?","And then just thinking about those metrics, while the asset is or the purchase is accretive to numbers, and again, strategically it looks very attractive. I mean, it clearly is growth dilutive. So I'm just wondering, how you thought about that concept relative to potential impact on valuation and multiple versus the potential long-term attractiveness of the platform?","Heather Bresch","Sure. Thank you, Elliot. And first, thank you. I think that your ability to see the strategic compellingness of this transaction, the scarcity of this kind of a high-quality asset, I applaud you for your vision. And what I would say as far as when we think about the value, again, I think it's important to know before -- I'll turn it over to Rajiv to get a little bit more into the business. But I think it's very important to know, again, it's not what Meda is doing on a standalone basis. And the metrics that you quoted is just that Meda on a standalone basis.","I think that what's important is now with the combination of Mylan, what we can do together combining Meda with our platform. Across the board, when you look from an operational and supply chain and commercial, I mean now that expertise and experience across the multiple geographies and including giving us a foothold in the 16 new markets, it truly just becomes a portal for us to leverage every launch, every asset, every acquisition from this point forward that much more.","So truly the long-term value of this is the continuation of what we've done over the last 10 years. And I know that we view the strategic transaction that sometimes in the moment is lost on how we're going to deliver that value, but I think if you look at our 26% CAGR through 2016, it becomes -- hopefully our track record speaks for itself, and it becomes evident that we deliver and do what we say we're going to do, which is be able to continue to maximize these assets, optimize this platform and continue our growth trajectory into the foreseeable future. So again, Elliot, I can't thank you enough. And Rajiv?","Rajiv Malik","Yes, let me reconfirm that the 3% topline growth and 5% adjusted EBITDA growth was on a standalone basis. We also confirm during due diligence that they are key countries like U.S., Germany, Italy, France, Sweden and Spain, all emerging markets especially. And their key products, Dymista, Dona, Betadine, Elidel and ArmoLIPID, all are showing steady growth over the next few years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Finkelstein from Susquehanna Financial.","Andrew Finkelstein","A couple clarifications on the guidance. When you talk about the ranges being valid with or without Meda, and you gave some quantification of the potential Meda contribution. I mean is the whole range in consideration without Meda or should we think of the top-end as being something that would exclusively be with the deal?","Then on the Momenta collaboration. Could you clarify if the milestones that are going to be paid, I think it's about $100 million this year, are those included in your non-GAAP spending or excluded? And then if we think about the 20 -- if we talk back to the synergies, if we could just go through how those were determined and where there may be opportunities for upside as you get into the combined platform?","Heather Bresch","Look, I think as far as the guidance ranges question -- regarding the guidance range, that's why obviously we do give a range. And we're committed to those ranges, with or without Meda. I think importantly, to note, we're assuming one quarter contribution. So yes, I would say it's safe to assume that if all those assumptions are accurate and we have a full quarter of contribution that certainly look at the topline of the range. It could be near the top-end of the range. And obviously, from the bottomline, would have that opportunity to be above our midpoint.","But again, I think that since we're only talking about one quarter, we wanted to be clear that we were committed to those ranges. And as I often say, all good things don't happen at the same time in this business, and all bad things don't happen at the same time in that business. And that we have a multiple moving pieces in parts that certainly could have us within that range without Meda. And I think as we have done historically, as the year progresses and as events and things become more certain, we're able to either hone in or adjust or update those ranges and we'll continue to do so.","As far as just, again, I'm going to say overall synergies, and then I'll let John and Rajiv weigh-in more in detail, but I guess I do have to go back and just remind people of the track record. I think we have over-delivered on every synergy target we've ever put out there back, starting with Merck. And so our ability, as I mentioned, not only did we have the opportunity to do due diligence and meetings with the management team, and truly really understand what these platforms could do together. And like I said, I hope our track record speaks for itself on integration and execution.","Rajiv Malik","And I would say that synergies are from combined assets when you bring two assets together. We have a fairly good information about their cost structure, our cost structure. And as I said, these synergies are driven mostly from cost structure, the cost of goods, the G&A, the selling and marketing infrastructure as well as some cross-fertilization.","Do we see upsides? Absolutely. We have not been able to put our arms around that what that number, but we believe that there will be a huge pooling effect, we'll be able to cross-leverage the portfolio, do more with these markets and we'll come back to you as we learn more about the asset.","John Sheehan","And then, I'll close with respect to the milestones. Milestones that we have in conjunction with collaboration, such as the one with Momenta, are considered a component of the acquisition cost of the product. And as such are not included in our adjusted income or income statement, but rather are capitalized as part of the cost of the acquisition of the products.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Tim Chang from BTIG.","Tim Chang","Heather, could you talk a little bit about the international opportunity for EpiPen? I mean, I was looking at some of Meda's sales figures and it looks like EpiPen, I mean it's not growing as much as is its -- it doesn't seem like its actually growing. Could you talk about what you guys plan to do with EpiPen outside the U.S. to grow that product?","Heather Bresch","So Tim I think, look, the opportunity is really more fantastic than as it relates to EpiPen. For us, I would say we're sharing this product between three companies. Pfizer manufactures the product, and then Mylan owns the EpiPen, and then Meda was our partner in Europe. So just the opportunity to contract back down to two, certainly makes the financial dynamics much more attractive.","And obviously, throughout Europe, the certain dynamics around pricing and again being multi-epinephrine marketplaces in many of those countries certainly had made challenges in continuing to grow that product. I think now in our hands, when you look at the infrastructure with the combined Abbott EPD business and now with Meda, we are going to have much further reach and be able to I think even invest in a much different way than Meda as a third-party partner was able to do.","So not only do I see it throughout Europe as an opportunity, but as we continue to look and add enhancements and how we bring EpiPen to the market and various other regions around the world, we do see like I said, a lot of opportunity even outside of Europe with the rest of the world, as we continue to invest around EpiPen and the awareness of anaphylaxis.","Well, thank you everyone. Appreciated all the questions, and look forward to seeing you soon.","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Melissa Trombetta, Head of Global Investor Relations. You may begin.","Melissa Trombetta - Mylan NV","Thank you, Gigi. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Mylan's second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; Chief Commercial Officer, Tony Mauro; and Chief Financial Officer, Ken Parks.","During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial guidance for 2018. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from today's projections.","Please refer to the earnings release we furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K earlier this morning, as well as our supplemental earnings slides, all of which are posted on our website at investor.mylan.com for a fuller explanation of those risks and uncertainties and the limits applicable to forward-looking statements.","Mylan routinely posts information that may be important to investors on this website, and we use this website address as a means of disclosing material information to the public in a broad, non-exclusionary manner for purposes of the SEC's Regulation Fair Disclosure.","In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We will refer to these measures as adjusted and present them in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measures, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to those GAAP measures, are available in our second quarter earnings release and supplemental earnings slides as well as on our website.","Let me also remind you that the information discussed during this call, with the exception of the participants' questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's express written permission. An archived copy of today's call will be available on our website and will remain available for a limited time.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Heather.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. A year ago we identified what we saw as an inflection point for U.S. healthcare. At the time, we said that each company's intersection with that point would be unique, including Mylan. We have continued to approach our industry's evolution from a firm foundation fueled by the fight to provide the world's 7 billion people access to medicine.","But during the second quarter, this effort took on new forms, which we believe points to our own inflection point within the industry's broader transformation.","As we've said, our ability to deliver access to medicine is predicated on the continued diversification of our portfolio and geography reach. Investments in these areas in turn drive our durability, which allow us to withstand inevitable headwinds.","The fundamentals of our global business remains strong. However, there is no doubt we are witnessing a continued rebasing of the entire U.S. pharmaceutical system. Two years ago EpiPen gave us the opportunity to begin the dialogue about the reality of gross to net in our industry and its impact on the patient experience at the pharmacy counter, which is why we launched a generic at half the price against our own brand.","Today, I believe time has shown that EpiPen was not a window into Mylan's business model, but rather a window into a broken and opaque system. The fact that the President's blueprint to lower drug prices recognizes systemic supply chain issues, and that a single tweak can result in the reversal of several price increases, further exemplifies the difference two years have made.","While the dialogue has evolved tremendously, actions by market participants to improve the U.S. healthcare environment have been less productive. A significant reason for this I believe is that the business of healthcare and the public company framework in which it is conducted have created entrenched interests that have no incentive to course correct themselves.","In fact, we see troubling trends that are doubling down on the current system instead of creating and embracing necessary changes that put the patient's interest first. From continued vertical consolidation to afforded generic utilization of the country's most expensive drugs, we believe current market practices are not sustainable.","Market uptake of our Glatiramer Acetate Injection is a prime example of supply chain tactics capping generic utilization at 15% when two substitutable products have been available for nearly a year. Last year we launched our Glatiramer Acetate with a traditional approach. And for nearly nine months we worked within the system to increase access to no avail.","More recently, we've taken unconventional steps to increase access. If these steps do not prevail, we will make further moves to do our part where we can to reinstate the necessary balance between innovation and access, as this balance has historically been the one aspect of the pharmaceutical industry to simultaneously drive trillions in savings while ensuring patient access to medicine.","Our experience with Copaxone is representative of the perverse incentives embedded in the current system. Even after substantially lowering the price of our product, the supply chain chooses a higher priced alternative. This provides evidence that the business of healthcare feeds on higher prices, frequently putting system interest ahead of patients.","Rest assured, we will continue to be vocal about measures to improve the current environment. We will also apply strategic learnings to our commercial planning in this period leading up to our generic Advair launch.","Our results and our guidance for 2018 are directly correlated with the turbulence in the U.S. and the disturbing trends regarding access to complex products.","Ironically, our commodity products and core U.S. business has met, if not exceeded, expectations. Our investments in complex products and biosimilars on the other hand have disappointed in the near term. But we believe longer term will continue to drive our growth globally and eventually in the U.S. once balance is restored.","Our rebased guidance of $4.55 to $4.90 incorporates the best visibility we have around complex product launch and utilization assumptions in the U.S, resizing of U.S. product opportunity, and remediation of our Morgantown facility.","Europe and Rest of World continued to deliver and be in line with our expectation.","While the U.S. market continues to rebase over the next couple of years, we are actively exploring other metrics that could provide better insight into our global performance.","As I stated earlier, our fundamentals are intact and our confidence in executing on our long stated global strategy is especially pronounced as we're continuing to forecast growth in ex-U.S. markets where more than 60% of our business resides.","Over the past several quarters, we have highlighted our Built to Last platform and how it differentiates us from our peers. However, we continue to believe there is a fundamental disconnect between the strength of our global profile and the valuation of our security.","I'm excited about today's announcement by the board, direct -regarding a strategic review committee, which has been formed with independent directors and is chaired by our lead independent director, Mark Parrish, to look into all alternatives to unlock value.","Rajiv is going to walk through a couple of updates. And Ken will cover some of the financials in more detail. And then we will take Q& A. But first, please allow me to thank our employees around the world for their unwavering dedication and commitment to Mylan. Thanks to our board, our management team, and our colleagues around the globe. Our foundation and future have never been stronger.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rajiv.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Thank you, Heather. Before I get into a few product specific updates, I would like to offer a general perspective on our experience with the approval process for the complex products.","We have a proven track record in getting many complex generic and biosimilar products across the finish line and approved by FDA and other international regulators. We believe strongly that continuing to secure approvals on these types of products in our pipeline is not so much a question of if, but rather when.","While our confidence in the science and the robustness of our application is unwavering, our ability to reliably predict timing of certain U.S. approvals has been challenged by FDA's evolving review approach, especially in the case of complex generics.","At the same time, we are pleased to experience the process for biosimilar approval, which is much more predictable and reliable.","We are also keenly aware that providing this much transparency about the timing of these approvals and launches can have unintended consequences, especially regarding the market dynamics. Given destability and market factors, we are reviewing our approach regarding the level of detail we provide publicly around the timing of individual product submissions and approvals.","I would now like to spend the next few minutes providing updates on select developments from the quarter. Let's start with generic Advair.","I would like to confirm that we received a minor complete response letter on June 27, which only included labeling and CMC comments. There were no outstanding questions (10:18) clinical, biocleanse (10:19), and facilities.","We quickly responded to the CRL in mid-July, as it required no additional data generation and substantially focused on clarification of existing data.","The agency assigned a minor amendment goal date of a standard three-month period following a CRL response. Because this product has received a priority designation, we remain hopeful that FDA will prioritize this review and complete it earlier than our assigned goal date. We continue to be ready with supply and are prepared to launch upon receipt of approval.","Moving on to generic receptors. We recently received a complete response letter from FDA that requests minor clarifications to the CMC. And we have already submitted our response. As already confirmed, this is not a meaningful financial driver, but it is an opportunity to provide accessible and affordable quality product to the patient.","Now on to Mylan's Fulphila, which is the first FDA approved biosimilar to Neulasta, and the second biosimilar for Mylan and Biocon's client portfolio approved in the U.S. We launched the product in July and are very proud to lead the first wave of biosimilar introduction in the U.S. Our launch has included a suite of services to further support patients and caregivers with a treatment.","We expect a gradual, but sustainable uptake with the product. And we continue to ramp up our capacity as we expand our launch. So far the launch has been in line with our expectations, which have been recalibrated based on our experience with other complex product launches.","I would like to now address EpiPen supply. Unfortunately, our manufacturing partner, Pfizer, continues to experience interruptions in the production of EpiPen. Currently, Pfizer supplies to Mylan are inconsistent and inadequate in meeting global demand, including in the U.S. As a result, supplies will continue to vary from pharmacy to pharmacy and may not always be available.","We appreciate how important it is for individuals with a life threatening allergy to have access to epinephrine auto injectors and understand the challenges this situation continues to pose for patients. We are actively exploring every option with Pfizer that would help stabilize supply and are in regular dialogue with FDA and other health authorities around the world.","I'll now provide the latest update on our sites in Morgantown and Nashik. Mylan has always been and remains committed to maintaining the highest quality manufacturing standards at its facilities around the world. At the end of the June, we released a statement confirming that the FDA had completed a recent inspection in Morgantown and made observations in a Form 483. We have submitted a comprehensive response to FDA and are committed to a robust remediation and improvement plan.","As a result of FDA's evolving regulatory expectations, our commitment to maintain high quality standards has left changing industry dynamics. We have undertaken a restructuring and remediation program in Morgantown during the second quarter of 2018. The program, which includes a discontinuation of a number of products, is aimed at reducing complexity at the facility.","These actions have temporarily had a negative impact on production levels, product supplies, and operations. However, long term these actions will only further strengthen our Morgantown site.","As for Nashik, I'm happy to inform you that our warning letter has been lifted, and we are operating business as usual.","I would also like to share a few thoughts on the performance of our global commercial platform. U.S., the largest pharmaceutical market in the world, continues to be a very meaningful market for Mylan, despite some of the current challenges and headwinds Heather talked about.","The fundamentals of our business, which include our portfolio, our pipeline, our global supply chain, and our customer relationships in the U.S.A. remain strong. These are the attributes that give us the strength, durability and ability to withstand the current headwinds and evolving industry dynamics in this very important market.","Our Europe and Rest of the World businesses are on track. And we continue to see consolidated high single digit growth in 2018. Our global key brands like Creon, Influvac, DYMISTA, DONA (15:38) and our ARV businesses remain solid.","These visions are further fueled by our new complex product launches, such as Glatiramer Acetate; Semglee, our biosimilar to insulin blocking; Hulio, our biosimilar to Humira; and Hertraz, our biosimilar to Herceptin. We also continue to strengthen this diverse portfolio with the complementary bolt-on business development opportunity.","Before handing the call over to Ken, who will walk you through the financial metrics in more detail, I would like to thank our employees all over the world for their commitment to Mylan and the patients we serve. Thank you.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","Thanks, Rajiv, and good morning, everyone. I'll take a few minutes to provide a quick overview of our financial results for the second quarter.","Total revenues of $2.8 billion were 5% lower than the prior year. Europe, which was up 4%, and Rest of World, which was up 10%, helped to partially offset a 22% decline in North America driven by lower volumes on existing products including EpiPen and primarily driven by the timing of purchases of our products by our customers and the impact of the restructuring and remediation program in our Morgantown manufacturing facility.","Adjusted net earnings declined 7% to $551 million. And adjusted diluted EPS decreased 3% to $1.07 during the quarter, which includes benefits from a lower share count following the completion of our $1 billion share repurchase program at the beginning of this year.","Moving to segment profitability. Excluding approximately $87 million of expenses related to the Morgantown restructuring and remediation program, North America adjusted segment profitability declined 28%, primarily as a result of the volume declines in sales from existing products.","Europe's profitability declined 6% during the quarter, driven by slightly lower pricing and volumes, partially offset by the contribution from new product sales. I'll remind you that the new product launches and seasonal products are weighted more heavily to the second half of 2018, therefore driving more growth in Europe in the balance of the year.","Rest of World profitability expanded 26%, mostly driven by new product sales including those in our ARV franchise along with emerging market growth. Both Europe and Rest of World continued to benefit from our ongoing integration activities, as we execute on our plans to further optimize our cost structure.","We also continued to invest in areas such as sales and marketing, as we focus on driving growth in several of our global key brands.","Adjusted free cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2018, totaled $1.3 billion. That's an increase of 22% compared to the prior year and reflects favorable working capital performance and lower capital expenditures.","First half 2018 adjusted free cash flow conversion was healthy at approximately 126% of adjusted net earnings, another measure of the strength and durability of the cash flow generating capability of our business.","During the quarter, we completed a \u20ac500 million bond offerings. These proceeds of this offering combined with those from our $1.5 billion offering in April were used to repay a portion of debt maturing in 2018 and 2019.","By extending debt maturities coupled with our strong cash flow generation, we further strengthened our capital structure and increased our financial flexibility, as we continue to execute on our business plan for 2018 and beyond.","Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at June 30 was approximately 3.9 times. That's in line with the previous quarter and our expectations.","Over the next 12 months, we intend to repay more than $1.1 billion of debt including \u20ac500 million of notes maturing this November and $550 million of notes maturing next year utilizing our solid cash generation.","We continue to expect that our 2018 year end leverage ratio will be reduced towards our previously announced guidance of 3.5 times. We remain fully committed to our deleveraging strategy as well as our investment grade credit rating.","Finally, as you heard earlier, Europe and the Rest of World remain on track to our initial guidance. However, we're revising our overall 2018 guidance predominantly due to the changes in our U.S. business that Heather outlined.","We're lowering our previous total revenue guidance range of $11.75 billion to $13.25 billion to our current range of $11.25 billion to $12.25 billion, which is now roughly flat at the midpoint versus full year 2017.","As a result of the lower top line expectations, we've also revised our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.55 to $4.90 per share, down from our previous range of $5.20 to $5.60 a share. Our new adjusted EPS range represents an increase of 4% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year.","Even with this new adjusted EPS guidance, we expect to deliver between $2.1 billion and $2.5 billion of adjusted free cash flow. That's consistent with our initial guidance as we began this year.","With that, we'll now open the call up for questions. Gigi?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Just a few questions if I may. First on the Morgantown facility remediation plan, which obviously led to lower volumes this quarter. How much of that business, Heather and Rajiv, do you expect to come back? And when? I mean it seems that some of these issues are discontinuations and won't ever come back. But how much of those lost sales are one time in nature and you expect to come back?","Secondly, in terms of the earnings guidance this year in North America. Are you modeling new product launches such as generic Advair?","And then thirdly, just if you can \u2013 maybe this is for you, Ken \u2013 help us triangulate how the low end of the old guidance was $11.75 billion and $5.20, while the midpoint is now $11.75 billion and $4.72. Can you explain the difference? The EPS difference is $0.50 and \u2013 or $300 million in EBITDA. Can you talk through what that difference is? Thanks very much.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","So maybe I'll start, Jami. And then I'll let Rajiv and others chime in.","And as far as Morgantown remediation, I think as Rajiv said, we are continuing to totally up that facility and doing it as quickly as we possibly can. So certainly we are hopeful.","I think, as Rajiv said this, through 2018 that we will be seeing that continue to turn around. And that's continuing to be able to rebring volume back up to where we said we were bringing it back up to, which is obviously streamlined from where the facility has been historically. So kind of that rightsizing and remediation is all happening simultaneously.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Yes. And just going back to the Morgantown, it was not triggered just by this FDA inspection. It was a part of our \u2013 this year's plan actually to right size it. Because we have observed that it will be very difficult for us to manage this sort of complexity, which Morgantown is, which is 20 billion doses with the evolving FDA expectation.","Having said that, while rationalizing, Jami, we have kept three things in mind. We have stayed close to the customers. And we have packed up the products where there are more than six, seven, eight, 10 competitors.","So they're not very \u2013 like from the drug shortage point of view, from the patient point of view, we have taken that into consideration. We have kept \u2013 we have made sure that products, if we are the one of the two or one of the three suppliers, we continue to supply, so that there's never a drug shortage or that sort of problem. We have stayed close to FDA.","Now yes, this is a very evolving and dynamic business as you know. And there are always opportunities where you will get opportunity to get back to the products. And in products which are even 10-, 20-year old. And we \u2013 once we come back and we are up and running in the full steam, definitely we will go after the opportunities to get back that volume.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","And as far as guidance, I'll comment on that and then Ken can revenue. Look, Jami, our rebasing is just that, rebasing.","And that low end of the guidance takes into consideration worst case scenario. So if we didn't receive Advair \u2013 obviously you can hear in our tone, we believe not only should we get it, but we should get it ahead of the goal date in mid-October. So not \u2013 we are confident, but certainly want to take the opportunity that that low end \u2013 that this range that we've given kind of accounts for that full spectrum of not only with the product launches in the U.S., but again as we talked about, the assumptions that we're putting in as far as utilization.","And also taking into consideration the sizing of now these opportunities, which have changed here pretty dramatically in the last several months when you look at what the brand of Advair is today versus what it was.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","And, Jami, I think it's important \u2013 I know you called out and Heather spoke to the guidance range on the EPS side. As we move through the year, we obviously narrow the topline guidance range. So I think it's probably important not just to look at the low point, but where the midpoint has moved.","And when you look at that, I think your question runs to the drop in the EPS guidance versus the move in the topline revenues. What I'll reiterate is the change in the revenues go exactly to what Heather outlined in her commentary. And in fact, the way that she outlined them I think you can kind of size them appropriately based upon the order of complex products, resizing of the opportunities, as well as the Morgantown remediation and restructuring plan.","I'd also point out that the heavier drop on the bottom line is because there are costs going through the system as we remediate the plant in Morgantown and restructure that plant. So that would be the reason for a slightly larger drop on the EPS side versus the movement in the revenue range.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Craig (sic) [Gregg] (27:44) Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, thanks. I have two. First for Rajiv, back on generic Advair, you mentioned you're confident, although there were some questions about CMC and labeling. Labeling sounds straightforward. But CMC may or may not be. Can you talk in any more detail about what that could entail?","And then secondly for Heather and\/the board, I think announcing a strategic review at the same time you're lowering expectations and in large part talking about and blaming the environment, not just the company, it takes the teeth out of such an important announcement.","So I'm hoping that we can focus back on that announcement. And can you talk about the strategic review and some more details. What range of options are you considering? Are we thinking sale, merger, go private, or other? And what is the timeline for such a process? Thanks.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Okay. Let me start with the generic Advair. As I mentioned, there were no clinical, biocleanse (28:47), and facilities related questions. The questions were around labeling and CMC. And you're right, labeling was straightforward and so was CMC.","Just given the complexity of this whole product and the submission, the major response which we acquired, a lot of this was around the clarifications around the data, which was already submitted.","We had a follow on call with the FDA before we submitted that response, just to align that this time we direct them where the data is. There was no additional scientific data generation required. That's why we could turn it around. So we are very optimistic and confident that I think this is the last turn. And we have given them what they were perhaps they could not able to \u2013 they were able to get it from the responses which were already filed.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","And, Gregg, as far as the strategic committee, here's what I would say. And as I tried to convey in my opening remarks, I couldn't be more excited that the board has decided to take this next step to unlock value. I think you've heard me talk about for quite a while being frustrated with the disconnect around the fundamentals and the global profile of our business versus industry dynamics.","And I think you called out correctly. We are absorbing industry dynamics in these macro situations and believe that Mylan's platform is in a better position to absorb those headwinds than anybody else.","And as we look across the markets, when you see peers, whether here in the U.S. or across Europe or Asia, some of the multiples being applied to businesses that quite frankly we believe are very sub-par to Mylan's, is where that frustration grows. And I think you can even look today at where we've rebased, if you took the low end of our range and applied a 10 multiple, you're at $45.","So I think therein lies the rub. And I think our board taking the next step to put this committee together to be evaluating all alternatives. And I would say, there's been -- this is the beginning of that process. There is no thing not on the table. I think that we'll be looking at everything.","And certainly as appropriate we'll come back and report out on that. So that's really about all. There's really nothing more to say at the time about that committee, except I am excited about it. And I think it's the right next step.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everybody. I have three questions if I may, if you don't mind. First, going back to Jami's question, more for Ken. Should we expect a sustainable lower gross margin from Mylan, given the impact of \u2013 the simplification of the Morgantown facility? That is, given the size of that part of your business, should we expect like the net of new product launches, the gross margin to be rebased lower? Or is this just a temporary period? And then we kind of go back to the same area?","Second, on Neulasta, a couple of questions there. So first, I know that, here for the marketplace you choose, narrow distribution for the product as opposed to a broad distribution. Can you talk about how that impacts your strategy? Does that mean you're focusing more on physician practices than the larger hospital chain? And can you talk more broadly about your early observation about the adoption?","And last but not least, regarding Advair, it sounds like you are looking for kind of like a 4Q launch here. Your guidance seems to suggest that you're expecting somewhat of a minor impact on the fourth quarter. Is this not supposed to come in like a channel fill early on? If you can talk a little bit about the dynamics, if an Advair comes to the market and its contribution to the guidance this year. Just so we don't kind of mis-model this.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Yeah. Ronny, before Ken answers, I just want to put in perspective. Morgantown is a very meaningful facility for us. But then, if you take our North American business, let's not forget a very important contribution from the class thermal (33:04), from the semi solids, the ointments, the injectable business, the Xulane, also the patches like that.","So there are \u2013 and also in the Morgantown when you pick up, there are some products which make money. There are some products which don't make money. And while we are rationalizing, we are taking all this into consideration to protect as much as we can in a very responsible way and can get back to that as soon as possible. Now I'm handing over to Ken.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","And he answered it well. So I don't have a lot to add to it, other than the fact that also one of Jami's earlier questions was the temporary impact versus the longer impact of that.","And as Rajiv and Heather said, we believe that the \u2013 effectively the part of our business that we want to bring back we're comfortable that that remediation and restructuring is going to be completely effective for Morgantown.","And therefore, our profitable business will come back into the portfolio. And we've made some choices around certain products as we simplify and make the Morgantown facility less complex. So overall, this impact is temporary and we believe that our profitability levels are sustainable.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV","And, Ronny, I think you asked the question around our Fulphila launch. And what I would say first and foremost is we're very happy with this launch. We're on track with our expectations.","We are partnering with clinics, with payers, especially oncology distributors and GPOs. Yes, it's very surgical as you commented. But we have great confidence in terms of how we launch it. And we are really monitoring and happy with where this uptake has been here in the first month of launch.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Elliot Wilbur from Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Just want to ask a line of questioning around Copaxone market dynamics. So I guess the company's recent WACC price adjustment got a lot of attention and still seems to be a subject of debate as to how much of an impact that's actually had on net pricing dynamics.","And I guess what \u2013 sort of given the rebate dynamics that Teva has put in place and the system's desire for rebates versus savings, what exactly are you doing there in terms of trying to drive incremental uptake? And in fact, has there been much of a change in terms of overall net pricing dynamics sort of post that WACC price adjustment?","And then second question is, can you just help us a little bit more in terms of thinking about EpiPen supply outside of sort of the just general commentary on your overall issues? Is there anything you can help us with in terms of fulfillment rates or what we should be thinking about in terms of a relative ability to supply in terms of units versus historic rates that would be helpful? Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Thank you. So we'll start with Copaxone. I think that what's interesting is, your question is, does lowering the price really impact the channel? And I think that that probably \u2013 your question in and of itself I think highlights the perverseness of the system we're operating in. And especially as we're seeing around complex products.","I mean I think the fact that we lowered it by 60% and the channel is incentivized to continue to stick with higher priced options is in and of itself the problem.","And I think if you look at the role that the generic industry has played, there has been this balance of innovation and access. And what we're seeing, and why I said they're troubling trends on the complex side, is we're seeing low single digit to 20% generic utilization. And that's what we believe is not sustainable.","So as I said we started traditionally with our launch. We moved to unconventional. And I can tell you we're not going to stop. I think that there are limited tools, but there's other tools out there that we can do to continue to highlight the savings that payers, especially employers, should be reaping from the access now to a generic alternative.","And I think that as we continue to publicize that drop in price, I think that it is causing \u2013 we definitely are starting to see a lot more conversation and questions being asked about why they would be paying so much more for the brand when the generic is available and seeing what our WACC price is.","So I think that we're continuing those discussions. And like I said, we won't waste a lot of time to continue to do what we need to do to not only improve access, but quite honestly, for us it's about totally removing what we believe is unsustainable for these complex products.","You look at the top 20 most expensive drugs in the country right now, only a couple have generic equivalents. There's a lot more coming. And we believe it's absolutely necessary for this country to adopt higher generic utilization rates and allow that access to flow when there's a biosimilar or a generic equivalent available on EpiPen. Yeah.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","On the EpiPen supply.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","It's hard to \u2013 it's been very challenging because our EpiPen supply interruption. While we have been able to anticipate along with the Pfizer team, working with them and working with the FDA, and made several improvements to improve the supply chain, a lot of it also too from Pfizer point of view is dependent upon the incoming \u2013 the component and the quality of the component.","And we have good months of supply from Pfizer. And then suddenly we get very erratic and which is really 30%, 40% off than what we are expecting, just because of the quality issues, which can come up.","So first of all, we are staying very close, as to Pfizer is the right company to answer. We are working very closely with Pfizer on this to do everything possible. And because we understand the importance from the patient perspective. And we'll do everything in our capacity to work with them and work with the FDA to improve this situation as far as possible.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. Just two here. First, on the strategic review, how are you thinking about short term value creation and just where the stock is trading today in terms of the longer term business and the structure?","And I guess as part of that, how practical would it be to think about splitting the company? Or is the business integrated at this point where you'd be thinking about significant dis-synergies? Just sort of thinking about the range of options that are available to the company.","And my second question is just on guidance and your approach to guidance setting. I guess this the second year in a row where you start the year optimistic on new launches. You've had to come in midyear and cut numbers for items that are out of your control. And I'm just wondering, was there any thought of taking a more conservative approach as you set this guidance? Or as we think about setting future guidance for the company? Thank you.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Yeah, Chris. Thank you. As far as the strategic review, I would say it's too premature to talk about what's the art of the possible.","What I can tell you is as it states, that it's looking at all alternatives to unlock that value. And I think that will continue to be an ongoing review about what would unlock value for shareholders. And I think that like we said, taking that next step is important. And we'll report back when and if appropriate.","And as far as guidance, I think that as I stated just a few minutes ago, that we absolutely have tried to, to the best of our ability, with the \u2013 with \u2013 given where visibility is around complex products and what \u2013 are continuing to push and be able to take \u2013 use our platform to hopefully unlock some of these issues and the blockage that we're seeing in generics, like I said around biosimilars and complex products. We tried to take this guidance and make sure to incorporate all of that. Worst case scenario.","So that we appreciate that. And I appreciate you stating that over the last couple years, there could have been things out of our control that caused that rebase.","We do believe that for Mylan, this does incorporate that rebase and taking the worst case scenario at that, at our lower end. I think for the U.S. as a whole though, that this continuing rebasing is going to happen for a couple of years.","But I think given where we are with our products and the launches that we anticipate, this range should take all of that into account. And we look forward to continuing to definitely grow from this point forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Gary Nachman from Bank of Montr\u00e9al. Your line is now open.","Gary Nachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thanks. Heather, the cautious commentary on greater challenges with complex products. You've done a good job putting together a very big complex portfolio. So what do you think really has to change for dynamics to improve there? Is it even more competition in some of these categories? And do you need to diversify even more away from the U.S. market longer term into ex-U.S.?","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Yeah. No. Thank you. Let me start with our global business. We've talked about the opportunities in the pipeline that we've been investing in over almost the last decade as global opportunities, whether it's biosimilars, insulins, Copaxone. These are all things that are feeding our global commercial platform.","Obviously, the U.S. as being a very meaningful marketplace, when we see that stalling of generic uptake, it's, as I said, concerning. And I meant every word I said in my opening commentary that they're troubling trends. I believe that they're not sustainable. You cannot be facing the healthcare expenditure that we're looking at as a country and not expect generics to play the role they have historically, which is saving. It's the only part of the industry that I think has worked like a market.","I don't believe this is about competition quite honestly in this marketplace. I believe that we've got significant challenges to the way formularies are tiered. And I think that, I would like to call to action, that the C-suite in corporations around the United States be looking at those formulary tiers.","The fact that generics \u2013 that access should flow historically. There have been brand, non-preferred brand, and generic. And once there was a substitutable or an interchangeable product, that access slowed. And that's what kept prices down for our \u2013 the payers and the system from government to employee.","When you start blocking that access and putting them on different tiers you see what's happening in consequence to that. You're down in the high-teens as far as utilization, versus 90% in our typical oral solids or small molecule.","I think the other issue is the specialty tier in formularies. That specialty tier isn't tiered against brands and then substitutable products or biosimilars. And I think we're really going to have to revisit how that works, to allow \u2013 to ensure that that access flows. And quite honestly, that's been the feedback we've been giving to the President's blueprint. That there has to be that access, or it really ruins the model on every other aspect as far as how the industry has worked and is going to have to work as far as sustainability.","So I'm very hopeful that we will be able to \u2013 these changes will be able to continue to be adapted. And there's going to be access forced for these generic alternatives, which quite honestly has been the backbone of the pharmaceutical system here in the United States. And I think we can all agree that as we look at these expenses, the top 20 products, I think more than half of them are biologics. So it's going to be absolutely necessary that we fix the formulary issue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Liav Abraham from Citi. Your line is now open.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Rajiv, perhaps you could address some of the comments you made on the call regarding the generics environment in the U.S. We've been hearing from some of your peer commentary around stability in pricing dynamics. Not amongst your more complex products, but the base business. If you can just comment on that, that would be helpful.","And then secondly, I'm not sure if I missed this. But can you quantify your revenues from new products in the quarter? I believe last quarter you talked about $100 million in new product revenues and about half of that being in the U.S. Please correct me if I'm wrong. But I'm not sure if I missed that number, but if you could comment on that, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV","Yeah. Maybe I'll just kickoff as it relates, Liav, to the generic environment commentary you'd asked. And I would say we have seen a stability, a more stable market from a pricing perspective from our core business here in the U.S. And we're very optimistic about how that rolls into the future.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","So on new product revenues, Liav, we did quantify that for you last quarter. This quarter, it's about $200 million of new product revenues flowing through. And I would say about half of it is in the U.S.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dave Risinger from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks very much. I just was hoping to get a little bit more color on whether your guidance midpoint is conservative? The reason why I asked the question is that Mylan seems perplexed as to its low valuation relative to some competitors in the field of generics. But some competitors tend to provide very conservative guidance that investors can be assured will be beaten, which then enhances the PE multiple.","And so I'm hoping that your rebasing is yielding a midpoint that will prove conservative. But I'm not sure if that's the case or not. So maybe you could just provide some more perspective on your level of confidence in the midpoint of the guidance and your policy for providing guidance going forward? Thank you.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Sure, David, and thank you for your question. I guess I'm a bit perplexed about maybe what peers we're talking about. I know a lot of our peers have significantly rebased their business over the \u2013 some point in time over the last 12 months. So again, I think that was the point we were making about the guidance that we've put out today is that we believe that it incorporates the worst case scenario at the bottom end. And we should be able to grow from here.","So I can assure you our intent is to be giving you guidance that we certainly believe that we're going to meet. And so we've taken all that into consideration.","And I just believe \u2013 that's why I made the point earlier \u2013 that this has been our inflection point with the industry and the turmoil that the U.S. is in. And I think that as a complex product, as we continue to hopefully see that steady growth from a utilization perspective will really be what allows Mylan to continue that growth from here. But we believe we've incorporated where that stands today in taking, like I said, the worst case scenario into consideration.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple. Just as I think about the complex generic opportunity, it sounds like absent changes to the system, is the only catalyst for rapid generic adoption just more approvals? And then a shift to multi-source pricing, such that the brand company just isn't able to contract as effectively. So that's my first question.","And then just on the biosimilar opportunity. Can you confirm, are there any supply issues that you have out of the gate? Just kind of curious for a little bit more color around the delay in terms of the launch?","And then lastly, will you in the future be breaking out biosimilar revenue? I know that's one thing that investors \u2013 some of your stickier businesses like OTC and biosimilar, which typically command higher multiples. Just sort of curious if you'll be thinking about providing investors with greater visibility? Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Okay, sure. I'll start with the multi-source question. Here's the irony again of I think where we find ourselves at this moment. The commodity type products, our core business as we said is meeting our expectations. Because of the broad portfolio that we have and those levers that we have to pull with all the different dosage forms and the channels that we operate in the U.S. system.","When you look at the complex products, the reason we've invested and have continued to bring not only our science, now having a proven track record, but our ability to launch and to supply these products, is because there is a high barrier to entry. And there's not going to be five plus players, at least not in the near term.","And you would think that a company would get rewarded for that investment and bringing those alternatives to the marketplace. And instead, what we're seeing right now is just blocking and using that generic as a stalking horse to play the tactics that are blocking it.","So what I can tell you is that I don't think this is about getting four or five competitors. I don't even think that's reality. I think what we need to focus on is requiring formulary access to generic alternatives. And that's what we're pushing for. And that's going to make the market work effectively and efficiently as it has been meant to do.","And I think that's what we'll continue to fight for. And that's where you'll see the difference in a meaningful way about utilization uptake.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","And regarding your question on biosimilars, I would say, while modeling the biosimilars, we have taken into consideration the current launches around the world. And we have modeled a ramp, a slow ramp as compared to the oral solid generation and all that.","So you can see a slow ramp and longer NUD (52:09), and that's what we are modeled. We have three launches planned in the second half of the year. The one is a Neulasta for U.S.A. The second is the Semglee, the biosimilar to the insulin in Europe. And the third is towards -- in the last quarter we have Hulio, which is the biosimilar to the Humira in Europe. And we don't see any supply constraints for any of these things. Yes, supplies do get ramp up as we have modeled them according to our launch models.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Your line is now open.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Heather, you shared your thoughts on the disconnect between the intrinsic value versus the market view. And my question is, there must be a business where you think the disconnect is the most. Which one is that? And what part of the company is that? One.","Second, maybe it will be interesting to get your thoughts on just the weakness in Europe and whether it was driven by Morgantown or other factors?","And then finally, Rajiv, I know you mentioned CMC issues on Advair. My question is, are you no longer worried about the new drug device combo guidance from FDA, which it had issued separate from the product specific guidance? Thank you.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Okay. And, Umer, I'm sorry. On your first question, I didn't quite get what you said about what do I think is working? What was the last point of...?","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","It was more, what part of the business you think has the most disconnect in value? Is it a certain part of the company? Or a certain geography, et cetera?","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Okay. No, here's where I think the disconnect is. We have U.S. centric shareholders that live and breathe the United States and are living the turmoil that we're seeing every day from Presidential tweets to the turmoil and the turbulence that we're facing. So if you \u2013 with that mindset, you can understand that you can obviously become very absorbed with what's happening here in the U.S.","I think where we believe that that disconnect is, is really measuring our global profile. And the fact that more than 60% of our business is outside the United States, we're going to continue to diversify, both portfolio and from a geographic reach. And I think that's what's allowed us to absorb the volatility.","I mean if you look at our business 2017 to 2018 basically with where we've just rebased, we're flat. And I think in the environment, especially here in the U.S., that that's pretty heroic.","So I think that what \u2013 where we fundamentally see that is not getting credit for the global profile that we have created. And that's what we're going to continue to go figure out how to unlock that value.","As far as Europe I would not say weakness, but...","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Morgantown is not a reason for anything to do with Europe. Morgantown is predominantly \u2013 when I say predominantly, 95% plus is U.S. centric supply side. So that is not a reason for any weakness in Europe too.","The question \u2013 and your third question was on drug device, the new guidance which is on the drug device. And let me just confirm the CMC questions included some questions on the drug device. But they were about the clarification on the data, which we have already submitted, and some additional scientific justification on some of that. So the new guidance has not played into a new question from here.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","Let me add a comment here, because we've had several questions on guidance, whether it be breaking out biosimilars or how do we set guidance. I don't want to let the opportunity pass to reiterate the commentary that Heather said in our opening comments. That as we look at this business, we continue to look at the performance metrics that we think are best to measure this business.","So as we move forward, we're going to be looking at things beyond EPS, as to the factors that we'll be talking both internally and externally about how do we guide this business.","And we spent a lot of time talking about EPS ranges this morning. But those are relatively short term metrics. And I think I just want to make sure that we all understand as we talk about not just this quarter and this year but going forward, that we will be looking at other metrics to guide this business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Irena Koffler from Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Irina R. Koffler - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Hi, thanks for taking the question. On the subject of guiding the business, I think Rajiv mentioned that you're not going to provide as much granularity about the timing of product approvals in your communications.","Can you expand on that? Just because there's already not a lot of granularity in the product by product sales? So if we don't have timing of potential approvals, it just gets even harder to model the business. And I was just hoping you can expand on that. Thank you.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","So look, I think we give \u2013 we have given historically down to the day that we think something is going to get approved. And I think all that you heard us reiterate is that kind of predictability and certainly just doesn't exist in the system right now.","So it's not \u2013 we can't give a date and then get punished for missing that date, when that date has uncertainty to it. And so all we're trying to warn is that our guidance is taking that in. And I think as Ken just reiterated, which is why we're continuing to search for metrics that will allow us to guide on how our performance is.","Obviously, new product and new product launches is what our business is all about. So those are extremely important. And as approvals come to the market, obviously the market is very aware of those products being in the marketplace.","I think we're just trying to sensitize that there's a cautious balance between trying to be predictive in a non-predictive environment when it comes down to the minute of the day. And I think whether something is off a day or a week or a month, certainly it's our responsibility to guide those large drivers. And we will continue to do that.","Operator","Thank you.

You may begin.","Kris King","Thank you, Beverly. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Mylan's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; Chief Operating Officer, Hal Korman; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Sheehan.","During today's call, including the Q&A, we will be making numerous forward-looking statements pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements often may be identified with the use of words such as may, will, could, should, would, project, believe, anticipate, expect, plan, estimate, guidance, trends, forecast, potential, intend, continue and variations of these words or comparable words.","Our forward-looking statements may today include, among others, statements related to anticipated business levels, trends in some European countries, planned launches of and anticipated exclusivity period for new products, our ability to achieve forecasted full year results while absorbing the impact of negative pricing pressures, expectations for capital expenditures, expectations for R&D, SG&A and other spending.","Our guidance range, future earnings, planned activities, anticipated growth and other expectations and targets for future periods, including our expectations regarding the third and fourth quarters for the 2012 overall. Because these statements are forward looking, they inherently involve risks and uncertainties and, accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.","Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors set forth under forward-looking statements in our recent earnings release dated July 26, 2012, as well as the risk factors set forth in our report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2012, and in our other SEC filings. You can access our Form 10-Q and other SEC filings, including our earnings press release, which we filed on Form 8-K through the SEC website at www.sec.gov. And we strongly encourage you to do so.","In addition, during this call, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. It should be noted that non-GAAP measures such as adjusted revenue, adjusted gross margin and adjusted diluted EPS should be used only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, or as a superior measure to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP.","Please refer to today's earnings press release, which is available on our website, as well as on SEC website, as it contains detailed reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures we use for our second quarter results prepared in accordance with GAAP.","Before I turn the call over to Heather, let me also remind you that the materials in the call, with the exception of the participant questions, is a property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's expressed written permission.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Heather.","Heather Bresch","Thank you, Kris, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I would also like to welcome and recognize Mylan's employees around the world. Because of their dedication and hard work, we once again delivered very strong results. On behalf of the Board of Directors and our entire management team, I would like to congratulate them on a job well done.","Mylan had an outstanding second quarter, delivering double-digit top line and bottom line year-over-year growth. Sales were about $1.7 billion, up 12% on a constant currency basis, and our adjusted diluted EPS increased 15% from the same prior year quarter to $0.60 a share. Building on our strong first quarter, this stellar performance supports our confidence that 2012 will be the best year-to-date in Mylan's history, with many more to come.","Among the second quarter's highlights were growth of more than 50% in our Specialty business, double-digit growth in North America and strong performance of our ARV franchise. Our performance this quarter was strong compared to last year's second quarter when we had several very significant product launches. Further, we delivered this growth while continuing to invest in our global platform through increased R&D and sales and marketing programs. In addition, our gross margin was up almost half a percentage point.","We also saw improvement in some European countries. Constant currency third-party net sales in our EMEA region were down about 3% year-over-year, a smaller decline than we've seen in recent quarters. EMEA's top line was essentially flat from Q1 to Q2 of this year. These results are yet another demonstration of our ability to manage our global platform for growth by optimizing new launches and seizing opportunities as we continue to build our base business and effectively manage pricing pressures. It's against this factor of that we look forward to the third quarter, which we project to be by far our strongest of the year, and a fourth quarter that is similar to or slightly higher than the second quarter. We are reaffirming our 2012 adjusted EPS guidance of $2.45 to $2.55 per share, as well as our 2013 target of $2.75.","Earlier this year, when we hosted our Investor Day, we outlined Mylan's strategic growth drivers. I'd like to walk you through several of them now and comment on results achieved or progress made during the second quarter. Our core growth driver is our global operating platform, which we continue to leverage this quarter. In our North America generics business, third-party net sales for the quarter were $845 million, up 13% from the comparable year ago period. More than 70% of these sales come from existing products, with the remainder coming from multiple new launches.","In the U.S., drivers in the quarter included Escitalopram, Doryx and Abacavir, which is enjoying 180 days of exclusivity. We also look forward to important launches throughout the rest of the year, including Modafinil. For our settlement with Teva, we may launch our product on August 10, which is prior to the expiration of the 180-day exclusivity period brand of Teva. We also expect to launch Actos, Actoplus Met and [indiscernible].","In Canada, our robust pipeline has produced 17 new product launches thus far in 2012, an unprecedented number for us, and we expect to sustain a similar level annually through at least 2015. Among our more significant second quarter launches were Crestor and","Tracleer.","In EMEA, constant currency third-party net sales for the quarter totaled $327 million which, as I mentioned earlier, represented a decline of about 3% year-over-year. Nearly 90% of these outcomes from existing products, with the remainder coming from new product introductions throughout the region which included Lipitor, Candesartan, Ibandronate, Lamivudine, which is our first generic ARV launched in Europe.","While existing product volume remained flat year-over-year, pricing was as expected, lower due to government action and ongoing competitive pressure. In this environment, we continue to manage our cost structure aggressively through vertical integration, repatriation of product and other measures taken to manage and reduce cost of goods sold.","In both Italy and Spain, we experienced double-digit constant currency sales growth year-over-year due to higher volumes on existing products and new product launches, which offset pricing impact. In addition to Italy and Spain, we saw some growth in smaller countries. And in Germany, our enhanced cost structure continue to allow us to compete in multiple tenders.","In our Asia-Pacific region, third-party net sales for the quarter totaled nearly $308 million and 9% constant currency increase. The primary driver of this growth was our ARV franchise. In Japan, higher volumes continue to offset price cuts that went into effect on April 1, and of which the market began adjusting during the first quarter.","Our third-party sales in Australia fell slightly as new product revenue and favorable volume and mix nearly offset the impact of price cuts of nearly 25% made in the second quarter by Australia Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and most significant agency's history [ph].","As for our Specialty business, our second quarter performance was very strong. Sales rose 51% year-over-year to almost $200 million. Year-over-year sales for the first half of 2012 were up 58%.","Domestic sales of EpiPen Auto-Injector accounted for most of this increase, driven by unprecedented script to expansion and ongoing growth of the anaphylaxis marketplace. Performance sales also grew, and the product continues to do well in all 4 major channels: retail, home health care, hospitals and long-term care. The nebulized LABA market in the U.S. is expected to expand about 15% this year and 10% in 2013. We expect our growth to continue to outpace the market. We also were pleased to announce in May that we had entered into settlement agreements with Sanofi and concerning their Brovana products.","Moving on to our other strategic growth drivers, we continue to believe we are well positioned to benefit from ongoing measures being taken to boost generic utilization. In the last year, utilization has increased in several European countries such as France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium, as governments modify reimbursement practices. Recently in France, for instance, when a consumer wants to buy a certain brand of product, he must pay for them out of pocket and then get reimbursed, whereas if he's willing to accept the generic alternative, he will pay nothing.","In addition, Japan continues to represent a significant opportunity. Over the last 12 months, Japan has experienced growth in generic utilization, which now stands at about 24%.","As for our global Institutional business, we continue to invest in research and development and an additional capacity, which will allow us to increase the vertical integration of this business and support the future double-digit sales growth we expect. In addition, year-to-date in the U.S., we have received approvals on 5 injectable products, and we launched several products throughout the rest of the world.","Moving on to our ARV franchise. We continue to strengthen our position as the market leader with our new and innovative dosage forms, and our portfolio now contains 43 products. Currently, approximately 1\/3 of all HIV patients being treated in the developing world for the disease rely on a Mylan product.","With respect to geographic expansion, we look forward this summer to launching our commercial business in India. And initially, we'll concentrate on certain therapeutic categories, starting with our ARV portfolio. We also are pleased with progress we are making in our export markets, and we are on track this year to file 150 dossiers in countries around the globe.","Portfolio diversity continues to be an important driver of our business. Year-to-date, we've launched about 300 products, and we're on track to launch approximately 350 more by year end. As we have continued to diversify, today we offer a wide variety of dosage forms, with oral solids making up only about 57% of our portfolio. Examples of other forms include injectables, ophthalmic, patches, soft gel caps, dermatologics, respiratory and liquids.","In neurology, earlier this year, lower courts ruled against us in the U.S. and U.K., respectively on Copaxone, and we intend to appeal those decisions. We remain confident in our application and expect to receive FDA approval before we have the ability to launch our product, given the anticipated length of the appeals process.","Turning to our respiratory franchise. We continue to be on track and expect to launch generic Advair in 2015 in Europe and in 2016 in the U.S. We also continue to invest in internal respiratory capabilities in Ireland. In addition, the development of our COPD combination product remains on track.","As for biogenerics, our product development remains on track, and we look forward to commercializing affordable products globally.","Finally, earlier this month, we applauded the signing of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, FDASIA,  which received near-unanimous bipartisan support in Congress. Mylan has long been a passionate leader and an advocate for many pieces of the legislation, which updates the 1938 law governing FDA to help protect the health and safety of consumers by requiring that all facilities that supply product in the U.S., regardless of where they're located, be routinely inspected by the agency and have the one quality standard. Through the landmark Generic Drug User Fee program, the new law also will help expedite approvals of generic drugs by reducing review times of ANDA from 31 months to 10 months over the next 5 years.","I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss this quarter's results in more detail, and I look forward to responding to your questions.","John D. Sheehan","Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. I refer you back to Kris's comment at the beginning of today's call regarding our use of adjusted measures.","I am pleased with our results for the second quarter of 2012, which are in line with our expectations. As you'll recall, in early May, we increased and narrowed our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range for 2012 from $2.30 to $2.50 per share to a range of $2.45 to $2.55 per share. With the exception of our fully diluted share count, which I'll speak about in a few minutes, our other guidance metrics remains unchanged, and I'll walk through each of them today.","Our Q2 results reflect double-digit growth on the top line and bottom line, excluding the effects of foreign currency, and were achieved while continuing to invest in new product development and sales and marketing programs, both of which also grew by double digits.","As Heather discussed previously, our ability to continually introduce new products, in particular this quarter Doryx in the U.S., Lipitor worldwide, has served to mitigate some of the challenges of the macroeconomic environment in Europe, as well as government-mandated price reductions, which took place in Japan and Australia earlier in the year. We continue to manage against these macroeconomic headwinds and remain poised to achieve our forecasted full year result while also fully absorbing their impact.","Getting into the details, let me now walk you through our financial results for the second quarter and first half of 2012. I'll also provide an update on our capital structure and liquidity position. Starting at the top of our income statement, total adjusted revenues for the quarter were approximately $1.7 billion, an increase of 7% over last year's second quarter revenues of approximately $1.6 billion. Year-over-year, third-party net revenue growth on a constant currency basis was approximately 12%. The 5% unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation primarily reflects a stronger U.S. dollar in comparison to many of the other functional currencies of our major operations but mainly in Europe and India.","For the first half of 2012, total adjusted revenues were approximately $3.3 billion, an increase of 8% over revenues from the first half of 2011 or 12% on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, our guidance range for total revenues for the full year 2012 is between $6.8 billion and $7.2 billion.","Recognizing current exchange rates and using them to forecast the remainder of the year, we expect to be near the low end of this revenue range as the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates is estimated to have an unfavorable impact approaching $200 million.","Looking at our operating profitability measures. Adjusted gross margin for the 2012 second quarter was a very strong 48.5%, a 30 basis point increase over the same prior year period. This increase was driven by favorable volume and pricing on our EpiPen Auto-Injector and by new product launches, partially offset by lower margins on existing products.","The current quarter also saw margin improvement in Asia Pacific. Sales and gross profit from Mylan Laboratories Limited, our Indian subsidiary, benefited from the effects of a stronger dollar as compared to the rupee, as a significant portion of its sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.","For the 6 months ended June 30, 2012, adjusted gross margins were 48.3% as compared to 47.7% in the prior year. Our guidance range for adjusted gross margin is 48% to 50%. We currently expect our gross margin in the second half of 2012 could potentially be above or at the upper end of our guidance range and as a result, our full year gross margin to be at the upper end of our guidance range.","Adjusted operating income was $398 million for the second quarter of 2012, a 4% increase from a very strong Q2 2011 and up 8% from the first quarter of 2012. This increase, which is primarily the result of the favorable gross profit that I just discussed, was realized in spite of R&D expense for the -- was realized in spite of increased levels of spending on R&D and SG&A.","R&D expense for the quarter, on an adjusted basis, was $93 million or approximately 5.5% of total revenues and up approximately 29% from the prior year and 39% on a constant currency basis. This increase was realized mainly as a result of ongoing clinical studies with respect to our respiratory and biologics programs.","At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was $328 million for the quarter or approximately 19.4% of total revenues, and up approximately 9% over the prior year or 13% on a constant currency basis. The increase in SG&A in the current quarter is due in large part to increased sales and marketing in our Specialty franchise, in particular for the EpiPen Auto-Injector, which has resulted in the overall growth of the anaphylaxis market.","For the 6-month period, adjusted R&D expense was $173 million, up 17% over the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, R&D expense to date for 2012 is 5.3%. Our guidance range for R&D expense for the full year is between 5.5% and 6.5% of total revenues. We expect R&D spending to continue to increase throughout the rest of the year, primarily related to our biologic and respiratory platforms, and we continue to believe that the full year spend will be within our guidance range.","SG&A expense, on an adjusted basis, for the 6 months ended June 30, 2012, was $640 million, an increase of nearly 13% and within our full year guidance range of 18% to 20% of total revenues, albeit at the high end as a result of the increased sales and marketing spend.","Adjusted EBITDA was $448 million and $859 million for the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2012, respectively, and remains forecasted to be between $1.75 billion and $1.95 billion for the full year.","I'd like to briefly discuss a few of the one-off items that are being excluded from our adjusted results this quarter. In April, we entered into a new 5-year collective bargaining agreement with our production employees in Morgantown, West Virginia. In conjunction with this new agreement, we incurred approximately $15 million of cost including amounts associated with our planned withdrawal from a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan. Second, we incurred approximately $14 million of restructuring cost principally associated with the planned closure of our manufacturing facility in Napa, California. This amount relates principally to severance and related benefits.","And finally, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we incurred a noncash charge of approximately $16 million, which represented an increase to our contingent consideration liability with respect to our acquisition of Pfizer's respiratory platform. Approximately half of this amount relates to the accretion of a liability to its undiscounted value, which would occur each quarter.","Moving on to our consolidated, nonoperating financial metrics. Adjusted interest expense for the second quarter of 2012 was $61 million. As of June 30, 2012, the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was approximately 5%. We continue to use interest rate swaps in order to target a long-term 70-30 fixed floating debt portfolio, which we believe is an optimal ratio. During Q2, we entered into forward starting derivative financial instruments to extend to 2016 the period over which we will maintain our 70-30 fixed floating ratio of our debt portfolio, as well as our average effective interest rate.","Adjusted interest expense for the 6-month period was $122 million, and is forecasted to be between $245 million and $265 million for the full year. The effective tax rate in the current quarter was 26% compared to 27% a year ago. Our full year 2012 tax rate range is between 26% and 27%, and we continue to believe that this rate will be sustainable at this level going forward.","Second quarter adjusted net income was $254 million, or $0.60 per share, a 15% increase from our Q2 2011 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.52 per share. For the 6 months, adjusted net income was $478 million or $1.12 per share, a 17% increase over the same prior year period.","As I mentioned previously, our guidance range for diluted EPS is now $2.45 to $2.55 per share. During the quarter, we completed a $500 million share repurchase program under which we repurchased 23.4 million shares at an average cost of $21.36 per share. The impact of this share repurchase program is included in our calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share on a weighted basis and now to approximately $0.01 for the current quarter. Our revised estimate of diluted shares for the full year is approximately 420 million shares.","Turning to our cash flow metrics. Cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis, which takes into account the special items which are outlined in our press release and which I discussed in detail in our first quarter earnings call, was approximately $282 million for the quarter and $349 million for the year-to-date period. In addition, the cash paid to settle previously accrued litigation, which is excluded from adjusted cash from operations, we have also excluded cash received during the quarter with respect to the settlement of a patent litigation matter.","Also during the quarter, Mylan and Sunovion settled outstanding litigation with respect to Sunovion's Xopenex product. As a result of this settlement, Mylan is licensed to continue sales of its concentrate product and will have a loyalty bearing license to sell its non-concentrate  product upon receiving final FDA approval from the U.S. FDA. The settlement also releases Mylan from payment of the $18 million in damages that has been awarded by a jury earlier this year. The net penal impact of these items, as well as a few miscellaneous other litigation matters, was an income of $12.2 million for the quarter, all of which is excluded from our adjusted earnings.","Our GAAP cash flow from operations for the current quarter and year-to-date period was a very strong cash inflow of $302 million and $193 million, respectively, and leaving us with unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaling approximately $347 million at June 30, 2012. We are still forecasting our full year 2012 adjusted operating cash flow to be within our guidance range of $900 million to $1 billion, driven by increased second half earnings, as well as increased cash receipts from accounts receivable related to our significant recent product launches.","Second quarter capital spending was $61 million, bringing the total for the year-to-date to nearly $100 million. And as a result of the timing of planned capital expenditures, we expect full year capital expenditures to be within our guidance range of $300 million to $400 million. In addition to capital expenditures, approximately $70 million was spent during the first half of 2012 to acquire product rights and licenses.","During the current quarter, we borrowed $365 million under our revolving credit facility. This, along with cash on hand and through cash received through our -- from our accounts receivable securitization facility, was used to fund the share repurchase program, which I previously discussed. In July 2012, the size of the accounts receivable securitization facility was increased to $400 million.","Even with the additional borrowings under the revolver and the AR facility, we continue to have a significant financial flexibility. Our leverage ratio at June 30, 2012, as a result of the additional borrowings was 3.09 to 1, which is slightly above our long-term target of 3 to 1. However, we expect to be back below 3 to 1 by December 31, 2012. As such, we will continue to revaluate the uses of free cash flow for transactions based on the parameters, which we've outlined to you in the past.","Additionally, I am pleased that in May, Mylan's credit rating was upgraded by Moody's to Ba1 from Ba2. And following this action, Moody's rating outlook is stable. This change is reflective of Mylan's track record of meeting our prior stated commitments, as well as our solid position within the global generic industry, in particular, our strong geographic diversification and robust product pipeline.","To summarize, our second quarter, much like our first, was strong and in line with what we had anticipated. This positions us well heading into what will be an exciting second half of the year, culminating in what should be our strongest year yet.","That concludes my remarks. I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Beverly?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Risinger of Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question is, can you just talk a little bit about that improvement in performance? Obviously, you're going into a little bit easier comps because of the declines in 2011, but if you could speak to how we should think about the prospects for constant currency performance in EMEA going forward. And then second, obviously, there was a big hit to prices in Australia, but your Asian business performed well. Could you talk about that outlook on a go-forward basis?","Heather Bresch","Sure. David, so I'll start with Europe. Look, I think that -- I want to be careful about not talking about this quarter as a trend yet in Europe, but I will say this. We certainly are getting positive indicators. And starting with France, our, as you know, largest market, we continue to see them take initiatives, increased utilization. We see those starting to take hold. We see volumes holding. So that ability of perhaps turning the quarter, maybe throughout the rest of this year, we will see a trend. But what I can tell you, we have our arms around what we can control, our cost of goods structure, our continual repatriation and vertical integration has benefited us. And that said in the past, once that market started to turn around, we -- certainly, we get our disproportionate share because of what we've been doing during these headwinds. Italy and Spain continue to be -- show a lot of growth, especially in volume. So while there continues to be austerity measures and price impact, we see that volume in our product mix and our ability to continue to grow those markets as very promising. So I think when you look overall of where there's still see -- or where we still see opportunity as the utilization being a much better offset the cost containment than just slashing prices. And as -- when you look at some of the other European countries that are much more mature, like the U.K., there is not that opportunity for utilization. They are pretty mature markets, so thus to maintain in some of those areas is very different than some of the growth opportunities we see for our strong holders. And then let's turn to the Asia Pacific. Yes, Australia continue to see price pressure as one of the most significant to date with the 25%. I will tell you, we continuously have them since 2008 when I believe they took the first big hit on pricing to rightsize that organization to remain very nimble and agile and be able to adapt to the changing environment. We've continued to invest in our R&D and product launches and cost of goods structure, which we'll continue to do, which has helped us hold and offset that price cut. As you mentioned, Japan had a nice increase. And again, we see opportunity. We see utilization for that country at about 24%. As you know the government has talked about getting that up to at least 30% here in the very near term, so again, continuing to capture some of that growth. And as I mentioned, our world driver being our ARV franchise out of our India subsidiary. And that continues to grow nicely, and we continue to be a very competitive market leader around tenders throughout the world.","Operator","Your next question comes of the line of Gary Nachman with Susquehanna Financial.","Gary Nachman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","In terms of the contribution from new products in North America, the $240 million, can you quantify roughly how much of that was Doryx? What were the other big contributors? And those will probably drop off, but should we still see sequential growth in North America for the rest of the year from other new products?","John D. Sheehan","Well, I think, Gary, as you know, we don't break out our revenue from products individually. We were very pleased with the launches that we had in the second quarter, and we do have a very strong quarter. We do have a very strong quarter coming up here in the third quarter for North America. So I think that it will be a very robust year for North America overall, including the second half of the year.","Gary Nachman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe for Heather, how is the DTC been going for EpiPen? Have you been able to measure the effect on this and the campaign in terms of drawing in new patients and also growing the market? Just some qualitative metrics around that.","Heather Bresch","So we've been very focused. As I mentioned in my remarks, it's actually growing the anaphylaxis market. So really just at the moment with us being the only epinephrine auto-injector on the market at this time, we've really been able to focus on education around anaphylaxis. So we have seen, as you've seen in these results, we've seen a great response to that. And we obviously look at Q3 to be one of the best ever for EpiPen as we continue to know that it's a very -- it's at the moment still very seasonal with back to school. We see Q3 always historically by being larger, but what we've seen with the script trend and expansion is that peak is starting earlier, lasting longer. So we certainly have seen a benefit and obviously, now with the runway absolutely clear for us through 2015, through our settlement with Teva, I can assure you, we are going to continue as we see those response continue to invest in EpiPen as a franchise.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Pinkerton with SunTrust.","Frank H. Pinkerton - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just first one, can you give us any details on your confidence in the comments you made earlier about the timing for the Copaxone FDA approval?","Heather Bresch","Yes, we remain absolutely confident on our regulatory pathway and our ability to receive an approval. As you know, the -- how Hatch-Waxman works, our ability to get an approval prior to the appeals process is not possible. So we are very focused on still receiving our regulatory approval and absolutely, as I mentioned in my comments, believe that we'll get that prior to the appeals process ending.","Frank H. Pinkerton - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then maybe a little broader question. In Europe, and I don't want to talk about your business, but can you make comments on other competitors there? What are you seeing out of the regional players, some of the smaller players? Is consolidation happening from a standpoint of taking capacity out kind of outside of the top 10 players in that market?","Heather Bresch","Well, as we've said before, it's really tough to talk about Europe where it gets one country and one market. I mean, we -- you've got many, many markets, many different regions, many different dynamics. What I would say is as we do participate in many of those markets throughout Europe, what we have continued to see is, yes, through some of these macroeconomic headwinds, we saw irrational behavior in some countries. We've stated that we always believe that those weren't sustainable business model, that our ability to continue to leverage our global platform very much made us unique throughout the European countries. And so our ability to weather the storm that Europe's been going through, and come out on the other side stronger with a much better cost of goods structure, put us in position to compete much better than any regional or local player that doesn't have the benefit of the global scale that the Mylan platform have. So I think that's the best way I can describe how we see Mylan fitting in for Europe overall, how Mylan would be very differentiated from a regional or local player.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Two things. First, on gross margin, you talked about how much of this is going to improve as the year progresses, how much of that is just the product mix and good products coming out of the U.S. versus what is more sustainable and I mean, relative to your comments about taking cost down in Europe, et cetera, et cetera, the gross margin line? And then secondly, are you doing anything in Europe to change the SG&A kind of cost structure because of all this austerity in the difficult markets over there? Because you've really talked about taking cost out of the gross margin line and you haven't talked about SG&A as far as Europe.","John D. Sheehan","So Marc, with respect to the gross margin, certainly a portion of the margin increase in the second half of the year is the seasonality associated with our product mix. Certainly, the Specialty business, including EpiPen, has its strongest quarter of the year in the third quarter, and that it will benefit us. We also have a very strong year for launches in North America, and new product launches, obviously, are beneficial. But aside from North America, as we talked about in the first quarter, we have been seeing through the cost-reduction efforts that we've been taking, whether it be the vertical integration, the repatriation efforts, we have been able to maintain and grow margins in Europe, and we've been able to also -- even with the price cuts that we've seen in Asian countries, been able to weather that with stable margins. So I think that it is a -- the strength of our gross margin is a combination between product mix, new products and then also managing aggressively the cost associated with our existing product portfolio.","Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Well, I guess, just before you answer the other questions, just on the gross margin. If you didn't have this massive increase in the number of U.S. products, which arguably you're not going to have as much next year versus this year, which is where I'm going with the question, what is the kind of the core gross margin? I mean, are we -- that 48% kind of becomes like kind of the baseline that we're thinking about now?","John D. Sheehan","I think that we'll certainly provide more detailed guidance with respect to '13 when we get closer to that year. We did talk about that a bit in our Investor Day, and I think we are confident in our 48% to 50% gross margin range that we have as our current guidance out there.","Heather Bresch","And as far as your question about the rest of European cost, I guess, first I would say that the global scale doesn't just apply to the product side. Our global scale is pulling on sales excellence, marketing excellence, looking at really -- as these markets continue to change and adapt, we're able to do so with along with them. So I would say, we have been able to take some restructuring in different countries and adapt in our sales model, and we continue to do so. So we are absolutely looking across the board at where that makes sense. And like I said, at the end of the day, our ability to really pull upon this global scale benefits us across the entire organization.","Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Have you cut any -- like of the sales force and staff, or how does that work?","Heather Bresch","It depends. I mean, we have countries, take Belgium, who was a total branded generic marketplace, and they have been increasingly switching to an INN substitution. So our ability, obviously, to marry up with the dynamics of that market is important, and we're able to do so. So I would say at the best we can be everything from sales, from marketing to sales reps to how we're selling the market into those countries.","Operator","Your next question comes on the line of Elliot Wilbur of Needham & Company.","Elliot Wilbur - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","First question is for Heather. Heather, do you still believe that the generic version of Lidoderm is opportunity for the company in 2013? And if so, could you indicate whether or not you've included it as one of many potential probability adjusted products in your $2.75 per share guidance?","Heather Bresch","Sure. I do absolutely believe that Lidoderm could be opportunity for us in the second half of '13. And I guess just to build upon that a little bit, because I know there's been a lot of discussion around Lidoderm, just for your recollection, the citizens petition, which has been discussed quite a bit, we filed back in 2006. After that citizens petition was filed, talking about -- Indo [ph] put forward their argument about bioequivalency and how the standards should be changed and what should be required, FDA issued guidance very clearly and have said about what they wanted to see with the Lidoderm patch in the ANDA. So all of that transpired before Watson filed their ANDA in 2009, and absolutely nothing has changed from FDA's perspective on guidance or requirement since that time. So the idea that the citizens petition is holding up the application to manage, it's just not really possible. So again, we look forward to our regulatory approval and still believe that to be a very viable option in the second half of '13.","John D. Sheehan","Elliot, with respect to the second half of your question on whether Lidoderm is in our 2013 numbers or not, I guess what I would say to you is that we risk adjust all of our products and take into consideration that there could be a range of periods in when products are introduced and, therefore, without saying specifically whether Lidoderm is in there or not, I would just say that Lidoderm is risk-adjusted into our future business plan.","Elliot Wilbur - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I have additional question for probably you John as well. Could you just describe for us what, in terms of management and the Board's perspective on what is the most attractive use of the company's discretionary free cash flow at this point in time. I mean assuming you have a range of options between paying down debt, buying back shares or something more strategic, you kind of have done a little bit of everything over the past couple of years, I'm just kind of wondering what your current thinking is in terms of what's the best use of cash for enhancing shareholder returns?","John D. Sheehan","Look, I'll -- I guess not being a member of the Board of Directors I'm not sure I want to speak on behalf of the Board of Directors, but I think we laid out on Investor Day earlier this year the parameters for how we would evaluate transactions. And I think those parameters continue to exist. In May, we believe that executing on a share repurchase program was the best and most appropriate use of the capital we had available to us at that time. And so we execute on that, and we were very pleased with the execution. On a going-forward basis, we'll continue to evaluate opportunities that are available for transactions in the marketplace, again, using the parameters we outlined, and we'll also evaluate the appropriateness of share repurchase program.","Heather Bresch","And I would just add, as you might imagine, Robert and the Board are extremely involved at looking at everything and constantly looking at all of our options.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal of Sanford Bernstein.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I have two. First, regarding EpiPen, you kind of look at the ACA and its potential implications and you just wonder if EpiPen is not one of the products that is likely to have a disproportionately higher growth from ACA. I was wondering if you guys have done any work to look at that tailwind that the ACA provide to EpiPen? And second, you kind of mentioned you're building injectable capacity and obviously, this is a good time to bring injectable capacity online. I was wondering if you kind of look at your current build map, when do you think you'll have more capacity, I mean, minimal step-up in capacity around the injectable. I think would you be able to get in the same cycle before some other competitors are able to bring their capacity backup?","Heather Bresch","Let me start with your second question because I'm not sure I clearly understood your EpiPen question, and so I'll come back to that. But quickly on your ask about our capacity build, as we've announced earlier this year, we are continuing to invest in our injectable capacity in Ireland, as well as other areas around the globe. We certainly agree that it's our continual ability to vertically integrate on the injectable front and bring more and more of that into the Mylan global supply chain. It's certainly a benefit to us. So it absolutely is part of our footprint for expansion and capacity building this year as well as into the future. As far as EpiPen, it wasn't clear or you didn't come across clear of what you were asking me. I believe you used some initials of ACA.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I mean the health care reform act, okay, essentially have -- through the expansion of Medicaid and the [indiscernible] exchanges. A lot more people will be covered and those would be young adults or people that are -- that might have not -- that might be using EpiPen more than the general population. Now I was wondering if you did any announcements toward the effect of the health care reform on EpiPen.","Heather Bresch","Okay, I think maybe what you're speaking of ACO. But in any event, we absolutely do not. As you may be aware or not aware, most programs allow for a patient to be reimbursed for 2 EpiPens per year. And that's usually a general rule of thumb across all programs whether government or private sector where people are carrying more EpiPens or typically paying out of pocket or get a waiver from their insurance companies. So certainly nothing in the current health care law changes those dynamics.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore with Cowen and Company.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","My question is looking out to mid-2015. I would think as the management team, you have to look at that EpiPen settlement and clearly have a potential worst-case model or worst-case scenario, although many good things could happen and maybe discount out some of the other potential positives. So I was wondering, in terms of capital deployment and knowing how long the integration for Merck took, as you're looking at potential acquisitions or other diversification, what should we be thinking in terms of timing? And John, you talked about not wanting to talk about parameters, but maybe you could just walk us through very briefly some of the parameters of assets or that the asset acquisitions that you gave at the analyst meeting?","Heather Bresch","Sure. So Ken, as far as a long-term visibility you're looking for, I think starting what we've been doing since 2008 is continuing to give that long-term visibility. And hopefully, with people have been able to start gaining confidence in our ability to be not only laying out guidance and potential targets but our ability to meet or exceed them. So I think as we came out Investor Day with a whole assortment of opportunities that are drivers for 2013 and beyond because, as you mentioned, we need to work today on those things. So whether it's EpiPen, yes, there's a possibility there could be an AB-rated. While I remain fairly confident that, that's going to be a high hurdle, we have many, many other opportunities. I mean, when we talk about biologics, Advair, Copaxone, all definitely coming after that 2015 time period, not to mention our continuous voluminous amount of launches across the board. That's why today in my remarks, I tried to lay out not only what the platform is generating but with all the different strategic drivers that we discussed that all give benefits. So you don't have to rely on all of them hitting obviously just a couple of them hitting certainly put at great growth to Mylan from this point going forward. And I guess the other thing I'd say on your comment about integration, I could say that our Merck acquisition certainly is in a hemisphere all by itself. When you buy a company 2.5x your size and do a transformational acquisition as we did, certainly that integration, I think took a couple of 3 years that we certainly were able and continue to show every step along the way our ability to realize those synergies. I think when you look at acquisitions outside of that, we've certainly stated we're not doing a large 2.5x our size transformative acquisition. So things like Bioniche respiratory franchise from Pfizer, we've continued to be able to bolt and tuck those in without ever even mentioning integration or missing a beat because I think the platform we have in place today is scalable and sustainable and is able to absorb these kind of acquisitions very, very easily. So there's not a long-term planning period for any of those.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I know never say never, but should we be thinking along the lines of Bioniche going forward, or could we see something more sizable?","Heather Bresch","I mean, I think we've been clear, and I'll let John speak about that. We have a whole range of opportunities and potential from sizing perspective in our continued strengthening our financial flexibility. So all I'm saying is that everything and these types of acquisitions are certainly nothing compared to what the Merck integration required.","John D. Sheehan","Right. Remember, Ken, that at Investor Day we indicated that we were committed to a long-term debt to EBITDA ratio of 3:1 that we would not go above that which is permitted under credit facility of 4.25:1. And that we would look at the transactions that expanded our portfolio or geographically into areas that we're not in or other shareholder value accretion transactions such as share repurchases that you saw too earlier this year.","Operator","Your next question comes of the line of Shibani Malhotra of RBC.","Shibani Malhotra - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'm just going to follow on from Ken's questions, but just in terms of looking at the Merck portfolio and the acquisitions you've done, Heather, can you just talk us through in terms of the synergies? I mean, should we assume that these have already been realized, or is there more to go? And then can you talk from the pipeline's standpoint, branded -- sorry, in terms of the filings you were expecting to get approved in Europe and also the kind of new Paragraph IV filings that you are thinking about, how much room is there for new products that we haven't heard of as yet and where we are -- where we are rather, on that? And then just specifically, on the M&A, can you talk about the kind of areas that we're looking at, I mean whether they're branded or generic, and what sort of disease areas you're looking at?","Heather Bresch","Let me start I guess on the portfolio aspect of your question. Just throughout the rest of this year, we're on track to launch another -- over 300 products throughout the world. We don't speak specifically before launches in Europe as you know. There's some competitive advantage, and it's not the same system that gives the same visibility, like here in the United States with Paragraph IV. But I can tell you, we've had very successful launches already this year, as I spoke about Atorvastatin and Candesartan and then Ibandronate. And like I said, we continue to have many more. Our total R&D portfolio and filings, we look to be doubling our size by 2015. So I mean, that should give you a sense of the amount of products that we have in the pipeline or already filed with regulatory agencies around the world of what we're going to be launching over the next couple of years. As far as Paragraph IV goes, I mean, certainly, we have been showing, like we did back in Investor Day, the state certain launches that we already know of or our first-to-file, share to file opportunities, 2012 was one of our largest years as far as the states certain so far been, but we continue to already be -- have settlements that go out through '13, '14, '15 of date certain. We continue to get our share of first-to-file opportunities. So I would just say that we continue to maximize and leverage our platform on all of the fronts that we have in the past. Difficult-to-formulate products, the Paragraph IV opportunity and, like I said, just a voluminous amount of dosage forms. And we are investing in everything from injectables, as I mentioned earlier, to our patches, at oral, solid dose soft gels, dermatologicals. So as far as from an M&A, when you think about -- we really have a lot of opportunity to complement this platform across the globe, from our Specialty division to continue to complement our infrastructure and disease state expertise in respiratory and allergy. You look at our Biologics partnerships and our ability to continue to leverage and build upon that, as well as therapeutic categories that we're not in yet. So we see an opportunity to still bid our U.S. generics business with things like whether it would be antibiotics or dermatological things that we're not as large in today. So across the board, I would say, we have many opportunities to continue to fuel the engine that we've put together across all of the fronts I just mentioned.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","John, just a follow-up on some of the earlier questions regarding uses of cash and share repurchase, can the company expand its share repurchase program without violating your debt covenants? And we're calculating that you have about another $400 million to $500 million in share repurchase potential that you could do right now, can you confirm that, that is correct?","John D. Sheehan","There are restrictions and under our bank facilities and borrowing facilities, with respect to our ability to do additional share repurchase programs. At the current time, our Board of Directors has not approved any other share repurchase programs. And quite honestly, I'm not in the position to confirm the $400 million to $500 million capacity at the current time.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But with the exception of the Board approving a buyback program, do your -- with your covenants, just given your cash flow generation, would your covenants allow you to announce a further share buyback program now?","John D. Sheehan","I don't think that our covenants would allow us to announce a share repurchase program currently of the size that you were suggesting, no.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow-up, EpiPen obviously performed very well this quarter, but we just noticed, in terms of IMS prescription trends during the month of June, demand for Epi dropped pretty considerably compared to the previous months. Just wondering what's going on, what you're seeing, is this just a seasonal adjustment, and how we should think about it going forward?","Heather Bresch","Well, a couple of things. I think you've heard me say before that I don't believe that EpiPen should be as a seasonal product as it's been historically. But we continue to educate people about obviously some of the unfortunate and unnecessary deaths that have taken place in restaurants and in schools have not been to things like these things that occur more in the springtime. So what I would say as we've seen, as you know, there's been a lot of reports of this allergy season started much earlier this yea since we had such a mild winter. I think that was a contributor to some of the strengths. But I would say, I also put a lot more weight on, like I said, just a pure expansion in education that's taken place in the market. And I continue to see hopefully more and more months becoming drivers short of what it's historically been just in Q3.","John D. Sheehan","So operator, that will conclude our call, and we appreciate very much the support of everybody who participated.","Operator","Thank you, everyone, for joining today's conference call.

It should be noted that non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted revenues, adjusted gross margin and adjusted diluted EPS, should be used only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, or as a superior measure to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.","Please refer to today's earnings press release, which is available on our website, as well as on the SEC website, as it contains detailed reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures we use to our third quarter results prepared in accordance with GAAP.","Before I turn the call over to Heather, let me also remind you that the material in the call, with the exception of the participant questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's expressed written permission.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Heather.","Heather Bresch","Thank you, Kris, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter came in a bit stronger than anticipated, continuing to demonstrate the great strength and diversity of our global platform. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $0.82. We're very pleased with our performance and that we were able to maintain consistent constant currency year-over-year revenues during the quarter.","I'd also note that we've delivered 2% constant currency growth for the first 9 months of the year. This is a direct reflection of the stability of our core business and strong momentum and ability to leverage our diverse platform. This strong year-over-year performance was all the more impressive given that 2012 was an unprecedented year for the industry and for Mylan in terms of new product launches, including several significant first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities.","Our new product launches generated revenues of almost $1 billion last year, of which nearly 85% came from our North America Generics business alone. We also have been impacted in 2013 by some delays in regulatory approvals from the FDA.","In light of coming off a very strong year, every one of our businesses grew except for North America, which performed in line with our expectations. Its year-over-year third quarter revenue declined 14%.","In Europe, we grew 6% year-over-year as we continue to see the benefits of a vertically integrated platform and continued momentum around governmental efforts to increase generic utilization.","Further, as we announced a few weeks ago, we believe the addition of Jacek Glinka as our European President will bring deep experience in this marketplace and will help accelerate our expansion in the region, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe and the CIS.","Our APAC region delivered year-over-year growth of 13% this quarter. This was driven primarily by our ARV franchise and our Japan operations. Our collaboration with Pfizer continues to exceed our expectations, both in terms of market share and new product launches, and we look forward to continued success there as the government targets to achieve generic utilization of 60% by 2017.","Specialty had a phenomenal quarter, as the top line grew more than 18% compared to last year. This was driven by EpiPen, which remains the world's #1 dispensed epinephrine auto-injector in a market that has had significant expansion with a lot of runway left. I'd also note that Specialty saw double-digit growth in performance and Altiva[ph]. We continue to expect total revenue growth of 20% or more from this segment in 2013. Despite delays in certainty launches, including Lidoderm, we fully expect 2013 to be right in line with our guidance. To this point, we are narrowing our full year EPS range to $2.80 to $2.90. We look forward to a strong finish to 2013 and to completing our pending acquisition of Agila this year.","This performance is to the credit of our employees around the world, and I'd like to take the opportunity on behalf of Mylan's Board and Management team to extend my sincere appreciation for their continued dedication to our cause. Looking forward, we remain confident in the 2014 targets that we provided to you on Investor Day. This is in light of the fact that we have risk-adjusted for the launch of generic Lidoderm in the first quarter of 2014, the near-term actions that need to be taken with Agila and the exciting opportunity to launch our AB-rated Copaxone at market formation. Finally, a quick update on a couple of our other long-term growth drivers. With respect to our respiratory program, the guidelines issued by the FDA in September regarding generic Advair were right in line with our expectations. We believe this further validates that our program, which has been underway for years, is right on track, and we continue to believe we'll be the first AB-rated substitutable generic in the market.","With respect to our biologics program, we look forward to launching our first product, generic Herceptin, in India. The product has been filed for regulatory approval and is expeditiously moving through the process. The rest of our biologics program, which we outlined in August, remains on track.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over now to Rajiv.","Rajiv Malik","Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. I would like to take a few minutes to update you on the status of our pending acquisition of Agila injectable business, as well as our generic Advair and generic Copaxone programs. As you know, Strides announced that one of Agila's 8 manufacturing facilities have received a warning letter from FDA. First, let me reiterate that even with this development, we continue to expect to close the Agila acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2013 and are in final stages of completing this transaction. We are fully aware of this issue placed in the warning letter, the actions taken by Agila in response and the very detailed communications and interactions between Agila and the FDA. Based on all of this information, I think it's important to note that the warning letter has changed nothing with respect to the solid rationale we have for the transaction. We see no impact on its contributions to Mylan's long-term financial assumptions and targets.","As we said when we announced this transaction in February, now more than ever, leadership is needed in this very important space, and we see an opportunity to truly distinguish Mylan as a high-quality injectables manufacturer. We see the FDA's observation with respect to Agila as a part of agency's commitment to step up its activities and standards around the globe as a result of PDUFA, rather than a particular reflection on Agila assets. We fully applaud the agency, as we have the highest respect for FDA, its mission and processes. Agila, like any other Mylan facility, will be held to Mylan's one global quality standard post closing. We remain very excited about what we will be able to do with the Agila assets as part of Mylan's platform, and we look forward to updating you again on this transaction upon closing.","Now let me provide a bit more color on our generic Advair program. Recent developments and the competitor commentary further supports our optimism that we will be the first into this market in 2016. As Heather noted, the guidelines issued by FDA on September 9 regarding generic Advair were right in line with the expectations. We outlined for you during our Investor Day in August, reinforcing our belief that our program is very much on the track.","Since our Investor Day and after issuance of this guidance, we had another follow-up meeting with the FDA to further discuss the development program. And we believe we have a definite path forward, and we continue to believe that we have a clear head start. We also agree with the recent comments from GSK that in addition to the finance-related hurdles, there are also significant manufacturing-related barriers and we believe we are best positioned in this area.","With regards to our generic version of Copaxone. As we shared on our Investor Day, we continue to work towards launch preparedness of this very important product. With IP hurdles largely behind us, we have already produced the requisite quantity of API from an FDA-approved facility and are now in the process of building up our finished product launch quantities. Also, we are actively working with the FDA to launch this product on the day of market formation.","Now let me turn the call over to John for more detail on our financials.","John D. Sheehan","Thank you, Rajiv, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. I refer you back to Kris' comments at the beginning of today's call regarding our use of adjusted measures. I am pleased with our financial results for the third quarter of 2013, which were slightly above the expectations we had at the beginning of the quarter, and we remain confident that we will achieve full year results within the guidance I detailed in August during our Investor Day. This is despite now not anticipating launching generic Lidoderm until Q1 2014.","In addition, we have narrowed our guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS for 2013 to $2.80 to $2.90 per share. Key highlights of our Q -- of our third quarter results include the continued strong revenue growth of our Specialty business at over 18% for the quarter, fueled by sales of EpiPen, as well as constant currency revenue growth of 18% from our Indian business, which benefited from strong sales of both API and antiretroviral finished dose form products.","In addition, on an adjusted basis, we generated nearly $450 million in operating cash flow during the third quarter, bringing our 9-month total to over $700 million.","Now let me walk you through the details of our financial results for the third quarter and provide an update on our capital structure, our share count, the Agila transaction financing and our liquidity position. Starting at the top of our income statement, total revenues for the quarter were $1.76 billion, a decrease of 2% on an actual currency basis when compared to last year's third quarter revenues of $1.79 billion, but essentially unchanged on a constant currency basis. On a consolidated basis, new product launches in the current quarter totaled approximately $108 million as compared to approximately $299 million in the third quarter of the prior year, a decrease of approximately 65% with our North American Generics business being most significantly impacted by this decline.","New product launches in the current quarter in our North American Generics business decreased approximately 70% to $81 million versus $258 million in the prior year. As you will recall, the third quarter of last year included new product revenues from the 2012 launches of Valsartan, HCTZ, pioglitazone and Escitalopram. As a result of the lower level of new product revenues, North American revenues declined 14% to $707 million in the third quarter of 2013 when compared to the third quarter of 2012.","Within our Generics segment, third-party revenues were $1.4 billion, a slight decrease on a constant currency basis when compared to the prior year. Because of the strength and diversity of our existing business, our revenues remained stable despite the unprecedented level of new products launched in 2012. We expect that revenues from new products will have a similar impact on our consolidated and North American fourth quarter year-over-year revenue growth.","Turning to our other regions within our Generics segment. Constant currency third-party revenues in EMEA increased $21 million or 6% in the current quarter. We continue to be encouraged by our strong growth in France and Italy, principally as a result of new product revenues and volume growth. For the first 9 months of 2013, revenues in EMEA grew 10% from the prior year on a constant currency basis. And for the full year of 2013, we continue to expect double-digit constant currency revenue growth in EMEA.","In addition, constant currency third-party revenue in the APAC region increased $44 million or 13% and as a result of double-digit growth, both by our Indian and Japanese operations. In Japan, we continue to benefit from our partnership with Pfizer.","Within our Specialty segment, third-party revenues increased $55 million or 18% compared to the third quarter of the prior year. EpiPen sales grew nearly 20% in the current quarter, and we continue to expect EpiPen sales to grow more than 20% for the full year. We remain confident in our ability to continue to generate growth from our EpiPen franchise and to maintain our leadership position in the market.","In addition to the growth in EpiPen sales, our performance product grew by more than 20% in the current quarter on an increased price and volume. For the first 9 months of 2013, total revenues increased to approximately $5.1 billion as compared to $5.07 billion for the first 9 months of 2012, an increase of 2% on a constant currency basis.","As discussed during our Investor Day, weakness in certain foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, specifically the Indian rupee, the Australian dollar and the Japanese yen, have been having a negative impact on our revenues as expressed in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, we expect that our total revenues for 2013 on a constant currency basis will be at the lower end of our guidance range of $7 billion to $7.4 billion, principally due to the foreign currency translation impact.","Looking at our operating profitability measures, even with the decline in the level of new product revenues within our North American Generics business, adjusted gross margins for the third quarter of 2013 was a strong 51%, down only 1 percentage point from the same prior year period. Our margins continue to be favorably impacted by the growth in our Specialty business and the optimization of cost and efficiency across our global platform.","For the 9 months ended September 30, 2013, adjusted gross margins remained constant at approximately 50% when compared to the prior year, despite the significantly lower contribution from new products in 2013. For the full year, we currently expect to be near the upper end of our gross margin guidance range of 49% to 51% and expect our fourth quarter gross margin to be above the top end of our guidance range as a result of an improved product mix within our Generics segment and continued customer initiatives.","Adjusted operating income was $462 million for the third quarter of 2013, a 10% decrease compared to the prior year. This is primarily the result of a lower gross profit in the current year and increased research and development expenses, which were up approximately 8% from the prior year. Third quarter R&D expense on an adjusted basis was $113 million or approximately 6.4% of total revenues. As planned, we continue to invest a significant amount in our respiratory and biologics platforms, which accounts for the majority of the increase from the prior year.","Third quarter selling, general and administrative cost, also on an adjusted basis, were approximately $333 million or approximately 19% of total revenues, at the midpoint of our full year guidance range of 18% to 20%. SG&A increased only 3% from the prior year, primarily due to increased marketing cost incurred within the Specialty segment.","For the 9-month period, adjusted R&D expense was $326 million, up 18% over the prior year. As a percentage of our revenues, year-to-date adjusted R&D expense for 2013 is 6.4%. Our guidance range for adjusted R&D expense for the full year remains at between 6% and 7% of total revenues, and we continue to expect to be at the upper end of the range for the full year, with the fourth quarter being our strongest spending quarter of the year.","SG&A expense on an adjusted basis for the 9-month period was $954 million, a decrease of 1% from the prior year period and within our full year guidance range of 18% to 20% of total revenues. A key factor driving the decrease in SG&A expense in the current year is the reduced sales and marketing cost in Japan as a result of our collaboration with Pfizer. We currently expect to be nearer to midpoint of our guidance range for SG&A for the full year.","Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $534 million, a decrease of 6% when compared to the prior year, principally as a result of a lower revenue -- lower level of new product launches. And adjusted EBITDA for the 9 months ended September 30, 2013, was $1.44 billion, a slight increase when compared to the prior year. We continue to forecast adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion for the full year.","Moving on to our consolidated nonoperating financial metrics. Adjusted interest expense for the third quarter of 2013 was $56 million. We continue to benefit from low short-term interest rates. As of September 30, the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was slightly above 4%. We continue to use interest rate swaps in order to target a long-term 70-30 fixed-to-floating debt portfolio, which we believe is an optimal ratio. Adjusted interest expense for the 9-month period was $184 million, essentially unchanged when compared to the comparable prior year period, despite the notional value of our debt increasing by almost $400 million from the year-ago level. As a result of the anticipated financing on the Agila transaction, we currently anticipate our Q4 adjusted interest expense to increase by approximately $10 million from the third quarter.","As discussed at our Investor Day, as part of our ongoing effort to lower our tax rate, during the third quarter, we adjusted our annual effective tax rate to 25% as compared to 26% in the prior year. As a result, the effective tax rate in the current quarter was approximately 23%, and we currently expect to maintain our 25% annual rate into 2014. Third quarter adjusted net income was $324 million or $0.82 per share, almost flat as compared to our Q3 2012 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.83 and above the upper end of our expectations from the beginning of the quarter. For the 9 months, adjusted net income was $832 million or $2.11 per share.","Our Q3 results were achieved despite an 8.5 million share increase from the sequential quarter in our fully diluted share count. This higher share count lowered our Q3 2013 adjusted EPS by approximately $0.02. The majority of this increase in share count was the result of dilution from the outstanding warrant on our cash convertible notes. Under our cash convertible notes, we have approximately $43 million warrants outstanding, with the majority of the warrants having a strike price of $30. For every dollar that our average stock price increases above $30, the dilutive impact of the warrants is approximately 1 million shares. As a reference point, our average share price for the third quarter was $35.20.","Our strong cash flows continue to enhance our financial flexibility, providing us with a number of levers to create shareholder value, including returning cash to shareholders. As we announced earlier today, our Board of Directors has approved a share repurchase plan that will allow us to repurchase up to $500 million of our equity. This share repurchase plan will be financed with our available cash on hand, available revolving borrowings or future debt issuances.","We have narrowed our guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS for 2013 to $2.80 to $2.90 per share. This guidance range fully incorporates further anticipated share dilution, as well as the financing costs from the Agila acquisition, which, together, amount to approximately $0.04 per share. This range also excludes any positive contribution from a positive Lidoderm launch -- possible Lidoderm launch in 2013.","We remain confident in our financial targets for 2014, specifically anticipated 12% top line growth and 19% bottom line growth.","Turning to our cash flow metrics. Year-to-date cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis was approximately $727 million. Our GAAP cash flow from operations for the year-to-date period was approximately $689 million, leaving us with unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $365 million. We are still forecasting our full year 2013 adjusted operating cash flow to be within our guidance range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. At the end of the third quarter, our gross notional debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was 2.8:1. Based upon the anticipated timing of the closing of Agila transaction and our share repurchase program, we expect our gross notional debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of the year to be approximately 3.5:1. We remain committed to our 3:1 long-term growth leverage target. And when our leverage target -- leverage exceeds that target, we remain committed to deleveraging within an 18-month period. Taking into account the closing of the Agila transaction and the share repurchase program announced today, we will end 2013 with financial flexibility in excess of $1.5 billion, which includes the EBITDA from potential expansion opportunities.","Capital spending for the 9 months ended September 30, 2013, was $239 million as compared to $160 million in the prior year. The increase as compared to 2012 is the result of expenditures to expand our global operating platform, including capital investments in our strategic growth drivers. We expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $350 million and within our guidance range of $300 million to $400 million.","Turning to our planned acquisition of Agila. As we announced in the first quarter, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps for a significant portion of the overall financing for the Agila transaction. In addition, during the third quarter, we executed an additional $930 million of notional value forward starting swaps to fully cover the expected financing for the transaction. Based upon current market conditions and our forward starting swaps, we now expect that we will finance the Agila transaction at an effective weighted average interest rate of approximately 4%, assuming no significant deterioration of Mylan's credit spreads.","To summarize, our third quarter was strong and a bit above what we had anticipated. We look forward to a strong finish to 2013 and are confident in our long-term targets we outlined in our Investor Day in August. In conjunction with our fourth quarter call, we will provide detailed 2014 financial guidance that will reflect recent developments and our most up-to-date outlook. That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Lyn?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just actually just one quick one and then one follow-up. First, on Agila, I know -- I appreciate the comments you made on the call. I know there obviously has been some controversy on the asset in light of the warning letter. Can you just elaborate a little bit more? In your view, how difficult is it going to be to address the warning letter at this facility? How long is it going to take? And do you think that has implications on your 2014 growth targets? My quick follow-up here is you've mentioned now and I think the last 2 press releases that there's been some of the -- U.S. pipeline opportunities have been delayed. Can you give us a little more color on what gives you confidence that you're going to receive approvals for these in 2013, or that they could actually be delayed even further?","Heather Bresch","Okay. Thanks, Chris. Maybe I'll touch on Agila and then if Rajiv wants to add any more color on it. I think as we spoke about at our Investor Day, I think there's a bucket of issues and problems. And certainly, anything and everything that we have found with Agila falls in that issue category, that we've been working very close with them on, getting our arms around it. And look, nothing takes away from the strategic opportunity and growth that we see Agila adding over the longer term. And I think, as I mentioned in my opening remarks and wanting to stress the point that we have risk-adjusted that for 2014. So like I said, we see the growth opportunity extremely meaningful and think that we absolutely have our arms around in understanding the issues that will need to be fixed over 2014.","Rajiv Malik","And Chris, yes, we are aware of the issues raised by agency in the warning letter. We are also very close to Agila's response. Agila is in very close interaction, positive engagement with the FDA. And as nothing can be said about the duration, but this is not something like the Antares [indiscernible] facility. These issues are very manageable and will be placed in a much shorter time as compared to the other warning letters we got out there.","Heather Bresch","And as far as your question on timing with the FDA, here's what I'd say. As GDUFA has -- they're beginning to implement GDUFA. As with any significant new piece of legislation and law, we're going through a transition period right now with the FDA. I think when you look at the Office of Generic Drugs now becoming a super office and having the same standing as the Office of New Drugs with the agency, what they're doing to hire and bring on staff to meet the commitment to get ANDA approval times from today 34-month average down to 10, there's obviously -- that doesn't happen overnight. So I think in the -- as you look at some of the particulars that are changing, for instance, wanting to get a complete response versus getting commentary back and forth during your ANDA application, moving towards the 1 cycle review, we have been working very closely, obviously, as; one, the author of the legislation, but to now the interpretation and how that log is executed obviously with the FDA. We've been working very closely with the agency. And I think the only thing I was trying to reference or underscore is yes, we have seen some delays as those transitions happen, but they're just timing issues. So -- which is why, again, we risk-adjusted some of the products such as the Lidoderm from 2013 to 2014, but absolutely have confidence in our overall approvals of these products.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Harold Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, on the generic Advair, can you just remind us, have you done the PK study yet? I couldn't remember if you said you were about to start the study at the Analyst Day, or if you've completed it. Second, I was just curious why have you pushed out Lidoderm launch from this year as a potential from happening. Is it just conversations with FDA that you've learned something new? And third, if you could just get into a little bit more detail","[Technical Difficulty]","Heather Bresch","I think -- operator, I think he got cut off. Well, why don't we answer it? We'll speak to the first 2. Rajiv, do you want to take Advair?","Rajiv Malik","Yes. On Advair, I think we have done several product studies to date and got very different inputs. And we are now about to kickstart our -- just kick started with our [indiscernible] study.","Heather Bresch","And as far as Lidoderm, look, I would say that while there is still a potential to get Lidoderm this year, we just believe from what we can see and the visibility we have and the back and forth that we've had tracking our application through the FDA process, which is why we risk-adjusted end of Q1 of '14. But like I said, I'd still say there's a potential. But from a financial perspective, we have pushed it into 2014. But there\u2019s -- we don't -- there's no issues around application. Again, this just falls in the bucket of timing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Gentlemen, just because there is a lot of investor angst over what does appear to be a delay in timing. Just the question related to the warning letter. Are you waiting for FDA to resolve the warning letter to close the deal? Or if not, do you feel you will get reassurances from FDA that the warning letter won't lead to a broader systemic problem like an import ban? If you can just provide some color around that? And then just my second question, again, related to the timing of generic Advair, your competitors Actavis and Teva said they didn't expect the first generic Advair to reach the market until 2018, in large part, because of the typical PDUFA time line, so if you could address that as well.","Rajiv Malik","I can get started with the second one on Advair. And Actavis and Teva will comment upon the program what they know about this, and we will be talking based on our interaction and active engagement with FDA. So the time line is what time line is, in this case, it's the only thing that the FDA is transitioning into GDUFA. FDA is very actively engaged upfront rather than after submission of the package and the submission of the signs, and that's why FDA is actually engaged because they know the complexity of the product, the complexity of the sign and the ownership there is going to help regarding GDUFA time lines. So we feel very confident of our projected time lines of filing in 2015 and approval of the product in 2015. As for Agila, again, as I mentioned, we have been very close to the issues, which have been raised, how are they being addressed, how positively Agila has responded and with all communications with the FDA, and we believe the possibility of the import ban is very unlikely. And taking all this into consideration, risk adjusting various scenarios, we are marching towards the closure of this deal in the fourth quarter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gilbert with Bank of America.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","John, how would you encourage investors to quantify or attempt to quantify the pricing pressure versus the volume lift from products sold to Walgreens' Alliance Boots? And do you think that sort of construct would hold true for Celesio, McKesson? And then how should we think about the pace of share buyback? Can you share any color there without giving away any secrets?","Heather Bresch","I'll let John get more into the details. But I guess the one thing that I'd like to point out, Greg, as they've continued to say, consolidation in this industry is our friend, from our customers' perspective. Because as you can imagine, as they become larger and now, in fact, global, their need from a product volume perspective and a reliable supply chain has never been higher. We're seeing that certainly play out with Walgreens and believe that, that would continue to play out as other customers, perhaps, become global as well. So -- and again, we just feel that Mylan is probably better positioned than anybody on our vertically integrated global supply chain. John?","John D. Sheehan","Yes, I guess, Greg, what I would say is that -- and I had said in other public forums is that we will absolutely provide our customers with price in exchange for volume and that, that creates a win-win for both parties, absolute increase in profitability for Mylan and cost savings for the customer. And it creates, quite honestly, stability, stability in terms of volumes for Mylan and stability for the customer. And I wouldn't expect that you will see any material impact on our gross margins as a result of that. In terms of the -- your follow-up question on the share repurchase program, we haven't set a particular timeframe out for when the share repurchase program would be executed by -- the board has authorized the company to execute that as it deems appropriate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur with Needham & Company.","Elliot Wilbur - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","A question, I guess, for Heather. Heather, can you talk to me a little bit about your expectations around Copaxone substitution scenarios, assuming that you do get approval and are at market formation and maybe, potentially, or even first-to-market and have some sort of exclusivity? There still seems to be the notion out there that there's going to be resistance to substitution, and you're looking at a relatively limited impact kind of in the 30% to 40% range. So I don't know if you share that viewpoint or not, but maybe you can talk a little bit about your capacity to supply the market and whether or not you think we're going to see relatively limited substitution until you see a multiplayer market?","Heather Bresch","Okay, thank you. So I guess let me start here, we have continued to state and certainly believe and continue to obviously have a lot of dialogue with the FDA on this very important product that we absolutely will have an AB-rated substitutable Copaxone. With that being said, if you'll remember on Investor Day, I pointed out that we've been conservative on what we consider to be -- not look like a typical generic from a utilization perspective right out of the gate. I do think it will be a little bit of a slower build because, as you know, there's a lot of package and services that are around this product from a Specialty pharmacy perspective and an ongoing maintenance with the patient. So I think that we've been very responsible about how we've looked at this marketplace, and I think that it's something that certainly -- a product like this, the value is not just in 180 days. This will be -- this is a very meaningful product, and it will have meaningful contribution to us over the years.","Operator","Your next question -- okay, go ahead.","Heather Bresch","I'm sorry, just going to say from a capacity perspective, we absolutely feel that we have plenty to fulfill the market needs around this product. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Finkelstein with Susquehanna Financial.","Andrew Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about upcoming launches that you are expecting? I think the Veladot [ph] is one of them, but other things that you're looking forward to the new product contribution next year, what else we should be looking for. And then also on EpiPen, commercially if you can talk at all about how the competitive environment is shaping up for next year? We saw you and your competitor take up price increase relatively recently, your views on that continuing and how the formulary landscape is shaping up for next year.","Heather Bresch","Sure. As far as product launches go, we have been saying now, I think, for multiple quarters and years that it's just the sheer volume of the launches that we continue to see globally, that's a real driver to that. Obviously, in the United States, as you pointed out, 2012 was a very meaningful year as far as new product launches. So with that being said, the diversity around our true global platform and the voluminous amount of launches globally is what allowed us to produce the results we have this year, and we see that continuing. So we've gotten to the point, it's not about any one product, it's really about our portfolio of products and those launches. And new launches will continue to be a significant driver for us around the globe for years to come. As far as EpiPen goes, we had a phenomenal quarter. I couldn't be happier with the results that EpiPen continues to produce, and the return on our investment of education and awareness and direct-to-consumer advertising has very much paid off. And as I said, we see a lot of runway room left. There's still a fairly small number of at-risk patients for anaphylaxis carrying an EpiPen, and we believe that our message is being heard. And as far as the competition landscape goes, as we've said all along, that shared voice in a market like this that shows this much reaction to education and awareness is beneficial, obviously, for the patient. And we believe we'll continue to get our very much disproportionate share around this marketplace, again, for years to come. And I think as far as pricing, our formulary position, we are the #1 in formulary position with all the major formularies and don't see any of that changing next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Liav Abraham with Citi.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a couple of follow-up question on Agila. Given your interactions with Agila thus far and some of the comments that we've seen in the warning letter, can you just confirm that you do not view this as a systemic issue within the company pertaining to the other manufacturing plants? And do you see any risk of increased FDA scrutiny at Agila's other manufacturing plants?","Rajiv Malik","First of all, Agila has 5 facilities in India, which have been FDA approved, and all 5 have gone through FDA inspection over the last few months. And while one of these facility we received a warning letter for, the other one, they received no -- 0 483, 1 483 and there's one with 4 483s. So it's not a systemic issue. The fact, within the same campus, they have their own quality facility with the 0 483 will tell you it's not a systemic issue. It's an issue, which is contained to this facility and is being addressed, very comprehensive and in a strategic way. So it will -- first of all, safeguard and shorten the quality issues related with the product and provide a long-term sustainable quality infrastructure and structure around those all other facilities across the globe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Buck with Buckingham Research.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Quick ones. For the EMEA business, the constant currency grew within the third quarter. It looks like it slowed a little bit to 6% versus what have been a 13% growth rate in the second quarter. Is there anything to look at that drove that? And can you talk about the outlook for growth in 2014? What's assumed for that? And then secondly, just a follow-up on Copaxone, are we at the point now that the FDA is taking the clinical trial potential off the table? I think I know the answer that you'll give, but there's commentary from your competitor that there's new information on the differences between the brand and generics. And how do you think the FDA will react to that?","Heather Bresch","So I'll start with your question. Look, what we see in Europe is actually what we anticipated. And as I think I called out in the Investor Day, the convention in France, which was driving higher generic utilization, we had said would not be -- should not be considered a run rate. There was going to be definitely a jump start as they started that at the beginning of the year, and we see that now kind of leveling off. So we absolutely still see growth continuing for the rest of this year, as well as next year. We haven't yet given guidance, and we'll be doing that obviously at our year end and when we give our 2014 guidance, specifically on growth rates. But we absolutely see the growth continuing and our momentum around generic utilization there continuing.","Rajiv Malik","And just a reminder that in my comments, I did indicate that we continued to see double-digit growth for EMEA for 2013.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And on Copaxone?","Rajiv Malik","And regarding Copaxone, I think as far as our application in FDA has been concerned, their clinical trials have never been on the table. We have been engaged with the FDA for over the last 4 years now, various interactions, strict analysis, lots of phase meetings. And FDA is using several other tools available to sign to prove that it's working. Clinical trial has never been a subject matter of discussion.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore with Cowen and Company.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to follow-up on Copaxone as well. I think you've confirmed in the past that it's not the natural formulation you're using, but just wondering as your competitor keeps on referring to having access to looking at different formulations, would they have access to your current go-to market product via litigation, so that they could've analyzed it? That's the first question. Then just a second question on the brand assets that are out there, is there any pressure? Are you feeling any pressure to pivot, or are you looking more aggressively at potentially brand acquisitions? And if so, can you kind of give us a sense of that strategy?","Heather Bresch","Yes. I mean, I guess, let me start on the Copaxone.","Rajiv Malik","Net goals, you said, but -- yes.","Heather Bresch","On a litigation -- I'm sorry, the litigation part. Here's what I'd say. Obviously, we think that the legal issues have played themselves out in the United States. I think we've been well on record talking about how confident we are in our formulation at being AB-rated and the ongoing dialogue we're having with FDA in a very positive sense and very much expect to be at the market at patent expiration. So that's all I'd have to say really on the Copaxone front. We feel very positive and confident about our application and where we stand both legally and with the FDA.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line -- okay, I'm sorry.","Heather Bresch","I'm sorry, [indiscernible] about acquisition, just quickly on that. Look, I think how we're using our capital, whether it's by share buyback, we see great opportunity. Obviously, we feel like there's not a better opportunity at the moment, quite frankly, than in our in-stock given the long-term opportunities that we have in front of us. And as far as the acquisitions go, I think we've said, we'll continue to look at everything as long as it's complementary and a strategic fit and within the parameters that we've laid out again on Investor Day. So we continue to look at everything that's out there that would be a complement to our current footprint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I've got 2. First, just a close up on Agila, which is -- you said something interesting. You said that actually the FDA inspected all of the Agila facilities, and you now always stand in all of them. Can you just quantify for us just, actually in your view, how long it will take to fix this? Roughly, how much it would cost? Would you exclude this cost? And it would include, of course -- in fact, are you paying it, or is it the former owners of Agila, which are responsible for picking the tab? And second, regarding the respiratory franchise. Now that you've got guidance on Advair, presumably it applies to a variety of other respiratory products, can you talk to us a little bit about your plans for other respiratory products and a little bit about the capacity you're putting together? If we think about you as a respiratory player beyond Advair, what should -- would we be thinking about?","Rajiv Malik","So on -- first, on Agila, as I said, these issues are manageable. They are nowhere close to another set of warning letters, which involved having engagement of FDA for the long time. We see these issues getting closed rather quickly and sooner than taking that sort of user time, which it takes to close a warning letter. Second, we have -- as we mentioned, that we have taken various scenario and risk-adjusted various aspects, and we'll be able to share with you all these details once we close this transaction, or soon after the close of the transaction. On using the Advair platform, absolutely. As we mentioned that Seretide, which was not an Advair product, but another, let's say, MDA product, and also we have now already in the pipeline some more products. And I think once we reach a stage that we are in a position to share with you, we'll be very excited to share with you the pipeline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So my question relates to just going back to some of the comments on August 1, and I'm just hoping for some updates, please. First, with respect to Agila, obviously, that's been discussed a lot. But August 1, you had mentioned that you didn't see any manufacturing issues impacting approvals. Could you just talk about how you're now thinking about Agila approvals in 2014, and whether your expectations have changed for Agila launches in '14? And then with respect to the European region, I think you had mentioned you expected it to grow mid-teens for the full year. Do you have an update there? And then finally, with respect to the 19% year-over-year EPS growth target for '14 that you said in the first, is that still unchanged? Well, I guess, it's unchanged. But does that include the new stock buyback now that you've announced that?","Heather Bresch","So look, as far as Agila goes, I think we've said at about every way we can say that we have taken all of this into consideration with our 2014 guidance and our target out there and reiterated that confidently today about what we see for 2014. So like I said, we've taken all that into consideration, and then I want to continue to reinforce the longer-term opportunity that we absolutely can see that growth continuing in 2015 and beyond. As far as Europe, I think we just reiterated that we see double-digit growth for this year. And 2014?","John D. Sheehan","Right. We -- I said that we would provide detailed guidance with respect to 2014 in our fourth quarter earnings call, David. And I think there are lots of positives and negatives that happen every day and so whether it be risk adjustment on product launches or share repurchase at all. And so I think that we'll provide detailed guidance. But just to reiterate, again, we are very confident in the 12% top line, 19% bottom line guidance that we -- sorry, targets that we provided previously.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry with Leerink Swann.","Jason M. Gerberry - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Just another Advair question, just on timing then. When should we expect you to start your clinical endpoint study? Would that be done in parallel with your PK study, or after the PK study? And just trying to get a sense of expectations for when investors might see the clinical endpoint study get posted on clinicaltrials.gov.","Heather Bresch","So look, maybe just one thing to reiterate around our Advair franchise and development. I would like to maybe just underscore that we believe we're years ahead of the other people that have been out there talking about their program. So as Rajiv mentioned earlier, we've had constant dialogue with the FDA and, like I said, believe that we're years ahead. So I don't want to speak specifically. If there's anything, Rajiv, you want to weigh in on the clinical front?","Rajiv Malik","No, and I think, as we've said, we are absolutely on track from the time line perspective for filing in the first half of 2015.","John D. Sheehan","So operator and for everybody on the call, we've got this busy day today in terms of earnings announcements, and it's 11:00. So we'll take one more call -- question and then let folks go on to the next call that's been scheduled publicly.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Tim Chiang with CRT Capital.","Timothy Chiang - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","So Heather and Rajiv, I mean, looking into 2014, to get to this guidance that you guys have provided, do you think that you're pretty comfortable with Lidoderm approval by the first quarter? I mean, I know you said that it's risk-adjusted. Is there any sort of detail you could provide about your confidence level at this point with Lidoderm?","Heather Bresch","So as I mentioned, yes, we risk-adjusted it, but are very confident in the approval. This was definitely much more around timing and some of the things that I pointed out with the FDA. So we absolutely are confident in our product and the approval, and I look forward to -- I think it's going to be, again, another one of those high-barrier-to-entry products that will be -- bring a lot of value over the years, not just in the first 180 days. So thank you very much, and we look forward to talking with you guys soon.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Welcome to Mylan's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. Joining me for today's call are Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; Chief Operating Officer, Hal Korman; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Sheehan.","During today's call, including the Q&A, we will be making forward-looking statements including those relating to our anticipated business levels, our future earnings, our planned activities, our anticipated growth and other expectations and targets for future periods.

Before we get started, I'd like to welcome and recognize all of our fellow employees around the world. Through their passion and hard work, we delivered very strong results this quarter. On behalf of the Board of Directors and our entire management team, I would like to thank each and every one of them.","Our diverse global platform has once again delivered strong results, representing a great start to 2012. Double-digit growth on our North American, Asia-Pacific and Specialty businesses allowed us to deliver robust financial results despite persistent macroeconomic headwinds in certain regions, specifically Europe and Australia. We are reaffirming our 2012 guidance of $2.30 to $2.50 per share and we see opportunities for upside during the year. Further, the strength of our platforms, first-in-class science and robust product portfolio give us continued confidence in our long-term growth target for 2013 and beyond.","During the first quarter, we generated total adjusted revenues of $1.58 billion, an increase of 11% on a constant currency basis as compared to last year's first quarter revenues of $1.45 billion. On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.52, an 18% increase over the $0.44 per share we delivered during the first quarter of '11.","In our North American Generics business, third-party net revenues for the quarter were $777 million, up more than 15% from the comparable year-ago period. This strong result was driven in part by launches of 11 new products in the U.S., including Ibandronate and Escitalopram, a first equivalent product that generated the highest and fastest conversion rate in versus generic launch we've seen in recent history. We also enjoyed strong sales in the U.S. on many of our existing products.","Further, consistent with the strength of our R&D capabilities, 2 of the 8 first quarter products submissions we made in the U.S. are first-to-file opportunities. Currently we have 171 ANDAs pending FDA approval, 40 of which are potential first to file. Regarding our neurology franchise which is one of our strategic growth drivers, we're awaiting the court's ruling in the Copaxone patent infringement case whose trial concluded in September of 2011. We remain convinced that we have an AB-rated product and look forward to securing approval in the second half of this year. While we eagerly anticipate the court's ruling and regulatory approval, I'd like to remind everybody that we are not relying on this product to achieve our 2013 target of $275 million. We also are pleased with our performance in Canada, and it's another example of the robustness of our global pipeline.","In Canada, we launched 9 products during the quarter, which is more than we launched during all of 2011. Our expanded portfolio is fueling sales and growth in our customer base, along with cost of goods efficiency that will help us weather price cuts and remain competitive and ensure consistent supply in every province.","In EMEA, as anticipated, we delivered third-party net revenues of $336 million during the quarter, a decline of approximately 14% compared to last year's first quarter results. On a constant currency basis, revenues fell 10%. New products launched throughout the region served to offset volume pressure on sales of existing products and mitigate some of the effects of unfavorable pricing.","During the quarter, we also enjoyed constant currency revenue growth of 8% in Italy, one of Europe's fastest growing markets. And in Spain, our sales volume grew along with this rapidly expanding market. Results in both cases were driven by increased generic utilization. Moreover, we remain on track to launch nearly 300 new products in Europe this year. By now, it should be very evident that our powerful global platform has and will continue to demonstrate its ability to absorb headwinds such as those occurring in Europe. Despite such headwinds, we have maintained our leadership positions in several markets such as France, Italy, Spain, U.K., Belgium and Portugal.","Moving now to our Asia-Pacific regions. We generated third-party net revenues of nearly $299 million during the first quarter, an increase of more than 8% over last year's results and 12% higher on a constant currency basis. Our double-digit growth was driven largely by the strong performance of our business in India. We continue to see growth in our third-party business and accelerated growth in our ARV franchise, both in finished dosage form and API. We currently supply to more than 90 countries. We keep expanding our ARV business by adding products and geographies and expanding market access. Further, we remain on track to launch our Commercial business in India later this year.","Finally, our Mylan Specialty business reported a 67% year-over-year increase in third-party net revenues, which totaled more than $162 million during the first quarter. This exceptional performance resulted from higher sales of the EpiPen Auto-Injector, another strategic growth driver. Increased volumes and favorable pricing drove the growth in sales, and we continue to see double-digit accelerated quarter-over-quarter sales growth. The settlement announced this morning with Teva only further enhances our confidence in the anticipated continued strong performance of this product and our entire Specialty franchise.","As we've stated before, we see tremendous opportunity ahead for EpiPen as only 7% or 2 million of the 28 million people estimated to be at risk for anaphylaxis actually carries one. Continually increasing public awareness is essential to ensuring access to this product for people who need it, and generating sustained market expansion. Now let me turn to some of our other important strategic growth drivers.","Our global Institutional business continues to deliver double-digit growth. We anticipate that this business can become a billion dollar franchise by 2016. We remain focused on supply chain integrity and optimization of our cost of goods; we\u2019ve benefited and we will continue to benefit from being vertically integrated; and we now have successfully internalized the manufacture of 80% of our products globally, giving us even greater control of over our cost and quality at each point in the supply chain. We also expect significant growth in our product portfolio and are on track to launch approximately 650 products and file more than the 750 regulatory submissions globally this year. We also are pursuing external opportunities to expand our portfolio, such as our acquisition of 2 limited-competition dermatological products from Valeant earlier this year.","Looking at our respiratory platform, we have made good progress on the integration of the Pfizer business we acquired in November of 2011, and we believe we are on track to launch the first AB-rated generic version of Advair.","Finally, with respect to biogenerics, we have had productive discussions with the FDA regarding our portfolio and remain confident that we will be in the U.S. market starting in 2016. With that, I look forward to responding to your questions and will now turn the call over to John.","John D. Sheehan","Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures and I remind you of Kris' comments at the beginning of the call today regarding our use of adjusted measures.","I am extremely pleased with our financial results for the first quarter of 2012, a great start to what we firmly believe will be the most successful year in our company's history. Our Q1 results were achieved and our full year results will be achieved amid the macroeconomic headwinds that continue to plague Europe and in the wake of a 10% price cut in Japan and the most significant price cuts in Australian history, both of which occurred this quarter. This is a testament to the strength of our diverse global business, our first-in-class science, and our robust product portfolio.","The difficult pricing environment in several of our locations was certainly not expected -- unexpected, nor were the positive development which served to offset, and in some cases, fully mitigate the unfavorable impact. In fact, our first quarter results came in line with what we -- with that which we have forecasted in our Investor Day on February 21. Also, our current quarter results were in line with those of the fourth quarter of 2011 on a pre-tax basis. Adjusted pre-tax income in the current quarter was $304 million compared to $294 million sequentially. Getting in the details, let me walk you through our financial results for the first quarter of 2012.","I will also provide an update on our capital structure and liquidity position.","Starting at the top of our income statement, total revenues for the quarter were $1.59 billion, an increase of 10% over last year's first quarter revenues of $1.45 billion. Year-over-year, first quarter third-party net revenue growth on a constant currency basis was approximately 11%. The relatively small unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation primarily reflects a stronger U.S. dollar in comparison to certain other functional currencies of our major operations, mainly in Europe and in India.","Included in total revenues for the current quarter is approximately $9 million of other revenue related to a clean energy investment subsidiary, which we invested in near the end of 2011 and whose activities qualify for tax credits under Section 45 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Our adjusted metrics, which I'll discuss momentarily, exclude all activity related to this investment with the exception of the net tax effect related to its operation, which is included in our adjusted effective tax rate. As a reminder, our guidance range for total revenue for the full year 2012 is between $6.8 billion and $7.2 billion.","Looking at our operating profitability measures. Adjusted gross margin for the 2012 first quarter was a very strong 48%, up approximately 1 percentage point from the same prior-year period. Our strong current quarter margins are primarily the result of favorable pricing on EpiPen in our Specialty segment. Within generics, gross margins remained stable as new product launches in North America served to offset the normal pricing trend in the generic pharmaceutical industry.","Our operations, particularly in Europe, continue to employ cost-savings initiatives, especially from the perspective of cost of goods sold. These efforts have proven successful, and adjusted gross margins in Europe, on a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis and excluding the effect of foreign exchange, and as we anticipated, increased nearly 300 basis points despite lower sales. And while I'm certainly not going to predict when the economic situation in Europe will improve, these initiatives are expected to continue to have an incremental positive impact on our adjusted gross margin throughout 2012.","Adjusted operating income was $368 million for the first quarter of 2012, an 8% increase from Q1 2011. This is primarily the result of the favorable gross profit that I previously discussed, partially offset by increased levels of spending on R&D and SG&A.","R&D expense on an adjusted basis was $80 million, or approximately 5% of total revenues and up approximately 7% from the prior year. Our guidance range for R&D expense for the full year is between 5.5% and 6.5% of total revenues. The timing of certain R&D spending, principally amounts related to our biologics and respiratory platform, has shifted into later periods of the current year with no impact on the timing of the programs themselves, and we continue to expect that the full year spend will be within our guidance range.","At the same time, SG&A also on an adjusted basis, was $312 million or approximately 19.7% of total revenues, closer to the high end of our full year guidance range of 18% to 20%. The increase in SG&A in the current quarter is due in large part to our investment in our Specialty franchise, which has resulted in higher volume and increased market share.","Adjusted EBITDA for the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, was $411 million and remains forecasted to be between $1.75 billion and $1.95 billion for the full year. ","Moving onto our consolidated non-operating financial metrics. Adjusted interest expense for the first quarter of 2012 was $61 million. We continue to benefit from low short-term interest rates. As of March 31, 2012, the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was approximately 5%. We continue to use interest rate swaps in order to target a long-term 70:30 fixed to floating debt portfolio, which we believe is an optimal ratio. ","As I mentioned before, our adjusted pre-tax earnings in the current quarter was slightly favorable as compared to that of the fourth quarter of the prior year. However, the effective tax rate in the current quarter was 26% as compared to 23% in the sequential quarter. The net result was adjusted diluted EPS in the current quarter in line with that of the fourth quarter of the prior year. Our full year 2012 tax rate range is unchanged at 26% to 27%, and we continue to believe that this rate will be sustainable at this level going forward.","First quarter adjusted net income was $224 million, or $0.52 per share, an 18% increase from our Q1 2011 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.44 per share and in line with that of the fourth quarter 2011 after their adjusting for and fully consistent with, our expectations from our -- and adjusting for the higher tax rate in Q1 2012.","Our guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS for 2012 remains at $2.30 to $2.50 per share. And as I previously mentioned, and fully consistent with our expectations from our Investor Day, we expect earnings in the second quarter to be in line with the first before accelerating into the third quarter, which will be by far our strongest of the year and finishing with a fourth quarter that will propel us to our midpoint of $2.40 per share.","Turning to our cash flow metrics. Cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis was approximately $67 million. This takes into account certain \u2013 account certain special items principally the exclusion of payments of approximately $90 million related to previously settled and accrued litigation primarily related to AWP and the inclusion of approximately $62 million related to amounts due in 2012, which were received in late December 2011 but excluded for adjusted cash flow purposes from that quarter.","Our GAAP cash flow from operations for the current quarter was a cash outflow of $109 million, leaving us with unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaling approximately $267 million. The first quarter is, historically, the heaviest in terms of the usage of cash and as a result of the timing of certain payments including taxes, interest and incentive optimization. But we are still forecasting our full year 2012 adjusted operating cash flow to be within our guidance range of $900 million to $1 billion.","First quarter capital spending was $36 million and we expect full year capital expenditures to be within our guidance range of $300 million to $400 million. In addition to capital expenditures, approximately $70 million was spent during the quarter to acquire product rights and licenses, the majority of which relates to the purchase of 2 limited competition dermatological products from Valiant Pharmaceuticals.","During the current quarter, we repaid the $600 million due under our convertible notes and made a scheduled payment under our term loan. Both of these payments were made using a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under our revolver and through cash received from our accounts receivable securitization facility, which we established in February. During the first quarter, we borrowed $285 million under this facility.","At the end of the quarter, following the debt repayment and additional borrowings under the revolver and the AR facility, our leverage ratio remains at 2.9x and we continue to have more than ample borrowing capacity.","To summarize, our first quarter was strong and was in line with what we had anticipated. This is an indication of things to come throughout what we believe will be our strongest year yet and another chapter in the exciting story that is Mylan.","That concludes my remarks. And I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao with Barclays.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First, I was just hoping you could speak a little bit to what you're currently seeing in terms of market conditions in Europe. Just given some concerns regarding economic instability or softness, obviously, you expected -- you saw good results from Spain and Italy. In particular, I was curious if you could speak to what you\u2019re seeing in Spain right now.","Heather Bresch","Well look, I think, Europe overall, what I'd say is, we're seeing what we've been seeing and saying that we're not trying to predict the future of when that's going to turnaround and obviously, why we continue to say we did not predict or forecast growth for our European region. I think with that being said, we do see increased generic utilization beginning to increase, especially in the southern European markets. We saw growth and maintain leadership position, obviously, in Italy. And we see the same with Spain. We see that volume through increased utilization offsetting some of the price cuts. So I definitely would say that governments are beginning to realize that for sustainable cost-containment, utilization increase is a more proven, has a better track record than just cutting cost. So I would say there is some optimism that, that trend certainly will continue but again, we certainly didn't predict growth this year.","John D. Sheehan","And, Doug, I'd just add that although we're not seeing growth, we are very focused on maintaining the profitability of the region through cost savings and vertical integration initiatives, and we saw very nice growth in the margins in Europe, in the first quarter.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And in terms of the product introductions that you referred to in the prepared remarks, is that broadly across the entire region and applicable to almost all the countries?","Heather Bresch","Yes, absolutely.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then also just a point of clarity on the settlement with Teva that was announced this morning. If they do make changes to their ANDA and there are meaningful, perhaps, design changes to their product, do you still have the opportunity to reinitiate litigation?","Heather Bresch","Well look, I think as far as our current settlement, it's very clear that we have through June of 2015. And as we made reference in there, they still have to receive regulatory approval, which we continue to believe that hurdle remains very high. So I would look at it that kind of regardless of product or changes and, obviously, we would look at any of those things that happen in the future, but I would say we are excited. And I think that this settlement just further enhances and underscores truly the value of this franchise and our ability to now have some great runway to just continue to show accelerated growth quarter-over-quarter.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Chris Schott with JP Morgan.","Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, just would be interested in your views on the implications of further consolidation of the U.S. market with the Watson, Actavis transaction announced yesterday. Just as it relates to the overall health of the U.S. generic market and Mylan's business, specifically?","Heather Bresch","Sure. Look, I think it's a fantastic deal. I think it -- as we've said for quite a while, and Robert has been very vocal about, that consolidation is needed. Taking capacity out of the market especially a large player like Actavis, it certainly benefits the global marketplace. I think it further underscores the need to be globally competitive, which underscores the platform that we've pulled together over the last 5 years. So look, I think congratulations to them; it's good and I think there is more to come, more consolidation to come.","Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then second question, just changing gears a little bit. Asia increasingly appears to be a more relevant driver to your numbers than Europe. Is this kind of low-teens organic growth we saw this quarter a decent proxy for the growth you could see the rest of the year given the Australian and Japanese price activity you just kind of referenced on the call?","Heather Bresch","Sure. So first of all, as I stated in my remarks, our business in India is just hitting on all cylinders from third-party business. The ARV franchise continues to grow, and we continue to add diversity of our product line. And so we see -- as we said, we anticipate continued double-digit growth. As far as Japan, again, we see a nice steady increase. Increased utilization continues to go up. We continue to build our product portfolio and most importantly, we continue to internalize those products, giving us much more flexibility, controlling the supply and the quality of that supply chain. So as Australia, obviously, continues to be a market that is undergoing significant pressure, I think since '08, we've shown our ability to manage through those headwinds and we're going to continue to do that. So I think all-in-all, Japan, and certainly, India, offsetting any of that pressure that we're feeling in Australia. And why we continue to be very confident in our growth in that region.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Elliot Wilbur of Needham & Company.","Elliot Wilbur - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just an additional follow-up question, Heather, on the settlement. At your Analyst Day, you talked about the company's view that the financial community sort of over-estimated the potential negative impact to Mylan's numbers, if and when the generic was introduced of EpiPen. Is there anything in the agreement itself enabling Teva's entry in June 2015 that changes your expectation that a competitive generic entree would get roughly 40% of the market that would result in roughly an $0.08 to $0.12 negative impact on Mylan's bottom line? Then follow-up question for John. Just looking at the company's capital structure as it currently exist, some of the out-year debt senior notes, around, I think you're around $2.3 billion, is still sitting on the balance sheet at interest rates north of 7 1\/2% and I guess given some of the recent transactions in the space and the current 0 interest rate regime across the world, I'm wondering if there might be an opportunity to refi that at more favorable rates given the company's enhanced cash flows and just stronger balance sheet position overall.","Heather Bresch","Sure. So I'll start with EpiPen. Look, absolutely nothing changes our thoughts or convictions about the strength and the brand equity of EpiPen. If anything, I think this settlement just underscores our confidence because we're going to have, at minimum, and I say minimum because I certainly believe the hurdles to get an AB-rated product are significant. But at a minimum, another 3 years to truly build the education around the need for people at risk to be carrying an EpiPen, so I think that brand equity only continues to become much more significant over the next few years. I think that you've seen the results of us being out there, raising awareness and educating and we're just going to continue to increase and invest in those efforts.","John D. Sheehan","And then your question with respect to our capital structure and the notes that we issued, quite honestly, less than 2 years ago. You're right that interest rates have fallen significantly over the last 2 years and so some of those notes may have the opportunity, when they are prepayable and taking into consideration what prepayment penalties may exist, may have the opportunity for prepayment or refinancing. That's something that we'll look at when we get to a point where they're able to be refinanced.","Operator","Our next question is coming from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was hoping 2 things. First, if you could just frame out the key considerations for the second quarter so that we have a better understanding of how to think about the momentum year-over-year in the second quarter of 2012 versus 2011, and also, sequentially, versus the first quarter of 2012. And then second, for Heather, just to clarify, can you just let us know if you're settlement today covers generic EpiPen only in its current form or in all future forms as well?","Heather Bresch","So I'll start with your second question and I'll let John come back to your first. Look, what we can say about the settlement is that it absolutely covers everything between Meridian and Teva through June of 2015.","John D. Sheehan","And I think, David, with respect to the second quarter, as I said in my prepared remarks, the second quarter being similar to the first is fully in line with what the expectations we had on Investor Day when we indicated that the second half of 2012 would be stronger than the first half of the year. The -- in particular, the -- my comments do not take into consideration a Doryx approval. But we continue to be -- to look forward to the court's ruling on that subject and our being able to launch that product, which has been long delayed, although I would say that as we look at the full year, we do expect -- we have always expected that before the end of the year that we would be in a place where we were or in a position to launch Doryx. We will launch Lipitor, the generic form of Lipitor, at the latter part of this quarter. And so I guess I would just conclude or summarize by saying that Q2 is -- continues to be in line with what we talked about or expected on our Investor Day.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Heather, I was curious your thoughts on France and there seems to be some new rules that have been implemented to try to drive more generic competition utilization. So I was curious on your thoughts there. Second, if you could just talk about Japan a little bit more, what was the strength in Japan and how good was it? I mean was this a double-digit growth quarter? Have we had double-digit growth for Japan? Just give a sense because you did say, in the press release, it seemed like it was strong and accelerating a little bit.","Heather Bresch","Sure. So in France. We do absolutely see the beginnings of this push for increased generic utilization as I said, kind of, throughout Southern Europe. Italy is certainly the lead of that pack, but we do -- are very encouraged by the recent new regulation statute to try to incentivize on several fronts that increase of utilization. And like I said, I do think our efforts are paying off as we have been continuing to educate regulators and officials that, that utilization is much more sustainable to cost containment at healthcare than the price cuts. So I think that those numbers are -- they're starting to see that, obviously, from other countries. And so I'm very encouraged. And in the meantime, we've maintained our leadership position, 30% of the market share. As John said, we're very focused on that profitable growth and believe that, obviously, when Europe does come out of this -- comes out of the storm they're in right now, that we're going to be stronger than ever and certainly benefit disproportionately from now the increase in utilization. And as far as Japan goes, yes, as I said, we did see strong results. I would say that for the year, we certainly anticipate low double-digit growth in that country. And I think that it comes from a couple of places. One, as I've said, we've continued to enhance and now reaping the benefits of the pipeline that we started to build after our acquisition. And we see those coming to fruition so we're launching more products, we're launching more internally manufactured products. So the profitability of that -- the country continues to increase. And again, utilization, we continue to see it creeping up close to the mid 20s. So all-in-all, Japan is steadily, just steadily increasing and we're very happy with our performance there.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I don't want to beat a dead horse or anything, but John and Heather, maybe if you can just elaborate a little bit more why you're still so confident that there is such a high regulatory bar for AB-rated generics for EpiPen. I guess I was somewhat surprised that -- wasn't really quite sure why you reached a settlement given your confidence in that regulatory landscape, so if you could be a little bit more specific why you don't expect to see that. And then secondarily, again on generic Doryx, we were expected to hear that case or that verdict in February or March and here we are almost, we are in May, almost in May, haven't heard anything yet and just what you think is going on there.","Heather Bresch","All right. Jami, so look, the confidence, I've never been more confident in our statements about EpiPen and an AB-rated product. And I think that our settlement, the way in which we settled should certainly underscore that. So our settlement has nothing to do with the regulatory aspects. The press release clearly lays out that they still have to get regulatory approval, which we continue to believe is a very high hurdle and why I'm saying we now have a minimum until June of 2015. So our settlement really has with -- just truly on the patent case and the judicial, nothing to do with the regulatory process or the hurdles that we believe are still absolutely in place. As far as Doryx, look, like we can't predict Europe, I can't predict when judges are going to rule. He said it would be soon, and I guess his definition of soon or quick may differ from some of ours but so look, we anticipate that decision any time.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Shibani Malhotra of RBC Capital.","Shibani Malhotra - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess, Heather, you talked about expecting increased consolidation in the generics industry due to excess capacity. Could you comment on whether Mylan is looking to further consolidate businesses and what sort of businesses you would be looking for if you were considering M&A? And then second, just to follow up on EpiPen again, I guess and on Jami's question. I was just wondering were you able to look at Teva\u2019s Actavis filing before you reached a settlement or was this just kind of a blind sort of case?","Heather Bresch","Okay. So first, I'll talk about the macro issue. And I want to just clarify, my point on consolidation is not even just a generic industry, but the pharmaceutical industry as a whole. I think that as we've continued to talk about the global competitiveness needed to compete is brands looking at generics, I think more than ever because of the emerging markets and the need to have a high-quality breadth product portfolio. So look, that's why we continue to believe there absolutely will be consolidation, perhaps among smaller players, but continued activity among brand and generics. As far as our activity, I think we laid out a lot of parameters and clarity on Investor Day, speaking to the fact that we absolutely are looking and always looking at a lot of different things, whether it's new geographies, products, therapeutic categories, bolt-on for dosage forms, certainly looking for products for our Specialty division. So we are extremely active looking on all fronts. And like I said, just continue to be excited at the opportunities we see out there given some of the macro economic conditions in some of these geographies. As far as EpiPen, look, I can't and we don't talk about litigation and so forth. But all I can tell you is, obviously, litigation is not typically blind in both parties; there's a lot of activity between the parties, obviously, in pretrial as well as trial. So I'll just leave it at that.","Operator","Our next question is coming from John Boris with Citi.","John T. Boris - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First question just has to do where you invited to look at Actavis and can you just share whether you did look at the Actavis transaction and just discuss your competitive position? Obviously, based on some of the slides, lots of input out there, you do slip to #4 in a consolidating industry. Just some commentary there. And then I have a follow-up on EpiPen.","Heather Bresch","So look, I think it's safe, John, for you to imagine that we look at everything. And I think that probably the only thing I'd say about the process is that it's not an auction or a competitive process. So I would just kind of lead to that about what the activity that was going on around Actavis for a long time now. And as far as -- so as far as our continued activity, as I said, I think that we have a tremendous amount of opportunity to continue to add on. And again, as we said on Investor Day, we're not standing still or gone on vacation. So I can assure you that we are very active right now on many fronts. And I guess all I'd say about commenting on #3, #4, #1, #2, we've said it's really not about the number, I think it's the quality of the assets and it's how we're building Mylan. And I think we put together a great global platform, as Robert has said. We don't need another transformational deal. But what we are very interested in is high-quality assets that we can continue to add and maximize and leverage this platform that we've brought together. And I think between our vertical integration, which is exceeding all of our wildest imaginations and the benefits we're reaping from that, just continues to boost our ability to compete in every market around the world with the highest quality products. So we've not lost our sight on our mission to reach 7 billion people and believe that we've got a lot of opportunity to get there whatever number that puts us as a global player in this marketplace.","John T. Boris - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","For John, on EpiPen, there was a slide you put up during your analyst meeting that seemed to indicate that with direct-to-consumer advertising, it was very deep, very responsive to market share gains. I think you're electing to make 2 investments this year, 6 months of direct-to-consumer advertising and you've invested in a 100-person sales force. How do you measure those investments going forward? And what are the implications for at least the volume growth on EpiPen going forward? And then just for Heather, can you just maybe talk about the Teva device and is it the device that would prevent it from being therapeutically substituted or AB-rated if and when they ever get approved?","Heather Bresch","So I'll start then I'll let John -- my comments about AB-rated have to do with the FDA and the regulatory environment around the Dragon [ph] device. So as I've talked about for a long time, that those regulations, and FDA clarified their position and the answer to the citizen petition a couple of years ago, that it's not that's same. Then it can't be rated substitutable and especially in a life \u2013 or an emergency situation. So my comments have always been around our confidence and our intellectual property around our Dragon [ph] device, the regulations at FDA and the ability to have to be the same. So if you have to retrain, it's not the same. And for obviously EpiPen and anaphylaxis, obviously reaches that hurdle of being a life saving or an emergency situation. So that again is why I underscore my confidence in the franchise and the hurdles for getting an AB-rated. I'll let John speak to ROI but what I will say is, we were -- after we saw the results from last year's DTC as well as other initiatives. Because while direct-to-consumer is certainly a large aspect, we're doing on many fronts, around this education. And obviously, if you look since Q3 of last year, you see just beyond accelerated double-digit growth year-over-year for each quarter. And obviously, this now being a record Quarter 1 for EpiPen and we see that continuing to grow. So it is absolutely, the results, I think, speak to the pay off here. And we just see that doing nothing but continuing to grow at an accelerated rate.","John D. Sheehan","I'll just briefly add on to what Heather said. As you know, we are the market for anaphylactic shock with over 98% market share. And therefore, the programs that we're running are both focused on building the awareness regarding anaphylactic shock and the value of the EpiPen for dealing with those types of life-threatening situations. And the way we measure the success of the programs, whether it be the direct-to-consumer advertising campaign or the expansion in our field force, is by looking at the expansion of the market that's taking place. And that expansion of the market, we showed that on the Investor Day, has been significant. We're off to a great start for 2012. We talked on the Investor Day of the Specialty business growing 30% year-over-year for 2012. And at this point, one quarter into it, I think it's at least that.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Greg Gilbert of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Getting a lot of free advertising on EpiPen today, Heather. I'll start with EpiPen. Would the settlement structure allow you to launch an AG [ph] if you wanted to? And what are your thoughts on EpiPen OTC. And for John, I think you could've made a nickel or more in EPS on Modafinil before the Teva development. You're still pointing to potential upside to the range. So what's going better than expected so far this year? Or were you just being incredibly conservative on your initial guidance?","Heather Bresch","So look, I would say that there's no restrictions on us on EpiPen, but I have to tell you that there is certainly no reason \u2013 EpiPen --the kind of product and what we've spoken about from brand equity and the awareness around there would just be no reason to put an AG [ph] in. So look, I think that the settlement certainly, again, I'm just going to say -- and you're right a lot of good advertisement this morning, removes that overhang that we know the Street continued to be concerned that the what-if possibility that, that what-if has been taken off the table, and I can assure you we will maximize the opportunity we have ahead of us.","John D. Sheehan","Yes, so Greg, I guess, Greg, on your second part, first of all, I guess I would start by saying that we're incredibly disappointed by the whole Modafinil situation. But Mylan has never been, we've said it so many times, about one product. And therefore, the -- we will -- we're whether it's Modafinil in or Modafinil out, we're still very confident at our $2.40 per share midpoint of our guidance range. And whether it be the very successful launch of Escitalopram that we had here in the first quarter or the strength of the EpiPen that we're seeing throughout 2012, all of those things make us very confident that 2012 will be a very good year, the best year for Mylan that we've had in our history. And look, I don't know that I would say we were being incredibly conservative or however you described it, I think we were providing a guidance range at the beginning of the year that we believe reflected the fact that not all good things happened, not all bad things happened. And that we would be in that guidance range. And we look forward to the year continuing to develop this way and taking advantage of upside opportunities.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","How about that OTC piece of my question?","Heather Bresch","Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. So as far as OTC, listen, we've had a lot of discussions and we'll be continuing to have these discussions. I believe that the most responsible thing for EpiPen would be behind the counter. So it would look much more like sometimes how insulin is treated or plan B. So we believe that there is absolutely opportunity to continue to work with states because as you might imagine, there is -- all the states differ with pharmacy laws and regulations. But we are actively pursuing and looking at doing just that, working with the states, working with the FDA, to hopefully get to a place where there would be both prescription EpiPen as well as behind-the-counter EpiPen that would provide the maximum access to everybody who wanted or needed to carry an EpiPen to be able to have as many as they want and also be able to make sure, from a collaborative perspective that whether it's schools being covered, soccer fields, football as you might imagine, that not only it\u2019s important to have the schools equipped, which we're launching a huge program here in the next couple of months with schools, but also everything in the community related to that. So all of this is working in conjunction and why I said that outside of just our DTC investment that there's a lot of other initiatives that are ongoing that we'll be excited to be telling you more about as the year unfolds.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Ronny Gal with Sanford Bernstein.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I\u2019ve got 2 and I promise not to ask a thing about EpiPen. The first one is John, kind of, we were a little bit on the Watson announcement yesterday where -- which surprised me the most is how much cash they can free to pay down the debt early on. And looking at your numbers, you've got roughly the same EBITDA they do roughly the same tax, roughly the same interest rate. You generate about $1 billion in operating cash flow, but you\u2019re spending $400 million of that on CapEx; you're spending 40% of your operating cash flow on CapEx. And the question is, is there -- how do we think about that? You guys are spending a lot more than your peers in terms of percentage of cash flow on CapEx. Should we think about this as a positive or should you be thinking about maybe holding some of that back, paying down your debt more and then suddenly you look a lot less levered and look lot more financial, let\u2019s call it digi-flexibility to return the cash, buy something or somehow to create like a most significant upside to the business. And then I do have a follow on.","Heather Bresch","So I'm going to start off even though you said John. I just at least want to underscore, not only our commitment to investment in CapEx but why. If you go back to our Investor Day, we said we were going to double our size in the next 5 years, from a capacity perspective, our platform. So as you look, we are investing, obviously, across the board whether it's on our API, whether it's in the finished dosage form facilities, but doubling that capacity, we believe is, again, just goes to the diversity of our platform, our ability to absorb whatever, headwind, countries, issues. That, that ability to not only invest from an R&D perspective and we talked a lot about our product portfolio doubling. And when you think about not only doubling, it's the quality of what we're doubling and the kind of products, again, our respiratory announcement. Our ability to have the dollars and invest the dollars we believe is another barrier to entry because we're using large dollar investments, whether it's respiratory, whether it's biogenerics, doubling our size. So we believe, as I said earlier, it's not necessarily just quantity, we believe not only are we investing in the right things, but certainly in a very quality way.","John D. Sheehan","And I guess I would just add on to what Heather said, at 2.9x gross debt to EBITDA, we're very comfortable with that leverage ratio. And that leverage ratio has been declining steadily and accelerating in that decline. And so we generate $600 million a year of free cash flow; it\u2019s just a substantial amount. We've been using that cash flow to reinvest back in the business as well as to delever. And so I think that we're building a platform for the future and responsibly reinvesting in that platform so we have the right play -- the right growth in the future while at the same time managing the balance sheet in a smart way.","Heather Bresch","And which is why I think we continue to reiterate our confidence and commitment to delivering on our longer-term growth prospects. Because the investments we're making today are for the 2016, '17, '18 opportunities that we believe we'll be able to globally monetize.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Gary Nachman with Susquehanna.","Gary Nachman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","First, a couple of pricing questions. How is the pricing shaking up for generic Lexapro between you and Teva since the share seems to have been split evenly between you guys? And on EpiPen, how much more headroom in pricing are you assuming this year after taking that 10% price increase in March? And then I have a follow-up.","Heather Bresch","Your pricing question, your first one, we don't discuss pricing of individual products. All I can tell you is we continue to see stability in our products at both the base business and opportunities on some of these new launches. So I would say that on the first one. EpiPen, look, I think we've been pretty consistent in our pricing. And we see that continuing. So as we continue to invest and continue to look at building that awareness, we'll continue to have a pricing strategy that certainly mirrors that.","Gary Nachman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, and just you mentioned in terms of your building out the Commercial business in India later this year, I thought I remembered you saying at the Analyst Day that, that was going to be earlier in the year, so I'm just curious if there were any changes to that timeline. And just talk about the impact you think that's going to have on the business in that region.","Rajiv Malik","We have talked about July launch and that's where we exactly are. We will be launching sometime between July and August. And we don't see any significant impact on the year.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Faerm, Jr. with Credit Suisse.","Michael Faerm - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You had commented earlier about your confidence in your ultimate approval and AB rating for your generic Advair. Can you elaborate on why you're confident in that, and maybe contrast it to the EpiPen situation where you're confident that the generic won't get AB rating.","Heather Bresch","Sure, I'm going to start and then I'm going to let Rajiv, perhaps, speak to our confidence in it. Look, I think that what we said when we announced the acquisition of that platform as we were taking the core competencies of the existing Pfizer platform and marrying that up with what Mylan has always been known to do best, which is taking very complex opportunities and bringing them to fruition. So when we looked at the high-caliber and the asset and the position and the point that Pfizer had developed a product now marrying that up and complementing it with our scientific ability is really what underscored our confidence. And I'll let -- and as far as EpiPen goes, look, as I continue to say, it's the Dragon [ph] device component of EpiPen that makes those regulations and those aspects different.","Rajiv Malik","And our confidence is based on what we acquired, the quality of the device and the similarity of the device between this one's and Glaxo's, as well as our continued dialogue with FDA and the progress which we are making. So we remain very confident that we are on the right path to build the first generic Advair.","John D. Sheehan","Operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your final question is coming from the line of Randall Stanicky with Canaccord Genuity.","Randall Stanicky - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I just keep it one. Just going back to Europe for a second. I appreciate and I think we all appreciate the headwinds and the challenges there. The double-digit declines in constant currency growth, if those continue, how much cushion do you have built in before that becomes an issue? I understand that you don't need to grow, but at what point does the constant currency decline start to hurt you?","John D. Sheehan","Look, I talked about the fact that our gross margins actually increased 300 basis points quarter-to-quarter, Randall. And so it's not about the top line; it's about the bottom line, and we're managing that region in the context of the macroeconomic headwind. So it's not hurting us. We obviously would love to see growth and we look forward to when the macroeconomic issues in Europe are resolved and generic utilization rates increase. And the top line growth, together with the gross margins increasing, and that's why we talked on the Investor Day about Europe being a long-term growth driver for us.","So with that, look, we appreciate all of our investors and the questions we received in this call. Q1 was very much in line with what we had expected, and we look forward to continuing to deliver on 2012 so...","Heather Bresch","Thank you.","John D. Sheehan","With that, operator, you can close the call.","Operator","Thank you, this does conclude today's teleconference.

You may begin.","Melissa Trombetta - Mylan NV","Thank you, Sonja. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Mylan's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; Chief Commercial Officer, Tony Mauro; and Chief Financial Officer, Ken Parks.","During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial guidance for 2018. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from today's projections.","Please refer to the earnings release we furnished to the SEC on form 8-K earlier this morning, as well as our supplemental earnings slides, all of which are posted on our website at investor.mylan.com for a fuller explanation of those risks and uncertainties and the limits applicable to forward-looking statements. Mylan routinely posts information that may be important to investors on this website, and we use this website address as a means of disclosing material information to the public in a broad, non-exclusionary manner for purposes of the SEC's Regulation Fair Disclosure.","In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We will refer to these measures as adjusted and present them in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measures, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to those GAAP measures, are available in our first quarter earnings release and supplemental earnings slides as well as on our website.","Let me also remind you that the information discussed during the call, with the exception of the participants' questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's express written permission. An archived copy of today's call will be available on our website and will remain available for a limited time.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Heather.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I can't believe it's only been a few short weeks since we last spoke during our Investor Day presentation in New York. As we shared with you then, and as our Q results continue to reinforce, Mylan is a differentiated player in our industry.","During Investor Day, we had the opportunity to highlight the power of our business model, which revolves around access, diversification, and durability. We provided a comprehensive overview of our commercial and operations platforms, as well as our exciting global pipeline. We also showcased Mylan's ability to generate consistent and durable results, supported by our diversity across geographies, product lines, and channels, all while absorbing evolving industry dynamics and natural market volatility.","Our first quarter continues to build on this story and represent a strong start to the year. We remain confident in our expectations regarding product approval timelines for key launches throughout the rest of the year and are reaffirming 2018 guidance. Since there have been no major changes since we were last with you, we're going to keep our remarks brief this morning, so we can get right into Q&A.","Before turning the call over to Ken to talk you through the highlights of the quarter, I'd like to take a moment, thank our employees around the world for their continued dedication and commitment to Mylan. And we look forward to answering all of your questions following Ken's remarks.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","Thanks, Heather, and good morning, everyone. I'll take a few minutes to provide a quick overview of our financial results for the first quarter, which were in line with our expectations.","Total revenues declined slightly compared to the prior year to approximately $2.7 billion. We continue to benefit from our diversified and durable platform, with solid revenue performance from both our Europe and Rest of World segments, helping to offset most of the competitive dynamics in North America.","North America was also negatively impacted in the quarter by the sale of certain contract manufacturing assets and the new revenue recognition accounting standard, both non-operational items.","Moving to segment profitability. Primarily as a result of declines in net sales from branded products, including EpiPen, the impact of the loss of exclusivity on olmesartan and olmesartan\/HCTZ, partially offset by new product introductions, North America declined 22% compared with the prior year.","Profitability expansion in both Europe and Rest of World, including benefits from our ongoing integration activities and the continued benefit of stable business operations in many markets, substantially mitigated the North America decline. We also invested in areas such as sales and marketing, as we focus on driving growth of several of our global key brands.","Adjusted net earnings declined 1% to $496 million, while adjusted diluted EPS increased 3% to $0.96, both of which were in line with our expectations for the quarter. The increase in adjusted diluted EPS includes the benefits from a lower share count, following the completion of our $1 billion share repurchase program in the beginning of the year.","Adjusted free cash flow for the three months ended March 31 totaled $664 million. That's an increase of 39% compared to the prior-year period and driven by improved working capital velocity.","At the end of Q1 2018, we decided to proactively execute a $1.5 billion bond offering, further strengthening our capital structure and increasing our financial flexibility, as we continue to execute on our business plan for 2018 and beyond.","We also intend to repay \u20ac500 million of notes maturing in November of this year. And as a result, we remain committed to deleveraging and to maintaining an investment grade credit rating. We also continue to expect our leverage ratio to be below 3.5 times by the end of 2018.","Finally, for the full-year 2018, we reaffirm our previously disclosed guidance and business outlook, including our total revenue guidance range of $11.75 billion to $13.25 billion. That's a 5% increase at the midpoint versus full year 2017.","Our adjusted EPS guidance remains unchanged at $5.20 to $5.60 per share, an increase of 18% at the midpoint when compared to the prior year. We also continue to expect full-year adjusted free cash flow generation in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion.","With that, we'll now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. If you have a follow up, please re-enter the queue.","Our first question comes from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Heather, just wondering if you could comment on the two upcoming GDUFA dates, June 4 for biosimilar Neulasta and June 27 for generic Advair. Specifically on Neulasta, there were some unrealized \u2013 Biocon received a Form 483. We don't know the magnitude of those issues. Maybe if you could clarify that and just address sort of some of those timeline issues. Thanks very much.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Sure. Jami, I'll start off with the remark I put in my opening remarks, which was we have no changes to the expectations that we laid out at Investor Day with \u2013 and accordingly with both of those GDUFA dates and where we see our key launches for the year. Nothing has changed our expectations to that. I'm going to let Rajiv comment on the [Form] 483.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Yeah, so, Jami, subsequent to our Investor Day update, our partner Biocon's Johor (09:06) facility was audited by FDA. And in our opinion, the [Form] 483 observations they received fall in the category of continuous improvement.","These observations are already being responded as we speak, and it doesn't change our outlook about approval and launch of this product. And we also continue to prepare for the launch of this very important product.","Your second question was around, I think, Advair. And I would say FDA continues to review our application expeditiously. It has sought some further clarifications from us to the responses we have submitted in the March (09:45). Everything is going off smooth. And we remain optimistic about our projected outlook of this very important product also.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Elliot Wilbur of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Morning. Maybe just as a follow up to that line of questioning, is there anything else that you could provide us with or maybe give a little bit more color on in terms of new product expectations for the balance of the year? Mylan's never been about one product or one product in any one particular year. But I guess increasingly, it seems like in the last 12 months, there's just sort of an excessive fixation on a couple of key assets, maybe given the lack of visibility into the much broader deeper pipeline.","So I don't know if there's anything that you could tell us or could share with us in terms of sort of some key new product assumptions, whether number of launches or revenue potential, something like that that might help alleviate some of the concern about the regulatory uncertainty on a couple of key products. Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Elliot, thank you. Listen, I guess I've got to start off by saying, I think you summed it up correctly. There seems to be a fixation on a couple of product launches and timing.","And I have to be honest with you, I can't give much more color to that other than, that's you guys. You guys are putting that fixation.","I think we have gone above and beyond of trying to explain that we're not a U.S. generics company. We're a global health care company that has over 7,000 products. And you look at our results and what we've demonstrated in Europe and Rest of World where our growth is, where we've continued to perform.","And you look at our U.S. business, which I would say in the environment we're in, not only continues to perform, but it demonstrates our ability to absorb the volatility that's going on.","So it's hard for me to step back and understand the disconnect, and the disconnect in appreciating the platform we have, discounting the performance that we've not only given historically but continue to produce and have shown a roadmap for growth over the next time horizon.","And yes, we have some great important products coming up for U.S. launches. We have some important products being launched throughout the world. And I can't let us feed into the fixation about one or two and a day here or there.","What I can tell you is we're going to continue to perform. We're going to execute. We're going to launch our products. We're going to maximize those launches. And we're going to do that around the world.","So thank you for that. And like I said, what we're here to do is to perform. And one way or the other, I think that we'll continue to unlock the value for this company with our performance.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Nachman of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Gary Nachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning. Heather, just to your last point, I thought there was particularly good performance in the EU. So what were the areas that drove most of the growth in the first quarter? When will Copaxone start to contribute there?","And the new product contribution of $103 million in the first quarter, how much of that was North America versus EU versus Rest of World? Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Okay. No, thank you for that. I'm going to let Tony discuss a little bit about our performance in Europe.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV","Thank you. I would say the performance in Europe perhaps at a few different pieces. If you look at our core markets like France, Italy, Spain, and countries like Poland, we've seen very nice double digit growth year over year. We've had a great contribution from new products like Rosuvastatin in markets like France, the UK, and the Netherlands.","And I think finally, it's our global key brands. Brands like DYMISTA, Creon, Influvac, and Elavil that we're seeing growing on a full year basis. And specifically in Q1, Creon, DYMISTA, and Elavil driving those markets.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","And on the launches, I would say it's almost 50\/50. Fifty comes from U.S.A. and \u2013 50% comes from U.S.A. and 50% comes from Europe.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV","And I \u2013 you asked a question around Glatiramer launch in Europe. We've launched in five markets. We look forward to continuing launching through May, June, and the months throughout 2018. And it is contributing. Certainly a great opportunity for us in Europe and the rest of the \u2013 in the U.S. as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Just two quick ones here. First, can we just hear an update on your capital deployment priorities from here? I think you've talked about your view that your stock doesn't reflect the diversification of the business. So I guess how are you balancing further share repo versus acquisitions? And with acquisitions, what scale are you considering as you think about transactions from here?","My second question was just on the generic Copaxone business and just a little bit more color on the commercial dynamics here. How are you thinking about the ramp of the product? Looks like volume has kind of stalled out a little bit. Should we think about further share gains for Mylan as the year progresses? Or is this a reasonable level to think about the business? Thanks so much.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Sure. Hi, Chris. Thanks. Look, I think we've been consistent and we'll continue to be consistent with our capital deployment. As we've said, we've got obviously tremendous financial flexibility, so that we can maintain our investment grade, obviously with the priority of paying down our debt.","But obviously, given the over $2 billion of free cash flow, we have the opportunity to continue to look at \u2013 to look at opportunities that complement our assets.","And when you look at the infrastructure we've built, our ability to add products, especially in our Rest of World region, that we can drive tremendous growth with bringing in products. Obviously as we look at Europe, we're always looking at bolt-ins and products that could add to now this very balanced of brands, generics and OTC.","And then obviously in the U.S., we still think we've got tremendous opportunity. When you look at diversifying with cash-pay products, when you look at consumer goods, when you look at things that we've got an ability to continue to leverage the current infrastructure we have built.","So we're looking at everything. We're looking at everything out there that would be very complementary to the platform we've built and \u2013 but not \u2013 with maintaining, like I said, our focus on investment grade with our flexibility.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","And, Chris, I'm going to give you a little bit high level on Copaxone's launch. And then Tony will chime in on specifically on U.S.A.","For products like Copaxone that you \u2013 and there will be many more like those, when you see \u2013 you will see it's not going to be traditional front and (16:56) \u2013 steep gain of the market share. You will see slow ramp with a long NOD (17:04), and it will be over a period of time.","For example, in Europe when we launched, based on the market type of the tender market, you can get to the 50% market, where like Norway or Nordics we have that. But in other markets somewhere that you're building up, it can be a slow ramp, but we have the same roll out markets here. Specifically, on U.S.A., Tony? Why don't you?","Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV","Yeah, I think, to Rajiv's point, we see some of the tender market in Europe is where we see increased conversion.","But the U.S. specifically, Chris, I think, as Rajiv just articulated it, the launch value capture has pushed out from what we're used to in this U.S. market, where it used to be generics captured all the value in six months. We're seeing a slower capture and slower peak value generation. But we also see extended length of time for value. That over the long term, the value is worth more.","And yes, we think that between 15% and 20% share of the Copaxone market is a very nice foundation. Actually, as we expect, we expect it to grow. And we're going to do everything in our power from a competitive landscape to go out there and do more and get more, because we think we've got a holistic program that benefits the patients. And we're going to go out and do our best.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ronny Gal of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everybody. And thank you for taking my questions. First, Ken. Could you help me a little bit in deciphering a little bit further where the contribution is coming from? I think you had $460 million in the United States, which is about 55% of your contribution, as you describe it. Any chance you can help us remove the injectable business and the branded business from there to just kind of like figure out where the kind of main channel oral generic business contribution is?","And then second, either to Tony or Rajiv. Speaking to peers, I'm hearing some very positive comments about your ARV business or your ideas about those 505(b)(2) new products. Can you describe to us what your strategy is there? What you're trying to accomplish? What do you think of those four I've said (19:01)?","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Hi, Ronny. Thank you. I'll start and then I'll let others chime in.","Ronny, I guess when we moved to these three segments and provided more transparency around each of the segments and the products and the profitability, that was very much driven because of what we said was our ONE Mylan approach to the market and our ability to leverage the very \u2013 the multiple dosage forms and the different products and the different channels. And really again, that leading to Mylan's durability, which continues to allow us to drive access and diversification.","So we believe that we've given much transparency around these segments and our profitability and the key drivers behind that. And further than that, we're not going to be separating any doseage forms.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","And on ARVs, Ronny, actually this whole franchise globally is doing very well. This quarter, we saw almost 20% growth year over year on this franchise, launching \u2013 launches of the TLD and TLE400 and gaining that market share. And now, not just U.S.A., we have, I think, achieved a critical mark in the European launches.","And as far as this 505(b)(2) opportunities in the U.S., I'd say I've hit a great sweet spot, where we are offering the patients a much more affordable combination of the products, which have been tested or used by the millions of patients across the world. And that's what we are trying to impress upon with the payers and partners like Kaiser (20:39) have to achieve a reasonable penetration. And we are seeing very good response as we have launched this franchise.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Douglas Tsao of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two, I think, quick ones. Just first on Neulasta, just curious, Rajiv, if you expect there will be a need for another reinspection of the Bangalore site.","And then two, maybe Tony, one thing we've heard from several generic manufactures in terms of the U.S. market is it sounds like people are being a little bit more opportunistic in terms of taking price opportunistically for some products. And I'm just curious if you're seeing that as well across the portfolio. Thank you.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","As I mentioned, on Neulasta, these [Form] 483 observations are of very routine nature on the continuous improvement time. And in my opinion, I don't see and they didn't indicate any need for them to come back in the wrap-up. And I don't have a crystal ball beyond that. But as of today, we don't see any indication or, in our opinion, any need for any re-inspection.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV","And maybe, Doug, just briefly as it relates to your commentary around opportunism. I think as we look at this U.S. business, we manage our business as a very large portfolio of products. And supply and demand have a very important role on that. And as supply and demand shifts, equilibrium does.","So we look at our portfolio as a balance between yes, there's products we've lowered certainly, and there's opportunities for us to take products at different price levels, whether it's new or existing. So I think we'll continue to manage our business in that manner. And we think \u2013 we feel really good about where this business is right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks very much. Rajiv, I was hoping that you could just paint a picture of the development of Advair. I'm sure you've been a little frustrated that it's taken this long to get to where you are with an Advair approval. But I know that Mylan originally purchased the facility from Pfizer maybe seven years ago. You helped the FDA draft the guidelines for generic Advair maybe four years ago. And then on the call today you mentioned you got some additional questions recently.","So I guess I'm sort of wondering why the FDA still has more questions. And then wanted to get your level of conviction that the drug will be approved in June on the action date. Thank you.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","David, thank you for your question. First of all, let me say I'm not frustrated. Products of this complexity, products of its kind, first-in-time, I think they are complex. And that complexity has taken \u2013 we didn't buy the facility. In fact, we built the facility. We bought it sort of conceptual, very early stage device program from Pfizer. And took a lot of work for us to bring it up to where we are today, worked with the FDA. All has gone well.","And don't misconstrue my questions. These are minor clarifications. When you submit response to 50, 60-odd questions that are part of the information request, they still want to seek some clarity about what we meant and what we said. So that's all.","And regarding my conviction, I'm very convinced with the science of the \u2013 about the science of this program. I have no doubts in my mind about the science of the program or the scientists.","Now I \u2013 that's right. When you asked me maybe last time that question, I said if and when. And sometime it's just blown out of the proportion.","We don't have a crystal ball. We \u2013 I'm exactly telling you what we see today. I don't see any hiccup. I don't see any indication from FDA about any more further red flags and stop that. And I'm conveying you the same optimism today through this answer.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Liav Abraham of Citi. Your line is now open.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you for all the color this morning. Just one additional question on Advair, and apologies for beating a dead horse here. But can you just remind us where you stand on the manufacturing front? And whether you anticipate any additional inspections by FDA prior to the action date? And from a manufacturing perspective, are you manufacturing commercial batches at the moment? Thank you.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Regarding your first part on whether we expect any more inspection. We were audited last year, sometime around summer, sometime in the summer. And there are no outstanding issues as far as that is concerned. And do we expect? Perhaps not, but I can't tell that. If they want to come sometime, we are manufacturing for last six months. We have validated the process, and now we are in the state of commercial manufacturing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ami Fadia of Leerink. Your line is now open.","Ami Fadia - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the questions. I have probably three. Firstly, just on Advair, can you confirm that you continue to expect it to be AB-rated to the brand?","And as you've seen the ramp with Copaxone being a little bit slower than what at least some on the Street had expected, how would you anticipate the ramp for Advair being \u2013 would it be different or similar to that of Copaxone? That's one.","Secondly on Copaxone, could you elaborate for us, where are you getting your current prescriptions from? Are they primarily new patients? And why are we not seeing a faster ramp? Is it more to do with the type of indications this product is for? Or is there something different about how payers are adopting a more complex product?","And then thirdly, just on biosimilars. You have several new biosimilars opportunities in Europe and Rest of the World. Could you give us some color around the type of pricing that you are seeing for the product and other certain markets where you're seeing \u2013 or where you expect faster uptake relative to other markets where it might be relatively slower? Just give us some color around that. Thank you.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Well, I'll start, and, Rajiv, chime in.","I guess we'll repeat the color that I think we've given pretty exhaustedly over the last few months. I'll start with Copaxone. We have said that any time that you're dealing with a product and a disease state where patients are put on a product, and they're on that product for life or a very long time, that yes, the uptake, we anticipated it being lower. We've continued to see U.S. dynamics continue to evolve with the payers and the distribution.","But as Tony I think very well stated, that yes, there's a slower uptake. But we see a long tail. And these products will continue to deliver a lot of value for Mylan over the longer term, especially around the globe.","I think as we think about Advair, it's a very different product, very different distribution network. And it's a product that's getting refilled very regularly. So we see from a patient perspective that dynamic being very different.","Now how the payer dynamics play into this? I mean what we can tell you is we're going to continue to compete. And as this market evolves, we feel that there's no one better positioned than Mylan, given our portfolio of products and the channels we compete in, to be able to optimize the product. And I assure you that will be our objective.","And as far as biosimilars around the globe, I think that we have said for a long period of time that we believed our biosimilar portfolio would generate much more revenue for us around the globe before it would here in the United States. We continue to believe that U.S. will lag Europe and other countries as far as the interchangeability and the uptake.","But we think that, obviously, they're going to be the next bolus of products of growth here in the U.S. And again, we believe Mylan is better positioned than anyone, with one of the largest portfolios of biosimilars.","And lastly, just to finish on Advair, we absolutely expect for it to be AB-rated.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Chiang of BTIG. Your line is now open.","Timothy Chiang - BTIG LLC","Hi. Thanks. Heather, along the lines of the respiratory segment that you're planning to build out with Advair, could you comment on any updates on Revefenacin? I know that you guys have highlighted the fact that you have an FDA decision coming in November. Do you need to build up your commercial infrastructure in front of that launch? Or are you basically already set on the respiratory side for this launch?","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","So, Tim, we had a mid-cycle meeting on April for Revefenacin with FDA, which went very well. And there were no outstanding questions. It's a routine review. And we don't see any red flags. And we remain optimistic about November approval of this product.","And as far as the infrastructure, we have respiratory infrastructure. We have been marketing prototype performance (30:30) and even now DYMISTA and even in EpiPen. So we have the infrastructure. And we don't need any more extra infrastructure but we \u2013 for Revefenacin launch.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I wanted to focus on the pipeline in these next two questions. First, maybe for you, Rajiv, the scientific approach you adopted on getting around Advair's inherent variability was primarily around establishing the in vitro, in vivo relationship and running a crossover study on one batch, at least per my understanding.","So my question is, do you have data for more than one batch? And is that something FDA has ever asked for? Or do they only want to see that one batch? And I ask that, because there's been a lot of questions around whether or not Novartis is going to run additional batches or not, with the underlying assumption being Advair has that up to two full (31:28) variance.","Second one, Ken, we're getting very close to some of your key launches on the biosimilar side, starting with Neulasta potentially very shortly and Herceptin next year and onwards. So my question is, we still \u2013 like, I personally still don't have a good sense for how to model the accounting and the profit split on this. And since it's going to be so important to the model, so we would really appreciate any clarity on that. Thank you.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Hi, Umer. I guess what I would say is, Umer, a few weeks ago, we gave I think about as much transparency on our pipeline as anybody out there. And I think that we exhaustively talked about not only our near term, mid-term, long term opportunity, but reconfirmed that we believed that we had no outstanding issues, no outstanding science, no outstanding inquiries from the FDA. I think Rajiv has reiterated that several times this morning.","So please just know that we absolutely are sitting in a position to understand and are the ones having the discussions with the FDA that we think have been very productive and very much feel that nothing has changed our expectation around our approval for Advair.","And as far as any more transparency on the products and their contribution. Look, Umer, that's why we give guidance out there. And I think this management team has a track record of close to a decade of delivering on our performance. So all I can say is that you should expect us to continue to do that. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rohit Vanjani of Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Rohit Vanjani - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I believe you had a facility inspection for biosimilar HUMIRA around the time of the Investor Day. I was just wondering what the results were there? Or if there was a Form 483 issued or any observations there?","And then secondly, for that Bangalore facility...","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Yeah.","Rohit Vanjani - Guggenheim Securities LLC","I think Herceptin, Neulasta, and Avastin are being made there. Are there any other products with 2018 and 2019 catalysts being made there, i.e., Lantus that they have still finished there? Or anything else that might be there?","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","We didn't understand your first question around...","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","We didn't hear your first question around HUMIRA. I guess on the second question, we're \u2013 obviously for a lot of reasons, competitive and otherwise, don't talk about where we're manufacturing our products.","But what was your question on HUMIRA?","Melissa Trombetta - Mylan NV","Look, we can just go to the next question","Operator","Our next...","Melissa Trombetta - Mylan NV","And then we can come back. So, Rohit, if you can get into the...","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Yeah, Rohit, can come back and handle it, yeah (34:05).","Operator","Our next question comes from Irina Koffler of Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Irina R. Koffler - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to hear from the team about EpiPen and the supply disruption. If you could just help us understand what remediation is being done? And maybe a little bit more on the timelines around it? Just because third quarter is typically seasonally the strongest quarter. And curious if you might be able to resolve a number of these issues by that time. Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Sure. So look, we \u2013 obviously we recognize the importance of EpiPen product to the patients that it serves. And as you know, Pfizer is our manufacturing partner. And Pfizer has experienced some manufacturing setbacks, but have continued to work very closely with FDA to be able to continually supply.","And I know there's been a lot of misinformation generated out there in the last few days. And we appreciated FDA taking the step to put up on their website, notifying that EpiPens are available. That \u2013 and ironically, they have to put that on the shortage, their shortage list, to say there's not a shortage.","There is intermittent supply. We've had \u2013 we've absolutely had fluctuations in that supply. But we've continued to see Pfizer being able to step up their ability to supply month over month. And we're continuing to have a very, very close watch on that and work very closely, again with not just Pfizer, but FDA, in making sure that we're getting \u2013 we're able to supply everybody who needs one.","And we've put our number on our website, on the FDA website, is the number anybody can call who's having \u2013 experiencing difficulty receiving an EpiPen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Finkelstein of Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Andrew Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Just in Europe if \u2013 I noticed that the segment contribution grew year on year at a little bit slower rate than revenue. So if you could talk at all about the dynamics there, I would think there could be some gross margin headwind, given product supplied out of India. And any investments you're making in Europe.","And then just in the U.S., I noticed this morning a couple notices of product discontinuations. Any color on efforts to continually optimize the portfolio in the U.S.? Thanks.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","So, Andrew, on the European segment profitability, growing a little bit slower than the top line. Remember that in Europe, we have a lot of R&D and manufacturing costs, as it relates to the products that we've been talking about today. So we have relatively more costs being converted back at a stronger euro and pound rate year over year. And that's the primary driver of the slightly lower growth.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","And regarding some product discontinuation, look, our Morgantown facility is perhaps one of the largest or solid (37:14) facility with the capacity to do about 18 billion to 20 billion doses.","In the evolving FDA standards, especially around the cross contamination, we find it hard to keep pace with making hundreds of molecules. We make more than \u2013 over 200 molecules in the facility. And we have taken our time now to simplify the operations and make it less complex and rationalize some of the portfolio. We have been very prudent. We have taken patient considerations in mind. We have kept our key customers and their needs in the mind.","And have taken some decients (37:50), which will have some impact on as we go along, you will see us dropping some volume. So I just want to highlight that. And you will see some volume shift over there as we drop some of the products but in a very diligent and prudent way.","Operator","Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our Q&A session. Thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to introduce the first speaker for today, Kris King. Ma'am, you have the floor.","Kris King - Vice President, Global Investor Relations","Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Mylan's conference call discussing our first quarter 2015 earnings and our offer to acquire Perrigo Company plc. Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Sheehan; and President, North America, Tony Mauro.","During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Such forward-looking statements may include, without limitation, statements about the proposed acquisition of Perrigo by Mylan, which I will refer to as the Perrigo proposal; Mylan's acquisition, which I will refer to as the Abbott transaction of Abbott Laboratories' non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business, which I will refer to as the Abbott business; the benefits and synergies of the Perrigo proposal or Abbott transaction; future opportunities for Mylan, Perrigo, or the combined company and products; and any other statements regarding Mylan, Perrigo, or the combined company's future operations, anticipated business levels, future earnings, planned activities, anticipated growth, market opportunities, strategies, competition and other expectations and targets for future periods.","Because forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties, actual future results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.","Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, uncertainties related to the Perrigo proposal and the consummation thereof; the ability to meet expectations regarding the accounting and tax treatments of the Abbott transaction and the Perrigo proposal; changes in relevant tax and other laws; the integration of Perrigo and the Abbott business being more difficult, time consuming or costlier than expected; operating costs, customer loss and business disruption being greater than expected following the Perrigo proposal and the Abbott transaction; the impact of competition situations where we manufacture, market and\/or sell products, notwithstanding unresolved allegations of patent infringement; any regulatory, legal or other impediments to our ability to bring new products to market; those set forth under forward-looking statements in today's earnings release; and the risk factors set forth in Mylan N.V.'s Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2014, as well as our other filings with the SEC.","These risks, as well as those other risks associated with Mylan, Perrigo and the combined company are also more fully discussed in the Registration Statement on Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement we are filing today in connection with the Perrigo proposal.","We undertake no obligation to update any statements made today, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Today's call should be listened to and considered in its entirety and understood to speak only as of today's date. In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are presented in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance.","Please refer to today's earnings release and the slide deck used during today's call, both of which are available on our website, as they contain detailed reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.","I would also like to point out that Mylan's offer for Perrigo is governed by the Irish Takeover Rules. Under the Irish Takeover Rules, Mylan management is prohibited from discussing any material, new information or significant new opinion which has not been publicly announced. Any person interested in shares in Mylan or Perrigo is encouraged to consult a professional advisor. Before I turn the call over to Heather, let me also remind you that the material in the call, with the exception of the participant questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's express written permission. An archived copy of today's call will be available on our website and will remain available for a limited time.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Heather.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, and thank you for joining us this afternoon. As promised, we've been busy since we last spoke to you on our fourth quarter earnings call. Our primary focus today will be on our strong first quarter results and on our legal binding commitment to acquire Perrigo. Mylan fully intends to comply with all requirements of the Irish Takeover Rules that govern this process. As such, we would like to caution investors that we will be limited in our ability to disclose certain forward-looking information.","Further during this call, we will not be discussing board or board-related matters. As such, we will not be speaking to Teva's unsolicited expression of interest or answering questions on this topic. We believe that our board's response speaks for itself.","Before I turn the call over to Rajiv and John, who will briefly review our first quarter earnings, I'd like to say hello and thank you to all Mylan employees around the world joining us on the call today, including our new Mylan EPD employees. I would like to thank each and every one of them for their hard work, dedication, and continued focus on execution, all of which helped us to deliver the strong first quarter performance we will be discussing today.","Rajiv Malik - President","Thank you, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone.","As you can see on slide seven, Mylan delivered solid first quarter results, kicking off what we believe will be yet another year of strong financial performance for the company. Sales during the quarter totaled nearly $1.9 billion, a constant currency increase of 15% compared to the same period last year.","Adjusted diluted EPS came in at $0.70, an increase of 6% compared to the first quarter of 2014. As highlighted on this slide, all of our regions within the Generics segment experienced strong constant currency revenue growth, which was a result of new product introductions combined with positive impact, especially in Europe, of the acquisition of the non-U.S. EPD business.","Within our Specialty segment, third-party net sales in the first quarter increased 8% compared to the prior year period as EpiPen Auto-Injector continued to experience volume growth. In addition, the integration of the recently acquired EPD business is proceeding smoothly and we already have begun realizing the substantial value we envisioned from this strategic transaction.","Turning to slide eight, we have been very active during the first quarter with respect to execution of our growth drivers. For instance, recruitment for our comparative effectiveness study for generic Advair is nearly complete and we look forward to getting back in front of the FDA in late summer and remain on track for filing our ANDA by year end.","As you are aware, we have established a strategic collaboration with Theravance Biopharma for the development and commercialization of TD-4208, which is expected to be approved as a once-daily nebulized LAMA product for COPD patients. Our technical and clinical teams have been working diligently together and we can now tell you that we expect to initiate our Phase III efficacy trials in the second half of this year.","We also remain on track to launch our two other respiratory programs in Europe this year, generic Seretide MDI and generic Flixotide MDI. Similarly, with respect to our two Phase III studies for Glargine, we have completed recruitment for Type 1 diabetes studies ahead of schedule and we expect to wrap up recruitment for the Type 2 diabetes study in July. We remain on track to commission our commercial manufacturing facility by this summer's end.","On the biologics front, we continue to progress with our partner Biocon on trastuzumab global Phase III trial. We are pleased to report that the Phase III trial for (9:15) is well underway and we also have recently initiated our global Phase III study for adalimumab.","With regard to our ANDA for generic Copaxone, as previously stated, we responded to all FDA requests to date. We remain fully confident that we are well-positioned to receive approval for our application. The approval of the Sandoz ANDA demonstrates that FDA is moving forward with approvals of substitutable generic version of this product. We are further encouraged by FDA's denial of Teva's eighth citizen petition. The FDA's response outlines their criteria for approval and Mylan is confident that our ANDA meets each of these criteria.","We also completed the clinical equivalence trial for Estradiol Vaginal Cream as per FDA's guidance and look forward to the next steps to adding another complex product to our portfolio.","Finally, I would like to echo Heather's sincere sentiments by thanking our employees for their unwavering dedication to our cause of delivering better health for a better world.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John D. Sheehan - CFO, EVP, Principal Financial & Accounting Officer","Thank you, Rajiv.","Looking at slide nine, as Rajiv mentioned, our total revenues for the first quarter of 2015 were $1.9 billion, which included one month of results from the Established Products Business we acquired. Sales were unfavorably impacted by approximately $93 million due to the effect of foreign currency translation, primarily reflecting changes in the U.S. dollar as compared to the euro, the yen, and the Australian dollar. However, on a constant currency basis, revenues in our Generics segment increased 15% when compared to the prior year period, an increase that includes revenues of $147 million contributed from the EPD business.","Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter of 2015 was a very strong 53%, up 240 basis points from the same prior year period. Our strong margins were primarily the result of new product introductions in North America combined with the positive contribution from the EPD business.","R&D expense on an adjusted basis was $152 million or approximately 8% of total revenues. As we continue to invest in our key growth drivers during 2015, we expect R&D spending as a percentage of total revenues to be within our guidance range for the full year. At the same time, SG&A also on an adjusted basis was $409 million or approximately 22% of total revenues, which includes the impact of the EPD business combined with our continued investment in the EpiPen Auto-Injector.","Our first quarter adjusted net income was $309 million or $0.70 per share, a 6% increase from our Q1 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.66 per share. Our adjusted diluted EPS was above our expectations from the beginning of the quarter and was achieved in spite of the significant currency headwinds we encountered.","Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics; cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis was $336 million, and first quarter capital spending was $48 million as we continued to invest in our business and growth drivers. At the end of the quarter, our debt to EBITDA leverage ratio was approximately 2.1 to 1. We continue to have ample borrowing capacity, including our recently announced bridge credit agreement for the proposed Perrigo transaction, and we remain committed to our long-term leverage targets which are consistent with investment grade.","To summarize, our first quarter provided an excellent start to 2015 and we remain committed to our 2015 guidance metrics which we communicated during our Q4 2014 earnings call in March. For the second quarter of 2015, we currently anticipate adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.86 per share to $0.90 per share, which would be a 28% increase over the prior year quarter, and we remain confident in our calendar year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4 per share to $4.30 per share.","That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn this call back over to Heather.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, John. Close to a decade ago, we laid out Mylan's vision and strategy and since pursued them relentlessly and consistently, never doing transactions for transactions' sake, never doing transactions whose main focus was cost synergies, never doing transactions for the sole purpose of lowering our tax rate.","Instead, we have always focused on doing transactions that complement our strategy, support long-term sustainable growth, allow us to further enhance and leverage what we've built and help us move closer to achieving our vision of delivering better health for a better world to seven billion people.","As we have demonstrated, Mylan aggressively pursues such transactions and we have repeatedly stated that we would be using our enhanced financial flexibility to do other large deals. And for those of you who know Mylan well, we do what we say we are going to do. The combination with Perrigo is simply the next important strategic step in our evolution, and builds on our strong platform consistent with our long-standing and clearly articulated vision and strategy. We have long believed the combination of Perrigo and Mylan represents an extraordinary opportunity.","As you have seen through our actions over the past few weeks, we are committed to making this combination a reality. The combination of Mylan and Perrigo demonstrates clear and compelling industrial logic. The potential here is truly transformative, and the transaction would redefine the delivery of global healthcare. A combined Mylan and Perrigo would be ideally positioned at the forefront of the megatrends driving change throughout the healthcare industry, including the growing number of Rx to OTC switches underway.","Together, we could better serve our customers and patients, create more opportunities for our employees and communities, and generate additional value for our shareholders and stakeholders. Mylan and Perrigo are highly complementary businesses and together, we would have unmatched reach and impact. Each company augments the other's platform to create something that is better, not just bigger, in terms of portfolio and pipeline, commercial footprint, operational leverage across customer channels and manufacturing and supply chain capabilities.","Let me quickly highlight some of the key strategic and financial benefits of the transaction. As a combined company, we will have a meaningful presence across all customer channels and we will have critical mass and leadership across Gx, Rx, and OTC with one of the industry's broadest and most diversified portfolios.","We will have the opportunity to offer our customers a compelling value proposition through a unique ability to deliver products and services in an environment where scale and reach are increasingly important. We will also have unmatched global scale and immense geographic reach in order to maximize this portfolio across existing and new markets. This scale and reach would improve patient access to affordable, high-quality medicine.","In addition to an enhanced commercial platform, we will have a massive global manufacturing platform and supply chain. This will provide a real critical advantage because it will allow us to deliver the reliability and cost advantages our customers have come to rely on. We are well-positioned to optimize the enhanced platform of the combined company, as well as Mylan's strong brand equity, to capitalize on trends shaping the healthcare industry and drive future growth and financial performance.","The combined company will be a stronger, larger and more diverse business, with approximately $15.3 billion of pro forma revenues in 2014 and significant free cash flow. Importantly, the transaction is accretive to adjusted EPS on a fully synergized basis. We expect to achieve annual pre-tax operational synergies of at least $800 million fully realizable by year four after closing.","We also expect to maintain our investment grade credit rating. The strong industrial and financial rationale will redefine how we can deliver on our mission to provide the world's seven billion people access to affordable, high-quality medicine.","Turning to slide 12, you can see that this transaction aligns with our existing growth drivers, enhancing our capabilities in respiratory and complex products, providing access to new geographic markets, while adding an exciting new opportunity in OTC. This broader platform enhances our ability to provide customers with healthcare solutions, not just products.","We have long thought that OTC could be a very important piece of the Mylan story and have carefully evaluated the best way to expand our presence in this area. In fact, the acquisition of the EPD business gave us a foothold in OTC. That platform would complement and enhance Perrigo's existing global growth plan.","Moving on to slide 13; importantly, our history of doing good and doing well would only be improved by this combination. Our broader product portfolio, significant commitment to R&D and larger cost advantaged manufacturing platform would better position us to serve our patients and customers and further enhance our ability to provide access to medicines and bring new innovations to market. The transaction also would create more opportunities for employees because they would be part of a larger and even stronger organization with significant growth potential. We have a great admiration for Perrigo's management and workforce, and there would be opportunities for best practice sharing across the combined company.","Mylan has long been considered a partner of choice, given our platform and geographic breadth, and this transaction would only enhance that positioning. The increased scale and significant free cash flows will directly enhance the position of our creditors and suppliers as well. And as we will outline in more detail now, this transaction has significant potential for shareholder value creation.","You can't just buy your way to greatness; you have to earn it through execution and performance. Both Mylan and Perrigo's shareholders can have great confidence in the value potential of the combined company, based on our management teams' proven ability to deliver shareholder value and achieve our goals through strategic organic and inorganic growth initiatives.","As we have outlined here on slide 14, we have carefully pursued transactions in the past that enhance our strategic positioning in the industry and add key capabilities, expanding geographic reach or enhancing operations. For instance, in 2007 we acquired Matrix and began building a horizontally and vertically integrated platform that today would be nearly impossible to replicate. Matrix also gave us a presence in India, which today is home to nearly half of our operations and employees.","We subsequently build upon this transformational transaction, creating a global footprint that we now leverage to deliver high-quality products efficiently and cost effectively around the world. Importantly, Mylan has the right team to execute and integrate this transaction. We have a strong track record of creating value from M&A and exceeding our synergy targets. Our integration of Merck's generics and specialty business is an excellent example of exceeding our synergy targets in a large, transformative transaction. We delivered acquisition synergies of approximately $500 million from this deal, which was double our original target.","These transactions and continued consistent strong execution on our business have resulted in strong performance and value creation for our shareholders, as you can see on slide 15. The team that delivered this double digit top line and bottom line growth and that integrated these prior deals is the team running this business today. Our performance is best seen through our annualized three-year total shareholder return, which is 50% higher than the S&P 500 Pharma benchmark and more than double the S&P 500 over the same period.","The current Mylan team also would benefit from the experience, expertise and institutional knowledge of core executives from the Perrigo and Omega team, and we have proposed joining the leadership team of the combined company precisely because we have great respect for what they have built.","Rajiv will now review how this combination will enhance our operational and commercial excellence.","Rajiv Malik - President","Thank you, Heather. I also am very excited about the potential of this transaction and the many opportunities that it would create for both Mylan and Perrigo.","On slide 17, you can start to see how we will mean more to our customers as a result of this combination. We'll have an impressive, diversified, and differentiated product portfolio with an ability to offer all of our customers thousands of marketed products across Gx, Rx, and OTC and across therapeutic categories and dosage forms.","The charts on this slide really spell out how the combination will expand and diversify both businesses' portfolios, including increasing Mylan OTC offering from 2% of revenue to almost 30%. A combined Mylan and Perrigo would have an unmatched ability to serve the front and back of pharmacies and other retail locations. Mylan's portfolio would be further strengthened by Perrigo's strong and complementary position in nutritional and animal health products which would allow us to bring even more value to customers around the world.","Turning to slide 18, you can see how the combined company would be well-placed to build and strengthen its existing portfolios by developing and commercializing new products. Both Mylan and Perrigo have robust pipelines in Gx and OTC opportunities.","In the past few years we have really distinguished ourselves from our peers through our ability to secure new approvals. For example, in 2014 we were the leading ANDA filer and we currently have an impressive 269 ANDAs pending with FDA, including 44 first-to-file opportunities. We also have a track record of securing approvals across multiple countries and currently have more than 3,700 global filings pending regulatory approval.","At the same time, Perrigo has an exciting opportunity ahead of its market trends in OTC continue to move favorably in its direction. As Perrigo recently stated, it expects nearly $1 billion in total new product revenues over the next three years.","Mylan's efficiencies and clear record of success in execution can play an important role in helping ensure that Perrigo captures the potential of these products around the world. In short, the combined company has a clear opportunity to further build its portfolio by bringing hundreds of new products to market every year across therapeutic categories and dosage forms, and drive organic growth well into the future.","Turning to slide 19, Mylan and Perrigo share many values and we have great respect for what Perrigo has accomplished. One common area of focus for our companies is R&D and its ability to unlock future growth drivers as the global healthcare system continues to evolve. At Mylan, we have been talking about the exciting opportunities in biologics, respiratory, and other complex products for some time now, and we are making great progress in many of these areas.","Similarly, Perrigo's platform will continue to evolve through strategic R&D investment to capitalize on macro trends, especially the powerful and ongoing move from Rx to OTC and the opportunities for branded OTC extensions.","This shared commitment to R&D coupled with a proven ability to secure approvals will continue to drive the growth of the combined company and position it to capitalize on the opportunities of the changing global healthcare industry. On slide 20 you can immediately see that a combined Mylan and Perrigo would have a massive vertically integrated manufacturing platform with 70 production sites around the world.","Moving on to the next slide; this combined platform will have annual capacity of more than 100 billion tablets and capsules, and leveraging capacity across the combined companies' manufacturing platform will drive growth and our ability to bring products to market, while minimizing the need for near-term investment in additional capacity.","This platform also will be differentiated by both companies' commitment to and track record of quality and proven ability to manage the entire global supply chain. All of this will give us the flexibility to deliver the quality, reliability and cost advantages that customers have come to rely upon. In addition to our strong presence in oral solids, we'll have broad capabilities across APIs, injectables, (28:34), semi-solids, ointments, creams and liquids.","Further, we are enhancing these capabilities with additional complex technology capabilities, including respiratory, biologics and insulin. In short, this platform would be a one-of-a-kind asset capable of delivering all of what our customers need today, while supporting future growth.","Slide 22 demonstrates just how strong the combined companies' consumer-focused platform would be. Together, Mylan and Perrigo would pose a broad portfolio of curable market-leading, consumer-facing products across specialty, branded generics, nutritional and OTC.","Mylan's strong existing consumer-focused portfolio, which includes leading brands such as EpiPen, Brufen, Perforomist, and Creon, among others, would be further strengthened by Perrigo's powerful brands, such as (29:42) Physiomer and Paranix. This strong portfolio will be supported and further enhanced by Mylan's consistent investment in its brand equity across customer channels.","Moving to slide 23, you can see what we mean by this combination redefining the delivery of healthcare. With addition of Perrigo, we would have an unmatched ability to deliver for all of our customers and, ultimately, patients. We would have critical mass across all customer channels and would be able to leverage our operating platform and commercial best practices for customers in every segment, especially the retail and pharmacy space.","We'll go to market as One Mylan with the ability to meet the critical needs of all our customers and patient groups, and deliver meaningful healthcare solutions. Although, we'll be optimally positioned to capitalize on macro trends and the industry environment, including evolving distributor and pure dynamics, the need for increased scale and reach and Rx to OTC switches.","Now let's turn to slide 24 to look at how this impressive portfolio would be leveraged by a broad commercial footprint. The combined company would have a significant commercial presence, covering approximately 145 countries worldwide. This global platform, which Perrigo doesn't have today, would be at (31:24) Perrigo's early stage global expansion efforts and create expansion and revenue growth opportunity by introducing Perrigo's products in these new geographies. Perrigo would also facilitate Mylan's entry into some new exciting geographies, such as Mexico, Russia and Israel, providing opportunities to introduce Mylan's broad portfolio in these countries.","Further, the combination would optimize each company's platform in both North America and Europe. There is significant opportunity to drive additional value in Europe because Mylan could leverage its recently acquired assets from Abbott, and Perrigo's recent acquisition of Omega to accelerate brand growth in the region. This will create greater opportunities for employees and allow us to better serve patients and customer in the region.","The EPD business complements Mylan's Generics sales force in Europe because of its deep experience in specialty and branded generics. Through this transaction, Mylan's platform would be further enhanced by Omega's OTC sales force. The complementary nature of Mylan and Perrigo platform would create additional growth opportunities through cross-selling and sharing best practices. The opportunities in Europe are especially exciting given the unique dynamics of its pharmacy model.","I will now introduce Tony Mauro, President of North America, to provide you with the details on how this transaction would enhance our presence in our largest market, North America.","Anthony Mauro - President, Mylan North America, Mylan N.V.","Thanks, Rajiv, and good afternoon, everyone.","As Heather and Rajiv clearly laid out, we're very excited about the opportunity to create a new kind of value for customers and patients in North America through the acquisition of Perrigo; value that can be experienced across every stage of life from a range of acute and chronic conditions in aisles of every pharmacy, as well as behind the counter.","For instance, Mylan accounts for approximately 1 in every 13 prescriptions dispensed in the U.S., showcasing our reach with pharmacists and physicians, while the majority of Perrigo's product portfolio is consumer-facing. By adding Perrigo's large OTC and complementary generics portfolio to Mylan's extensive and existing product offering and commercial organization in North America, we're looking at a total offering of more than 430 generics and more than 1,900 SKUs in over 400 OTC product families.","In the U.S., Mylan and Perrigo enjoy long-standing relationships with the vast majority of retail pharmacies. Currently, five of Mylan's top customers account for more than 75% of our Generic business. The continued consolidation of our customer base and remaining existing supply network has created a unique opportunity for Mylan and Perrigo to combine a front store and back store portfolio that would allow our customers to meet patients' needs in a whole new way.","Enhancing our position as the supplier of choice in North America means providing an agile supply of high-quality product while ensuring the scale and efficiency our customers need to act quickly in today's ever-evolving marketplace. Finally, strengthening our North American offering will build unmatched brand equity across every point in the patient's journey, from behind the counter to front store consumer-facing offerings, the combination of Mylan and Perrigo in North America creates a one-of-a-kind opportunity to focus less on individual products or treatment categories and more on providing patient solutions.","Now, let me turn the call back over to Rajiv.","Rajiv Malik - President","Thanks, Tony. On slide 26 you can see that this transaction will generate significant synergies.","As Heather stated earlier, these complementary assets are expected to drive at least $800 million of annual pre-tax operational synergies by the end of year four following completion of the transaction. We have a lot of confidence in our synergy targets. I also know that the Irish Takeover Rules require such estimates be prepared using a sound process and be independently reported on, in our case, by PwC and Goldman Sachs. As we've said before, this team has a proven history of meeting the goals it sets for itself and oftentimes exceeding those goals.","Those who know Mylan recognize its history and our synergy goals should be viewed in the context of what our team has been able to accomplish in the past. We believe we can leverage the strengths of both organizations to achieve our targets, while at the same time accelerate the growth of the combined company. Given the scale of our platform, we see significant opportunities for enhanced efficiencies. This also will limit our need for planned expansion. As you will recall, Mylan had previously planned to increase its oral solid capacity to more than 80 billion doses and this gets us beyond our goal.","We also see opportunities to do more with our combined R&D operations, and work more efficiently as we develop products for Gx and OTC markets. Please note that this target of at least $800 million doesn't take into account the sales growth potential we see from coming together.","Now, let me turn the call over to John again.","John D. Sheehan - CFO, EVP, Principal Financial & Accounting Officer","As you can see on slide 27, the combined company would benefit from a significantly enhanced financial profile which would support continued growth and value creation. Strong profitability would drive substantial cash flow generation and support deleveraging as well as continued investment in new business development and R&D. As a result we expect to maintain our investment grade credit rating after the transaction closes. With the addition of Perrigo we would create an even stronger, larger and more diverse platform with about $15.3 billion of pro forma revenues in 2014.","Importantly, the acquisition of Perrigo would be accretive to adjusted EPS on a fully-synergized basis. Our strong balance sheet would enable the combined company to remain forward looking and able to continue to pursue expansion through business development and acquisitions. Furthermore, there would be significant opportunity for meaningful growth, given the strength of the combined businesses' rich pipeline of launches and opportunities to mean more to customers across business lines.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Heather to walk through this compelling transaction.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, John. Now let me discuss the legally-binding commitment we announced on April 29 to make this combination a reality. Under Irish Takeover Rules, Mylan's Rule 2.5 announcement means we are legally committed to launch the offer and take this attractive proposal directly to Perrigo shareholders, offering them certainty. This offer consists of $75 in cash and 2.3 Mylan shares for each Perrigo share, which based on Mylan's closing stock price of $68.36 on April 8, the first day after overwhelming market reaction to our initial proposal, which equates to $232.23 per share.","This represents a multiple of approximately 25 times Perrigo's calendar year 2014 EBITDA pro forma for its recent acquisition of Omega Pharma, which compares favorably to recent transactions in our industry. After close, Perrigo shareholders will own approximately 39% of the combined company, while Mylan shareholders will own approximately 61%.","Turning to slide 30, I'd like to reiterate, importantly for Perrigo shareholders that there is a clear and certain path to completion of the transaction. We are confident that we can close the deal before the end of the year. We have committed financing in place and have already incurred significant, non-refundable, committed financing fees. We have already filed for HSR approval, and made a hell or high water commitment with respect to U.S. antitrust clearance, and we've also started the pre-notification process with the European Commission.","Furthermore, our offer is not conditional on due diligence. We are in the process of preparing tender offer documentation for Perrigo shareholders, and believe that they will recognize the compelling nature of our offer. Additionally, the process required to secure the Mylan shareholder vote is well underway. The Mylan Shareholder Meeting is expected to occur early in the third quarter, and we are confident in our ability to secure approval from Mylan shareholders.","Looking at slide 31, it is clear we are not alone in seeing the potential of this combination. Perrigo's share price was up 18%, and Mylan's share price was up 15% upon the initial announcement of the transaction on April 8. These share price spikes have occurred while the broader market has remained relatively stable, underscoring the market's belief in the logic of this transaction.","Further, as shown on slide 32, analysts and other third parties also quickly recognize the compelling strategic rationale of this combination.","Moving on to the next slide, another way to think about the attractiveness of our offer for Perrigo's shareholders is to consider EPS. At the midpoint of this guidance range, Perrigo expects to deliver adjusted EPS of $7.75 in 2015. Under Mylan's offer, Perrigo's shareholders will get more than $10 in adjusted EPS on a fully-synergized basis, plus $75 per share in cash. Clearly, this adjusted EPS figure is substantially more than Perrigo could achieve on a standalone basis or through pursuing alternative acquisitions. In addition, Perrigo shareholders will continue to benefit from the combined companies' strong growth platform and future value creation.","Turning to slide 34; I would like now to spend a few minutes addressing the valuation of this offer in a bit more detail. As you know, Perrigo has stated that they value our offer based on Mylan's closing price as of March 10, 2015. We think this is simply misleading for shareholders. Once our offer was made public on April 8, the market spoke loud and clear, as we already stated. The closing price on April 8 of $68.36 is the true, unaffected share price with which to calculate the value of our offer.","Prior to April 8, the volume of shares traded and percent change of our stock price was entirely in line with normal averages, discounting for the secondary offering of Abbott shares. I would also like to note that the implied multiple of this offer is very much in line with previous precedent transactions, regardless of which Mylan share price you use to calculate it. Furthermore, the analyst price targets of a combined Mylan Perrigo, clearly demonstrate the value creation, with even the low end target of $70 representing a value exceeding $236 per share. Put simply, we believe, and it is clear the market believes, our offer is significantly above the self-serving math that the Perrigo board has been using.","On slide 35, you can see why in summary this proposal is the right choice for Mylan and Perrigo shareholders. This combination offers an attractive cash and stock proposal, the opportunity to participate in the future growth of a stronger combined company, and a clear and certain path to completion. We believe this combination produces values above what Perrigo shareholders can expect on a standalone basis, giving the undeniable financial and strategic logic of this transaction, we still believe engagement is in the best interest of our shareholders and other stakeholders of both companies.","Finally, turning to slide 36; we have said it throughout the call, that those who know Mylan know that we have been clear and unwavering over the last decade about our vision and our strategy for the future. This vision has called for complementary and strategic transactions that enhance our company while at the same time achieving results for our shareholders and all other stakeholders.","We have consistently managed the integration and execution of organic growth drivers to grow our earnings per share on a 27% compounded annual growth rate. This world-class ability to execute gives us the confidence in achieving our target of at least $6 adjusted diluted EPS by 2018. Mylan does not do deals simply for the synergies needed to build a bridge to the next transaction. We are patient and persistent to find the right transactions that deliver on our vision and maintain our track record of steadily increasing shareholder return.","The combination of Mylan and Perrigo is no different. We are excited about the potential for this transaction to create long-term sustainable value for all stakeholders and look forward to advancing through this process rapidly.","Thank you for your time, and I'll now turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Sumant Kulkarni from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. So in the event that the Perrigo transaction goes through, how do you reconcile short-term shareholder value versus long-term shareholder value, given that Perrigo pays a dividend? And then, plan B, if Perrigo does not go through, what's Mylan's next step?","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Sumant. Look, I would say that I think our track record hopefully speaks to the fact that we are constantly executing on both short-term, midterm and long-term, and I believe the combination of what we will be able to deliver together is going to be truly the best for both of our shareholders, both companies, and we'll deliver, like I said, both short-term, middle-term and long-term. And look, I think back when we were together last quarter and we talked about aggressively pursuing transactions, and that Abbott would be the first of transactions that we were looking at, now this being the second, but you should know, we're not standing still and we will continue to look at transactions that, again, strategically complement our global platform.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Related to the Perrigo offer, can you talk to the ROIC metrics based on your proposal? And can you also talk about whether you were a bidder on Omega, given you said that you've had some interest in OTC for some time? Thanks.","John D. Sheehan - CFO, EVP, Principal Financial & Accounting Officer","So, Gregg, I'll take the ROIC one, and early on the call here, we indicated that the Irish Takeover Laws limited the amount of forward information we could provide, and so that's one that at this time we aren't going into detail on.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","And as far as Omega, Gregg, we have said that you should always assume we're looking at everything and transaction that makes sense. Obviously, if you go back at the timing, we were in the middle of our Abbott transaction, but believe that the Omega asset is a great one and one that would be very complementary to our now infrastructure throughout Europe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry from Leerink Partners. Your line is open.","Jason M. Gerberry - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious if you could talk a little bit about how you went about valuing the Tysabri pipeline indications for Perrigo? And do you view those as upside to the offer that you've put forward? Do you think, yes, this is something and that potentially in future bids you might have to implement a CVR structure? Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jason. Look, what I would say is we took everything into consideration. I think we have a very competitive and compelling offer on the table and we look forward to pursuing the transaction.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Finkelstein from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Andrew J. Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks very much for taking the question. Could you elaborate any more in terms of you talked about not standing still? But you know, as you look at the platform that you would have with Perrigo, what horizons might that open up that aren't available today? And then just in general as you evaluate deals and given your confidence in a hell or high water condition, how do you think that regulators are looking at reviewing consolidation within the pharmaceutical space, whether it's a product-by-product overlap or a larger analysis of concentration that would be helpful. Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you, Andrew. I think that as we laid out what a Perrigo\/Mylan combination will provide is a very unique value proposition across all customer channels and our ability to truly redefine the delivery of how we'll bring healthcare services to market. And so I think that as a combination, not only would we have the financial flexibility and the scale and size to truly look at continuing to enhance that patient experience. And I think that as we look at our mission statement of providing the world's seven billion people access to affordable medication, it will just continue to open up the opportunities of other transactions that we can look at to enhance and accelerate delivering on our mission statement.","As far as hell and high water and the FTC is concerned, I believe that as we've seen in other areas of the industry that have seen consolidation, if I look at the payer, if I look at just Medco, Express Scripts, I think that took eight months or nine months to get through the FTC. So I think as the FTC looks at very large transactions, they take a lot into consideration. It's not just about the product overlap, it could also be around the environment or around shortages, around pricing, around just what that would mean for the industry from a leadership position. So I believe that there's a lot taken into consideration and they take their time to really look at all those factors.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thank you. I just was wondering what happened to the European generic business? If I back out the impact from currency and the contribution from the Abbott business, it looks like that business was down 8%. What's going on there? Is that an impact...","John D. Sheehan - CFO, EVP, Principal Financial & Accounting Officer","No.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'm sorry. Go ahead.","John D. Sheehan - CFO, EVP, Principal Financial & Accounting Officer","No, Jami \u2013 so, Jami, our European business, if you will, let's call it the Mylan legacy or Mylan base business in Europe grew mid-single digits in the first quarter year-over-year. So we can go through \u2013 on a constant currency basis. So we can go through the math together. But that business absolutely grew in the first quarter.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, it's not all of the Abbott business was reported in that line? The Abbott business was \u2013 part of that was...","John D. Sheehan - CFO, EVP, Principal Financial & Accounting Officer","So, yeah. The Abbott business \u2013 let's not call it the Abbott business. The Mylan EPD Business is a global business, including in Australia, Japan, Canada and then the European business. Certainly, Europe is the largest, but very nice presence in all those other markets. And business is being reported in each of our geographic regions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Faerm from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Mike E. Faerm - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I have a general M&A question. While the Perrigo offer is pending, should we expect to see other deal announcements? And if the answer is yes to that, how does the existence of the Perrigo bid impact the strategic and financial characteristics of other deals you might pursue in the meantime? For example, a lower cap on size or different fit considerations or otherwise?","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So, Mike, like I have stressed, we are committed to completing those transactions in a very timely manner. We said that we expected our shareholder vote early in Q3. So you can assume that our focus and attention is on this Perrigo transaction. With that being said, we are constantly looking at BD transactions, product transactions and that will always be a constant. And in addition to all of that, obviously, the macro environment is continuing to evolve around us. And we'll continue to be part of that. But right now, our full attention and focus is completing this Perrigo transaction.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Christopher T. Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Great. Thanks very much. I guess my question is with regards to Perrigo is a question of why now right after you've completed your own inversion. It sounds like some of the commentary, both from your letter and from Perrigo's call a few weeks ago, it sounds like you guys had conversations about a year ago which obviously didn't result in a transaction. If I just could, why does this deal make more sense today than it did a year ago for both parties?","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Chris. I don't think it makes more sense today. I think the transaction and this combination has made sense for some time, which is why we've had several conversations over the years with Perrigo. I think most recently, if you look at the timing, obviously, there was a lot of other things happening between both of our businesses. Now, you see that we were in the middle of the Abbott transaction and Perrigo was in the middle of the Omega transaction.","So for us, it just became now a matter of after we were able to get the Abbott transaction closed, we said that we were going to be aggressively pursuing transactions that the financial flexibility that the Abbott transaction would afford us, we would be putting immediately to work. And we believe that Perrigo absolutely is that next right transaction to enhance shareholder value creation for both companies.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Thanks for taking my question and thank you for laying out the proposition on the Perrigo deal. So can you quantify for us the accretion \u2013 the peak accretion on the Perrigo deal if synergies vastly outperform the initial numbers you put out there? And then also, what's your confidence in getting a favorable shareholder vote based on your interaction with your shareholders for the Perrigo deal? Thank you.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","So, well, first, I think for the synergy part of your question, I think the last slide of the deck nicely lays out what we have tried to underscore in this call, which is transactions for us were not just about synergies or tax rates. It's truly about being strategic and complementary. And we have truly executed on all the transactions that we've done and exceeded any targets that we've put out there. So I would say that you should assume that that track record would speak to the transaction as well, and as we've mentioned, the Irish Takeover Rules prohibit us from going any deeper at the moment with how that lays out or how it could fold in, but that's why we tried to stress in the presentation that it's at least $800 million. And all I can say is I don't think we would disappoint on what we will deliver with a combined \u2013 with this combination.","And what was the second part? Oh, the shareholder vote. So, look, over the coming days and weeks, I can assure you we will be very active with the shareholders, and we believe that the compellingness of this transaction really has been already \u2013 the market has already recognized this. And we believe it's a compelling transaction, and what it's going to deliver on a going-forward basis are for the Perrigo shareholders, and the Mylan shareholders will absolutely allow us to secure a favorable vote.","Operator","Thank you. Our next questioner comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. I've got a couple. First, John, if you wouldn't mind breaking out for us the EPD sale by region, just so we can all back out the growth rate for each region.","And second, can you detail for us the process that will take you here to a shareholder vote, both yours and Perrigo assuming that you need to go to their shareholders to get a vote? And can you comment a little bit about the issue of how would you argue this deal to your own shareholders? If I run my numbers, the ROIC and accretion for the first three years or four years is somewhat low. Or if you cannot discuss those numbers or this direction right now at what point would you be in a position to discuss them?","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So I'll take the second part first and then John can come back on EPD. Look, Ronny, I think as you've known us for a while, I can't stress enough that you \u2013 to try to just look simply at metrics on a sheet of paper. This is truly about what \u2013 how Mylan is uniquely positioned, Perrigo is uniquely positioned. We think these are two best-in-class assets that as we come together, the value creation that we are looking at is for, like I said, not just near and mid, which we will deliver value, but the sustainable long-term value creation and proposition of truly redefining global healthcare.","And I think that if you looked at our transactions historically, whether I go back to Matrix, which nobody saw the rationale at the time. And to think that what that was able to strategically deliver from a vertical integration and a horizontal and is now, as I've said, have half of our operations and employees, really having I think one of the best global supply chains throughout the industry at a very cost effective and efficient model.","When I look at Merck, I don't need to remind any of those on the phone what that transaction, and what people with those metrics were on a sheet of paper but obviously the commercial reach and scale that that brought us overnight with being able to leverage then the Matrix transaction on the Mylan platform. That's what has allowed us to grow the 27% CAGR over the last eight years and continue to deliver that. So we see Perrigo no differently. We believe that the combination, what it will allow us to deliver to both shareholders will be substantial and would be better than either organization can do on a standalone basis.","John D. Sheehan - CFO, EVP, Principal Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah, Ronny, regarding the EPD Business, first of all, just a reminder that the EPD Business is only part of the first quarter results for one month as we didn't close the transaction until the end of May \u2013 end of February, sorry. And when you look at the impact of that one month in North America, the revenues are not really materially \u2013 the revenue growth is not materially impacted by the addition of the EPD Business. I indicated in Europe that the base business grew mid-single digits. And in the Rest of World region, which includes the Australian and Japanese operations, the base business and then the EPD Business contributed about equally to the growth.","Operator","Thank you. Our next questioner comes from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks very much. My question is for John. John, you've obviously reported the first quarter and you've given second quarter EPS guidance. I think that implies an acceleration in Mylan year-over-year EPS growth in the second half of the year. Could you just provide some more color on that because you've also mentioned that you've factored in pressure on Mylan \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 on EpiPen in your guidance. So if you could provide some color. And also talk about the tax rate outlook for the rest of the year in light of the 20% tax rate in the first quarter. Thank you.","John D. Sheehan - CFO, EVP, Principal Financial & Accounting Officer","Sure, David, absolutely. So with respect to the second half of the year, I did indicate in our year-end earnings call back on March 2 that the third quarter of the year would be the strongest of the year. I also indicated that the fourth quarter would be stronger than the second quarter. So I think that the year is developing exactly as we had anticipated it would be. There are certainly new product approvals that we anticipate for the second half of the year. We will have the addition of the EPD Business in the second half full \u2013 fully consolidated in the second half of the year. And we're really excited here from the initial performance in the first quarter and into the first month of the second quarter. So I think all of those things will contribute to a very strong second half of the year for our business. And was there a second...","Operator","Thank you.","John D. Sheehan - CFO, EVP, Principal Financial & Accounting Officer","Okay.","Operator","Our next questioner comes from the line of Louise Chen from Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So was just curious if you could comment a little bit more, maybe if you can't quantify it, just how to think about sales synergies for Perrigo and Mylan, the order of magnitude of those and then the timing of when you might expect to achieve those. Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","So unfortunately, we can't speak to \u2013 as we've said, this is forward-looking, but what I will say is that as you can imagine, when you're able to bring a very holistic view, and as Tony talked about, bringing this value proposition, especially here in the United States, to a very consolidated customer base and payer base that we have today. Having this broad portfolio allows us to think about really the delivery of patient solutions and thinking about front of the store, back of the store and how to uniquely come to market.","So I just would say there's many opportunities, both throughout U.S. as well as Europe. As we talk about kind of their unique pharmacy model certainly provides for a cross-channel, cross-selling between the physician channel as well as the pharmacy channel. And when you think about now the current Mylan infrastructure in Europe with our Mylan EPD, our retail pharmacy sales force now in combination with the Omega sales force, there would really be a true trifecta of coming to that market across all channels, and really being able to optimize these assets across the globe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks, guys. Heather, even though we're talking about year four synergies, I'm assuming that there is a COGS component to that. Can you or did you quantify even directionally how much of a COGS savings opportunity there is? And then can you just help us with the immediately accretive to fully synergized numbers by year four? Should we be thinking that this is accretive in year four and not before or how should we think about that statement? Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","So look, Randall, I think as far as you should assume, I think, as Rajiv had laid out on the synergy side, we absolutely see efficiencies coming from cost of goods. And again, I think when you think about the consolidation of the API between both companies, as well as the manufacturing operations that we definitely consider there to be efficiencies in both of these assets coming together.","As far as fully synergized amount, obviously, as you're familiar with the Irish Takeover Rules, I think that the best way to think about it is, again, I'm going to go back to our other transactions. It's really about not doing transactions just based on synergies. It's really about the complementary and strategic and compelling offering that we're going to be able to offer to our customers and to patients. So not only are we committed and that's why we stress the at least $800 million because we believe we'll continue to deliver as Mylan has done in the past. And like I said, I don't think we'll disappoint around this transaction about what we deliver on a short-term, midterm and long-term basis.","Operator","Thank you. And the last question that we have time for today is from the line of Marc Goodman from UBS. Your line is open.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","I'll ask a few questions then. First, the EpiPen looked a little weak. Maybe you can give us a flavor for if there was anything unusual in the quarter. Are we still thinking $1 billion-ish for the year?","Second, there really wasn't a lot of discussion around the O-U.S. business. Maybe you could talk about some of the key countries. How did France do? How did Italy do? How was the India business versus the Australia business? Just give us a sense of going around the world. And then, John, I was a little bit confused by the way you answered one of the previous questions with respect to how much the Abbott business contributed. So like, for instance, with the Rest of the World I thought you said that the base and then the EPD were both equal as far as the growth. So are you saying that the business went from $370 million to $392 million, so $10 million was Abbott or $10 million was base? I'm a little confused. Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","Well, Marc, thanks for not disappointing. I'm glad someone is interested at least on how the business is running. So as far as EpiPen is concerned, I think maybe you're just referring to our year-over-year comparable because there was some unique buy-ins last year that we had called out. So I would look at just what we continue to see as growth in the overall epinephrine auto-injector market. So we're still very happy to see that market continuing to expand by our efforts around education and awareness and that's continuing to take our disproportionate share of that. So we're looking forward and ramping up for a big allergy season. My understanding is because of the extreme cold weather that leads to perhaps even a more robust allergy season. And so, look, EpiPen is right on track as far as we're concerned. As far as the Rest of the World goes, I would say, as we commented on, and I'll let Rajiv fill in...","Rajiv Malik - President","Yeah. Every \u2013 France, I think has been stronger \u2013 very strong in the first quarter. Italy is also again growing and doing very well. Our India business, especially the HIV business coming over there, our emerging market business is firing on all cylinders. So I think all other markets have been doing very well.","John D. Sheehan - CFO, EVP, Principal Financial & Accounting Officer","Yeah. And then lastly, Marc, on your question on Rest of World, what I was trying to say was that Rest of World, as we reported, grew on a constant currency basis by 12% year-over-year and that, that contribution was more or less split evenly between the base Mylan business as well as in the EPD business.","Heather M. Bresch - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, thank you very much. And we look forward to talking to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for your participation in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Kris King. You may begin.","Kris King","Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Mylan's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Sheehan.","During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements relate to, among other things, our ability to identify, affect and integrate complementary or strategic acquisitions of other companies, products or assets; our expected or targeted future financial and operating performance, results, metrics and plans, and expectations related thereto; the ability to obtain regulatory approvals and planned launches of and anticipated exclusivity periods for new products.

These non-GAAP measures are presented in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our financial performance. Please refer to today's earnings release, which is available on our website, as well as the SEC website, as it contains detailed reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.","Before I turn the call over to Heather, let me also remind you that the material in the call, with the exception of the participant questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's expressed written permission. An archived copy of today's call will be available on our website later today and will remain available for a reasonable amount of time.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Heather.","Heather Bresch","Thanks, Kris, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Mylan's performance during the first quarter marked a great start to the year. On the top line, we delivered revenues of $1.72 billion, a year-over-year increase of 7% on a constant currency basis. On the bottom line, we delivered $0.66 per adjusted diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 6% slightly exceeding our expectations.","We delivered this strong performance, despite ongoing regulatory delays, once again leveraging our current assets and strong demand for our products around the globe. Mylan's ability to consistently deliver strong results reflects the unwavering dedication of our employees around the world. And on behalf of the board and our entire management team, I'd like to thank them and congratulate them on a job well done.","Now I'd like to walk you through the commercial performance of our businesses. In our Generics segment, we delivered revenues of $1.51 billion, a 10% increase on a constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of 2013. In our North American region, revenues totaled $782 million, up 7% year-over-year.","As stated earlier, the strong performance was the result of our ability to continue optimizing our existing assets, thereby offsetting continued regulatory delays at the FDA.","With that said, we're extremely pleased with our most recent delayed approval of XULANE, which we launched last month. This complex product is a first-to-market, generic contraceptive transdermal, for which Mylan was the only known filer. In Europe, we delivered $356 million in revenues during the first quarter, a constant currency decline of 2% that was driven largely by a comparatively mild winter season for flu and other seasonal infection.","Even so, we continue to see encouraging trends across the region. Our sales growth outpaced market growth in our key European markets. And in addition, we continue to anticipate year-over-year growth in Europe in 2014.","In our Rest of World region, revenues totaled $370 million, an increase of nearly 27% on a constant currency basis. This outstanding performance was fueled by India, which serves as both our operational hub and the engine behind our global antiretroviral franchise. During the first quarter, we also launched a critical care franchise in India, our fourth commercial line, as well as Hertraz, our first biologic product. Our business in Japan continued to deliver strong performance during the quarter, which marked the beginning of the second year of our collaboration with Pfizer.","In our Specialty segment, first quarter revenues totaled $195 million, an 8% decline versus a year ago. The decrease was predominantly due to a reduction of inventory at the wholesale level. We have regained market share and also expect double-digit growth in 2014, both for the market and for EpiPen and remain on track for it to be -- for it to become our first billion-dollar product.","As far as our long-awaited approval of generic naproxen is concerned, we remain in communication with the agency. And at this juncture, we are unaware of any outstanding scientific issues. However, there are continued processes occurring within the FDA that we believe could impact the earliest market formation date of patent expiry of May 24. With that said, we believe that the prudent course is to not include it in our second quarter guidance, and we continue to look forward to being able to launch this very important first generic product for multiple sclerosis patients at market formation.","We are reaffirming our full year guidance ranges, including adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.25 to $3.60. As we stated before, this is irrespective of any one approval. With respect to M&A, as we have stated in the past, we continue to be very active in exploring a number of potential transactions. And we remain confident that we will be in a position to execute on a substantial one by year end.","With that, I look forward to answering your questions and to seeing you during our upcoming Investor Day this summer. I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv.","Rajiv Malik","Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. As Heather said, we have had a great start to the year, and we expect that momentum to continue and increase throughout the rest of 2014.","This morning, I would like to provide all of you with an update on where we stand with several key products and our strategic growth drivers. As you know well, we are waiting on several important approvals that are in the pipeline at the FDA. We are directly and actively engaged with FDA on a regular basis to ensure we receive copies of [ph] approvals as soon as possible.","While Heather has already updated you on generic naproxen, we've continued to expect approvals for several other key launches, including our generic version of Lidoderm, Vivelle-Dot and XELODA. As I've stated previously, we believe it's simply a matter of timing.","Also, as Heather mentioned, we had a successful approval and launch of XULANE, the first generic version of contraceptive ORTHO EVRA transdermal patch.","Related to our respiratory platform, we were pleased to announce our global licensing agreement with Prosonix as it represents another development milestone for this franchise. We look forward to a successful collaboration with Prosonix in coming years as we bring to market generic version of Flixotide and Flovent around the world for the treatment of asthma.","Our development program for generic Advair continues to progress as expected, and we will provide you with an update on our core respiratory franchise at our upcoming Investor Day this summer.","On our injectables platform, I'm very pleased to report that since we last spoke, we have received 3 more close-out reports from the FDA pertaining to our Agila India sites. This leaves us with only one open FDA inspection at the Agila India site. And we continue to make good progress here. I'm very proud of the team that has been working to resolve these specific issues. And I would like to thank each and every one of them for their diligent work and passionate dedication.","Outside of the remediation activity, we remain on track to launch 127 injectable products globally this year. Also, in India, Hertraz continues to do very well and continues to meet our expectations as projected. Hertraz, as you will recall, is Mylan's first generic quality [ph] product, as well as India's first generic automated trastuzumab.","And with that, I look forward to answering your questions. And I will hand the call to John, who will provide you with the details on our financials. John?","John D. Sheehan","Thank you, Rajiv, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to be referring to financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. I refer you back to Kris' comments at the beginning of today's call regarding our use of adjusted measures.","I'd like to begin today by walking you through our first quarter financial results, which, as Heather indicated, was a great start to what we believe will be another strong year for our company. I'll also provide an update on our capital structure and our liquidity position.","Our Q1 results were slightly above our expectations. The growth in adjusted diluted EPS was achieved through constant currency revenue growth of over 40% by our Indian operations, specifically within our antiretrovirals business, and strong result at our North American Generics business even despite of the delays in product approvals in the United States.","Total revenues for the quarter were $1.7 billion, an increase of approximately 5% when compared to the first quarter revenues of $1.6 billion in the prior year or approximately 7% on a constant currency basis. We continue to expect that our total revenues for 2014 will be within our previously disclosed guidance range of $7.8 billion to $8.2 billion.","Looking at our operating profitability measures. Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter of 2014 was a very strong 50%, up over 100 basis points from the same prior year period. Our strong margins are primarily the result of an improved mix within our diverse product portfolio of our North American Generics business. Additionally, our margins continue to benefit from the efficiencies of our vertically integrated platform. We continue to expect our full year 2014 gross margins will be between 51% and 53%, with Q2 being very similar to Q1's margins, before increasing in the second half of 2014.","Adjusted operating income was $396 million for the first quarter of 2014, up slightly from the prior year, primarily a result of the improvements in gross margin.","R&D expense on an adjusted basis was $117 million or approximately 7% of total revenues. Our guidance range for R&D expense for the full year is between 7% and 8% of total revenues. The timing of certain R&D spending principally amounts related to our biologics and respiratory platform is expected to occur in later periods of the current year, with no impact on the timing of the programs themselves. And we continue to expect that the full year spend will be within our guidance range and that the spending in the second quarter will be at the upper end of our guidance range.","At the same time, SG&A, also on an adjusted basis, was $352 million or approximately 20.5% of total revenues, slightly above our full year guidance range of 18% to 20%. However, on a sequential basis, SG&A expense was flat when compared to Q4 of 2013, and we continue to expect to be within the guidance range for our SG&A for the full year.","Adjusted EBITDA for the 3 months ended March 31, 2014, was $460 million, an increase of 4% when compared to the prior year and remains forecasted to be between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion for the full year.","Adjusted interest expense for the first quarter of 2014 was $63 million, essentially flat when compared to the prior year. We continue to benefit from low short-term interest rates, which have offset the increase in interest expense from higher long-term debt. As of March 31, 2014, the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was slightly below 4%.","First quarter adjusted net income was $260 million or $0.66 per share, a 6% increase from our Q1 2013 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.62 per share and slightly above our expectations. Our guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS for 2014 remains at $3.25 to $3.60 per share, irrespective of any one product approval.","Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis was $286 million. Our debt cash flow from operations for the current quarter was approximately $268 million, leaving us with unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $243 million. The first quarter is historically the heaviest in terms of the usage of cash as a result of this timing of certain payments, including taxes, interest and incentive compensation. And we are still forecasting our full year 2014 adjusted operating cash flow to be within our guidance range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion.","First quarter capital spending was $72 million, as we continue to invest in our business. And we expect full year capital expenditures to be within our guidance range of $350 million to $450 million.","At the end of the quarter, our gross-to-EBITDA leverage ratio is approximately 3.4:1. We continue to have ample borrowing capacity and financial flexibility and remain committed to our 3:1 long-term gross leverage ratio target, which represents an investment-grade credit profile. Further, we remain committed to our stated M&A parameters that any transaction would be accretive to earnings and maintain our long-term low gross leverage target.","To summarize, our first quarter provided a strong start to 2014 and provides yet another example of our ability to manage our business through a variety of industry and market headwinds, while producing top and bottom line growth for our shareholders.","With respect to the second quarter of 2014, we expect adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.67 to $0.70 per share, excluding Copaxone. I would like to again emphasize our commitment to our full year guidance ranges. We are confident in our targets for 2014, and we look forward to updating you on our long-term outlook at our Investor Day this summer. That concludes my remarks. And I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao from Barclays.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So to start off with, I think the obvious one that is in a lot of people's minds is sort of an update in terms of capital deployment. Obviously, we've seen Meda has publicly acknowledged that you have approached them. Perhaps, provide an -- and Meda has also indicated that they have sort of stopped the talks. Just provide an update, first, on whether you are continuing to try to engage Meda in terms of a potential acquisition or merger, as well as what interests you about that particular business, sort of from a profile standpoint? And do you see another array of opportunities of like businesses that you could pursue?","Heather Bresch","Okay, Doug, thanks. Look, I'm not going to discuss any particular transaction. But what I will say is, we have been extremely active. And as we've said before, it's certainly not driven on inversion or synergy, that those may be a by-product, but very much driven on complementary, strategic assets to our current platform. And certainly, when you look at assets like a Meda, you can understand from a European -- extending our commercial reach, the portfolio. So I will tell you that there is -- that's just one of many that are out there that we believe would be very complementary to our platform. And I will tell you, we're very busy looking at all of them.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, Heather, as a follow-up question on Copaxone. You made a reference to events at the FDA that could potentially delay market formation for generics. If you could just provide a little bit more clarity as to what you mean by those kinds of events? Is this from a legal standpoint, given the ongoing review at the Supreme Court? Or is it just sort of other technical hurdles that the agency is obviously trying to deal with?","Heather Bresch","Yes, thank you. We see no legal hurdles. This is totally regulatory and administrative. I think that what we've been seeing with the agency is a delay. I mean, our ORTHO EVRA is a prime example of an important first generic that was delayed a bit. So we just wanted to point out that we see these processes. I can tell you that we are working diligently to hold -- to make the May 24 date happen. But I certainly want to clarify, there's been no event or anything. We -- as I mentioned in my remarks, we -- there's no -- unaware of any scientific issues. This is procedural and that we're looking very forward to bringing this important product to the market at market formation.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore from Cowen & Company.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Heather, just going back to the first question on Meda. Just trying to understand, we are watching the public back and forth. So is this just Swedish disclosure laws and we're still working with Meda? Or is this something that we should assume has been concluded?","Heather Bresch","No. Look, I mean, I think hopefully you can appreciate there's a lot of sensitivity around any transaction. And so, certainly, we would be giving updates as we see appropriate. I just -- like I said, we'll reiterate that we are actively looking at several different assets.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And can you just maybe discuss -- should we think along the same size as Meda or would you be willing to go even higher or larger?","Heather Bresch","Yes. I think we have said that we'll stay within the parameters we've outlined, which allows us to do a fairly significant transaction. And again, and obviously, we've also said we are willing to put our equity to work.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions, if I may. If you could again just help clarify Copaxone. And my question really relates to the at-risk launch, just given the whole Supreme Court situation. Heather, clarify for us your views of precisely what the Supreme Court is reviewing. And if you could talk about the exposure you see facing by a potential at-risk launch. Teva told us this morning that you would be facing treble damages, that you would be facing a potential loss of not only Copaxone 20mg but also Copaxone 40mg. So how are you guys thinking about that potential risk? And then just secondarily, on M&A, how just, from a high-level question, how do you balance your desire to get a deal done this year, to stay competitive and relevant in an industry that is rapidly consolidating with not overpaying just to get something over the finish line?","Heather Bresch","All right. Well, I'll obviously start with Teva. Look, I won't -- I know Teva's call was this morning and I won't try to pretend that I can necessarily connect the dots they tried to put out there. And I would say they have their track record for at-risk launch and so do we. So I would say that as we think about this, what I can tell you is, we're not characterizing the launch. Right now, I'll remind everyone that the ruling that stands is that their patent has been found invalid. And that patent office rejected now for a second time their reissue patent. And again, we continue to look forward to bringing this very important product at market formation. So as I turn now to M&A, because as we've continued to say, we're not about one product and our ranges and our guidance is not predicated on any one product. I would tell you, Jami, we're, like I said, very actively looking at many different assets out there. And I think that when you think about the parameters that we put out there, from a financial perspective, as well as being accretive, I think that you'd see Mylan -- our track record has been to be very diligent and very methodical about our transactions, not just a transaction for transaction's sake. I think that when you look at how we've continued to build the platform and now have the organic opportunities that we have and now with the substantial financial flexibility, both with capital, as well as with equity and the size of transaction we could do, I think that our patience and doing the right transaction has continued to pay off and will pay off for us this year. And I think that we see several different opportunities that we believe -- that's why we say confidently, we believe that we'll be able to execute on something by the end of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just maybe sticking on the business development front. Can you just elaborate a little bit more about how you think about product concentration when you pursue an asset? I guess, do you prefer more diversified businesses? Or when you look at the spectrum of assets on substantial transactions, would you look at a more concentrated product portfolio? My second question is on the same vein. We've had reports the last few days of several major pharma companies reportedly shopping their diversified brands. Are those type of franchises things that could make sense for Mylan or be of interest to Mylan?","Heather Bresch","Yes. So I would say on product portfolio, it's both. If you look at our Agila transaction, which gave us critical mass around injectable product portfolio and pipeline which, as we've stated, [indiscernible] positions us to become a leader in that category. So when we look at opportunity, it could be both complementary across geographies or concentrated. And I think that, again, this just gets back to our initial strategy, which is to be complementary with assets that build upon the platform that we have today. And as I've stated before, I think that there are still opportunities out there for some product categories that we're not in today. There are therapeutic categories out there, whether it be antibiotics or ophthalmics, things that we still believe that we have runway to add to our portfolio. And yes, we've seen, obviously, several of these established product businesses being discussed and absolutely believe that they would be, again, something that would be very complementary in nature, both from a geography perspective, expansion, as well as product portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman from UBS.","Marc Harold Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Two things. So, Heather, just on this M&A. I just want to make sure I understand. In the past, you all have talked about in the brand business being interested in staying in respiratory, staying in allergy, places that you know if you're going to make an acquisition brand. Whereas in generics, obviously, you're very open-minded to adding a lot of different things. That's what you said in the past. I'm just curious, are we changing that now and saying, \"We're a little more open to a lot more different areas and brand a lot of other different types of situations.\" And then the second question is, can you talk about Europe, can you talk about France, Italy? Obviously, big countries that are important. What was going on, what was the market growth? What were you doing as far as share? How is pricing? Just give us a sense of what was going on in the business.","Heather Bresch","Sure. So I would not say anything's changed from what we said in the past. I would certainly -- referencing these -- the therapeutic categories and product lines across the Generics business. As far as branded goes, we said that there are, again, complementary assets out there in the respiratory, allergy and as well as dermatology. That's an area that we've continued to add. We certainly have a nice critical mass around our generic line and have experience in that. So that, from a branded perspective, is certainly where we've been concentrated. And look, I just -- what I would continue to say is, I think, this is a very opportunistic time in this industry with a lot of different assets being out there and being available. And I think that we're going to be able to do not only something substantial, but something very meaningful to our platform. And I'm sorry, what was your follow-up?","Marc Harold Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It was on Europe and...","Heather Bresch","Oh, Europe. So like I said, I continue to be encouraged by the trend that we're seeing. Given the mild winter, the entire pharmaceutical industry, the growth was down in Europe. But in our key markets, France, Italy, we outpaced that growth for Q1. And as I've said, we continue to see Europe delivering growth year-over-year for 2014. I'm continuing to see generic utilization kind of tick up slowly in these countries, especially France, Italy, our largest markets, to your point. So from our perspective, our vertical integration, our supply chain, has really been able to continue to kick in giving us very competitive cost of goods, controlling our own destiny through our own supply chain, as well as being able to continue to see volume growth offsetting some of the competitiveness in some of the countries. So I'm still very positive on Europe and continue to be favorable to the trends we're seeing there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sumant Kulkarni from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have 2 to ask, both of them upfront. First one is on the FDA delays. At what point do you think that could change? And I know your company is very diversified in terms of revenue base. But in the event that a generic Copaxone and a generic Celebrex, Vivelle-Dot and Lidoderm don't come in this year, how safe is the guidance range?","Heather Bresch","Well, I believe that's a very, very hypothetical that the FDA is not going to approve any products. I think just like I said, that's why I mentioned our ORTHO EVRA important approval that we just received. So far, we're seeing some delays. I certainly don't see the agency as being shut down. And we have continued to work closely, obviously very much on first -- important first market, generic entry. Those are very important dates for the Office of Generic Drugs. That's very important date for the U.S. health care system, as well as patients out there. So I certainly don't concede that no -- none of these products are going to be approved. And I -- as we stated, our range both for our quarter and the year is not dependent on any one approval. So I think that FDA will continue to transform itself administratively. And during this transformation, we are seeing some delays, but I think that -- time will continue to kind of course-correct. And again, I think that this is nothing more than a bit of a timing issue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just going back to Copaxone. Is this something that's specific to Mylan? Or do you think it's a -- just a broader generic Copaxone delay, in general? And then, the second question is, as you think about the back half EPS ramp, obviously, it's a little bit more than we've seen in the past. EpiPen is a big swing factor. But can you just call out what else could be contributing to the moving parts in the back half EPS?","Heather Bresch","So let me first say, we absolutely don't see this specific to Mylan and not even necessarily a delay, Randall. We're trying to be prudent. And as I said, what we've done with our guidance but I will tell you, we're still actively working towards May 24, and regardless, believe that Mylan will certainly be there at market formation. Towards the second half of the year, what I would say are a couple of things. Obviously, our seasonality with EpiPen -- which over the last several years has continued to give Q3 usually one of our largest quarters. And then, on top of that, because of these delays that we've seen in these approvals, we have some approvals that certainly will be pushed out and falling into the second half of the year. So I think that there's some normality to the fact that our second half of the year has been historically larger. And I think this year, it could be even accentuated by the fact that some of these important launches will be happening now in the second half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So I guess, my 2 questions are, first, just a follow-up. In light of what you've suggested for the second quarter, it implies a tremendous second half is dependent upon a few launches, is that, right? I mean, have -- or should we just simply assume that the hockey stick will occur because Copaxone and Lidoderm launch in the second half? Or are there other important launches in the second half that we should be thinking about? And then, I'll just ask my second question quickly. If you can just provide the organic Rest of World growth in the quarter, excluding Agila.","Heather Bresch","Okay. So first, as I've continued to state, it's not -- our second half of the year is not dictated by any one approval. Again, I'd remind you that EpiPen, seasonally, Q3, is our largest quarter for it. So as that product continues to grow, obviously, that continues to be a significant driver in the second half of the year. Additionally, yes, while we have important launches happening in the United States, we also have many, many launches happening throughout the rest of the world. Throughout Europe, we have some big launches in the second half of the year. So again, it's not dictated by any one geography or any one product. We have a lot of moving pieces, a lot of opportunities that we're going to be able to bring to the market throughout the rest of this year. And I'll let John comment but we don't break out our businesses, and Agila's now fully integrated.","John D. Sheehan","And also that I'm really pleased to be able to tell you, David, that the growth in the Rest of World in the first quarter was not the result of Agila. It was the result of our strong antiretroviral franchise in India. The -- our Agila business is reported in each of our commercial markets around the world as the Agila products are sold in those markets. So the Rest of World is really primarily organic growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Finkelstein from Susquehanna Financial.","Andrew Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Can you talk at all about -- first of all, in terms of the customer consolidation we're seeing across the industry, you're looking at a lot of different transactions. But what is most important to have for your platform in terms of serving those customers? And then, more specifically, on Copaxone, could you talk at all about your delivery device for your generic, which you proposed an auto-injector that could have benefits for patients?","Heather Bresch","Okay. Thank you. So as far as the customer consolidation, as we've said before, we see it actually as a real win-win because as we see our customers taking on a more global footprint, we believe that there's very few companies that can supply a true reliable supply of products. And so I would say the most important thing to our customers today is the guaranteed supply, a certainty around that products are going to be there when they need them. And I think Mylan has a very -- a great track record of being able to supply. And again, as we continue to vertically integrate our product portfolio, we're now making or producing 80% of what we're selling. So I think Mylan's control around its global supply chain is certainly, I would say, at the forefront of a customer's concerns and what they're interested in. And we've been able to set up great global arrangements that are able to give certainty around supply. As far as Copaxone and the device, I don't know, Rajiv...","Rajiv Malik","I'll only add that our delivery device, which is an auto-injector, is not only comparable, but I think more patient-friendly. So I found that the same -- more on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Buck from Buckingham Research.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","A couple of quick ones. So for the Specialty business, can you talk about the magnitude of the inventory reductions and what the reason for that was and what you're seeing so far in the second quarter? Second question, just -- can you give an update on what pricing was in Europe and rest of the world and U.S. for generics? And just one big-picture question for Heather. For the second quarter, you've talked about the confidence in executing a transaction. Can you talk a little bit about, I guess, the rationale for talking about interesting deals as opposed to sort of learning at deal close? Because obviously, there's been some disclosure for Meda in terms of what you've been interested, but not a lot from Mylan. So I was just curious on that.","Heather Bresch","Okay, I'll start with the inventory reduction on Specialty. I -- we really had seen what was really compounded by the fact of the 2 very cold and long winters that actually this one, this most recent one predicated just some different buying patterns from our wholesalers. So we believe that, that is what the -- what we saw happen in Q1. As far as what we're seeing today, I can tell you, I'm very happy with the market growth, double-digit market growth, that we continue to see year-over-year and the market share that we've been able to regain with EpiPen. So again, we remain very bullish on EpiPen, I think, that we've got still tremendous opportunity there for the rest of this year. As well as pricing, John, anything on the stability? We continue to see stability really across our entire generic line on pricing.","John D. Sheehan","Yes, I mean, the Rest of World pricing has been very stable. And we have not seen any hypercompetitive pricing there at all. So it's a very stable market for us.","Heather Bresch","And then, lastly on your transaction point. I think is, again, as you know, our personality, we will certainly talk about a transaction when we feel it's warranted or at the appropriate time. And until then, like I said, I'll just reiterate that we are actively working on many different fronts.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur with Needham & Company.","Elliot Wilbur - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Well, might as well stick with the subject of transactions and maybe get John to weigh in on this question as well. I hear a lot of talk about transactions and earnings accretion, but very few companies talk and particularly talk specifics about return on invested capital metrics. And when I look at a transaction like Meda and the numbers being produced by that company and the potential takeout value, it just seems like it's going to be very difficult to generate return on invested capital in excess of double digits. And so I'm just kind of wondering where exactly that metric sort of fits in terms of your acquisition criteria. And if possible, John, if you could sort of give us kind of a range or sort of what you're thinking about in terms of the required rate of return for some of these deals that you're looking at. And as a follow-up for Heather. I mean, we're probably not going to be able to shake the notion of treble damages around the Copaxone launch until something actually occurs. So maybe you could just sort of comment on the fact that you have a favorable decision from the Federal Circuit regarding the merits of the patent versus uncertainty at the Supreme Court level regarding the Federal Circuit's role in deciding that, and how that may sort of bifurcate just potential damages versus treble damages.","John D. Sheehan","So I'll start, Elliott, on your question regarding return on invested capital and M&A. Number one is that you're aware that return on invested capital is an important internal management metric that we use. Our long-term incentive plan, one of the performance metrics under our long-term incentive plan is ROIC. So that management is incented and is very focused on that metric. When you look at our history, our ROIC actually has been double-digits. And we've generated that ROIC on the back of the acquisitions we've made to date. And I'm comfortable and very confident that with the acquisitions that we're currently looking at that we'll continue that track record and that our return on invested capital will not only be above the weighted average cost of capital of the company, but also double-digit.","Heather Bresch","And as far as Copaxone. So look, I'll remind again because you're correct, the Federal -- what's the ruling that stands at the moment is that their patent has been found invalid and that the patent office, as I said, now for a second time has rejected their reissue patent. As far as what's before the Supreme Court, I also think there's some confusion there, maybe not by accident. But Teva -- the question that Teva posed before the U.S. Supreme Court was whether a District Court's factual finding in support of its construction of a patent claim term may be reviewed for legal error as the Federal Circuit requires or only for clear factual errors. So it's really just that, that's a question before the U.S. Supreme Court, not the validity or invalidity of their patent. We know the U.S. Supreme Court can do whatever the U.S. Supreme Court wants to do. But again, that's not the question that Teva posed before the court. It's really what's the -- what's the standard that's before the court between the district and the federal court level. And the odds are that if there was a -- if they changed that, that it could get remanded. And I think to now jump from that to saying, if it got remanded, and what does that court case look like, and we're now years down the road, but I think it's way premature to be talking about what that would mean from a court perspective. And as I said, we're not characterizing the launch. So again, we look very forward to bringing this mark -- this product to market at market formation and hope that will be, if not May 24, as close to that as it possibly can be.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Liav Abraham from Citi.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A couple of questions, the first one on Copaxone. Synthon indicated last month that it received a complete response letter for its version of generic Copaxone late last year. Can you comment on whether you or Natco received a complete response letter for your generic Copaxone over the past 12 months? And if so, when you responded? And then my second question is on your generic Advair program. Can you just confirm your timelines there and that everything is on track for a potential 2016 launch?","Rajiv Malik","As Heather has mentioned in our prepared remarks that there are no unanswered scientific questions. So whatever complete response letter we have received last year has been responded well in time. And is behind us.","Heather Bresch","And we're well ahead Synthon's case.","Rajiv Malik","Yes. And we're well ahead of Synthon's case.","Heather Bresch","And generic Advair?","Rajiv Malik","On generic Advair, we continue to execute on every milestone which we have in front of us and bringing this product to the market as we have shared with you in our Investor Day.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Chiang from CRT Capital.","Timothy Chiang - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Heather, I wanted to just clarify that the so-called Copaxone issue -- now assuming you do get approval of the product, is it certain that you're going to launch the product? Let's say, it got approved -- I don't know -- August, September, is that a certainty at this point?","Heather Bresch","Look, Tim, as you might imagine, we look at everything and take very seriously and, like I said, have obviously a long history of launching products. And at the time of approval, we'll take all those same factors into consideration. But obviously, we have said that we look forward to being there at market formation.","Timothy Chiang - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just one follow-up on Lidoderm. I mean, have you had an active dialogue with the FDA on your ANDA application?","Heather Bresch","I can assure you, we are -- if there's another word beyond active that we -- I could underscore our interactions with the agency, so yes. I will tell you that we are having very active conversations on obviously many fronts. We have many important products that are pending approval. Lidoderm being one of them, Vivelle-Dot. So we've got a lot of great opportunities that we believe that we'll continue to bring throughout this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry from Leerink Partners.","Jason M. Gerberry - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Actually, I have a question regarding, I guess, the inverse of Copaxone. On EpiPen, could you comment at all about just -- Antares disclosed in their last 10-K about an amendment that they'll need to submit on EpiPen ANDA. How that, if any way, would impact your settlement if they were to make meaningful changes to their product? Wondering if they can end up back in litigation with you guys. And then, just secondly, can you just repeat, are you reaffirming your $1 billion sales target for EpiPen this year?","Heather Bresch","Yes, sure. Yes, as I've said, we're looking forward to EpiPen being our first billion-dollar product this year. And as far as Antares' amendment, our settlement requires them to get their product approved, to come to market. So what I've continued to say is I believe that's a very high barrier to market to get a substitutable product approved. They certainly could have -- they could certainly be going the 505(b)(2) path, which is what every other person who's filed now on -- in this anaphylaxis space has had to do. So whether or not that what Antares' amendment relates to, I can't say. But like I said, I continue to say it's a very high barrier to be a substitutable product.","Kris King","So thank you, everybody, for your questions. And we look forward to seeing you this summer during our Investor Day. And operator, you can close out the call.","Operator","Okay. Thank you very much for your participation in today's conference, everyone. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."],"15535":["Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) Q4 2013 Earnings Call February 27, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Kris King","Heather Bresch - Chief Executive Officer, Director and Member of Science & Technology Committee","Rajiv Malik - President, Director and Member of Science & Technology Committee","John D.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kris King, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Kris King","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Mylan's fourth quarter and 2013 earnings call. Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Sheehan.","During today's call, including the Q&A, we will be making numerous forward-looking statements pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements often may be identified by the use of words such as may, will, could, should, would, project, believe, anticipate, expect, plan, estimate, guidance, trend, forecast, potential, intend, continue, pursue and variations of these words or comparable words.","Our forward-looking statements made today include, among others: statements relating to our ability to identify, acquire and integrate complementary or strategic acquisitions of other companies, products or assets; our expected or targeted future financial and operational performance, result, metrics and plans and expectations related thereto; anticipated business levels; planned launches of and anticipated exclusivity periods for new products; expectations regarding the integration of Agila; expectations for R&D and other spending; planned activities; anticipated growth; and other expectations and targets for future periods, including our expectations regarding the first quarter of 2014 and 2014 overall and subsequent years. Because forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties, the actual future results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.","Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: the impact of competition; changes in third-party relationships; the company's ability to successfully integrate Agila and achieve anticipated synergies; and the success of clinical trials and the company's capacity to bring new products to market, including but not limited to where we use our business judgment and decide to manufacture, market and\/or sell products directly or through third parties, notwithstanding the fact that allegations of patent infringement have not been finally resolved by the court.","For more detailed information on the risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business activities, please see the factors set forth under Forward-Looking Statements in our recent earnings press release dated February 27, 2014, as well as the risk factors set forth in our reports on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2012, and Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2013, and in our other SEC filings. You can access our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other SEC filings, including our earnings press release, which we filed on Form 8-K, through the SEC website at www.sec.gov, and we strongly encourage you to do so.","We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Today's call, including the Q&A, should be listened to and considered in its entirety and understood to speak only as of today's date. In addition, during this call, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial measures of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. It should be noted that non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, cost currency revenues, adjusted gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, should be considered only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are presented in order to supplement your understanding and assessment of our actual financial performance. Management uses these measures internally for forecasting, budgeting and measuring operating performance. Please refer to today's earnings press release, which is available on our website as well as on the SEC website, as it contains detailed reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures we use to the most comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.","Before I turn the call over to Heather, let me also remind you that the material in the call, with the exception of the participant questions, is the property of Mylan and cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Mylan's express written permission. An archived copy of today's call will be available on our website later today and will remain available for a reasonable amount of time.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Heather.","Heather Bresch","Thank you, Kris. And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. 2013 represented yet another very strong year for Mylan. We delivered impressive financial results and further positioned our company to generate sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders while continuing to fulfill our mission of setting new standards in health care and providing 7 billion people access to high-quality medicine.","During our Investor Day last August, we spoke to you about powerful trends that are changing the face of health care around the world, including spiraling health care costs, growing consumer involvement in health care decisions and heightened awareness of the importance of drug quality. By building the integrated global operating and commercial platform that we have today, we have created the scale, diversity, innovation and control over both the cost and quality of our products that we believe is needed to continue to be a leader in our industry and shape its future. This platform also has been instrumental in our ability to consistently deliver outstanding financial results, and 2013 was no different. As you have seen, our revenues for 2013 totaled $6.9 billion, a 4% constant currency increase compared to '12. And adjusted EPS totaled $2.89, a 12% increase compared to the prior year.","This performance is noteworthy for 2 reasons. First, 2012 was an unprecedented year for the industry and for Mylan in terms of new product launches in the U.S., including several first-to-file and first-to-market opportunities. Second, in 2013, regulatory delays in the U.S. prevented us from launching several significant products we had expected to introduce toward the end of last year. Despite these headwinds, we are very well positioned going into 2014 as we continue to do what we do best: leverage our one-of-a-kind platform, execute relentlessly across our business and maximize opportunity so as to deliver on our financial objectives.","Moreover, we also continued to make significant progress in '13 on many of the key long-term growth drivers we have identified, demonstrating our continued ability to deliver while positioning our company for future growth. For instance, we completed the acquisition of Agila, creating a global leader in the injectables space. This includes an exceptional R&D capability and manufacturing platform and one of the broadest portfolios in the industry. The transaction immediately gives us an even stronger platform in developed markets, provides us with expansion opportunities in exciting new markets and brings us new therapeutic categories, such as oncolytics.","In 2013, we also expanded our commercial operations in India. We launched a portfolio of women's care products and continued to build out the ARV franchise. Recently, in partnership with Biocon, we received approval to launch, in India, our first biologic product, Hertraz, which we did earlier this month. The launch was an important milestone as we prepare to introduce biosimilars in other markets around the world in the coming years.","Our Specialty division continues to show strong performance. Specialty revenues grew 18%, driven by increased sales of EpiPen. Last year, we celebrated EpiPen's 25th anniversary and helped more people at risk for life-threatening allergic reactions gain access to epinephrine. For instance, we worked with organizations and local advocates to successfully pass legislation to allow school access to epinephrine in 17 states in 2013, bringing the total to 31 states with such legislation. As impressive, we continued to grow the product in an expanding market, despite 2 new entrants. Since its introduction, nearly 55 million EpiPen units have been dispensed, and the product remains the world's #1 dispensed epinephrine auto-injector.","We made good progress in the fight against HIV\/AIDS. We established an exclusive agreement with Zyomyx, a diagnostics company, to distribute its proprietary point-of-care CD4 T-cell count test. This is a great example of how we're striving to meet the evolving needs of our customers and patients by offering health care solutions beyond pharmaceuticals. We also launched a broad portfolio of ARV products in South Africa, which has the world's largest HIV\/AIDS population.","Our scientists continue to distinguish Mylan as a company capable of developing a diverse array of complex and hard-to-manufacture products. A great example is our respiratory franchise. We continue to anticipate being the first company to bring an AB-rated substitutable generic form of Advair to the market in 2016. Near term -- nearer term, we continue to expect to launch an AB-rated form of Copaxone at market formation later this year. Mylan's performance during 2013 reflects the hard work and dedication of our employees around the world, and I'd like to take this opportunity on behalf of Mylan's Board of Directors and senior leadership team to sincerely thank them for their unwavering commitment.","Let me now turn to our outlook for 2014 and note that we'll provide you with a longer-term update this summer at our annual Investor Day event.","In line with the targets we provided at Investor Day, we are providing 2014 guidance of revenues between $7.8 billion and $8.2 billion, an increase of 16% compared to 2013. On the bottom line, we anticipate adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.60, an increase of 19% compared to 2013. With the volume of approvals we are expecting in 2014, we are confident in our guidance ranges, irrespective of delays in any one approval. Given the significant regulatory delays in 2013, should all of our approvals come to fruition, this year could exceed our current expectations. We are also reaffirming our 2018 adjusted diluted EPS target of at least $6.","Growth will come from a variety of sources across our diverse platform. In North America, we expect that timely approvals of new products in the U.S. will be critical to delivering on our growth targets. We look forward to launching a number of exciting transdermal and complex products this year. We continue to work very closely with the FDA to help ensure that the agency meets all of its obligations under PDUFA, which include enhancing safety, access and transparency.","Further, we expect our injectables platform to come on strong for us in 2014, as we will double the size of this business this year and are now beginning to leverage this asset commercially around the world, particularly in the U.S. In addition, we continue to see a favorable market environment for our base business in North America. And as always, we stand ready to serve customers in the event of market supply disruptions, a capability that has long differentiated our company.","In Europe, we expect continued growth this year, primarily by growing volumes in key markets, which will offset anticipated government-mandated price cuts by continuing to enhance our cost structure and leverage our supply chain, and launching new products. In Asia Pacific, we continue to expect robust growth from our antiretroviral franchise. In addition, we expect strong performance from our business in Japan, where we saw a significant turnaround as part of our collaboration there with Pfizer that exceeded our expectations.","As far as Specialty division, we look forward, this year, to EpiPen becoming Mylan's first billion-dollar product. Despite our success to date, we're still only serving about 10% of the at-risk population.","Finally, in addition to executing on our existing business drivers in 2014, we currently expect to be in a position to execute on another substantial transaction this year.","With that, I'll turn the call over now to Rajiv, who will provide more color around our business and growth drivers. He'll be followed by John, and we'll do the same with respect to our financial performance.","Rajiv Malik","Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. As Heather mentioned, we continued to execute rigorously on many of our key growth drivers over the course of 2013, and we anticipate making significant further progress over the course of 2014. In the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of Agila, creating a global leader in injectables. We are making good progress integrating this business. We are particularly pleased with the progress that our quality team is making on implementing Mylan's one global quality standard across Agila's entire injectable network and enhancing their overall systems. Since closing, we have implemented a number of key commercial enhancements that will reduce Agila's historic long-term reliance on a business-to-business model, unlock commercial rights and economics in many of Mylan's key growth markets and increase value to Mylan. Some of these key changes include beginning full commercialization rights for most of Agila's U.S. portfolio, both market and pipeline products, including all oncolytics; and regaining significant product rights in Canada, Australia, Brazil, Japan and South Korea. As a result, less than 30% of acquired Agila portfolio is now business-to-business, as against 60% prior to our acquisition.","In 2014, we anticipate launching 127 injectable products globally and 36 in the U.S. through our combined platform. We are starting to see increasing benefits of our approaching customers with an integrated portfolio of products across our business lines, what we call Mylan One. Oncology is a good example of this commercially integrated approach, and it's an area that has been significantly strengthened by addition of Agila.","We also continue to expand our operations into new markets through Agila, while also continuing to build organically in India. For example, we are further expanding our current portfolio of antiretroviral products and innovative women's health care franchise by launching an oncology business anchored by our Hertraz trastuzumab product development partnership with Biocon. We soon, also, will be launching a critical care portfolio and are on track to have commercial verticals in 5 therapeutic categories in India by the end of 2014.","Mylan continues to be a commercial partner of drugs [ph] around the world. Building on our strong existing partnerships for generic antiretroviral products, Mylan also has just named -- Mylan also was just named the year's exclusive branded medicines business partner for India. We also continue to successfully operationalize and execute on our collaboration with Pfizer in Japan and are very pleased with the turnaround of our business there.","During 2013, we transitioned more than 250 Mylan products to Mylan-Pfizer co-branded packaging, and these are now being actively marketed by Pfizer's strong sales force, who were able to maximize a number of Day 1 launches, including Tacrolimus, which was our most successful product launch ever in Japan. As a result, according to IMS, Mylan-Pfizer's combined market share increased by more than 4 percentage points and is now more than 5.5%, and we expect to see continued growth from this partnership in 2014. We also made progress against our commitment to double our size in terms of manufacturing capacity and product portfolio. We completed the expansion of our transdermal patch facility in the U.S.A. in preparation for pending launch of our generic Lidoderm and other exciting transdermal products. In addition, we completed the acquisitions and integrations of additional FDF manufacturing sites in India focused on oral solids and injectables.","We continue to build and diversify our pipeline of complex products with a strong future growth potential. We continue to expect to launch an AB-rated form of Copaxone at market formation this year. We are actively working with the FDA to secure approval and have not received any question from FDA that would lead us to believe that the agency is changing their position that a clinical study is not required for the approval of this product.","As you can see from Slide 11, 2014 will be a critical in terms of execution around several of our key R&D programs. And as a result, our investment in R&D will increase by more than $100 million. Let me touch on some of the key development equities this year. We are moving towards commencing our clinical trials for our generic version of Advair in a few months. The guidelines issued by FDA regarding generic Advair were a positive development and right in line with our expectations that we outlined during our Investor Day last August, reinforcing our belief that our program is very much on track. Our continued conversations with the FDA have further validated this. We are initiating our pivotal PK studies soon based upon positive outcomes from pilot human PK evaluations. We'll also initiate our clinical trials in Q2 2014. Given all these factors, we continue to anticipate being the first company to bring an AB-rated generic form of Advair to market in 2016.","With respect to Seretide, we filed a submission for our MDI product for approval in Europe in the fourth quarter, and we expect to launch a substitutable product in Europe in the first half of 2015. These submissions have been recently validated by MHRA and German health authorities, indicating that the products are under active review. We also are making progress on our COMBO product for the treatment of COPD. We have concluded our Phase IIb trials and will be analyzing the data and preparing for our Phase III clinical trials in COPD.","As part of development and commercialization program with Biocon for a generic version of 3 insulin analog products, we expect to move our Glargine product into our Phase III clinical trials this year. We continue to believe we have the opportunity to be one of the first generic entrants in the developed markets into the rapidly growing diabetes area. We are also continuing our Phase III clinicals for our trastuzumab biosimilar. Our ability to invest in these kinds of significant R&D programs while maintaining and growing our core Generics business, as well as investing in the extensive manufacturing capabilities required, is what has fueled our success to date and, in many cases, put us in front of our competitors. We look forward to delivering these products to the market as soon as possible.","Now let me turn the call over to John for more detail on our financials.","John D. Sheehan","Thank you, Rajiv, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to be referring to certain financial metrics that have been prepared on an adjusted basis. These are non-GAAP financial measures. I refer you back to Kris' comments at the beginning of today's call regarding our use of non-GAAP measures. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to introduce Colleen Ostrowski as our new Senior Vice President and Treasurer. In addition to her role as Treasurer, Colleen will also have overall responsibility for Mylan's Investor Relations and will be supported by Kris King.","Our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2013 were in line with our expectations and represent a strong finish to another successful year for our company. As detailed on Slide 13, 2013 capped a 6-year period where we generated exceptional adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS growth for our shareholders through consistent execution despite difficult economic conditions in many locations around the world.","Let me walk you through our financial results for the full year of 2013, which built upon already -- an already robust 2012 double-digit growth. As a reminder, the operating results of Agila have only been included in Mylan's consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date of December 4, and they weren't material to the quarter. Also, as a result of the acquisition, we've revised the Asia Pacific region within our Generics segment to include the operating results from Agila's Brazilian operation, and we'll now refer to this region as the Rest of World. Additionally, in 2014, our regions within our Generics business will be North America, Europe and Rest of World. The Rest of World region will also include our export businesses, which to date have been included in the EMEA region.","Our double-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth in the fourth quarter was achieved through strong results at our North American Generics business, whose top line grew by 7% in the quarter due to favorable product mix; as well as our Specialty business, which generated revenue growth of 13% for the quarter, fueled by an EpiPen sales growth rate in the high teens. Finally, in the Rest of World region, our Indian business continued its double-digit constant currency revenue growth.","Starting at the top of our income statement, on Slide 15, total revenues for the full year were $6.9 billion as compared to $6.8 billion in 2012. And for the fourth quarter of 2013, they were $1.8 billion as compared to last year's fourth quarter revenues of $1.7 billion. Foreign currency, especially the U.S. dollar relative to Asia Pacific currencies such as the rupee, the yen and the Australian dollar, negatively affected our top line in 2013. Excluding the effect of foreign currency, our top line grew by 4% for the full year in 2013 and by approximately 7% in the fourth quarter, which was in line with our guidance from February 2013.","Within our Generics segment, third-party revenues were $1.6 billion for the quarter and $5.9 billion for the full year, up 7% in constant currency versus the 2012 fourth quarter and 1% versus the full year 2012.","Revenues from our North American Generics business were approximately $854 million for the quarter, an increase of 7% when compared to the prior year period. Revenues from new products in the quarter in North America totaled $77 million as compared to $181 million in the comparable prior year period.","As you will recall, the fourth quarter of last year was positively impacted from the 2012 launches of Valsartan, HCTZ and pioglitazone. Offsetting the lower level of new product revenues in North America was increased volumes and favorable product mix. Revenues in North America for the full year were $3 billion, representing a decrease of 7% as compared to 2012, even though revenues from new product launches in 2013 declined approximately 75% as compared to 2012.","Turning to our other regions within our Generics segment. Constant currency third-party revenues in EMEA increased 3% in the current quarter. And the full year revenues in EMEA totaled $1.5 billion, an increase of 8% on a constant currency basis. We are particularly encouraged by our double-digit revenue growth in 2013 for France and Italy, as new product introductions and volume growth more than offset the negative impacts from single-digit price erosions in the region.","In the Rest of World region, we grew constant currency third-party revenues by approximately $41 million or 11% in the fourth quarter, principally as a result of the growth by our Indian operations, specifically within our antiretroviral business. For the full year, revenues totaled $1.4 billion, representing constant currency growth of 14% as a result of the strong performance by our Indian operations and the double-digit growth in Japan as a result of new product introduction and volume growth driven by our collaboration with Pfizer Japan.","Within our Specialty segment, third-party revenues in the fourth quarter increased $20 million or 13%. And for the full year, revenues increased over $146 million or approximately 18% when compared to 2012. We remain confident in our ability to continue to generate growth in our EpiPen franchise and maintain our leadership position within the market.","Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2013 was a very strong 51%, up over 2 percentage points from the same prior year period. And our full year adjusted gross margins were 50%, up slightly from 2012. Our strong margins are primarily the result of growth in our Specialty business and an improved product mix within our Generics business due to an increase in sales of high barrier-to-entry products. Additionally, our margins continue to benefit from the efficiencies of our vertically integrated platform.","For 2013, adjusted earnings from operations was $1.7 billion, up slightly from the prior year. Adjusted operating income in -- for 2013 includes an additional $70 million of investment in R&D. As planned, we continue to invest a significant amount in our respiratory and biologics platforms, which accounts for the majority of the increase from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.96 billion for the full year of 2013, which is near the midpoint of our guidance range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. Fourth quarter adjusted net income was $308 million or $0.78 per share, a 20% increase from our Q4 2012 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.65 per share and in line with our expectations. Of -- our full year adjusted net income was $1.14 billion or $2.89 per share, a 12% increase from our 2012 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.59 and at the upper end of our guidance range.","With that, I'd now like to discuss our guidance -- financial guidance for 2014, which can be seen on Slide 16. Our adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2014 is $3.25 to $3.60 per share. This guidance range is arrived at with the following income statement line item metrics, all of which are on an adjusted basis, with the exception of total revenues and CapEx: Total revenues of 7.8% to $8.2 billion, with Specialty generating growth of approximately 20% and our Generics business generating approximately 15% revenue growth.","I'll speak further in a few minutes on the drivers of our year-over-year revenue growth. Gross margins between 51% and 53%, the midpoint of which is 200 basis points higher than 2013. Drivers of this increase include new product revenues, EpiPen growth and the strength of our North American Generics business as we continue to benefit from an improved product mix combined with the efficiencies of our global platform. R&D of between 7% and 8% of total revenue as we continue to invest in our future, and SG&A of between 18% and 20% of total revenue.","Included in our earnings release this morning is a table of assumed foreign exchange rates used in developing our 2014 financial guidance. Using all of these guidance metrics, we project adjusted EBITDA of between 2.4 and 2.4 -- $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion. We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%, net income to be between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion and adjusted EPS to increase 19% as compared to the midpoint of our 2014 guidance range.","In addition to the above, we are providing the following additional adjusted 2014 guidance metrics: adjusted cash provided by operating activities of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion and capital expenditures of between $350 million and $450 million, yielding an adjusted free cash flow guidance range of $750 million to just over $1 billion, with a midpoint of $900 million. Our strong free cash flow provides us the flexibility to reinvest in our business, returning capital to shareholders, and\/or pursue other strategic uses of our capital. Finally, we are projecting an average diluted share count of between 389 million and 405 million shares. As a reminder, under our cash convertible notes, we have approximately $43 million warrants outstanding, with the majority of the warrants having a strike price of $30. For every dollar that our average stock price increases above $30, the diluted impact of the warrants and employee stock options is initially approximately 1.3 million shares. This diluted impact decreases as our average stock price increases. For changes in our average stock price between its current level and the $60 -- the average diluted impact -- and $60, the average diluted impact is approximately 600,000 shares. As you will see later in our Capital Structure Achievements slide, our 2014 projected diluted share count range is based upon an assumed share price in the range of $40 to $60 per share.","Slide 17 represents a projected bridge between our actual revenues for 2013 of $6.9 billion and the midpoint of our 2014 guidance range of $8 billion. We expect new product launches to contribute approximately $700 million of incremental revenue in 2014. Volume growth in our base business will serve to offset single-digit price erosion on our existing products. Additionally, the benefits of a full year of Agila are incorporated into each of the individual regions within our Generics business. We expect that Agila will be the engine to drive our injectables growth by providing products to our commercial businesses around the globe.","Slide 18 shows a projected bridge between our actual 2013 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.89 and the midpoint of our 2014 guidance range of $3.43. New product launches and margin expansion will drive our earnings growth in 2014. With respect to new product launches, all unsettled products are in our guidance at risk-adjusted amounts and include the estimated impact of competition. In addition, our interest expense is forecasted to increase by approximately $35 million due to higher debt associated with the Agila acquisition, partially offset by lower rates from proactively managing our debt. We expect our third quarter EPS to once again be the strongest quarter in terms of earnings and slightly stronger than our second quarter. We expect the first quarter EPS to be approximately equal to our Q1 2013 EPS.","Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics on Slide 19. Cash flow from operations on an adjusted basis was $1.2 billion for the full year, leaving us with unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling almost $300 million. We continue to benefit from short -- low short-term interest rates. As of December 31, 2013, the average rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was slightly below 4%. We continue to use interest rate swaps in order to target a long-term 70-30 fixed floating debt portfolio, which we believe is an optimal ratio. As we previously stated, in 2014, we intend to redeem our high-yield bonds maturing in 2018. During 2013, we executed forward starting rate -- starting interest rate swap that fixed the benchmark interest rates on the planned debt issuance that will fund this redemption.","Capital spending for 2013 was $335 million, which was below the midpoint of our guidance range of $350 million. And that was a result of timing of spending. In addition, during 2013, we repurchased approximately 29 million shares of our common stock for $1 billion. Over the past 3 years, we have returned nearly $2.4 billion to shareholders through our share repurchase programs, and we will continue to look at additional opportunities to return capital to shareholders. At the end of the quarter, following the share repurchase programs and the additional borrowings due to the Agila acquisition, our gross debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio is approximately 3.5:1. We continue to have ample borrowing capacity and financial flexibility and remain committed to our 3:1 long-term gross leverage ratio target.","To summarize, our fourth quarter provided a strong finish to 2013 and provides yet another example of our ability to manage our business through a variety of industry and market headwinds while producing top and bottom line growth for our shareholders. We look forward to doing more of the same in 2014 and beyond.","That concludes my remarks. And I'm now going to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao from Barclays.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Heather, I was just hoping you could perhaps provide a framework for us in terms of how you're thinking about M&A right now and your sort of strategic priorities, given -- now that you've accomplished sort of the platform in terms of the injectables business and where you stand right now.","Heather Bresch","Sure. So you know, Doug, I think we've been pretty transparent about having parameters in place, and we're certainly committed to those. But I will tell you that we are looking -- we're not going to limit ourselves in really looking at anything that is accretive and continues to strategically complement on the platform that we've got in place. So we believe there's a lot of interesting opportunities out there that now are continuing to present themselves. And as you know about this team, we certainly aren't standing still. And now, with Agila closed and integration well on track, we believe that we're well poised for a transaction.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And just a quick follow-up. Do you see any value in terms of expanding your brand business in terms of addressing some of the consolidation that we're seeing now on the part of purchasers?","Heather Bresch","As we've said, when you look at the assets that we currently have in our Specialty business, from EpiPen to Perforomist, us continuing to invest in the respiratory franchise, we believe that there's great opportunity to continue to leverage our infrastructure in that platform even to a greater extent and believe that, as we've said, really, the lines between generics and brands continue to come down. I think, when you look at even partnerships like we have in Japan with Pfizer, it's our ability to organically continue to produce these opportunities, partner in interesting ways, as well as look at bringing in other products that would enhance, like I said, the infrastructure we have. We believe this respiratory niche is a great niche and fits perfectly with our innovative capabilities as well as, like I said, our commercial infrastructure. So I think you should look for us to do across the entire spectrum of the industry and be looking at everything.","Operator","And our next question comes of the line of Greg Gilbert from Merrill Lynch.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Heather, can you comment on the size range of the \"substantial deals\" that you're looking at currently? And as part of that, a very specific question, is Mylan willing to be -- become a non-U.S. company, from a domicile standpoint, if it's in the right interest -- the best interest of shareholders?","Heather Bresch","Sure. So Greg, I guess what I would say is we're not limiting ourselves, but what we've said is it's going to be accretive. So I think that pretty definitively lays out the spectrum of transaction that we could do. And as far as where we're domiciled, an inversion, synergy plays. Again, we've said our business model is not going after a transaction for a transaction's sake. So that is not going to be a primary driver. It could be an added-on benefit of a deal that's accretive and strategic to us, but it's not going to be the primary driver.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","John, just with respect to Q1, the guidance, I think you had mentioned it was going to be similar to last year. Can you just, perhaps, help us, is there anything to read into your view or expectations around an approval in mid-March on Lidoderm?","John D. Sheehan","I would say to you that, quite honestly, as Heather mentioned or we've talked about in the past, we expected a Lidoderm approval in the fourth quarter, and that didn't come to pass. And so I think we've been -- I'm being fairly conservative in our expectations. And I would say that a Lidoderm approval in the first quarter would represent an upside to the first quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore from Cowen and Company.","Ken Cacciatore - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I was wondering, to try to get a little bit more nuance on the parameters of an acquisition, would you consider a merger of equals? And then, we are in interesting times here. Things are moving fairly fast. I was wondering if you'd even contemplate an exit, maybe enjoying upside via others' equity. Just -- can you give us some nuanced thoughts about conversation in what is a rapidly evolving environment?","Heather Bresch","Well Ken, I guess what I would say is, as you'd noted, there is a lot happening in the industry today. And as I said earlier, we're not standing still. I think that this management team has been pretty active in the past. We continue to, as I said, be looking at everything. I think that our opportunity, our business model is to continue to build upon the great company that we've put in place today. And I think we continue to show our ability to perform while we're not only growing the opportunities we're having currently, but looking at acquisitions that make sense to just further our growth and accelerate our growth. So I would say, as I said earlier, we're not limiting ourselves to the transactions we're looking at, but they're going to be accretive, and we intend to continue to be a leader in this industry and continue to shape this industry.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman from UBS.","Marc Harold Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Heather, can you talk about Europe a little bit in the fourth quarter? Obviously, your main countries that are important, Italy and France, how they did in the quarter, maybe from a growth perspective, and how you're thinking about them in 2014? Obviously, France has been unusually strong for the past 1.5 years. I was wondering how you're thinking about that strength continuing into this year. And then just to confirm a couple of things that you guys said, you mentioned something about the COMBO product, a Phase IIb. Did you say that the data was very strong, and you're moving to Phase III, or you haven't made that decision yet? And then, on Lidoderm, I was just curious, why are you not expecting Lidoderm to be approved in March after the 6 months of exclusivity are up for Actavis? Or are you?","Heather Bresch","You -- we should get creative with asking one question, Marc. So I'll start was the last one, Lidoderm. As you know, I never -- we never perceived the first-to-file to be blocking our approval. We believe they forfeited their 180. So what I will say, the good news is there's nothing on our side keeping us from approval. So we believe it is just a timing issue. As John said, I was vocal about expecting it in Q4 of last year, so I believe that approval could be any day. But as John said, we're being conservative in our approach, just given the delays we have seen with the FDA. And again, that's why we're saying it could be upside to us if we get it in Q1. As far as Europe goes, and then I'll let Rajiv comment on COMBO -- as far as Europe goes, look, overall, and not necessarily looking at quarter-to-quarter, I guess what I would say, when I look at the annual growth, year-over-year, and what we're projecting again for this year for Europe, I'm pleased. I believe that we saw during kind of the lows of Europe, we were able to really put to work what we could control, which was our supply chain, cost of goods, products we were launching, vertically integrating them. And we've now seen all that hard work continue to pay off, in addition to seeing a bit of growth in these countries, like you mentioned, in France and Italy, continuing to see volume offset price cuts that we've taken into consideration. So look, I still say utilization rates are low, comparatively speaking, so I think that runway is still very much there, especially in countries like Italy. And as we've said, we're going to continue to look to grow this European business. We think there's a lot of opportunities to add to our platform there, especially when we look at areas like Central and Eastern Europe. So I'm happy with what we're seeing in Europe. We do continue to see them being a growth driver, and we continue to see a lot of opportunities to add to that business. So, Rajiv, COMBO?","Rajiv Malik","And regarding COMBO, we just finished our Phase IIb trials and are currently analyzing. And very soon, we'll be meeting FDA to reconfirm our Phase III program.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Liav Abraham from Citi.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question relates to Copaxone. You reiterated this morning that you feel that, with regard to generic Copaxone, you'll be there at market formation. What is your current thinking or your base case assumption regarding when that will be? Do you still think it will be the end of May this year, or because of the delays that you mentioned with the FDA, do you think that this, too, could be delayed? And then if you could give some comments","[Technical Difficulty]","Heather Bresch","So you got cut off, but we'll at least answer the Copaxone. We are targeting for the -- that patent -- the patent expiration date in May and have been working very closely with the FDA. They continue to prioritize market formation generic products, which obviously, Copaxone is a very large and important one. So look, we are optimistic and hopeful that the FDA is not going to let this important date go by. But again, it just all comes down to timing. We believe we -- that again, nothing kind of rests on our side of the fence, that we've completed everything we needed to complete for Copaxone approval.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Sanford Bernstein.","Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","My, I guess, 2-part question, and the first one will be around EpiPen. We've seen the scripts down a little bit. You're holding your shares real nicely at 90%, but the scripts look a little bit down year-over-year since the beginning of 2014. Can you, then, comment a little bit about the product, and when are we going to be able to see what you got for next generation for EpiPen? And then, staying with the complex product, I wasn't sure if Rajiv mentioned it, if [indiscernible] is expected going to Advair pivotal this year? And on Glargine, do you expect to start the pivotal this year? And when should we see a short-acting insulin from you guys?","Heather Bresch","Okay. Thanks, Ronny. So I'll start with EpiPen. Look, I think, if you remember, last year at this time, I was saying we were having the coldest winter in the history, at least for the recent history, I would say, only to be now topped by this winter, which is even colder and longer than last year. So I believe that we're going to see the natural return of EpiPen once the sun comes out for a bit more than 5 minutes. And so, look, I think that the runway for EpiPen is still significant. As I mentioned earlier, we're still only treating about 10% of at-risk patients. We continue to be very active in getting legislation passed that's certainly continuing to, we think, grow the market, grow the script trend that you're seeing. And we think 2014 is going to be a great year and, as I mentioned, believe it will be Mylan's first billion-dollar product this year. So I think every -- things couldn't be better on the front of EpiPen. And as far as our longer term, as I mentioned earlier, we'll be giving an update on our longer-term view of our -- all of our business and growth drivers this summer at Investor Day. And at that time, we'll be talking more about the life-cycle management of EpiPen. But again, we see this franchise and the brand equity of it to be very strong and significant.","Rajiv Malik","So Ronny, on generic Advair, 2 important milestones will be happening later this year. So in a couple of months, based on the successful pilot PK study that Abacavir received, we'll be starting, first of all, pivotal clinical trials in the next couple of months. And with a similar -- at the same time, we are starting with our pivotal PK studies. So these are 2 important milestones. Also, later this year, we are starting Phase III for Glargine, followed by the short-acting.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Heather, I'm just curious to know if your increased confidence in the new product approvals, specifically Lidoderm and Copaxone, are on the back of the onetime status update from the FDA. And how much of the $700 million of new products is accounted for by incremental Agila sales?","Heather Bresch","Well, so let me start with, Jami, we're not breaking out and, as you know, we don't break out product-by-product or lines of sales. Agila is now totally integrated into our business, and we've said what's most important is not what they were doing on a standalone basis, but what we were going to be able to do with that platform as part of our overall platform. So our injectable business, as we've said, we see doubling this year, so it's a very important driver and will continue to be through 2018. And I think, as we've said, we're driving for -- and everything that we're doing and executing on is towards that $6 in 2018. And our ability -- really, a lot of things may have some timing implications quarter-to-quarter or so forth, but certainly, nothing at all has changed about our long-term picture and everything that we're doing to execute on delivering that $6. And as far as the confidence around -- the confidence around approvals, I would say our confidence comes into the fact that they will be giving approvals at some point. I mean, it can't -- the delays that we've seen, they're going through a massive transformation at OGD. We continue to stay very close to them on the overall transformation as well as day-to-day tactics around getting these products approved, especially, as I mentioned, market formation products. So look, I think that it's very high on FDA's radar screen. They want -- they know their mission is to get affordable medicine out there as timely as they can, so that's where my increased confidence comes from.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Buck from Buckingham Research.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Two quick ones for Heather. Can you talk a little bit about the GDUFA process and whether you're -- you've put in an expectation of any increase in timeline for approvals this year, and the fear that came out of GPhA is that you'll see more complete responses as opposed to outright approvals. And just secondly on -- for John, I guess, can you talk a little bit about how you've incorporated some of the consolidation into the pricing assumptions for this year?","Heather Bresch","So as far as GDUFA goes, I mean, look, we knew -- and GDUFA overall contemplated, certainly, from a timeline perspective, that all this change wasn't going to go to happen overnight, that it was going to be over the course of these 3 to 5 years on all fronts. Not just so -- I keep reminding people there were 3 important pillars of GDUFA: access, safety and transparency. I think the safety aspect, as far as inspections and having the FDA be able to have the reach and scope to assure good manufacturing practices on facilities making products for the U.S., is extremely important. And, obviously, you've seen a lot of activity around that. I think the transparency in being able to then be able to show what companies are doing and what their scorecards are from a quality perspective continues to have focus. But I'd say this last one, access, which is making sure that we're getting products approved in a timely fashion, and as you know, those metrics -- we're supposed to see those approval times go down into the 10- to 12-month range over these years. So I think when you talk about complete response letters and, again, where they want to move towards, it's not going to happen overnight. And I think that, right now, is what you're seeing in this transition of going from how they used to approve ANDAs to how they want to approve ANDAs. And some of the pain we're feeling right now is working through that transition because of all of the ANDAs that were already on file at the FDA. So look, it's just -- it's a work in progress, something we're close to and, listen, something that is very much high at the highest levels of the FDA on their radar screen, that they need to make sure they're fulfilling all 3 pillars of GDUFA. So that's what I would say. And that's why I think, when you hear us talk about our guidance and the ranges we have out there, we've said that, look, if everything would come to fruition and break loose, from the '13 launches we didn't get to what we're expecting in '14, we could exceed our current -- the current expectations we have today. But we think we've taken a very measured approach to waiting on what we're seeing and feeling at the FDA at the moment.","John D. Sheehan","And David, on the second part of your question with respect to the current consolidation among our customer base and that being taken into consideration in our guidance, on Chart 17, I provided a revenue bridge. And both as it relates to pricing assumptions, as well as volume, both are taken into consideration -- we took what's happening in our industry into consideration in both of those lines.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the business development from the 2-part question. I guess, first, when -- with the scale and type of deals you're currently considering, I guess, are these substantially different than, let's say, a year ago in terms of the focus of the company or how large you're willing to go with transactions? And the second part of that question is -- I just want to make sure I understood the comments from earlier. What is Mylan's view on getting substantially larger on the branded side of this business, not just a tuck-in or a single product acquisition, but something that would substantially increase the branded portion of the revenue base?","Heather Bresch","Okay, Chris. So look, I guess what I would start with is what continues to change is the size of our balance sheet and the flexibility that we have. So again, I think, to just be very clear and transparent, we've said it needs to be accretive, and we're not going to limit ourselves. So I think that, as we continue to grow, that ability of what we can acquire continues to grow as well. And as far as the branded side of the business, again, I think we're not limiting ourselves to saying we're just looking at generic opportunities or brand opportunities. And I think that, when you look at the kind of complex, high barrier-to-market products on -- even on the Generics side that we're bringing to market, a Copaxone, a generic Advair, I think that there is -- they're not launched in the same way that a traditional generic product in the retail sector is launched. So as you think about the infrastructure needed to be successful with those types of product, that's where we say we continue to be able to leverage that Specialty franchise or infrastructure and think that, especially as we think about who we're calling on today, that we've got great opportunities to complement that as well and continue to build on the commercial side. I think, if you look at operational excellence we've achieved and continue to, as we've said, look at other things that would add continued dosage forms or therapeutic categories, that remains a priority. But with that being said, we're also looking at things that would expand our commercial excellence and the infrastructure and that sales and marketing on a global basis. So we're looking at anything that would be strategic and complement us and be accretive. And I would say, as I mentioned earlier, we see several interesting things out there that would accomplish this.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur from Needham & Company.","Elliot Wilbur - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","A question for Heather. With regard to the top line outlook parameters that you're providing us with today, certainly, quite a bit more robust than you had talked about back at your August Analyst Day and, if I'm not mistaken, kind of at the high end of the range, probably one of the highest growth rates, if achieved, that the company would have delivered in something close to 20 years. So I'm just wondering specifically kind of what has changed over the last couple of months to give you so much more confidence in your top line outlook. And as a corollary to that, you're still sticking with roughly the same adjusted EPS growth guidance, even though you're talking about the midpoint of top line growth being essentially 4 percentage points higher. So I'm sort of wondering why we're not seeing some more of a step-up in bottom line growth relative to top line growth expectations.","Heather Bresch","Yes. Well, Elliot, I guess, maybe the good or bad news is I've been here for more than those 20 years that, I guess, you're talking about on what kind of growth Mylan has achieved. But I think you -- and what we tried to convey at our Investor Day last year is our continued, balanced look at top and bottom line growth. I mean, we've said before it's striking that right balance. Certainly, what we've been able to show, up until this point, that we've been very much able to execute and to pull upon this global platform and the diversity of it to manage our business and deliver the EPS growth. I think that as, now, we continue to mature and our operational excellence is where it is, we continue to see that, as we add important things like our injectables platform and the kind of growth and the opportunities that, that's providing across our entire global business, that's what you see coming in here to 2014. So what I would say is we continue to focus on both top and bottom line knowing that what we've shown, and I think our track record speaks for itself, that our ability to manage this business and deliver on that bottom line is critically important. But obviously, we're showing our ability to perform while we continue to have opportunities kind of compound themselves. And so I think what you're seeing in 2014 to be the first of, of a series of growth, as we've shown in our projections, as I said earlier, everything we're doing, executing to that $6 in 2018, is going to be that continued balance of growing top and bottom line. And we just see a ton of opportunities. Like I said, if we -- if everything comes to fruition in 2014, it could even exceed our current -- these current expectations.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry from Leerink Partners.","Jason M. Gerberry - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on your last comment, just about the potential upside to guidance. I'm just getting a handle on your conservatism around the Copaxone opportunity. Obviously, there's a lot of swing factors in kind of sizing up that market opportunity. Could you talk a little bit about -- are you expecting all 3 players in the market at formation? How are you thinking about that? And then, there's a lot of difference of opinion on the managed care outlook for this market. So I'm just kind of curious, your intelligence, are you expecting payers to get aggressive with implementing step eds [ph] for the 20-milligram generic?","Heather Bresch","So look, Jason, as I said in my opening remarks, we're confident in these ranges, irrespective of any one approval coming or not coming in 2014. And that's what we've taken into consideration in the range that we've given. I think, as far as Copaxone goes, as I've said, it's not your typical generic launch, but we are -- we have invested, and we think that we certainly will be very successful with this launch, as we are -- have been with many of our other products, taking into consideration the way you need to launch and the players that are at the table. We don't talk about our assumptions about any one product, but I would, again, say I think our track record shows that we take a very responsible approach about how we weight these opportunities. And again, that's why we're confident in the ranges that we have out there for 2014. So I want to thank you and thank everybody for joining us today, and look forward to seeing you soon.","John D.

Ma'am, please go ahead.","Melissa Trombetta - Mylan NV","Thank you, Liz. Good evening, everyone. Welcome to Mylan's fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me for today's call are Mylan's Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch; President, Rajiv Malik; Chief Commercial Officer, Tony Mauro; and Chief Financial Officer, Ken Parks.","During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements on a number of matters, including our financial guidance for 2018. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from today's projections.","Please refer to the earnings release we furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K earlier this evening, as well as our supplemental earnings slides, all of which are posted on our website at investor.mylan.com for a fuller explanation of those risks and uncertainties, and the limits applicable to forward-looking statements.","Mylan routinely post information that may be important to investors on this website, and we use this website address as a means of disclosing material information to the public in a broad, non-exclusionary manner for purposes of the SEC's regulation fair disclosure.","In addition, we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics of Mylan on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures.

Bresch - Mylan NV","Thanks, Melissa, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I recognize that a reoccurring theme on many of these calls hosted by pharmaceutical companies in recent quarters relates to the ongoing challenges affecting our industry and the entire healthcare sector in the U.S. I know that's created a lot of uncertainty about what the future holds for our industry. But the fact is, tremendous opportunity awaits the company that's both willing and able to break down the barriers to access to affordable medicine around the world, invest in capacity, and launch new products.","Mylan is that company. Having built a one-of-a-kind platform whose strength, diversification and resilience positions us like no other company to provide the kind of leadership needed to truly deliver Better Health for a Better World. We continue to lead the charge to remove barriers to access globally.","A couple of great examples to illustrate this. One is our generic RESTASIS, which we look forward to launching in the United States. This product may not become a significant financial driver for us as it will open the market for all, but it is a great example of our ability and willingness to fight the good fight to make an important ophthalmic product available to many more Americans.","Similarly in Europe, we overcame numerous IP barriers to secure approval to market the first generic of the 40 milligram strength of Glatiramer Acetate, which we since launched in Netherlands, Germany, the U.K. and Norway. This development builds upon approvals received in 2016 for the 20 milligram strength, which already is available in several European markets.","We're happy for the many additional MS patients these products will help. In various emerging markets, we've partnered with other companies to break down barriers as well. Our launches during the year of MyHep All, which treats hepatitis C in India, and our introduction of the first half based, fixed-dose combination to be offered to patients being treated for HIV in developing countries are perfect examples.","I'd like to point out that our commitment to steaming the tide of HIV is Mylan's most compelling example to-date of our commitment to breaking down barriers to access. More than 40% of people being treated for the disease globally depend on the Mylan product. As you consider the statistic, keep in mind that combating infectious diseases is but one of the multiple therapeutic areas Mylan is focused on. In fact, you can count on us to do next for cancer and diabetes what we've already done for HIV, as we dramatically expand the number of patients served.","With all this said, Mylan was by no means immuned in 2017 to the industry's turbulence, particularly as experienced in the U.S., the world's largest pharmaceutical market. But we believe we were best positioned to absorb the impact, deliver growth and expand access. In fact, it was precisely because we saw where the industry was heading that we embarked about a decade ago on our journey to transform Mylan and move into the much larger and more stable global community we now live.","As a result, we're able to leverage the benefits of scale, diversification and integration, giving us deep confidence that Mylan truly is Built to Last, as demonstrated by our performance this year. We delivered solid financial results. For instance, with total revenues rising 8% year-over-year to approximately $12 billion. More than half of this amount was generated outside of the United States, owing to the scope and scale of our operations.","Adjusted EPS fell 7% compared to 2016, as we absorb the decline in profitability of approximately $500 million associated with the rebasing of EpiPen. We also generated $2.6 billion in adjusted free cash flow, up more than 20% year-over-year from durable, recurring revenues across all markets around the world. Further, consistent with our commitment to maintain a healthy balance sheet, yet another quality that distinguishes Mylan, we accelerated debt repayments of about $1.36 billion. We also completed our $1 billion share repurchase program, returning capital to our shareholders at a time when we recognize our shares as being substantially undervalued.","For all of these accomplishments, I'd like to take a moment on behalf of our board and entire leadership team to thank all Mylan employees. Their outstanding execution and unwavering commitment to differentiate Mylan and deliver Better Health for a Better World is why we couldn't be more excited about our prospects for 2018. As you'll see, our focus for the year is not executing and leveraging everything we've brought together to continue carrying out our ONE Mylan strategy.","That means further integrating Mylan to optimize our global cost structure. It means realizing the value of every single launch around the world, including important ones, like Glatiramer, Wixela, and pegfilgrastim in the U.S. And despite the continued value we expect to generate with new product launches, we remain proud of the diversification we've achieved, as demonstrated by the fact that no single product is expected to account for more than 3% of our revenues.","Moreover, given the growth we expect to see in our Europe and Rest of World segments this year, we anticipate that they'll account for an even greater proportion of our total revenue. That will, again, help offset continued volatility in the U.S. as our customer base continues consolidating and concentrating and as competitive pressures persist. Given this dynamic, we'll no longer provide guidance around pricing as it will put us at a competitive disadvantage.","Moving on to guidance. We look forward to delivering a strong financial performance this year. Specifically, we expect to generate total revenues of between $11.75 billion to $13.25 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of approximately 5% at the midpoint. This guidance assumes flat growth in North America and high single-digit growth in Europe and Rest of World.","On the bottom line, we expect to deliver adjusted EPS in the range of $5.20 to $5.60, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 18% at the midpoint. In addition, we're looking to generate adjusted free cash flows between $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion.","Finally, we will continue to engage with all of our stakeholders about our story and being Built to Last. And as part of this, we look forward to hosting an investor event on April 11 in New York.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rajiv.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Thank you, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. I would first like to thank our employees for their unwavering dedication as we close out another strong year and successfully executed on many fronts, both commercially and operationally. I echo Heather's excitement for our Investor Day in April and look forward to highlighting the strength of our platform and our industry-leading differentiated pipeline.","I will now walk you through the key drivers of our 2018 outlook. We see 5% top-line growth while targeting EPS growth of 18% at the midpoint of our guidance range. During 2018, we will focus the execution of our significant launches, like generic Advair and many more, to further strengthen our durable portfolio.","At the same time, we'll continue to focus on Mylan integration while leveraging our cost of goods structure, our globally vertically integrated platform as well as our optimize G&A footprint.","At the same time, we'll be strategically reinvesting in our business, especially in the area such as sales and marketing and lifecycle management of several global key banks. All of these efforts will further ensure that Mylan is Built to Last.","From a segment perspective, in North America, specifically in USA, we have several exciting opportunities such as the launches of generic Advair and pegfilgrastim, our first planned biosimilar launch in the U.S. We also will continue to build upon the momentum from our Q4 2017 launches of Glatiramer Acetate and generic ESTRACE Cream.","Another important effort will be around further strengthening our ARV franchise in U.S., as we will be very shortly launching our novel ARV combination of (11:05) in addition to recently launched first generic of Efavirenz. Our U.S. portfolio is now and will increasingly be more durable and diversified as a result of our meaningful investments in recent years in injectables, OTC, respiratory, biosimilars and dermatology. These differentiated and robust offerings give us a greater ability to weather the ever-changing dynamics of the U.S. market.","In Europe, the 2018 growth will be driven by our established brands, our OTC portfolio, as well as several new launches such as Glatiramer Acetate 40 mg\/mL, (11:49), as well as our Insulin Glargine. We continue to invest in the lifecycle management of some of our key brands in the region, including Creon, Influvac and DYMISTA. For Creon, we are developing the two additional new strength.","And for Influvac, we successfully developed a quadrivalent vaccine, which has been approved in 2017 and will be launched commercially in 2018. As we expand our ARV presence around the world, we are now the leading generic player in the major European markets also.","These drivers, along with our well-balanced portfolio, has led a sheer number of products across more than 35 countries in the region will continue to drive the long-term durability of our European business and especially help us consolidate and strengthen our leadership position beyond France and Italy. In rest of the world, the growth in 2018 will be driven by portfolio expansion of our OTC and established brands across several new geographies such as China, Brazil, Turkey and Russia.","We see sizable opportunities in these high-growth markets. We also continue to expand our biologics portfolio and pipeline across many emerging markets. Another key driver for this segment continues to be our HIV and infectious disease franchise. Mylan has been the first to market suppliers for nearly half the new medicines approved under PEPFAR since 2009. And 2017 was no different as we got approval of Dolutegravir, Emtricitabine and TAF tablets.","Also late last year, we launched HepBest 25-milligram, a once daily tablet for treatment of chronic Hepatitis B in adults. Our vertically integrated platform and the capacity we have created over the last decade has helped us to stay and lead in many of these highly competitive tender markets.","Turning to our pipeline. I'm especially proud of our deep scientific clinical regulatory and intellectual property capabilities and the positive momentum we have built to bring complex products to the markets. During the last quarter, Mylan and Biocon, Trastuzumab was the first FDA-approved biosimilar to Herceptin and represent a significant achievement for Mylan as it also was our first biosimilar approved in the U.S.","We also received approval of Brazil's first trastuzumab biosimilar in partnership with Biocon and Libbs. Marking another positive step in increasing access to this critical product for the patients with HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers around the world. We have currently secured marketing authorization in 20 emerging markets for trastuzumab.","In the U.S., we continue executing on our BLA for pegfilgrastim and are confident as we approach our FDA action date in June of this year. We are looking forward to launching this product in U.S. in the second half of 2018. Also, last quarter, the EMA accepted our resubmissions for both trastuzumab and pegfilgrastim, and we continue to work with EMA to move these programs forward and launch them in European markets at the earliest opportunities.","Regarding our proposed biosimilar to EYLEA, we along with our partner, Momenta, previously announced that FDA has accepted our R&D. We plan to begin Phase III trials in the first half of 2018 and look forward to updating you as our program progresses. For our Bevacizumab proposed biosimilar to Avastin, we obtained marketing and export authorization in India and launched last quarter.","We are planning more than 30 submissions in 2018 in rest of the world markets. For developed markets, including Europe, U.S., Australia, and New Zealand, our Phase III clinical study is progressing well and we target to file our BLA at the end of 2019.","We also believe that we are now positioned to potentially launch adalimumab, a proposed biosimilar to HUMIRA, at market formation in Europe later this year. We look forward to discussing this program in more detail in our April Investor Day.","Moving to our insulin programs. We're pleased with CHMP's decision last month to recommend approval of Mylan and Biocon's Biosimilar Insulin Glargine. This further validates our abilities to deliver on our complex product portfolio globally.","We expect to begin launching the product across various markets in Europe in the second half of 2018. For U.S. market, our application is in active review with the agency, and we are responding to the information request as and when they are received. We also continue to communicate and pursue with agency towards defining a pathway for substitutability.","Last week, our partner, Biocon confirmed that their insulin facility in Malaysia received, from FDA, 6 observations during their PAI. We, along with Biocon, are viewing FDA's comments and feel confident in our ability to quickly address the observations.","In December, U.S. Patent and Trademark Appeal Board instituted IPR review on all claims against two Orange Book-listed patents, in reference to Insulin Glargine, marking another step forward in our ongoing efforts to bring a substitutable version to the patients as soon as possible. We're also very pleased to report the progress of our other insulin pipeline program as we move insulin aspart, a biosimilar to NovoLog into the clinic.","Moving on to respiratory. We continue to advance our program with the FDA on our generic Advair application. Over the last few weeks, the FDA has provided us feedback on almost all the disciplines in the form of several information requests. We have already responded to some of these requests and are in the process of responding to rest.","We remain optimistic about this very exciting opportunity, for a June 2018 approval and launch. We look forward to bringing this product to market as soon as possible and providing an affordable alternative to patients.","Moving on to our nebulized program of revefenacin. FDA recently accepted Mylan and Theravance Biopharma's NDA for revefenacin in adults with COPD and have signed a PDUFA date of November 13, 2018. We believe that revefenacin when approved, will offer a convenient once daily nebulizer option for patients and will further strengthen Mylan's robust and growing respiratory portfolio.","Earlier this week, Theravance Biopharma announced the completion of a Phase 3b study of revefenacin, which is intended solely for commercialization purposes and not required for FDA approval. While numerical improvements for revefenacin over tiotropium are not statistically significant for the primary endpoint, the study provided important insights for the use of the product if approved, in patients with COPD.","Moreover, revefenacin was generally well tolerated and no new safety issues were identified. Regarding generic Symbicort program with our partner, 3M. As we previously announced, the pivotal PK studies are now completed with BE demonstrated for both low and high strength products. We have completed the clinical equivalence study and are on schedule to submit our 505(j) ANDA by the end of June 2018.","Regarding our generic RESTASIS program, we are working towards our target action date of July 2018. This product has been another example of Mylan leading the fight for access to affordable medicine. Earlier today, we announced the global collaboration and licensing agreement with our partner Revance, for the development strategy and commercialization of our post biosimilar to BOTOX. We plan to work together to advance the regulatory approvals in the development of this important biosimilar product and commercialization in U.S. and towards Europe.","The manufacturing process and the know-how owned by our partner for the process and selling (21:24) capabilities, combined with Mylan's scientific, regulatory, and legal capabilities, will differentiate us and our ability to bring this drug to market. The addition of this product further solidifies Mylan's long-term commitment through the development and commercialization of biosimilars and complex products globally.","This is just another example how Mylan today is being viewed as a partner of choice due to our ability to execute on science and commercialization capabilities. We continuously look for opportunities, and 2017 was no different. For example, we executed on a portfolio of specialty dermatology products, the addition of a brand Cold-EEZE to our OTC baskets and a niche portfolio of complex and hard-to-make APIs.","As I said before, I have never been more excited about the future of Mylan, with our continued diversification across channels and geographies in addition to our unique and durable platform.","With that, I will turn it over to Tony.","Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV","Thank you, Rajiv, and good afternoon. Like Heather and Rajiv, I am pleased with the overall performance of our business in 2017 and remain very optimistic about Mylan's future. From a commercial standpoint, our ability to continue leveraging ONE Mylan around the globe to drive solid top-line growth in 2017 in what's proved to be a dynamic and challenging environment, once again underscores the strength, diversification, and resilience of our commercial platform. We continue to believe that this platform positions Mylan uniquely within the industry and with our customers as we work to deliver better health for patients.","Before providing you with an overview of our segment performance, let me first highlight a few key product updates. Over the past year, we continued to deliver on our commitments to bring complex products to market. A few prime examples include our introduction of a generic ESTRACE, a generic version of COPAXONE 20-milligram and the launch of the first generic for COPAXONE 40-milligram in the U.S. and in Netherlands during the fourth quarter.","In the U.S., we continue to be encouraged with the uptake on our 40-milligram strength. For the week ending February 16, our share of new prescriptions was 18% and total prescriptions stood at 14%. And we continue to bring on new customers every day. In addition, we have seen an increase in the utilization of a comprehensive support services provided by our MS Advocate Program.","This program provides a suite of services truly focused on the patient. These include access to an encore registered nurse for product questions, help to enroll into our co-pay assistance program, in-home injection training with our WhisperJECT Autoinjector and support to help patients understand their coverage and reimbursement options.","We continue to view Glatiramer as a very attractive and durable opportunity. We fully believe as the year progresses, Mylan will receive its fair share of the market opportunity and will work in a balanced way to ensure the objective is obtained. In addition to this activity, our global key brands, such as DYMISTA, Dona, Elavil, and ArmoLIPID, as well as several others, continue to stand out for their double-digit growth.","We expect this growth to continue as we leverage our strong commercial infrastructure in markets around the world and share assets and resources across geographies to ensure best practices are being utilized and opportunities are being maximized. I'd like to commend our sales and marketing teams for being able to accelerate the growth of these products, proving that one plus one can equal three. With more than a year of getting to know the former Meda commercial assets, we have been able to grow that portfolio and we see continued opportunity to further leverage our entire portfolio globally.","Moving on now to our full-year regional highlights. Let's begin with North America. Third-party net sales in this segment totaled approximately $5 billion, a 12% year-over-year reduction, primarily driven by a decline in EpiPen of more than $650 million, as well as competitive pressures brought on by loss of exclusivity and continued customer concentration.","As in previous quarters, the pricing environment continues to be a topic of much discussion throughout the industry. As we have said in our previous earnings calls, we expected additional fluctuations in the year-over-year pricing comparisons resulting from the loss of exclusivity on several of our meaningful first to market products namely: olmesartan and olmesartan\/HCTZ.","As we have continued to maintain full-year price erosion in our North American generic business came in as we estimated in the high-single digits. As Heather stated, going forward, we will no longer be giving country-specific generic price erosion results or expectations as we feel this places us at a competitive disadvantage in the market.","Our results in North America were more than offset by strong growth in our Europe and Rest of World segments, which together now account for nearly 60% of Mylan's revenues. In Europe, sales totaled almost $4 billion, a year-over-year increase of 34%. This strong organic growth came from countries like Italy, the U.K. and Germany, as well as a positive impact in key markets such as Italy, France and the U.K. from Meda acquired products.","Notable, too, was the stability and performance of our strong, durable brands in the region such as Creon, Betadine, Brufen, Influvac and DYMISTA, which represent nearly $500 million in sales for this region.","Building on my earlier comments related to complex products, we received marketing authorization for the first-generic of the 40-milligrams strength of Glatiramer Acetate in partnership with Synthon and launched in the Netherlands in the fourth quarter, followed by launches in Germany, the U.K. and Norway earlier this year. We are excited about the opportunity to continue launching the product throughout Europe as additional approvals are received.","Our Rest of World segment generated sales of $2.8 billion, a year-over-year increase of 19%. This strong growth was driven in part by new Meda assets, as well as very strong performance within our ARV tender businesses. Key brands such as Elavil and Hertraz in emerging markets and AMITIZA in Japan also helped grow the top-line.","Additionally, Australia grew 17% year-over-year as a result of growth in brands, generics and our partnership efforts. We are pleased with the performance in this region and continue to see growth opportunities in our portfolio.","While Ken will go into a detailed financial guidance, I'd like to take a moment to underscore my optimism and excitement as we head into 2018. As Rajiv outlined, I am encouraged by our commitment to reinvest in our business, especially in the areas of sales and marketing. Doing so will allow us to keep leveraging our global commercial platform. In addition, it will ensure commercial readiness as we launch Glatiramer in additional markets around the world and boost conversion rates as we introduce our other key products such as pegfilgrastim and generic Advair and as we expand our global key brands.","In summary, we continue to believe that our distinct product mix of generics, brands and over-the-counter medications across a range of therapeutic categories sold in multiple sales channels and combined with an expansive geographic reach and a one-of-a-kind commercial platform position Mylan better than any other company in the industry to be the partner of choice to our customers and deliver better health for patients. And it's why we couldn't be more excited about Mylan's very bright future in all of our regions.","My excitement is brought to life each day, not only by the nearly 7,000 people around the world who make up our commercial team, but also everyone at Mylan for their dedication to our customers and to the patients who depend on our products.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to our financial results. Rajiv and Tony have already taken you through the details of our consolidated and segment revenues, which were in line with our expectations. I'll cover the remainder of our financial results.","Adjusted SG&A increased 3% in the quarter versus the prior year to $602 million. For the full-year, adjusted SG&A increased slightly to $2.4 billion and declined 40 basis points as a percentage of total revenues.","The dollar increase is due primarily to the full-year impact of the acquisitions of Meda and Renaissance. It's important to note that both the quarter and the full-year benefited from our ongoing integration activities, which partially mitigated this impact as we continue to optimize our cost structure.","Adjusted R&D was approximately 5% of total revenues for the quarter, which was in line with the prior year. For the full-year, adjusted R&D was down 80 basis points to 5.5% of total revenue versus the prior year, mostly due to the reprioritization of global programs. Our adjusted effective tax rate for both the quarter and the full-year 2017 was 18% and was in line with the low end of our revised guidance.","Moving on to segment profitability. As a result of the declines in third-party net sales, including EpiPen, segment profitability in North America declined 12% in the quarter to $687 million. Partially offsetting this decline, segment profitability expanded in Europe and the Rest of World segments by 76% and 6%, respectively, reflecting new product sales contributions. Europe also benefited from higher volumes in our base business, along with favorable pricing and integration activities.","For the full-year, combined regional segment profitability grew 5% versus the prior year, Europe grew 62% and Rest of World grew 54%, both benefiting from the full-year impact of acquisitions and the impact of our ongoing Mylan integration activities. This growth was partially offset by a 15% decline in North America, mostly due to lower pricing and lower volumes on existing products including EpiPen.","Adjusted net earnings declined to $765 million and adjusted EPS declined 9% to $1.43 in the quarter, both driven by lower gross profit from third-party net sales in North America, partially offset by the impact of integration activities. On a full-year basis, we reported adjusted net earnings of $2.4 billion and adjusted EPS of $4.56, both in line with our revised guidance ranges.","The 7% decline in adjusted EPS versus the prior year reflects the approximately $500 million negative profit impact from EpiPen, partially offset by favorable impacts from the Meda and Topicals Business acquisitions, along with the benefits from integration activities.","Turning to our cash flow and liquidity metrics. Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.9 billion for the 12-months ended December 31, 2017 compared to approximately $2.5 billion in the prior year period. Capital expenditures totaled $257 million compared to approximately $390 million in the prior year.","As we've said previously, we're fully committed to maintaining a healthy investment grade balance sheet and to continuing to de-lever. During 2017, we demonstrated that point by paying down our debt by approximately $1.4 billion while at the same time, continuing to invest in the business.","At the end of 2017, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 3.8 times and was in compliance with our debt covenant requirements. Based on our adjusted EBITDA growth and debt reduction assumptions in 2018, we expect to reduce our leverage ratio to below 3.5 times.","We remain committed to our long-term target ratio of 3.0 times, as well as our investment grade credit rating. Our strong cash flow performance track record reflects the strength and the durability of our portfolio.","Moving to 2018. At a high level, we expect total revenues in the range of $11.75 billion to $13.25 billion, which represents an increase of 5% at the midpoint versus full-year 2017. Full-year adjusted EPS is also expected to increase from $4.56 in 2017 to a range of $5.20 to $5.60, an 18% increase at the midpoint.","And finally, we expect adjusted free cash flow in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion. As you heard from Rajiv and Tony, in our top-line outlook, we expect positive volume growth and a significant contribution from new product launches, including and pegfilgrastim. This is coupled with the carryforward impact of 2017 launches, including Glatiramer Acetate. These are expected to more than offset the competitive market dynamics in the U.S.","As shown on Page 10 in the investor presentation, you'll see we expect adjusted gross margin to expand over 180 basis points at the midpoint from 2017 to 2018 while absorbing the expected global pricing headwinds. This expansion is driven by the benefit of new launches and increased volumes in addition to our ability to further leverage Mylan integration as we continue to identify opportunities to optimize our global cost structure.","For 2018, we do expect the potential slight upward pressure on our adjusted effective tax rate at the midpoint of our guidance. As I mentioned earlier, our 2017 rate was 18%, and we're now estimating for it to be in the range of 17.5% to 19% in 2018. The slight increase is due to implementation of the tax reform changes that were passed late last year, as well as the changing mix of geographic profits as our portfolio continues to diversify globally.","As shown on the adjusted EPS bridge on slide 12, you clearly see the positive contribution from the gross profit growth driven by new product launches and volume from existing products. We're able to invest more in the selling portion of SG&A as we continue to reap benefits from our Mylan integration activities. In addition, we expect a slight benefit from lower R&D spending focused on less crowded, more complex, hard to produce niche products.","Finally, we expect interest, tax, shares and FX to be a net positive impact on adjusted EPS and is mainly driven by the lower share count following the completion of our $1 billion share repurchase program in the beginning of 2018. As a result of our continued strong cash flow generation; for the full-year, we expect to generate between $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion of adjusted free cash flow, net of capital expenditures between $300 million and $500 million.","Our ability to generate strong cash flows reflects the strength and durability of our portfolio resulting from the decade-long transformation of our business into a global, diversified player and is supported by the strength of our balance sheet, which provides us with financial flexibility to invest in the future of our business. A quick comment on calendarization as you think about modeling for 2018.","We expect total revenues to be second-half weighted similar to 2017. However, we expect adjusted EPS to be slightly more heavily weighted to the second half relative to 2017 due to higher profitability of new product launches, which will be second-half weighted.","Finally, we also expect Q1 to contribute slightly less adjusted EPS on a relative basis than it did in the prior year. We're very proud of the business that we built over the last decade and we believe that we're uniquely positioned to fully realize the value of the transformation and our differentiated portfolio.","It's that differentiated business model, our global talent, our execution track record, and our ability to generate significant cash flows that give us the confidence in our ability to successfully execute through the dynamic nature of our business.","With that, we'll now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on your biosimilar BOTOX program with Revance. If you can talk about some of the technical hurdles in achieving these timelines, et cetera. And was wondering if you would consider bringing other aesthetic products, like fillers, to be in a position to have a more complete aesthetics offering to compete with Allergan? Thanks.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Hi, Jami, thanks for your question. Actually, we will be looking forward to give you more details about the program, the timing and where we are, what we have evaluated from our partners strength point of view. When we talk to you or meet you in our April Investor Day. And also about the line extension and the other aesthetic products that, that subject will also be addressed at the same time.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Yes. And I would just add to that, Jami. Obviously, as we talked about diversification, we're looking obviously across the whole product line, about things that have a, no reimbursement or cash pay, which, again, we think would complement our existing U.S. business. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good evening, and thank you for taking my question. One brief one to Ken. What do you expect would be the adjustment to the cash flow in 2018? Are we expecting this to be a large number or small? And then more specifically in biosimilar, HUMIRA; Rajiv, do you expect to getting the market to open in October 2018, essentially as your program move forward, so now, you now expect to be ready then or is it more that they expect market opening to be later and thus, your product will get there on time?","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","Thanks, Ronny. On the question on cash flow. As you know, in 2017, we have larger adjustments to cash flow as we pay the settlement of $465 million under the CMS, DOJ arrangement. As we move into 2018, the adjusted cash flow is not anticipating similar type adjustments. So I would tell you that right now, we're anticipating those to be smaller.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","And Ronny, regarding your question on biosimilar to HUMIRA, we are very much looking forward to potentially launch this product in October of 2018 as market formation takes place.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a question for the team on expected new products approval pace or pipeline yield in the U.S. in 2018. I guess, outside of the complex generic products, which FDA seems to always make more complex than they should be, but there also seem to be a fairly significant slowdown in the rate of approvals, at least over the past couple of months. I just want to get your thoughts or perspective on that and whether or not you've built in additional cushion in terms of probably early adjusting the new product outlook based on the possibility of much slower review times than we've seen in the past couple of years? Thanks.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Sure, I'll start and then certainly, Rajiv, if you want to add anything. What I would say, Elliot, is I don't think 2017 has been different than the last couple of years in the sense of seasonality with approvals coming in from the FDA Q4 and especially, December have always been their largest month of approval. So as you look from December and trend that to January, February, I wouldn't necessarily call that a down tick in approvals from an annualized basis.","And on your timing question, what I would say, we continue to be \u2013 see improvement in meeting these timelines, especially as we're in the post GDUFA filings and especially now coming into GDUFA II, that, one, the lines of communication, the back and forth, the more transparency around these files, especially around the complex products. We continue to see enhancement then. So we look forward to that continuing under Dr. Gottlieb's leadership. And look, that's why we're excited about this year, our approvals, and look forward to some of these various important launches.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks you. Ken, I was hoping if you could talk about how any future capital deployment factors into the EPS ranges for the year. And on generic Advair and biosimilar Neulasta, can you help us at least directionally with gross margin; is it higher, lower, or similar than corporate average? I think that, any color on that and biosimilars in general would be appreciated by all? Thanks.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","Thanks, Gregg. So I think some of a \u2013 couple of the key points is, as you know and as we said and have released earlier, one of the bigger capital deployment, things that we've done and just finished up in the first quarter, was the completion of the $1 billion share buyback program. And obviously, that's going to complement EPS in 2018 and the growth year-over-year.","But I would also tell you that we have consistently said over the last 12 to 18 months that once Meda was completed, we're not looking at large transformational assets and businesses to bring into the portfolio. But we do have this large, healthy and growing cash flow stream and cash flow bucket that we'll continue to look at product additions in certain gaps as we look at growing our OTC space, as we look at growing our Derm space, things like that.","So, they will have some contribution. But the reality is, is we look at one of the primary areas for capital redeployment this year is, as I stated, which is in paying down debt, following the share repurchase program to reduce our leverage ratio below 3.5 times while we get to the end of 2018 and remain committed to that investment grade balance sheet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Liav Abraham with Citi. Your line is now open.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon. Just another question on generic Advair, can you just give us a little bit more flavor on the information request that you've received from FDA? Apart from these, are there any outstanding issues? And where do you stand on the manufacturing front? And then as it relates to guidance, can you confirm that you can make your guidance without any of these big launches such as Advair or Neulasta that you're anticipating this year? Thank you.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Thanks, Liav. In fact, we are very happy with the pace at which FDA has reviewed this ANDA after we have submitted the response to the CRL in August of 2017. And we have been getting \u2013 especially over the last eight weeks, we have got continuous feedback from FDA in terms of several information requests, some of those requests have already been responded to and some of them are being responded.","We don't see any red flags. We don't see any big hurdles. Yes, there is a lot of clarification which we need to provide, but that's what we are left with. And as well as the manufacturing is concerned, we don't see any constraints for manufacturing the requisite quantities for the launch and what we have built in our plan.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","And as far as your question around guidance, I would say this year is no different than in year's past. I believe that we've always taken a very practical approach to how we probability weight our launches to, and that's why we give a range around our \u2013 around what we're expecting.","And as I've often said, all good things don't happen at one time. All bad things don't happen at one time. It's really about managing this global business across all of our segments, as well as this year, really executing on these launches. So as always, as the year goes through, as we see changes or to change those ranges, we will. But we feel good about the range we've given and the way that we've modeled our business to manage to hitting our target.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Great. Thanks very much for the question. Just two quick ones here. First, prior commentary, I think, had been for earnings of at least $5.40 in 2018. Your formal guidance here is $5.20 to $5.60. I know it's not a huge change. But can you maybe just help us bridge a little bit in terms of what changed in terms of underlying outlook here? Is this just more pressure on that U.S.-based business that we're seeing across the space? Or is it something with new launches and pipeline?","And then the second one was just an update on generic RESTASIS and the opportunity here. Is that something you're thinking about for 2018? Just any more color on approval timelines. Thank you.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","Hi, Chris. Thanks. As far as our \u2013 I guess, what I would say, Chris, is I think $5.60 is more than $5.40. And so we've said at least $5.40 our target. The mid-point is $5.40. As you know, there's a lot of moving pieces and parts that go into us giving that range. So really, nothing has changed.","I think, again, there's a lot of moving pieces and parts, as I said earlier. And I think our track record of showing our ability to manage those has been very good, and I'm excited about this year. I'm excited about the opportunities. And as I said, as things roll in, we'll continue to hone in on that and so that's what I would say on the guidance.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","On RESTASIS, Chris, we have a target action date of July 2018. We don't have any significant or any scientific issues which need to be resolved. And now we are waiting to hear from FDA. And we look forward to bring this product to the market in 2018.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just, Rajiv, maybe a little bit of an update on the pegfilgrastim product. And one question I had was why was it that with trastuzumab, you simply had the PDUFA date delayed by a few months and yet you had got a Complete Response Letter even though it seems like with both, it was more of manufacturing issues rather than clinical?","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","So let me give you the status of pegfilgrastim and that \u2013 we have responded to the deficiencies, which we received in the last quarter. We have heard from FDA on several of those issues already. And we are already received certain information request. We feel very confident on the science part, on the execution of everything which was asked. And I think we have responded and we have a pretty good place on that.","I think the only place where we're waiting now this \u2013 between that the tune action date, and this is (52:39) FDA may like to have another look into the manufacturing facility, although they have already approved or given us an approval on Herceptin, but that's up to FDA. We continue to work with the FDA very closely to respond to everything, which has been asked thus far. We don't see any hurdles.","And I cannot comment about what assumptions or why they did, what they did in Herceptin in extending the product by three months. But in this case, they have given us now a target action date of early June, which we are very optimistic that by this time, all these issues will be resolved. And we look forward to launch this product in the second half of this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS. Your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Owais (53:29) for Marc. You provided some \u2013 you indicated some countries, where you saw \u2013 overseas where you saw some good growth such as Italy and Australia. Just wondering like what other countries \u2013 if you can provide a little more details in countries that you've seen may not seen as robust of a growth in BOCs (53:53)?","Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV","Maybe I'll take a shot at this. Yes, we've seen some really great growth outside of the U.S. in markets like Italy, France, U.K, Germany, in particular last year. There's tremendous opportunity in the U.K. and Germany specifically to continue to grow our opportunity in those markets as well as many of the emerging markets, we've seen great growth in Australia, like I said, 17% year-over-year. And we think we're going to have a great year in 2018 as well. So we have great confidence in where our business has been in 2017 outside the U.S. and where is going here in 2018.","Rajiv Malik - Mylan NV","Tony, just to add, we've been very excited with our opportunities and growth we are seeing in Brazil, China, Russia, although it's a small base, but there are many opportunity, many opportunities, which have been incubated and are being now realized in the next \u2013 in 2018, as well as 2019 as we go along.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Irina Koffler with Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Irina R. Koffler - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned that you wanted to make investments in sales and marketing. And I was just wondering if you could expand on that? And whether this investment would be completed in this year, or is it more of a head count expansion that will carry cost into the next year?","Anthony Mauro - Mylan NV","Thank you for the question. I think it will be twofold. Quite frankly, I think there will be certain investments that we see providing immediate value from a marketing perspective in key markets that from an OTC and established brand perspective. Additionally, from building an infrastructure in countries like China and Russia where we're adding sales force to ensure that we can cover broader and wider array of products that will carry on pass this year as well.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","And Irina, I would just add to that that where you'll see in the charts that we provided you, that you see that we're continuing to reap benefits from our G&A initiatives. Meaning, where Mylan ONE integration initiatives. And as we move through the year, we look at how do we take that money and invest it to grow the top-line and bottom-line. And there's, obviously, more to be done in that area. We continue to have Mylan integration activities under in process.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Akash Tewari - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, it's Akash on for Umer. Just a couple of questions. Number one, you guided to flat year-over-year in North American sales. Can you talk about what contribution from launches you're baking into have flat growth in a base case?","And then also, Rest of World's profitability has been pretty choppy for you guys since Q4. Can you talk about how you expect profitability to kind of evolve going forward? And then what the contribution was to segment profit in Q4 specifically? Thanks.","Kenneth Scott Parks - Mylan NV","I think on the segment profit piece for Rest of World, in the charts you'll be able to see both the fourth quarter and the full-year that profitability has expanded in not-only Rest of World, but Europe, as we move through the year. Now you will see that the fourth quarter had a little bit less profit expansion than what we had for the year overall. But that market can be a little bit choppy based upon tenders.","But what we like is the fact that it continues to grow, it continues to follow the top-line. And as Tony just talked about, we've only begun to scratch the surface in many of the markets that we can enter into.","So I wouldn't be too concerned about a quarter. And again, I would say that it's a good, healthy quarter. But what I would do is continue to watch what we're doing and how we're diversifying broadly across that Rest of World market.","Heather M. Bresch - Mylan NV","And I guess, just to add to your question about the U.S. in North America, it's just \u2013 here's what I would say as you think about the generic industry as a whole, the real drivers to the success of this business as new product launches and high-volumes and offsetting erosion and other products as they can offer or have other competition enter the market.","So as you look at our business now, the size of our business and the scale across the diversified portfolio we have, it's taken all that into consideration. We're not \u2013 we long ago stopped giving any kind of product by product basis. And what I would say is, again I'll just reiterate, I think our track record speaks for itself, is that giving working a lot of probability, waiting in practicality into the numbers that we come forward with as it results to all segments and rolling up to the EPS guidance that we've given.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Ms. Trombetta for any closing remarks.","Melissa Trombetta - Mylan NV","I just want to thank, everyone, for joining our call today. We look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day on April 11th. This concludes our call. Have a great night.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."]}}
