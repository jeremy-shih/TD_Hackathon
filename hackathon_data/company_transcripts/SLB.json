At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session with instructions being given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead, sir.","Simon Farrant","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2015 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from New York following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting yesterday. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.","However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind the participants that some of the statement we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the projected statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings.","Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our third quarter press release which is on our website. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements.","Now, I will turn the call over to Simon.","Simon Ayat","Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share were $0.78. This represent decreases of $0.10 sequentially and $0.71 when compared to the same quarter last year. Our third quarter revenue of $8.5 billion decreased 6% sequentially. Almost 40% of the revenue decline was attributable to pricing. ","Despite the very challenging environment both in terms of pricing and activity, pre-tax operating margins only declined by 101 basis points sequentially. This was due to the continued strong and proactive cost management across the entire organization. Sequential highlights by product group whereas follows. Third quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.3 billion decreased 5% sequentially as decreases in exploration spending impacted both wireline and testing services internationally. Despite the revenue decline, pre-tax margin -- operating margins remained essentially flat at 26.3%. Drilling Group revenue of $3.3 billion, decreased 7%, primarily due to pricing pressures and activity declines internationally that have mostly affected drilling and measurements and M-I SWACO. As a result of strong cost management, Drilling Group margins only declined 94 basis points to 18.6%. Production Group revenue of $3 billion, decreased 5% sequentially, while margins declined 173 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by pricing and activity declines in Well Services.","Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate was 20% in the third quarter. This was lower than the previous quarter by about 1 percentage point due to the geographic mix of earnings between North America and the Rest of the World as well as the mix of earnings amongst the international geo markets. Our cash flow generation continues to be very strong. During the third quarter, we generated $2.5 billion of cash flow from operations. During the first three quarters of 2015, we have generated $6.6 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $150 million during the third quarter and $600 million during the first nine month of the year. ","Net debt improved $400 million during the quarter to $5.2 billion. During the quarter, we spend $545 million to repurchase 6.9 million shares at an average price of $78.76. Subsequent to the announcement of our transaction with Cameron in August, we have been repurchasing the maximum number of shares allowable under the SEC\u2019s regulations.","We filed our S4 registration statement relating to the acquisition two weeks ago today. It\u2019s worth highlighting that once the SEC declares our registration statement effective and the proxy statement is mailed. We will be prohibited under the securities laws from repurchasing our stock until the Cameron shareholder vote. We spent $590 million on Capex during the third quarter. Full-year 2015 Capex excluding multi-client and SPM investments is still expected to be approximately $2.5 billion. And now I will turn the conference call over to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you Simon and good morning everyone. Schlumberger third quarter revenues fell 6% sequentially, driven by continuing decline in rig activity and persistent pricing pressure throughout our global operations. North America revenues fell 4% sequentially, as we maintain focus on balancing margins and market share, while international revenue was 7% lower as customer budget cuts and service pricing erosion impacted results. Still in the midst of what may well turn out to be the most severe downturn in several decades, our operating margins were maintained at levels much higher than in previous downturns. ","In North America, pre-tax operating margins were held at 8.9% in spite of an additional drop in activity and pricing both offshore and on land. While international margins dropped to 23.7% as customer budget cuts, activity cancellations and lower service pricing took further effect. In the first nine months of 2015, year-over-year revenue has dropped 34% in North America and 18% internationally, yet we have delivered nine month decremental operating margins of 34% in North America and 23% internationally, which represents a strong performance improvement over the 2009 downturn.","We have delivered these results by proactively and decisively managing our cost and resource base, carefully navigating the commercial landscape with the aim of balancing margins and market share and at the same time, accelerating our internal transformation program. We also generated more than $1.7 billion in free cash flow in the third quarter, which represents a conversion rate of 170% of the quarter\u2019s earnings.","Our ability to generate significant free cash flow even in this part of the cycle is a major competitive edge which we actively use to pursue new business opportunities as well as targeted M&A activity. In terms of M&A, our main focus in recent months has been the proposed acquisition of Cameron announced on August 26, which will open up a significant growth opportunity for us, as we look to establish the industry\u2019s first complete drilling and production systems, spanning both the surface and the subsurface.","In addition, we also completed the acquisition of Houston-based T&T Engineering, which specializes in design of land rig systems as well as Utah-based Novatek, which is a leader in the field of synthetic diamond innovation. We also signed a letter of intent for a joint venture with a part of the Bauer Group from Germany in further revolution of our land-rig-of-the-future strategy. And finally, we entered into an agreement with IBM to jointly provide integrated production optimization services combining our production software platform with IBM\u2019s enterprise asset management services in an end-to-end offering.","Looking at our results on a geographical basis, North American revenue decreased 4% sequentially, a figure considerably less than the 27% sequential decrease seen in the second quarter and better than the 7% drop in the average horizontal rig count. On land, the revenue growth was driven by lower hydraulic fracturing activity and additional pricing pressure for both products and services. In the Gulf of Mexico, revenue declined on lower multiclient seismic sales, exploration rigs transferring to drilling and completion activities, as well as pricing concessions which were partially offset by higher new technology sales.","In Western Canada, rig count almost doubled sequentially, following the early spring break up, but was still down by roughly 52% year-over-year. In spite of these headwinds, operating margins in North America decreased by only 136 basis points sequentially to 8.9% and this strong performance is the direct results of our proactive approach to cost and resource management, the growing effects of our transformation program, strong new technology sales and efficient supply chain management.","As service pricing in US land fell further in the third quarter, we continued our approach of concentrating activity in core areas and for key customers while proceeding to start equipment rather than operating at a loss. In the rare event, we select to pursue work at what we consider non-commercial prices. We view this as an investment decision and apply the same justification and approval process used for any other reinvestment we do in our business. This has let us to move equipment and crews between basins as we look to balance market share with margins and as we pursue new technology opportunities. We believe that this approach has enabled us to protect our profitability in North America land and has also helped us maintain our overall infrastructure and long-term ability to service our customers in this market.","In the international markets, revenue declined 7% sequentially due to further customer budget cuts, rapidly changing activity driven by the disruptions, delays and cancellations, as well as by further pricing concessions. Third quarter international operating margins of 23.7% was down 72 basis points sequentially and 83% basis points year-over-year. Our nine month decremental margins were still held to 23% which represents a marked improvement over the 61% from the corresponding period in the 2009 downturn which is a testament to both the strength of our international business and how well our organization is executing.","Within the international areas, Middle East and Asia revenues declined by 8% sequentially while pretax operating margins decreased 171 basis points to 27%. Activity in the Middle East remained robust during the quarter, particularly in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, but pricing concessions, changes to the activity mix, as well as project delays had a negative impact on revenue and profitability. Year-over-year area revenue decreased 20% while margins dropped by 61 basis points. Our lump sum turnkey project in Saudi Arabia continued to progress well and with steady improvements in drilling efficiency, well deliveries are now ahead of planned levels. ","In the United Arab Emirates, robust drilling production and seismic activity was boosted by further rig additions and we also recorded strong sales of Petrel and ECLIPSE software. Drilling activity was also stronger in Kuwait as rig count increased, however, this was partly offset by operational delays and an activity shutdown in the neutral zone. ","In Iraq, we mobilized two rigs for the Zubair lump sum turnkey project with the first well already completed, while revenue from the other operations in the country remained flat with the second quarter. ","In Southeast Asia, activity was lower throughout the region driven by a further drop in Offshore Australia as project ended, lower rig count in Malaysia, reduced deep-water exploration and development work in the South China Sea and continuing NOC budget cuts on land in China. ","In Latin America, revenue declined 7% sequentially, while pretax operating margins fell 159 basis points to 20.7%. In Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, activity was further hit by a combination of delays and budget reductions, while Colombia was weaker due to increased pricing pressure. These effects were however, partially offset by steady activity in Venezuela and Ecuador. ","Year-over-year area revenue decreased 30% and operating margins decreased by 120 basis points. In Mexico, revenue dropped again in the third quarter and now stands at an eight-year low as the significant budget cuts further impacted activity and profitability. At the same time, we began multiclient seismic operations in the Gulf of Campeche and awards for the second and third license rounds of the Energy Reform Act remain on schedule. ","Offshore activity continued to decline in Brazil as budget reductions impacted both equipment rentals and field operations. And in addition to this, revenue was also hit by the weakening of the reais. In Venezuela, activity was steady for both the PDVSA and for the heavy-oil joint ventures in the Faja, while in Ecuador, SPM activity was flat as the Shushufindi project continued to perform in line with expectations. ","In Europe\/CIS\/Africa, revenue fell 6% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins increased 92 basis points to 22.2%. Year-over-year revenue decreased 31% and margins dropped by 125 basis points. Within the area, the bright spot in the third quarter was Russia and Central Asia, where revenue continued to increase with peak summer drilling activity in Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. This increase was however partially offset by a weaker ruble. ","In the North Sea, increased drilling in the UK sector was insufficient to counter lower activity in the remote areas and was further offset by reduced activity in Norway from project delays and cancellations as well as currency weakness. ","In Sub-Saharan Africa, activity increased in Gabon in the third quarter, but was considerably lower in the rest of the region as operations were halted in Chad. Exploration work dropped to a new low in Angola and also projects were cancelled in Nigeria. In Algeria and Tunisia, activity was also down in the third quarter, while in Libya, our operations continues to be limited to one offshore rig. ","Turning next to the overall market outlook, we see two clear trend emerging. First, as we enter the last quarter of the year, the global oil market is still weighed down by fears of reduced growth in China, and the timing and magnitude of additional Iranian exports. However, the fundamental balance of supply and demand continues to tighten driven by both solid global GDP growth and by weakening supply as dramatic cuts in E&P investments start to take full effect. We expect this trend to continue and as the oil markets further recognizes the magnitude of the industry\u2019s annual production replacement challenge, this will gradually translate into improvements in oil prices going forward. ","Second, in spite of the expected improvements in oil prices, the market outlook for oilfield services looks challenging for the coming quarters, as we expect additional reductions in activity and further pressure on service pricing.","This is driven by the financial pressure on many of our customers where a year of very low oil prices is now exhausting available cash flow and corresponding capital spending and also leading them to take a very conservative view on 2016 E&P budgets. In addition to this, the winter season will have the normal negative impact on activity, which in the fourth quarter, is unlikely to be offset by the usual year-end sales of software products and multi-client licenses.","Based on this industry outlook, we expect E&P investments to fall for a second successive year in 2016, which is the first time since the 1986 downturn, when the spare capacity cushion was more than 10 million barrels per day. In spite of the need for the industry to increase investment levels to mitigate the pending impact on global supply, we instead see an increasing likelihood of a timing gap between the expected improvement in oil prices and the subsequent increase in E&P investments and oilfield services activity.","This timing gap or increased response time is a direct consequence of the dramatic cost in E&P investments, which have clearly damaged the oil industry\u2019s financial strength and investment appetite as well as the operating capacity and capability. So while our macro view has not changed in terms of a tightening supply and demand balance and an expected improvement in oil prices, we have to factor in that the likely recovery in our activity levels now seems to be a 2017 event.","We communicated in our previous earnings call that we were prepared to live with our existing cost base going forward, provided we were close to the bottom of the market and that the activity recovery was only a couple of quarters out. As a result, we carried our cost base forward into Q3, which had some negative impact on our operating margins and we did not report any exceptional restructuring charges in the quarter.","The likely timing gap between the oil price recovery and the subsequent increase in oilfield services activity in combination with a more conservative spending outlook from our customers is causing us to now take further action. We have therefore decided to proceed with a further round of capacity and overhead reductions, which will result in a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter.","This charge will cover severance cost for additional headcount reductions, reflecting both our updated activity outlook for 2016 and a further streamlining of our support structure. In addition and as part of our internal transformation program, we are now ready to initiate a significant restructuring of our global manufacturing and distribution network, which will also result in a charge in the fourth quarter.","We will seize opportunities to streamline our engineering, manufacturing and sustaining infrastructure by consolidating sites into clusters both in central locations and in the field, while at the same time, further modernize our processes by introducing state of the art manufacturing automation in line with the best companies in other high tech industries.","These changes to our manufacturing and distribution network are closely coordinated with the integrated plans for Cameron, which are already well advanced and which will be quickly implemented once the transaction has closed. So far in this downturn, we have proactively and decisively managed our cost and resource base, carefully navigated the commercial landscape with the aim of balancing margins and market share, at the same time, as we have actively accelerated our internal transformation program.","With the above actions, we are continuing this prudent approach with the aim of protecting and extending our solid financial performance into 2016, which is shaping up to be another challenging year for the oilfield services industry. We further believe that our ability to respond to higher E&P investments and oilfield activity in 2017 will be improved by protecting our financial strength in 2016, rather than carrying at accepted costs and inefficiencies as we await the recovery of the oilfield services market.","Overall, we remain very confident in our ability to weather this downturn much better than our surroundings and through our global reach, the strength of our technology offering and our transformation program, we are creating a significant financial leverage that will enable us to increase market share, deliver superior earnings and margins and continue to generate unmatched levels of free cash flow.","Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ole Slorer at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ole Slorer","Well, thank you very much. And, Paal, I wonder whether we could start with the macro and maybe before that, Simon congrats with another great set of free cash flow numbers.","Simon Ayat","Thanks, Ole.","Ole Slorer","But let us start with the macro for now. Where do you think that the weakening supply has played our differently or similarly to what you would have thought 3, 6 or 12 months ago in light of recent CapEx cuts?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think it\u2019s playing out more or less as we have expected globally. I think what you see in OPEC, there is really no change to overall production capacity. There is a continuous shift from spare capacity into marketed supply. In North America, the production is coming down more or less as expected as well and internationally, we are starting to see signs of a weakening supply as well. I think in all these three main sources of supply, while production is starting to come down, I think there are also significant efforts to maximize production within each of these basis while in some cases taking more short-term actions to maximize production which might actually have a negative on long-term recovery. I think there is only a limited period that this can be done and while the various players exhaust these type of opportunities, if investments aren\u2019t increased, I think you will see a further acceleration of the drop in production.","Ole Slorer","And the timing of that acceleration, do you have a view on that?","Paal Kibsgaard","No, it\u2019s still a bit difficult to say, but I think there are clear signs now in all \u2013 at least in North America and non-NAM and OPEC that production is weakening and we expect that to continue and potentially accelerate in the event the investments aren\u2019t increasing.","Ole Slorer","Okay, thanks for that. Just sort of based on what you highlight here, with respect to CapEx trends in respect of oil prices, just having a shot at your fourth quarter and first quarter next year, with a 10% EPS reduction into the fourth quarter and then another 5% into the first quarter, would that be a reasonable trajectory?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, let me say this. Q4 looks challenging and visibility had actually dropped in the past month or two now. So, formal [ph] activity is down, but in Q4 we will see the start of the wind to slow down in the northern hemisphere. We also see further budget cuts in several of the key offshore markets such as Sub-Sahara Africa, Brazil and the Far East. We also expect rig activity in North America land to be down in Q4 due to the financial stress on many of our customers there and we expect very limited yearend sales of product, software and multiclient. So EPS will drop, but due to the lack of the visibility we have now, Ole, I am not really ready to commit to a number, but I will also say that Q1 in spite of Q4 not having the seasonal uptick in yearend sales, we also see Q1 being below Q4.","Ole Slorer","Okay, that makes sense. Thanks a lot.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thanks, Ole.","Operator","Thank you. We will go next to the line of James West with Evercore ISI.","James West","Hey, good morning Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning. ","James West","Paal, so we\u2019ve now pushed out the recovery to \u201917, but I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit more on how you see \u201816 playing out. Clearly you just mentioned 1Q is going to be below 4Q, does that mark the bottom in earnings and we are kind of going sideways from those next year or is there a potential for a second half modest upturn?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, we hope that Q1 will represent the bottom and there would be a gradually, but slow recovery during the year or even sideways. I think it is still too early to say, James. I think we have, even for Q4 now there is significant uncertainties in several of the markets on what\u2019s going to happen. Beyond that we clearly see Q1 being below Q4, but visibility, Q1 is still very low. So I would hope that what you kind of depict will be the case, but I think it\u2019s too early to say. But I would say also that there is a limit to how long these reductions in investment and activity can continue. And I think as the oil price now likely will start to move upwards, hopefully investments will turnaround, but anything meaningful will be late \u201816 and into 117 as we see it as per today.","James West","Okay, got it. And then, Paal, you specifically called out M&A in the press release last night and you had a number of smaller deals in addition to Cameron this quarter, or last quarter excuse me. Are you preparing the market for something additional of size or is this just highlighting the fact that you guys are generating tons of cash, you got a huge flexibility?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah, it\u2019s still out there, we\u2019re not preparing the market for anything other than refocus significantly our entire organization on generating free cash. Margins are a key ingredients to generate cash. So both of those are key focus areas for us in terms of protecting and extending our strong financial performance. And obviously, in this type of market, companies that can generate significant free cash has a broad range of opportunities and I think we\u2019ve shown so far in the downturn that we will be opportunistic. What opportunities are there and which one we will convert, we will revert back to you when we have converted them. But as of now, we will continue to be opportunistic but there is no preparation or any methods beyond that.","James West","Okay, got it. Thanks Paal.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the line of Angie Sedita with UBS.","Angie Sedita","And again impressive free cash flow and decrementals there versus the peer group. So, Paal in your prepared remarks you talked a little bit about the outlook for 2016 as far as E&P spending and I know it\u2019s obviously early to have much granularity. So, where we have less visibility is internationally and maybe you can just give us some color there on what you\u2019re hearing with your conversations, with your customers around the world as far as the spending outlook for 2016 both land and offshore?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah, we don\u2019t have a lot of granularity Angie; it\u2019s still just kind of broad-based statements. Most of our customers haven\u2019t completed or just barely started our budgeting process for 2016. But the general feedback is very consistent. And that is, they expect, the vast of them that spend will be lower. So I can\u2019t give you granularity of geography or land and offshore. I would say though that the part of that rule that is still very, very resilient is obviously the GCC countries in the Middle East. So I\u2019m not expecting anything significant there in terms of lower investments. But broad-based pretty much everywhere else. There are significant challenges and we expect 2016 budgets to be below 2015.","Angie Sedita","Okay, okay, that\u2019s helpful. And if you -- you think about the U.S. and obviously it\u2019s a smaller market for you. But as you think about the U.S. and you\u2019ve said on a number of occasions that the pricing is unsustainably low. And as we all know that many of these smaller companies are free cash flow negative. I mean how do you think this plays out in 2016 going into 2017, could even a modest increase in activity in oil prices led to even modest improvements in pricing or how do you think this plays out, any thoughts?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah. I\u2019m not very optimistic on any turnaround in service and product pricing for oilfield services in North America land. I think, yes, many of the small companies or most of the small companies are free cash flow negative. They are under significant financial stress and maybe some of them will go bankrupt in the coming quarters or in the coming year. But there is still massive overcapacity and even these small companies that go bankrupt will likely be picked up other investors and their assets will be returned back into the market. So, I think the overcapacity is going to be with industry for quite a considerable amount of time. So I don\u2019t expect any real improvement in service and product pricing in the coming year in North America land.","Angie Sedita","All right, great. Thanks I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.","Bill Herbert","Wondering if we can talk about a little bit about the flexibility of the U.S. upstream value chain here as we\u2019re getting deeper into this downturn. And I mean the supposition has been and perhaps continues to be the -- once the recovery narrative is embraced by the industry that the industry can respond quickly and assertively to an increase in spending and activity. Do we still think that\u2019s the case given the duress of the industry and the fact that many are not only cutting into fat and muscle but now bone.","Paal Kibsgaard","So I think the industry is -- so I think the market is probably overestimating how quickly the industry can respond whether it\u2019s in North America or internationally. I think the fact that now four quarters into very low oil prices, the financial strength of many of our customers has significantly weakened and their appetite to invest is also a bit down. Any I think \u2013 any improvement in oil prices, I think will be to initially \u2013 is going to go towards the strength in the balance sheet and then the oil companies will likely assess how sustainable are these increases in oil prices before they start investing. ","So there is a delay, I believe, between an improvement in oil prices and the decision to increase budgets. And there is going to be a further delay between increasing budgets and realizing that into higher oil field activity. And then there is going to be a delay in between higher oil activity and higher production. So I think there \u2013 the market is underestimating how long this period is going to take and just the fact that the industry is again looking to reduce investments when we have this significant pending supply impact coming. This shows that I think we are \u2013 we even have increasing chance of a potential spike in oil prices if investments aren\u2019t increased in time. ","Bill Herbert ","Okay. And then secondly, so given the duress that you\u2019re processing here for the next several quarters, notwithstanding the fact your decrementals in Q3 were still very laudable, they trended higher. And I\u2019m just curious as to whether we see accelerating decrementals over the next quarters or do they stabilize or what\u2019s your view with regards to the roadmap on that front?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, in terms of our decrementals, we are working flat out to continue to manage them at our own levels that you\u2019ve seen so far this year. So we are not giving up on that, we have continuous efforts both in reducing cost and capacity as well as creating more leverage to offset pricing from our transformation. So we are going to continue to work very hard at delivering continuously very strong decrementals. We see that that\u2019s very important to sort of maintain our financial strength and also to help us generate the strong free cash flow that you\u2019ve seen so far this year. ","Bill Herbert","Okay, thank you. ","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the line of Jim Crandell at Cowen.","Jim Crandell","Good morning. Paal, the \u2013 based on maybe a more limited sample size, we seem to see a number of companies quarrelling for 20% to 30% reductions in their CapEx for 2016. Is that a range that you think is reasonable at this point? ","Paal Kibsgaard","I think, full year 2016 \u2013 for full year 2016, that sounds like a high number. At this stage, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be as much as that, no. ","Jim Crandell","And based on your conversations with the \u2013 with managements of some of the NOCs, would you think that the NOCs in Latin America, West Africa and Asia would be still one of the weakest points in the market. I noticed that Angola is cutting spending by 50% next year, and do you think that\u2019s going to be indicative of some of the NOCs in those regions?","Simon Ayat","Well, that number again I think is high, but I think the fact that this customer group has cut significantly this year and would likely go down potentially further next year, I think is a reasonable assumption. But again, my commentary on 2016 is based on very high level discussions and I don\u2019t have details of what budgets and what numbers are going to be. Other than that, it seems to be consensus that overall spend will be down. I think your 20% to 30% is very high. It\u2019s likely to be less than that, but still I expect it to be down. ","Jim Crandell","And how would you \u2013 in a declining market, how do you think that that affects the market share of integrated services for Schlumberger?","Paal Kibsgaard","I don\u2019t think it has a direct impact on anything in terms of up or down. There continues to be a broad range of integration type of opportunities. We are pursuing order, but it is all the way from bundle services from a few of our product lines all the way up to full turnkey lump sum contracts as well as SPM opportunities. So nothing dramatic in terms of shift of integration opportunities. It continues to be a key part of what they offer and there is a generally growing appetite from all customer groups to engage in those type of contracts. ","Jim Crandell","Good. Okay, thank you. ","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the line of Bill Sanchez at Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Bill Sanchez","Thanks. Good morning, Paal. ","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning. ","Bill Sanchez","Paal, I want to try to understand a bit more from you the magnitude of the pricing declines internationally that you\u2019re seeing and what the duration from here is going to be and I guess specifically kind of where are we now or where are you I should say in working through all of your contract renegotiations with your customers?","Paal Kibsgaard","I can\u2019t give you a number, Bill, on this, other than, I think, it\u2019s clear that the pricing impact internationally all the way, it is significant to our operations, it is still significantly lower than what we\u2019ve seen in North America and North America land. I would say that round one of the pricing discussion is complete. There might be more coming in the coming quarters and I think as long as oil prices are down, and the outlook is still relatively somber, then there is a constant pressure on pricing internationally as well as in North America land.","So, we continue to work through that. We bid competitively on the tenders that are out there, customers that are looking to renegotiate, we engage in those discussions and obviously, we\u2019re trying to minimize and protect how we -- what we concede in these type of discussions, but that\u2019s a call we make in this situation around what market share we are looking at, what kind of terms and conditions we can get, so some of the things and how we look at the overall business that we run. This is a normal part of business. When there is overcapacity, there is pressure on pricing, and that\u2019s part of what we do for a living to manage that.","Bill Sanchez","Do past renegotiations that you\u2019ve, for the like of, kind of settled with your customers, do those get reopened here as we go into 2016 or these are just incremental discussions that you\u2019re still having on contracts that really haven\u2019t been negotiated at this point or renegotiated at this point?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think it\u2019s a mix of all of it that I think you see it in North America land and you see at international. Overcapacity, there is a continuous pricing discussion until we hit the bottom of the market and then it stabilizes and then we look upwards from there. So there is a mix of renegotiations of contracts already discussed and some of them, which have not been changed already. So there is a combination of all of that.","Bill Sanchez","Okay. Simon, a follow-up for you or a question for you, can you give us an idea of when the share repurchase blackout period will begin for you?","Simon Ayat","Okay. So as I mentioned in my remarks, once we supplied the S4 and it is accepted, there will be a blackout period. I am expecting it to be about four to five weeks and could start maybe early November.","Bill Sanchez","Okay. And I guess we would expect repurchases to take place up until that point?","Simon Ayat","Yeah. Now, I like to take this opportunity just to remind you that first, we are issuing a large number of shares and the number of shares that will be issued, it\u2019s going to take place by our US based subsidiary. You\u2019re going to see a large movement in the capital structure of Schlumberger between our US subsidiary and the parent company. In other words, the US subsidiary will be the one acquiring Cameron and as a result, it\u2019s going to acquire the shares from the parent company. ","So you\u2019re going to see eventually when we close the transaction of Cameron, a large swing in the capital structure between the US based subsidiary, our parent company because of the structure of the acquisition and this would require the US subsidiary as I said to acquire shares from the parent company. So, there will be a large movement of cash from the US based subsidiary into the parent company. But when times will come, we\u2019ll explain it to you in more details and how it\u2019s going to work out.","Bill Sanchez","Great. I appreciate the time. I\u2019ll turn it back.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the line of David Anderson of Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Anderson","Thanks. Paul, I was hoping you could expand a bit more on what you see on the exploration front. In the commentary, you noted Gulf of Mexico continue to transition. Now, West Africa is starting to roll those exploration programs. And what\u2019s the mindset of your customers at this point of where that fits in the portfolio, you talked about -- the first and foremost about the balance sheet is obviously about dividend, but is it just about getting development costs down first and this exploration is kind of pushed out, well, how does that kind of fit in terms of your vision for the next couple of years?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah. I think what you\u2019re saying is correct. The focus on driving cost down is on development and exploration is basically eliminated. That\u2019s how I think many customers look at it. There are significant cuts in exploration activity and they continue both for seismic and for drilling. The Q3 exploration rig count was down about 25% year-over-year and the seismic spend was also down in excess of 30% and that\u2019s following a pretty low year in 2014 as well. So it is very challenging for exploration activity for us, but again the impact of this is still fully absorbed in our results which are still reasonably good. So, yes, in summary, our customers are more or less cutting completely exploration and focusing a lot more in driving further cost out of the development.","David Anderson","And on that side, on the development, as you integrate OneSubsea into Schlumberger, this will be a pretty big opportunity to pull on the rest of Schlumberger to help bring down development cost. If I think about you leaning on your reservoir expertise and well design capabilities, how receptive have customers been so far to Schlumberger taking a greater role in that offshore development. It would seem to be as a pretty big mindset change for your customers. I mean, is that happening? Do you feel confident of that? Do you think projects can actually move ahead in \u201916 because of that or is that a little too optimistic in terms of the timing? ","Paal Kibsgaard","It might be slightly optimistic on the timing, but I think \u2013 so first of all, many of the things that you mention in terms of bringing together these capabilities of Schlumberger and OneSubsea is already happening, but obviously we can accelerate and have an even further impact on this as we close the transaction and take full management of OneSubsea, but I am very pleased with the progress that OneSubsea has made and the close working relationship we\u2019ve had OneSubsea from the Schlumberger side. But I think over time and maybe not already in 2016, there is significant cost reduction potential in the \u2013 for the deepwater, I think both, when it comes to the well cost as well as for the overall infrastructure.","I think we can simplify, we can standardize, we can engineer costs out of the system and what that will allow, if you can, for instance, reduce the well cost by, say, 30%, you can potentially drill four wells for the price of three, which again will help you increase production and recovery from the deepwater fields which obviously will help lower cost of barrel and then improve the economics. So I think we are in very, very early innings in terms of driving down costs for deepwater, both production and then the drilling part of it. And I think what we are doing now with the Cameron acquisition is going to address both those dimensions.","David Anderson","Great. Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thanks.","Operator","We will go next to the line of Scott Gruber at Citi.","Scott Gruber","Good morning.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning. ","Scott Gruber","Turning back to international decrementals, you guys continue to post very impressive figures during this down cycle, but at what rate of upstream spending decline abroad with this 25%, 30% decrementals be at risk of rising? I know there is not a lot of clarity on exactly how spending will turn out next year, but spending is down 15%, would you start to become concerned or would it take a steeper drop to really threaten those decrementals?","Simon Ayat","You are talking about 2016 spending.","Scott Gruber","Correct.","Simon Ayat","Well, we have delivered I think very strong financial performance in the international market now for a number of years. In 2014, we generated 69% incrementals on quite limited revenue growth and so far 23% decrementals on 18% drop in revenue this year. So our performance so far this year is not a fluke, we have been very good at managing our international business. So I am expecting that even with still further headwinds in terms of top line in 2016, we should be able to continue to hold the decrementals at a very respectable level, whether they are going to be at 23% or slightly higher, it will be difficult to say. But in terms of offsetting activity reductions through cost cutting, I think we have proven that we can do that. And beyond that it is how much leverage we can generate from the transformation to offset pricing. So both of those are \u2013 we are very active on trying to delivery both of those type of results. And we are going to go very hard at it for 2016 to continue to delivery strong decrementals internationally.","Scott Gruber","Got it. And then you already touched on the need for customers to repair their balance sheets which will likely contribute to the delay in activity recovery. Is there also an oil price threshold that you have in mind that need to be achieved before your customers start to increase CapEx? I mean, do we need to see $65 Brent or $70 Brent. At what level do you think customers are comfortable expanding their budgets even if there is some delay?","Paal Kibsgaard","I don\u2019t have a specific oil price number in mind. I think it\u2019s going to be much more functional how sustainable our customers see the increases in oil prices to be. I think it\u2019s more about having a stable basis for increasing investments before they go ahead and do it right. I still that they are -- that there is going to be conservatism based on the very tough four quarters that the industry has gone through at this stage. And that\u2019s why again we are basically saying that there is going to be a lag between higher oil prices and investments, and even a tag between our investments and realizable oil selectivity.","Operator","Anything further Mr. Gruber?","Scott Gruber","Well nope, that\u2019s it, got it. Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the line of Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim.","Michael LaMotte","If I could follow-up just on transformation quickly and ask you to expand upon two areas in particular. First you\u2019re comments on the reorganization of the manufacturing operations and how long that is expected to take and if you could quantify the gross margin benefit perhaps of that effort. And then secondly, in the press release, this is the first time we\u2019ve seen the references to the multiskilling. So if you could give us an update in terms of where we are in the progress of that effort as well?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah. On the transformation around the global manufacturing and distribution, the charge we\u2019re taking is for consolidating facilities, moving much more towards campuses and clusters and also the introduction of some new automation manufacturing type of technology. Similarly, we\u2019re also looking to consolidate how we do global distribution going more from a global and local set up to a much more regional setup in terms of how we manage that. So the process of getting it done, we are -- we have already embarked on. And there are some charges associated with it that we will take in the fourth quarter and we will continue implementing that program in 2016 and 2017. So, I\u2019m not going to be able to give you a specific impact on margins and what this is going to generate for us, although that we\u2019re -- we are very excited about doing this. It\u2019s going to modernize a core part of the company and its going to make us even more competitive in the international market.","Now in terms of multiskilling, this is part of how we\u2019re continuing to drive people productivity. There is many other aspects of what we do there, we have remote operations as another key part of this as well, where we can centralize much more of our expertise and have them oversee more jobs centrally rather than being at the well side as well. So, all of these elements are key part of the transformation program and we are still not at the halfway point of rolling this out globally and for it to have the full impact on our operations on our results. So there is still a lot of runway left in both the multiskilling, the remote operations and what we\u2019re going to do on manufacturing and distribution as well as all the other parts of the transformation. So we\u2019re excited about it and there is a strong pull from the entire organization on this and we continue to work hard on implementing it.","Michael LaMotte","Great, thank you. And if I could ask a follow-up quickly to Simon. Would you be perhaps, I noticed debt came down; total debt came down in the third quarter from the second quarter. During the blackout would you be using free cash flow to further pay down debt or can we just assume that that cash builds on the balance sheet in that interim?","Simon Ayat","So, good question Michael. Some of the -- most of our debt actually is a fixed debt. So we do have certain percentage which is more reflective of commercial paper, et cetera, this will go down. But as I said earlier and I like to repeat this that you\u2019re going to see a large movement in our capital structure. And perhaps eventually, we will have a little bit more debt associated with the transaction coming from our North America or our U.S.-based subsidiary. And this to acquire the shares from the parent company. So you\u2019re going to see a different type of movement and eventually there will be larger debt that we will have in the U.S. subsidiary in order to acquire the shares.","Michael LaMotte","Post close?","Simon Ayat","In the meantime, during the blackout period, as you highlighted it would reflect into a reduction in the debt, which is the current debt that is reflected in the simple [ph] program that we issue on daily basis.","Michael LaMotte","Great, thanks Simon. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the line Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo Securities. ","Jud Bailey","Thanks, good morning. Paal, I ask you about a couple of different markets outside of North America, it seems like Latin America continues to trend some of the more \u2013 one of the more difficult international markets. Could you maybe comment on Mexico and also, particularly on Brazil given all the issues going on the Petrobras and some of the contract renegotiations and how you\u2019re thinking about that market and how it may impact you in 2016? ","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah, both markets, as you point out, both Mexico and Brazil have been very challenging this year. Mexico, even more than Brazil, I would say. So there has been significant budget reductions and they have continued throughout the year. Like I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our Q3 revenues now stands at an eight-year low, which is quite remarkable for a sizable market as Mexico is for us. ","So in terms of next year, it\u2019s still very early for both of these countries, Mexico and Brazil, but I think it\u2019s going to be challenging as we enter into 2016. Though, I don\u2019t have a lot of details of it yet, but no positive signs either from Pemex or from Petrobras at this stage. ","Jud Bailey","Okay. Thank you. And I\u2019ll \u2013 my follow-up is on \u2013 just to circle back on international pricing, understanding you\u2019re kind of done with Round 1, but as you kind of look at the market today, is pricing getting \u2013 is it starting to decline worse than it did earlier in the year or is there any sign of it stabilizing or do you get the sense that the pricing is slipping even more? And are there any particular markets internationally, where you are seeing more pricing pressure than others? ","Paal Kibsgaard","No, it is not, I\u2019d say slipping further, it\u2019s just \u2013 there is a continuing pricing pressure in this part of a cycle. It\u2019s quite normal. There is nothing special about it. And as long as the outlook is negative, then there will be continued pricing pressure. Every bit that is out, there is even increased competition to get it and that creates the downward pricing pressure. So nothing exceptional. I don\u2019t see it accelerating. Other than that is not going way, and we will just continue to manage it and navigate it the way we have been doing so far in the downturn. ","Jud Bailey","Great, thank you. ","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","And the last question will come from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital.","Kurt Hallead","Hey, good morning. ","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning, Kurt. ","Kurt Hallead","So just I\u2019m curious Paal, when you think about the \u2013 going back to the M&A dynamic, the Eurasia deal kind of fell through, that\u2019s \u2013 is that something that still could be \u2013 come back on the table at some point going forward? And when you think more broadly about M&A, is the Schlumberger interest right now more in some geographic opportunities or is it in some product specific areas generally speaking?","Paal Kibsgaard","Just to say the Eurasia deal first of all, obviously we were disappointed that we couldn\u2019t get it closed within the several extensions of the timeline that we agreed with Eurasia. But that deal is now closed for us. So I don\u2019t really have any more comments on that. ","In terms of other M&A, we continue to be opportunistic. I can\u2019t go into details of what that will entail or what we may or may not do. Other than that, we have a broad view of the entire market and what opportunities are there, what they are interested in. And we continue to evaluate companies on a monthly basis and if there is a willing seller and a good price, then we might be able to do something more, but it\u2019s still too early to say. So I can\u2019t promise anything or I can\u2019t make any further comments on what may happen. Other than that, we continue to be active in assessing the market and look for opportunities to further extend and strengthen our portfolio and we keep generating the cash to allow us to do that. ","Kurt Hallead","Okay. That\u2019s great. I\u2019ll keep it there, and we\u2019re seeing a little bit. ","Paal Kibsgaard","Very good.","Paal Kibsgaard","All right, so before we close this morning, I would like to summarize the three most important points we have discussed. First, while the business environment clearly got worsened in third quarter, our focus on cost management and transformation has enabled us to deliver strong financial performance and generate significant liquidity, which is a clear competitive edge in this part of the cycle. ","Second, our forward visibility has again been reduced and we will consequently revert back to managing the company quarter-by-quarter. This means a further round of capacity and overhead reductions in the fourth quarter as we adjust resources to a lower activity outlook. At the same time, we will continue to accelerate our transformation program with the next step being a significant restructuring of our global manufacturing and distribution network, which will further modernize the core part of our company.","And third, our outlook for the oil market remains unchanged with a continuing tightening of the supply and demand balance as the dramatic cost in E&P investments start to take full effect, ultimately leading to an increase in oil prices. Given the conservative view our customers are taking on 2016 investment levels and the general state of the industry, following a year of low oil prices, we see an increasing likelihood of a timing gap between higher oil prices and a subsequent increase in E&P investment and oilfield activity. ","In this environment, we continue to proactively manage our business, to preserve our financial strength into 2016, which will allow us to better navigate the market uncertainty and to respond faster to new business opportunities and ultimately, higher activity.

Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.","Simon Farrant","Thank you, Greg. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited fourth quarter and full quarter 2014 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston where the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting took place yesterday. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.","However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information is included in the earnings press release on our website. We welcome your comments after the prepared segments.","I will now turn the call over to Simon.","Simon Ayat","Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges and credits was $1.50. This represents an increase of $0.01 sequentially and is $0.15 higher when compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter we recorded $1.8 billion of pretax charges. These charges are primarily related to actions we have taken to meet the challenges of the current market conditions.","The $806 million of charges relating to the restructuring of the WesternGeco seismic fleet are as we announced last month. We recorded $296 million of severance cost associated with the headcount reduction of approximately 9,000. This reduction which will largely be completed by the end of the first quarter will bring our headcount more in line with the currently anticipated activity levels.","In Venezuela effective December 31, 2014, we changed the exchange rate we applied to our bolivar denominated transactions from 6.3 to 50 bolivar per dollar, which is in line with the SICAD II exchange rate resulting in a $472 million charge.","We believe that this rate now best represents the economics of our business activity in Venezuela. Going forward, this charge will reduce the US dollar amount of local currency denominated revenues and expenses. Had we applied this exchange rate throughout all of 2014, it would have reduced our full year EPS by approximately $0.08.","The last item relates to $199 million write-down of unconventional integrated project in the Eagle Ford as the result of the decline in oil prices.","Fourth quarter revenue of $12.6 billion was flat sequentially. This reflected approximately $260 million of yearend software product and multi-client sales which were weaker than what we typically experienced in the fourth quarter.","Pretax operating income of $2.8 billion decreased 1% sequentially while the pretax operating margins decreased by just 19 basis points to 22%. This level of margin is consistent with the same period last year.","Sequential revenue and pretax margin highlights by product group were as follows. Fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization Group revenue of $3.1 billion decreased 3% sequentially while margins increased by 95 basis points to 30.9%. The revenue decrease was largely attributable to the seasonal drop in marine seismic activity while wireline experienced declines in Russia due to the seasonality and the weakening of the ruble. These decreases were partially offset by yearend multi-client and software sales. The margin increase reflected a more favorable revenue mix as a result of the yearend sales. ","Drilling Group fourth quarter revenue of $4.7 billion decreased 3% sequentially while margins declined by 94 basis points to 20.7%. These decreases were primarily driven by unfavorable currency effects and activities declines in Russia that impacted the drilling and measurement and M-I SWACO as well as lower IPM activity in Mexico.","Fourth quarter Production Group revenue of just under $5 billion increased 5% sequentially on higher well services activity in both Western Canada and US land. Year end sales of Completions and Artificial Lift Products also contributed to the increase. Pretax margins were essentially flat at 18.3%.","Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 21.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 22.1% in the previous quarter. Net debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $5.4 billion representing an improvement of $458 million as compared to the end of Q3.","We spent $1.1 billion on our stock buyback program during Q4. This represented 12.1 million shares at an average price of $90.22. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.2 billion of CapEx and an improvement in working capital of almost $1 billion.","From a cash flow perspective we generated $11.2 billion of cash flow from operations during all of 2014. During this same period we generated a free cash flow of $6.2 billion. This represents $700 million increase over 2013 and means that we converted 84% of our 2014 earnings excluding charges and credits into free cash flow.","This strong cash generation has allowed us to continue to invest in growth opportunities which we did by completing various acquisitions and investing $4 billion in CapEx, $1.1 billion in multiclients and SPM projects while at the same time returning $6.6 billion of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases.","During the full year 2014, we repurchased 47.5 million shares at an average price of $98.38 for a total of $4.7 billion while paying out almost $2 billion in dividends.","Yesterday our board of directors approved a 25% increase in our annual dividend to $2 per share. This is now the fifth consecutive year that we have increased our dividend and it results in doubling over the five-year period.","This new level of dividend reflects our confidence and our ability to continue to generate superior cash flows and return excess cash to our shareholders even in the face of market challenges. As it relates to 2015, our strong balance sheet will continue -- will also allow us to be opportunistic in terms of taking advantage of market conditions to make strategic acquisitions and investment.","CapEx excluding multiclient and SPM investment is expected to be approximately $3 billion in 2015. We expect the ETR for the full year 2015 to be in the low to mid 20s. However this can rally on a quarterly basis depending on the geographical mix of earnings.","And now, I turn the conference over to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter we continued our strong financial performance driven by record activity in North America and in the Middle East and Asia. In other international areas, Latin America revenues improved slightly on higher activity in Venezuela and Columbia while Europe, CIS and Africa fell as the ruble weakened and the seasonal decline activity started in Russia.","Europe, CIS and Africa declined further from the downward trend in oil prices which curtailed customer activity and reduced rig count in the North Sea and parts of West Africa.","Overall fourth quarter revenue was flat with the previous quarter but grew 6% year-on-year. Pretax operating income decreased 1% sequentially and grew 7% year-on-year while pretax operating margins were essentially flat slipping 19 basis points sequentially but rising 13 basis points year-on-year.","This performance ended the year in which Schlumberger revenue climbed to a new high in spite of significant head winds including activity challenges in a number of geo markets, geopolitical unrest in Libya and Iraq, international sanctions in Russia and reducing customer spend.","Still our global footprint, broad business portfolio, and strong execution capabilities provided the required resilience to outperform even in this environment.","Looking at our corporate financial performance, we generated more than $3.4 billion in free cash flow in the fourth quarter bringing the full year total to more than $6.2 billion. This represents an increase of 13% over 2013 and a conversion of 84% of the full year's earnings into free cash flow.","During the quarter we continued our active stock buyback program buying back $1.1 billion in stock to keep us on track to complete the $10 billion program within the stated two and a half year period. ","As a further demonstration of the confidence we have in our continuing ability to generate free cash flow, the board of directors just approved that 25 increase in our quarterly dividend which means that we have doubled our dividend payment over the past five years.","By geography, our North American results set the new record for the area as revenue grew 2% sequentially. Line activity improved in spite of tough sequential recount as new technology introductions and operational efficiencies drove performance.","___ drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico returned to normal, and grew by 12% sequentially following the impact of loop currents in the third quarter. While multiclient seismic sales also improved although ending up significantly down compared to the same quarter last year.","Sequential revenue gains were led by the production group on higher pressure pumping activity on land in both the US and Canada and further supported by very strong uptake of the BroadBand family of stimulation technologies that are growing at four times the rate of highway at the same stage of it's introduction.","North America margins increased by a further 24 basis points in Q4 to reach 19.6% driven by stronger activity and new technology uptake, solid execution and further supply chain cost improvements.","Lower oil prices have already created pricing pressure on land for hydraulic fracturing and drilling services and we are actively working with our customers in all basins to help lower their overall drilling and completion costs.","In addition to general typing discussions, our customer interactions are focused on how we can better work together and how we can create savings from new technologies and workflows as well as from improved operational planning and efficiency.","Looking forward in North America we see a relatively flat first quarter for offshore activity in the Gulf of Mexico as well as solid activity in Canada. However the dramatic fallen oil prices has already led to a reduction of around 400 rigs in US land compared to the October peak and we expect the trend of activity reductions and pricing pressure to continue in the first quarter.","In our international business, strength in the Middle East and Asia and solid performance in Latin America was offset by significant revenue reductions in Europe, CIS and Africa. As a result, revenue slipped 1% sequentially but improved 1% year-on-year while pretax operating income decreased 2% sequentially but grew 4% year-on-year.","Full year performance in the international market was strong in spite of E&P CapEx spend remaining flat with 2013. Year-on-year revenue grew by 4%, operating income by 12% with incremental margins of 69%. ","International margins which ended the year at 24% grew 168 basis points versus 2013 and we generated more than 70% of our global operating income in the international market in the past year.","The significant drop in oil prices have put pressure on our customers to further reduce their cost of barrel and we are actively engaged with most of them to find ways to generate their required cost savings while maintaining a very strong focus on the quality and integrity on the products and services we provide.","Within the international areas, performance was led by the Middle East and Asia where sequential revenue grew by 4% and pretax operating margins increased by 71 basis points to 28.3% driven by activity growth in the Middle East while activity in Asia was largely unchanged.","Year-on-year revenue increased 6% and margins grew by 2013 basis points. In the Middle East region, activity reached a new record in Saudi Arabia led by growth from a number of key projects and we expect to see continued strong levels of both rig-related and rig-less activity in the coming years.","Kuwait was also strong on land seismic activity and yearend product and software sales while Oman continued to be driven by wireline services and hydraulic fracturing work. Activity was again higher in the United Arab Emirates particularly for well construction technologies both offshore and on the island drilling project.","In Iraq, activity was steady in the north as an improved security environment had allowed operations to slowly resume. However the overall activity level still remained significantly below pre-conflict levels. In the south, we saw modest activity improvements although new project start-ups continued to be delayed.","Southeast Asia remained flat through the third quarter as strength in shale gas development on land in china offset modest activity declines in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam.","China was also boosted by increased product sales during the fourth quarter and strong offshore activity in Bohai Bay. In Malaysia, work has begun in the new well construction project on the Bokor field where we have now been conducting integrated project and production management operations for more than 10 years.","This is another example of the value that long-term relationships bring to integrated operations.","In Latin America, revenue improved 1% sequentially while pretax operating margins fell 102 basis points to 20.9% as growth in Columbia and Venezuela was offset by weakness in Mexico and delayed in Argentina and Brazil. Year-on-year revenue grew by 3% while pretax operating margin slipped by 31 basis points. In Venezuela growth was driven by new technology and work flow deployment for PDVSA as well as increased activity in the far half through a series on new project startups.","In Mexico, revenue decreased significantly on a combination of customer budget constraints and seasonal weather effect impacting offshore activity. The lower customer spent mainly impacted land development activity although some exploration work was also delayed. Elsewhere in the area activity in Brazil was solid on land but offshore work was lower and IOC projects were completed and drilling delays were experienced on existing project. In Argentina growth slowed in the fourth quarter although activity from conventional resources grew and the highway technology continuing to penetrate the market.","In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue fell by 7% sequentially with margin declining by 112 basis points to 22.3%. Compared to the same quarter last year, Europe, CIS and Africa revenue fell by 5% while margin slipped by 21 basis points. In Russia, weakness in the ruble and the onset of winter weather led to the lower result.","The North Sea activity also declined on lower rig count in both Norway and the UK as customers reduced activity in response to lower oil prices. In other parts of Europe, Africa and CIS area, activity was stronger in North Africa with increasing activity for unconventional resources in Algeria and Tunisia. This was partially offset by very weak activity in Libya where we now have successfully restructured our operations in line with the lower activity.","In Angola, activity decreased following the peak in explorations seen in the third quarter while elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa activity was strong in Congo and we also secured additional growth in Chad and Gabon. Before leaving the Europe, CIS and Africa area, I would also like to mention that we were awarded a full-year contract for drilling and well services by Statoil for the UK Mariner development east of Shetland. Mariner is one of the largest project development on the UK continental shelf in the last 10 years and their 22 distinct services that Schlumberger will provide offer considerable opportunities for integration in this unique project.","In terms of the outlook for the international market, as part of the Middle East and partial Latin America, we do expect a reduction in spend levels for all customer groups in the coming year although we believe that the activity and pricing impact will be less than what is projected in North America land. It is also worthwhile to keep in mind that E&P spend in the international market was already flat in 2014 with a corresponding drop in discovered reserves and in oil production capacity. So a further reduction in spend levels in 2015 will likely accelerate these trends.","Turning to the overall macro outlook for 2015, GDP growth rate softened somewhat in the fourth quarter but that 3% growth is still projected to be higher than 2014 confirming that the global recovery remains intact and as a result, demand for oil is again expected to increase by around 1 million barrels per day in 2016.","Looking at the supply side, the growth in global oil production capacity of around 1 million barrels per day over the past year matches the growth in demand. So the overall oil market is still relatively well balanced from a capacity standpoint.","The dramatic fall in oil prices is instead a result of higher marketed supply in the second half of 2014 from North America and also from OPEC who have shifted focus from protecting oil prices to protecting oil prices to protecting market share. In response to the falling oil prices, the industry is currently in the process of significantly reducing E&P investments which will lead to a reduction in supply as declining rates impact current production capacity and lower exploration and development activity delay supply additions.","In a scenario of continuing economic growth and increasing demand for oil, the lower E&P investment levels will lead to a tightening of the oil market with the first indication being the reduced production capacity in the international markets in 2014 following a year of flat E&P investment. In this uncertain environment, we continue to focus on what we can control and we have already taken significant steps to restructure and right size our business to match the reduced E&P investment level.","We are further convinced that performance must now be driven by and accelerated change in the way we work through our transformation program. The delivery of new technology that improves the performance of our customer's reservoirs, the increases in efficiency and reliability that reduced overall timing, development and production costs and the opportunities for growth and greater integration bring are all significant drivers of our own and our customers' performance.","The technical performance targets of our transformation program is independent of the macro environment and we are in 2015 actually looking to further accelerate the implementation of the program. In terms of technology, we still expect new technology sales at premium pricing to contribute more than 25% of our revenue while we also target integration related activity where we had unique capabilities to exceed 30% of our total activity.","In terms of reliability and efficiency we are in 2015 aiming to make further progress towards our targets of a 10-fold reduction in non-productive time and doubling in asset utilization at 20% increase in workforce productivity and 10% lowering of support costs which will all help to significantly lower our operating costs.","Part of our transformation program requires us to work differently with our customers in order to fully realize the value for both them and for us. Given the current business environment, we have engaged with many of them in recent months to drive forward these changes with very positive response.","Still given the level of the oil price and the industry wide focus on reducing E&P investments, we clearly have a challenging year in front of us. In this environment we have our entire organization fully focused on continuously engage in our customers to understand any changes to their plan, retailer resources through activity in line with the targets and playbooks we have established and to manage commercial discussions according to the priorities we have put in place for each of the over 80 countries where we operate.","Beyond our strong execution focus, we also see the coming year as flushed with opportunities for us which we intend to fully capitalize on as we look to further strengthen the company going forward. With our wide geographical footprint, extensive business portfolio, and clear financial strength, we remain confident in our ability to outperform in any part of the cycle including the current market condition.","Thank you. We will now open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ole Slorer","Yes, thanks a lot and thanks for your insights there Paal. I wondered whether you could start with the macro here. I wondered whether you could help us understand your slight change in language from the third quarter. You highlighted both in the third quarter release and the fourth quarter release that negativity, the peer revisions, I mean, that's consistent. But on the supply side you talked in the third quarter about pipe capacity and now you are talking about increase in supply. I just wondered whether you could just elaborate a little bit and help us understand the difference in the magnitude.","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay. So if you look at the high level macro view that we have, nothing has really changed from what we said on the Q3 call. So looking at GDP at 3% we are still looking at solid growth overall in 2015 and oil demand is also going to be up. So as we said in Q3 the issue is really on the supply side where I think it's very important that we separate the three in global production capacity and marketed supply. So if you look at the global production capacity in 2014, it grew by about 1 million barrels a day which is equal to the growth in demand. So the significant drop in oil prices is not driven by this over capacity but rather by the higher marketed supply which is coming from North America and from OPEC.","So we believe that the supply side is currently going through a significant change where the key local producers have shifted focus from protecting price to now protect market share, and the consequence of this is that at least for a period of time, this is going to make the high cost producers become the new swing producers where the activity is going to be even more driven by the variations in oil price and the economics of their project. And the tool used to drive this change to the supply side is the lower oil price which is what we are seeing now.","So the main new element from the Q3 call is that OPEC decided not to cut production so the reduction in the marketed supply will have to come from lower E&P investments and that is really the only offtake to our macro view.","Ole Slorer","And my second follow up would be exactly on that. You highlight this time around in your release that the two effect of lower CapEx increased declined curves from existing fields and delays in new field start-ups. So I wonder whether you could talk a little bit at a high level at what point do you see the impact of this will change market psychology on the direction of incremental capacity versus a direction of incremental demand assuming demand plays out in line with your view there.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, if we assume that oil demand is going to be up by 1 million barrels, if we don't take lower investments and already reduce their capacity, the market is already heading towards a tightening. I think that's very clear. Now we don't expect the oil prices to improve significantly until there are signs of weakening supply, and the weakening supply will either first come from North America or from international. I think the signs we need to look at are different from the two regions. Given the strong growth momentum in North America I think what the market will be looking for here is the slowing year-over-year growth while given the flat investment levels in international market in 2014, capacity already reduced in 2014. So here I think we are looking for a further reduction in absolute supply. So I think these are the two main signals to look for.","Ole Slorer","And then your guess again on timing?","Paal Kibsgaard","I am not going to guess at least not in public.","Ole Slorer","Okay, Paal, I will hand it back. Thank you very much.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Anderson","Good morning Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","David Anderson","I was just wondering, in light on your commentary around the supply response and you are talking about international and North America, there is clearly a pretty healthy debate out there about the economics of North America in unconventional. Just wondering with Schlumberger's expertise in reservoir, can you help us understand how you think about that marginal cost supplier and in particular how you see the trajectory of spending and activity levels in North America over the next several quarters?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well I think if you look at 2015 activity in North America and you look at the third party spend surveys, it indicates about 25%, 30% reduction. So it's clearly going to be a tough year going forward, right. As to the viability of the project I think there is still a broad range of operating costs in North America land. But I would say that as a general statement the shift in OPEC from protecting price to protecting share is raising some questions around the US shale going forward and I think the new oil price dynamic is clearly going to test the resilience of several North America land producers from their ability to get financing, their ability to continue to drive cost efficiency and reduced cost of barrel and also their ability to maintain production at current level. So I think most likely we are going to face the situation in North America land with lower activity, more focus on the lower cost production areas for a while. That's our view at this stage.","David Anderson","And then just kind of sticking still on North America in light of the headcount and CapEx reduction and keeping in mind that you are getting more capital efficient of the transformation. I just wonder if you could help us understand your strategy during this downturn to align your capacity with activity levels. Should we expect a similar strategy that Schlumberger employed in 2009 or can we expect it to be a little bit more focused on utilization this time around?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I am not going to go into the detail tactics and strategy we have on pricing and share. That's going to vary all depending on I would say the basin, the customer type and so forth. But I will say that the general rule that we have applied in recent years that below a certain contribution margin, we will rather stack the equipment than operate at the level that is unacceptable.","David Anderson","Okay, thank you Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","Bill Herbert","Thank you, good morning. Paal, so switching gears here a sec from North America to the international realm and recognizing that the early data internationally has not been as transparent as it has in North America given the litany of capital spending analysis for '15. But given where oil prices are today, certainly it seems that the indication points to a pretty hard landing in the international realm and while we share your view that the contraction internationally is going to be more benign than in North America, it's still going to be fairly consequential. So just as a starting point, is down 10% to 15% internationally within the realm of reason where we sit today?","Paal Kibsgaard","While to think to kind of venture out and even make full year statement at this stage I think it's too early. We have very significant lack of visibility. The way we are going about managing actually both North America and internationally, is we are looking quarter by quarter now. So we have taken actions to be in line with costs versus the activity that we foresee for Q1. And we will continue to stay very closely in touch with customers to look at plans going forward to make sure that we continue to tailor resources to the projected activity.","Now we are aware of the third party surveys and the 10% to 15% reduction in international spend for 2015 I think today is probably a reasonable starting point although I wouldn't confirm it from our side for the full year.","Bill Herbert","Okay. And then secondly kind of juxtaposing downturn as it were 2015 versus what prevailed in 2009, I mean clearly you are a different company coming into this downturn than you were in 2009 given the internal transformation focus. In light of that, do you think the decremental margins this time around are going to be better behaved anywhere in 2009 or basically about in line?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well I would be very disappointed if we don't see a significant improvement in our decremental margins in this downturn versus what we saw in 2009. The -- we've had a very, very strong focus on generating incremental margins in the past four, five years, and over the past quarter we have basically converted our strong and peer expectations on incremental into equally clear expectations internally on what good decrementals are. I am not going to give you what the number is but like I said I will be very disappointed if we don't do significantly better than in 2009.","Bill Herbert","Very good, thank you sir.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Michael LaMotte","Thanks. Good morning Paal. I am trying to hone in on how you're actually approaching 2015 and maybe take it from the perspective of the methods to the leadership of Schlumberger in terms of controlled business. You mentioned several things you can control, maintain the targets on the transformation program with the lack of visibility, maybe tighten up the reaction time from six months reviews to quarter-by-quarter. Is there anything else that we should be thinking about in terms of approaching the downturn of '15?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well I think you hit on several of the things. But if I was to just kind of repeat to clarify them, what we have passed to our senior management team in the quite frequent meetings we've had over the past quarter, there are really three high level things. Firstly, the increased importance of staying very, very close to our customers. First interactively support our efforts to reduce their cost levels but also to make sure that the -- we very clearly understand their plans and changes to their plans. That's the first one. The second one is what you will alluded to do that we stay focused on what we control. And that is to proactively adjust costs to activity levels, and factoring in the benefits from the transformation. And also having a clear plan on how we are going to navigate the commercial landscape in terms of activity and pricing discussions with our customers but also very importantly to continue to focus and deliver safe and high quality operations, which is essential to our performance but also to our customer's performance.","And the third one which we are also balancing into the total picture is to capture the opportunities that we see in the current environment and we see the current environment as being flushed with opportunities for us. First is to gain market share in light of our two main competitors looking to combine. Secondly to accelerate the transformation, our organization is now pulling very hard on it and we also see our customers being very open to adjust how we work with them and how we interact with them to gain some of the benefits. And then the third one is inorganic growth. We see lots of opportunities for this based on our strong cash flow and also very solid balance sheet.","So these are the high level messages that we have already passed to our management team and they are currently executing.","Michael LaMotte","That's very helpful. Thank you. If I can follow-up on your inorganic growth comment quickly, does the current environment change the process around acquisitions and the last few years they've been smaller, bolt-on has been used as a term to describe the strategy since Smith. Does the appetite for a larger deal change in this environment?","Paal Kibsgaard","No, I wouldn't see that. The current environment has changed the strategic directions that we were looking to pursue. It is more about when these opportunities arise. We have a clear view of where the company is heading and what we want to do from an M&A standpoint. We have been executing a number of these things in pervious years and as we go forward now, we would look at whether the other opportunities that we have in our list become accelerated opportunities in which case we will pursue them.","Michael LaMotte","Okay, thanks so much.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.","Angie Sedita","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Paal Kibsgaard","Morning.","Angie Sedita","Paal, so could you talk a little bit, I mean you have the 25% reduction in your CapEx and could you give us a little bit of high level color on that cut where the cuts are coming from and I recall that in 2009, you did reduce your CapEx tied to technology but based on your opening remarks, it sounds that that would not be case to cycle and then also how flexible are you on your CapEx outlook for 2015?","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay. Well like you say in the current full year CapEx estimate is 3 billion, but given the lack of visibility and the uncertainty, this is still subject to change. So I will also that part of the CapEx reduction is due to the efficiency gains that we are planning from the transformation. So you cannot directly translate the CapEx to a projected revenue for 2015 and I also don't think you can directly compare it to the CapEx reductions that we did in 2009.","I will also say that we have significant flexibility built into our manufacturing capabilities. We are, as I mentioned, targeting market share gains in particular in the international market. So if we need more CapEx, to serve these gains, we have the flexibility to increase CapEx during the year, and also we have the opportunity and flexibility to decrease CapEx further if the impact on the transformation is even beyond what we are targeting. ","Angie Sedita","All right. And then kind of an unrelated follow-up, I mean obviously your customers are coming to you and the international markets talking and looking at the contracts and where you can pull out cost out of the system, and you are seeing it in the US, how much success or have you begun conversations and where you can pull cost out of the system specifically in US frac. Is there other cost recovery opportunities besides proppants, truck, rail and what are you seeing along those lines?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well overall or in the US?","Angie Sedita","Both, actually.","Paal Kibsgaard","While I would -- our approach to these discussions with our customers and we are receiving invitations to engage in these discussions both international and in North America. I mean our approach is that we fully understand the need our customers have to reduce their overall costs. And we have engaged in a range of discussions where we are looking at volume discounts versus market share, further application and new technology, generally better planning and efficiency maybe less use of backup resources, better terms and conditions and it also involves general pricing discussions, right. So with the transformation, we have significant opportunity to drive costs of our system internally but some of these cost savings will also depend on our customers being open to work with us in different ways. And I would say there is a significant increase in that openness to start to realize these values and I think our discussions in general are focused on how we can create more value together, obviously in addition to general pricing discussions.","Angie Sedita","All right. And so -- I guess to add on to that, are you going back to your supply chain vendors for changes in cost reductions and proppants and other sources that you have in the US or internationally and are you able to pull cost out of your system besides the efficiency side?","Paal Kibsgaard","No, absolutely. And over the past three years or so, we have fully centralized our shared services and supply chain organization including global category management. So we are fully leveraging firstly our buying power and secondly I would say a highly capable supply chain organization to drive a similar type of discussion with our suppliers as to the discussions we have with our customers.","Angie Sedita","Thanks. I will turn it over.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James West from Evercore. Please go ahead.","James West","Hey, good morning Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","James West","I wanted to just touch on the transformation program again and kind of clarify a few things there. Obviously you are looking to speed up the transformation. I wanted to know if you could give us some sense of kind of how much more quickly you can go through this? And then secondarily, does the downturn, which I know we all don't like, nobody likes downturns, but does that not make the transformation easier to be in a downturn?","Paal Kibsgaard","In some ways it does. Because then you are performing quite well and you are busy taking on more work and growing to change to where you were both internally and in the interfaces, you have both the customers and suppliers. It's more difficult to drive change in that type of situation. When you have a shift in market conditions as you have now, we see even more interest internally and even more openness on the customer supply side to engage in doing things differently. So I would say, yes, the changing market condition provides us with more opportunity to accelerate so then the key is just how do we put resources on to this from a central management standpoint to have the various parts of the program staff and given the financial means to accelerate some of the investments that we are making to realize these gains.","James West","Okay. Great. And then I have a follow-up not on that but unrelated. You made a comment earlier about going after market share as a result of your two major competitors combining. Have you already seen customers come to you and have you already seen market share gains? I know it is early days but is it already happening?","Paal Kibsgaard","No I think it's a bit premature to say it's happening now. I mean the transaction is not closed yet. So I think as of now we are preparing for this. In discussions with our customers, the topic comes up, but I would say that this is more something that will take place if and when the transaction is closed.","James West","Okay. Got it. Thanks, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead","Hey, good morning Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Kurt Hallead","Just follow-up on James's question on the potential fallout from the merger. As you indicated there is nothing yet shaking loose necessarily and that will come post deal close. So you've indicated or you've emphasized at least in your prior commentary market share gains and with an emphasis on the international side. So I was wondering if you might be able to just give us a little bit of color on what you think may shake loose and how many basis points of market share gains could come out of this if not for Schlumberger specific, maybe on a broader basis?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well if I was going to comment on the transaction firstly at the high level, I would say that the pending transaction first validates what we have been saying all along and that is that scale is essential to drive performance in the business that we are in. Now from our experience making a making a large transaction to build and leverage scale it has a series of challenges. And in general everything takes much longer than you initially think. And in addition to this, all the extra work that is involved with making such a transaction, easily distracts you from running the base business. So as I have been saying we look at this transaction as an opportunity within capital low for us and we do intend to capitalize on it, and this is again linked to the gaining of market share. In the international market I would say in many countries our market share has been limited by a glass ceiling and this glass ceiling has been put in place by our customers to make sure that there is enough work to make a third player viable. Now if the other two players were to combine into one, then I think this glass ceiling can easily be broken and that's why we are basically going through pretty much all our contracts in all the international countries we operate in and to make sure we have targeted plans for how we would look to capitalize on this market share opportunity if and when the transaction closes.","Kurt Hallead","Okay. That's good. And so many topics and so little time, so just wanted to try to calibrate some things with you. You said you guys reduced headcount by 9,000 to address current activity levels, then you reference a couple of third-party E&P surveys with the US down 25% to 30% which seems low in my view and 10% to 15%, which if I were to interpret your commentary though you didn't state specifically might suggest is you think that 10% to 15% reduction in international spend is too low, or too much? ","Paal Kibsgaard","While as I said I didn't make a full year statement on this. We are going to focus on managing this year in quarters. I think the general statements I would make is that the impact on North America Land we expect to be significantly more dramatic then what you would see in the rest of the world.","Kurt Hallead","Okay. And then if I just may finish with one. Just curious about your views on what's going on with the market opportunities in Brazil given all the corruption, scandals and so on and so forth. And maybe tying that back to the merger coming up here, which would give your competitor about 70% market share, if I'm not mistaken, of the recently awarded drilling package. So first and foremost, with the mess in Brazil, is that going to lead to activity declines you think in 2015? And then secondarily, how do you see the possibility of this drilling contract being re-bid one more time?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well I think as to your -- the things going on but in Petrobras I will let Petrobras comment on those things. Our relationship with Petrobras and our working relationship continues to be very good. Now Petrobras did recently announce budget cuts for their first half of 2015 and versus a previously indication of flat spend. So there will be challenges in Brazil going into this year. As for the new contracts, the latest information we have is that the wireline and E&M contract will kick in mid-year of 2015. And what is going to happen to the market share within these contracts and I don't know. We are based on the bid happy with the contact. Now what Petrobras chooses to do in terms of market allocations we will have to revert to them.","Kurt Hallead","Okay. I really appreciate it. Thanks a lot, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Bill Sanchez","Thanks, good morning.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Bill Sanchez","Paal, given your quarter-to-quarter kind of look here how you are managing the business I was hoping perhaps you could help us just calibrate 1Q relative to fourth quarter? I know we didn't see quite probably the yearend product sales one would expect. You talked in your prepared comments just kind of some of the puts and takes in North America but I didn't hear much specifically around international. And just trying to see if you can help us calibrate how we should think about 4Q to 1Q here from an EPS perspective?","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay, if you look at the first quarter, even for the first quarter there is still significant visibility challenges. Now we do expect a significant sequential drop in revenue due to, like you say, last year on product sales, the normal seasonal impact in particular in North Sea, Russia, China as well as in Marine Seismic and also the exchange rate impact in particular from Venezuela and Russia is going to felt. And the last part which is kind of new this year is further activity and pricing impact from the reduced E&P CapEx spend. So what we have done is and we have tailored our cost space for revenues to be around the levels for the first quarter of last year. So this involves a range of cost measures taken in Q4 including the release of the 9,000 people that we quoted. So I would say I am comfortable with our cost structure with respect to this base case of Q1 activity around revenue levels of Q1 of last year. Now this activity is stronger, we have means to cover it, and if it is lower we have the ability to quickly cut more.","Bill Sanchez","Okay. So 1Q revenue '15 equal to 1Q revenue '14 overall?","Paal Kibsgaard","I am not saying that the revenue is going to be that, I am saying that that's how we have tailored our cost base.","Bill Sanchez","Okay. So if I just get back then to the headcount reductions then, so the reductions you have made, I guess, first, assume that this -- it seems like from the call this is strictly a North America reduction, is that in fact the case of the headcount cuts you have made so far?","Paal Kibsgaard","No, it's not. This is a global reduction and it both a combination of I would say structure headcount as well as fee capacity headcount.","Bill Sanchez","Okay. So there's still room here as your quarter-to-quarter view changes for further headcount reductions on a global basis? I guess is that a fair comment, Paal?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, as Q1 evolves we will firm up our view on Q2 and the playbook we run through in Q4 to be right-sized for Q1, we will repeat if necessary during the first quarter to be right-sized for Q2.","Bill Sanchez","Okay. If I could just ask one more, what should we assume right now [inaudible] of the headcount reductions that are being made currently?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well I am not going to predict the cost here but I will tell you that normally we recover our costs in the severance within the following time here. It's probably more than this number. So I have already covered in fact [inaudible] be within the 2015.","Bill Sanchez","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, I will turn it back.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jud Bailey","Thank you, good morning.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Jud Bailey","Paal, one thing that strikes us about this downturn relative to what we saw in 2008 and 2009 is the urgency of some of the large operators to cut back on their offshore spending very quickly. I would be curious to get your thoughts on deepwater activity in kind of the three main basins, Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and Brazil, how your customers are approaching that and how you see the outlook there over the next 12 to 18 months?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well if you look at global deepwater activity, it was down I think 6%, 7% in 2014 predominantly driven by Brazil and in 2015 at this stage and I am talking about deep water activity now, we still expect another 5% to 10% decline. Where it is going to come I think is a bit early to say. The Gulf of Mexico looks likely to be reasonably flat. As I just mentioned Brazil, there seems to be potentially further cuts in Brazil and I think there is still a bit lack of visibility in Angola. But I would say, 5% to 10% decline in activity is what we expect which is more I think in line with what we absorbed in 2014. Now I think with a big saving in deepwater drilling spend it's going to come in 2015, it's going to be around the rig rate which started to come down in 2014 but I think the big saving our customers are going to get on deepwater drilling in '15 is going to come from the rig rate.","Jud Bailey","Okay. And that kind of leads into my next question is, one thing that we've heard from rig contractors is more so than in '09 we are hearing from them that operators are approaching them more so than '09 on trying to renegotiate existing contracts. I would be curious how are your customers approaching you in terms of pricing? Are they looking to try to renegotiate existing contracts? And then also do you have a sense on the ability for you to sell them new technology to save time and cost, or are they just in the mode of trying to get cost down and not really looking at that aspect of it yet?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think on the deepwater size for our product and services, we do have discussions around trying to drive costs out of the system. But I would say our customers in this market segment in particular are still very-very focused on operational integrity and also looking at using the latest and best technologies to make sure that they drive performance through that. So we haven't really had any significant I would say price book discussions or requests for price book reduction. On the deepwater side it is more how we can work together to drive total cost down through better planning, through better execution, through less downtime, rather than specific price book discussion.","Jud Bailey","Okay. Thank you. I will turn it back.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob MacKenzie from Iberia Capital. Please go ahead.","Rob MacKenzie","Thank you. Good morning guys. I wanted to ask about technology adoption, something you highlighted again in your press release, specifically on US land. And my question is are you seeing a greater or lesser propensity of operators to adopt technology in the effort to drive down -- or drive up -- returns in this cycle? One might think you would but operators typically haven't always behaved that way.","Paal Kibsgaard","Oh, you are right. In North America land that has been the situation. I would say that we are seeing or in 2014 we did see a growing uptake and a growing appetite to apply new technologies to drive both higher production and lower cost to improve cost per barrel. So I would say that BroadBand family of stimulation technologies is a very good example of this. Highway was one of the first and a major technology innovations on the fact side in terms of fluids for quite a while. As we introduced it in 2011, it grew very fast. But with the BroadBand family which was introduced in the early part of 2014, this is currently growing at four times the pace. So part of this is that we have engaged our customers in a slightly different way this time around for BroadBand and we have met myself and my team included with a range of our customers at the CEO, COO level to lay out firstly what the technology does but also to give them introductory offers to basically demonstrate what these technologies can do and I believe that when we introduce them in this way then the adaptation to all these organizations actually is quicker and more significant.","Rob MacKenzie","So when they come to you as many of them say they are doing now coming to their vendors and asking for price concessions, how does that change the conversation?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well I think our customers still look to drive down total cost or improved cost per barrel and when they engage in these discussions there is already pretty clear on the standing of what some of these technologies have already done for them, and when we have commercial discussions these improvements and these benefits that we offer are factored into the overall situation when we discussed pricing with them.","Rob MacKenzie","Thank you.","Simon Farrant","That's all the time we have for the questions today.

As a reminder this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.","Simon Farrant","Thank you, Greg. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited first quarter 2014 results conference call. Today\u2019s call is being hosted from Abu Dhabi, where Schlumberger Limited board meeting took place earlier today. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.","However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I\u2019d like to remind participants that some of the information in today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements.","Now, I will turn the call over to Simon.","Simon Ayat","Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits was $1.21. This is $0.14 lower sequentially but $0.24 higher when compared to the same quarter last year. As a reminder, during the second quarter of last year, we wind down our operations in Iran and classified the results of the business as a discontinued operation and all the prior period amounts have restated.","Oilfield Services first quarter revenue of $11.2 billion decreased 5.6% sequentially, while the pre-tax operating margins declined 18 basis points. Approximately half of the $667 million sequential revenue decrease was a result of the absence of the year end surge in the product software and multi-client sales that we experienced last quarter.","The remainder of the decrease was largely attributable to the seasonal weather related slowdowns that typically experience in Q1. These factors also accounted for the sequential decline in margins. Given the significant impact that these seasonal factors had on our sequential performance, my comments will focus on year-on-year changes unless otherwise noted.","Oilfield Services revenue increase 6.3% year-on-year, while pre-tax operating margins grew by 248 basis points. Highlight by product group were as follows. Reservoir characterization revenue of $2.9 billion increased 1.8% while margins grew by 129 basis points to 27.3%. These increases were -- are primarily attributable to a very strong performance in wire line on improved offshore exploration activity.","Drilling group revenue of $4.3 billion increased 6.6% and margin improved by 249 basis points to 20.3%. These improvements were due to increased technology integration and robust drilling measurement and M-I SWACO activities in the Middle East and Asia. ","Production group of $4.1 billion increased 9.5%, while margin grew by 313 basis points to 17.9%. This growth was driven primarily by a very strong performance by well services in North America land despite the severe weather.","Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and the credits was 22.6% in the first quarter compared to 22.3% in the previous quarter. We generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations. Net debt increased $610 million during the quarter to $5.1 billion, reflecting the consumption of working capital that we typically experienced during Q1. Driven by the annual payments associated which increased compensation.","At 18% of last 12 month revenue, working capital was lower in both absolute terms as well as percentage against the same quarter of last year. Additionally, we spent $899 on our stock buyback program during Q1. We repurchased almost 10 million shares at an average price of $90.31 during the quarter. As you know, back in July of last year, our vote approved new $10 billion share repurchase program. To-date we have repurchased $2.6 billion of shares under this program.","During the quarter we spent $864 million on CapEx. We generated $688 million of free cash flow compared to $127 million in the same period last year. As it relates to full-year 2014, CapEx is still expected to be approximately $3.8 billion as compared to the $3.9 billion we spent in 2013.","And now I will turn the conference call over to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Simon. In spite of severe winter weather impacting activity in our Russia, China, and North America land operations, our first quarter results were solid and fully in line with our expectations. Sequentially revenue dipped from the fourth quarter as a result of seasonal slowdown in activity and lower product and multi-client seismic sales, but grew year over year by just north of 6% while pretax operating income increased by 21% to yield an incremental margin of 60%. ","The driving force behind these results is further market share gains on the back of growing new technology sales and expanding integration related activity as well as a relentless focus on operational excellence and efficiency. In terms of revenue progression by customer group, our year-over-year growth was driven by the NOCs and the independents which now represent more than 70% of our revenue, while overall activity for the IOCs was more or less flat.","In the first quarter we generated close to $700 million of free cash flow which is an improvement of almost $550 million compared to the same quarter last year. Based on the growing strength of our free cash flow, we have decided to accelerate our current $10 billion stock buyback program announced in July of last year with the aim of completing the program in two and half years versus the original target of five years. ","This does not change how we intent to use our cash where the priority continues to be reinvestment in the business to drive growth while we remain opportunistic when it comes to M&A and also plan to renew dividend levels each year. The acceleration of the buyback program is more a reflection of the confidence we have in our business performance and outlook and a signal of our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.","Our international business continued to perform well in the first quarter. The seasonal impact of weather and lower product sales resulted in a sequential drop in revenue of 8%. However pre-tax operating margins were resilient at 22.8%, down only 73 basis points from the fourth quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, revenue was up 5% on the back of strong growth in the Middle East and Asia while pretax operating margins expanded by 286 basis points driven by new technology sales and strong focus on cost and resource management. ","In terms of pricing, the international market remains highly competitive and we have not seeing any signs of a general pricing inflection. However our latest technology and our best in class service quality continued to carry a premium which together with the growth in integration related activity is reflected in our revenue rated pricing indicator which is up compared to the first quarter of last year.","The improvement in effective pricing together with our ongoing transformation programs focused on reliability and efficiency puts us in a very competitive position in the international markets which we are using to drive both market share gains and to expand our margins.","In Latin America, revenue was down 12% sequentially while operating margins were essentially flat at 21.1%. Compared to the same quarter last year revenue was down 8% however pretax operating income was flat due to proactive cost and resource management and also supported by our broad and diverse contract base in the region. ","The year over year reduction in revenue was predominantly driven by Brazil, where both activity and pricing were significantly down compared to last year. Still, introduction of new technology and swift actions to right size the resource base in the country has enabled us to minimize the negative financial impact from the lower activity. ","In Mexico, revenue was also down compared to the first quarter of last year, driven by lower budget spend from Pemex, both on land and offshore. The Pemex, mega tender process was concluded during the quarter and we have signed contracts worth $1.9 billion, which represents nearly half of the awarded work scope covering all the major projects in the South and North regions. The resource mobilization for the additional project is ongoing and will be concluded during the second and third quarter as we gradually ramp up the activity.","In Argentina, year-over-year growth was strong driven by rig-based activity in the Vaca Muerta shale where we are also actively engaging with a number of customers on sub-surface studies and on projects to improve drilling and completion efficiency. In Venezuela, activity was also up year-over-year and we continue to work closely with PdVSA to help them grow production and improve operational efficiency. ","And in Ecuador we posted strong growth compared to the first quarter of last year, as we continue to progress on the Shushufindi SPM project where we again set the new production record during the quarter. ","We also secured a right to negotiate for two additional blocks of fields in the country in the latest production in [indiscernible] that took place in the first quarter and these commercial discussions have already started.","In the Middle East and Asia, revenue decreased 3% sequentially while operating margins were essentially flat at 26.3%. On a year over year basis, revenue increased 19% and margins were up by 349 basis points. In the Middle East, year over year growth was again driven by Saudi Arabia where we continue to move in resources to keep pace with the additional growth we are taking on, and also by the United Arab Emirates where activity is at a record high. ","In Southern Iraq, activity was down significantly compared to the same quarter last year as contract awards are delayed due to ongoing discussions between the IOCs and the governments. Based on this as well as the upcoming elections, we do not expect any significant recovery in activity in Southern Iraq in the coming quarters, and we are therefore already taking actions to right size our resource base. Activity in Northern Iraq on the other hand was solid in the first quarter and we expect strong growth there in 2014 leaving full year revenue for the country flat with 2013 and the operating margins approaching the average of the region.","Southeast Asia posted strong first quarter results driven by high deepwater activity throughout the region, solid SPM performance in Malaysia and very good drilling performance in our IPM project in Queensland, Australia. In China we continue to ramp up activity on our tight gas SPM project with Yanchang Petroleum in the Ordos basin and we are operating a total of 12 rigs at the end of the first quarter.","In Europe, C.I.S. and Africa, revenue was down 11% sequentially and operating margins were down by 220 basis points. However compared to the same quarter last year when the majority of the [formal] (ph) activity was still included in our ECA numbers, revenue grew by 1% and margins were up by 253 basis points. The year over year revenue growth in the region was also negatively impacted by severe winter weather in Russia as well as the weakening of the ruble that took place during the quarter. Still, the underlying activity both offshore and on land in Russia remains firm for the year. There were also several positive activity signs in parts of Europe and Africa that helped offset the first quarter headwinds in Russia.","In Norway we posted solid year over year growth driven by market share gains for our drilling services and we expect to see further growth in the second quarter as the seismic season starts and wherever this year will have particular focus on the [balance sheet] (ph). We have also been awarded a five year integrated well construction contract by the Norske for exploration and drilling activity where we will play an integral part of both the planning and execution process. And in West Africa we also posted strong year over year growth driven by both exploration and development work in several of the Gulf of Guinea countries and we still expect strong growth in 2014 in the region in particular from Angola, Gabon and Chad.","In North America we posted a strong quarter with revenue up 1% sequentially while margins were down 107 basis points to 18.5% driven by pricing pressure and severe winter weather on land as well as drilling delays in the Gulf of Mexico. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue grew 12% while margins were down 53 basis points. ","On land, we posted strong year over year growth in revenue driven by market share gains and new technology uptick in pressure pumping as well as solid growth in our artificial lift business where we continue to expand our market position in the rod lift market. Our margins on land were impacted by lower pricing in pressure pumping as we rolled over several key contracts at the end of last year and we also choose to incur additional sand transportation and fuel costs during the periods of severe winter weather to avoid any disruption to our customers\u2019 operations.","In the Gulf of Mexico, deepwater drilling activity was down compared to the first quarter of last year due to a series of operational delays, longer completion times and more work over activity and this impacted several of our product lines. However, the situation is expected to normalize again in the second quarter and the outlook for deepwater drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico remains strong for the full year.","Turning to technology, in 2013, we saw further growth in the rate of high impact commercializations from our RNE organization. This, together with significant improvements and the out of box performance of our new products had a clear impact on our financial results as presented in last month\u2019s Howard Weil conference in New Orleans. In 2014 we expect this trend to continue with a wide range of new technologies scheduled for introduction to the market at the rates that will even surpass 2013. We will showcase a number of these new technologies in our investor events that will take place June 24th and 25th in New York.","In addition to the latest technologies from reservoir characterization and drilling, we will present a range of new production related technologies including a revolutionary intelligent completion system, our latest multistage completion technology and new fracturing fluid innovation and we will give you an update on our North American land artificial lift business where we see strong growth potential for both ESP and rod pump sales sales. Together with these technology presentations we will review progress on our ongoing transformation programs and also provide an updated financial outlook for the coming three year period.","Moving on to the macro picture, the global economic data has been mixed so far this year, with the US suffering an unusually half winter, China showing some signs of slowdown, although still projected to grow along 7.5% in 2014 and the situation in Ukraine adding a new risk to the outlook. However, the fundamentals of the global recovery remain intact, as the above factors are likely to only have a temporary impact.","In contrast to this, the oil markets have been significantly tighter than anticipated, as strong demand trends in OECD and in the Middle East together with continuing supply disruptions in various regions have left to lower spare capacity figures and pushed OECD stocks down to the largest deviation from historical averages since 2003.","The North American supply search continues to be just enough to equal the world's growing demand, while all other growth regions, including Iraq, Brazil and the Caspian are struggling to meet their production targets. This should continue to support oil prices around $100 a barrel and therefore encourage oil directed investments in both the North American and International markets.","U.S. natural gas demand reached a new all-time record in Q1, due to the severe winter weather pushing prices to a six year high. However, U.S. supply trends remain strong on the back of the Marcellus and as the weather normalizes over the springs and summer months we expect the North American market to return to a balanced supply demand situation from natural gas.","International gas markets remain relatively tight largely driven by Chinese demand which continues to grow at double digit rates while European gas demand has eased in the past months on a mild winter. Based on these markets conditions, we continue to expect well related EMP spend to grow by more than 6% in 2014, with spend growth relatively balanced between North America and the international markets. We further expect our year-over-year growth in 2014 to be driven by the NOC\u2019s and the independents.","After several years of strong growth, our revenue IOCs has dropped over the past two quarters and was in Q1 flat compared to the same quarter last year. However, the first quarter should be the low point for IOC revenue this year, as our latest activity outlook indicates sequential revenue growth from this customer group in the coming quarters and with full year revenue expected to be flat with 2013.","Equally important to the level EMP spend and the way we translate this into revenue it\u2019s our ability to convert the top line growth into profits. While we plan to deliver a solid incremental margin on the challenging market conditions in North America, we see potential for higher levels in our international business as demonstrated by our first quarter year-over-year incremental margins of 86%.","We are not likely to maintain these levels to our 2014, but our international incremental margin potential should offer strong support to our earnings growth in the coming year. Furthermore, our broad geographical footprints, our balanced technology portfolio and our agile organization provides us with insulation from market downsides as recently seen in Latin America and allows us to swiftly capitalize on market opportunities, whether in North America or anywhere else in the growth.","We therefore remain positive and optimistic with respect to the 2014 outlook as we continue to aim for solid double digit growth in earnings per share, fueled by a combination of topline growth, margin expansion and the acceleration of our current stock buyback program.","That concludes my remarks, we will now open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). First question comes from the line of David Anderson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","David Anderson - JPMorgan","Thanks. Good morning, Paal. I was wondering if you could expand a bit on your comments with the IOC\u2019s, so 30% business it looks kind of flat, obviously we have seen a lot of headlines of the IOCs cutting CapEx, I was wondering if you could put that into context first a little bit? Can you help us understand how you see it's progressing, is it simply a function of day rates and when day rates come down, the projects start moving ahead. I was just wondering if you can help us how you see that kind of progressing throughout the year.","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay. So let me first start one thing, so I said that the IOCs are now making up well below 30%. So it has dropped over the past couple of quarters. So we have already seen a reduction in their spend. And what we\u2019re saying is that, it\u2019s already flat now year-over-year, the forecast we have from the value, geomarkets and a roll-up indicates our progression in the next couple of quarters and we see the full year basically being flat year-over-year. ","Now what\u2019s driving that, as we said before, we believe that the primary focus of the CapEx cuts from the IOCs will be on projects that are heavy on infrastructure and probably less so on well rated CapEx, although we have seen some impact on this as well. ","","David Anderson - JPMorgan","Okay, so if I think about kind of the exploration spend side of that, I guess that\u2019s the part that I wonder the most about. It seems like that might be a little bit more at risk than say, the development CapEx. Can you talk about that from that standpoint, and how that could impact the WesternGeco, because obviously you guys have more exploration risk, so just kind of help us, kind of quantify. Is that a risk for you going forward this year or are you seeing, are you feeling pretty good about that exploration spend even with these kind of chatter-bumpy cuts out there?","","Paal Kibsgaard","We haven\u2019t really changed our view on exploration spend or the seismic spends since the January call. We still expect to see growth in exploration spend in 2014. It\u2019s going to be lower than 2013, and within the exploration spend, we see flattening or flat seismic spend and the growth is going to come through well related spend, through appraisal and exploration type of drilling. So we haven\u2019t really changed the view on either exploration or seismic from the January call. That was already factored into the plan.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of James West from Barclays; please go ahead.","","James West - Barclays Capital","Why don\u2019t you just step into North America for a second, clearly the rig count trends have been a little bit better than I think most people anticipated early in the year. How do you see the progress for your business in North America going forward? Is it more that you\u2019re going to gain margin and share from technology or do you actually see some pricing power developing?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, if you look at Q1 first of all, in terms of our performance we saw very strong year-over-year growth as I said, with revenue of 12%. And this is a combination of market share gains and new technology uptake. And we continue to gain share and pressure pumping. And this is on the back of efficiency gains and new technology uptake. And we added another two fleets in Q1 from our idle asset program. ","Now in terms of activity outlook for North America, on land we expect solid activity growth in U.S. land in 2014. We see this being led by South and West Texas. And in addition to the number of wells, we also see supported by again efficiency gains and further uptake of new technology. ","In terms of Canada, the breakup is going to have the normal impact on Q2 and we see Canada slightly up compared to 2013. ","And Gulf of Mexico, again Q1 was slow for us because of lower deepwater drilling activity. We see this coming back in Q2 and onwards; so a strong outlook again for Gulf of Mexico.","James West - Barclays Capital","Okay, so you do it in the Gulf, but this was I think a little or so deepwater rigs scattered into the Gulf from the second half of this year, you do see all those rigs coming and going to work and see the big uptake in the second half of this year. ","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, we do. And also the number of rigs in Q1 wasn\u2019t really the problem. They -- we regenerate less revenue, although we have completion work there, the amount of revenue per day in completion mode versus full drilling mode is obviously a significant relapse. So it was not a rig count issue, it was an activity type of issue in Q1.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley; please go ahead.","","Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley","","Paal, I\u2019m just taking one step back at the -- and I want to just have you clarify a little bit a high level question. You mentioned that the oil markets are tighter than one's anticipated. I know you don\u2019t like talking about client production or anything like that, but once you made a statement I feel like I can ask you to elaborate a little bit more on that. I think consensus have probably been more divided on where oil prices are going and this year, and next year are meant to be the big sort of surge in production [indiscernible] that actually highlighted Brazil, Iraq, Caspian and of course North America. So what is that you see here that you don\u2019t think the other -- or that\u2019s positive to make that statement?","Paal Kibsgaard","Ole I think if you want to build a very kind of bullish case on production, I am sure you can do that. It\u2019s just that if you go back and look at the previous years, there is always an element of project delays and production disruption. And what we said in January is that we expect there to be a normal dose of that in 2014. And so far this year we have seen that, so the market is still relatively tight. Obviously these stocks are down. OpEx spare capacity is down. And there is nothing dramatic in it other than that all the things aren\u2019t lining up as maybe the bull case was at the beginning of the year for production.","Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley","Will you tie that to what you see at the customer level of increased project delays now with IOCs being more capital disciplined, or taking a step back here having to borrow for their dividends? Is this something that you think is permanently delayed? How have you changed your view on it, say 2017, let\u2019s say longer term supply growth as a function of what\u2019s going on at a CapEx level at the moment?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think what\u2019s going to happen at least over the next couple of years is that the IOCs will focus more of their spend where they can drill wells and generate production from existing infrastructure or from infrastructure that costs less. So huge infrastructure projects, I would expect to be kind of lower in frequency. And some of them might be postponed as we have already seen. While the focus, again is going to be on generating production which generates cash. So the ability to do that at the lowest possible investment, I think is going to be the focus, which is still good for us.","Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley","So does that mean that you\u2019re more than positive on the areas like the North Sea, let\u2019s say metro areas, Gulf of Mexico than what you will be on frontier exploration like Arctic, Russia or [indiscernible]?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well I think for the frontier areas, you will still see exploration I think there is still a push towards delineating and trying to assess what these frontiers contain. So I think although there is lower growth in exploration this year I still think there is going to be lot of interest to try to assess what kind of potential these areas have. Now how the economics of the project was stack up and when development starts, that will I think is going to be a function of what they find and what the economics look like. But I still think there will be a push towards doing exploration in frontier areas, yes.","Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley","And finally back to the U.S. again you have the very impressive growth, you highlight that this was market share gains through new technology. Could you kind of help us understand a little bit now how much was market share gains on your technology and how much did the underlying market grow by in your view?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, if you look at the overall rig counts, it was up about 4.5% year over year and I would say partly offsetting that growth also was inefficiencies due to the weather. So a fair bit of this I think for us is market share as well as new technology. So I am not going to give you a detailed number which I am sure you know. But I am quite pleased with how we are continuing to progress in particular, in the pressure pumping market. We added about four fleets in Q3, one fleet in Q4 and another two fleets in the first quarter of this year. And this is all at descent incremental margins, so we are pleased with how we are progressing.","Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley","Anything on the technology side you can share or do you want to wait to do it?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I already said a lot more about them what we normally do, so I think that\u2019s going to be it.","Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you. Good afternoon, Paal where you are, good morning where we are. I have a follow up question, you addressed a lot of the concerns that investors have had with respect to the outlook on IOC spend and so on in great detail, so thanks for that. Question I would have would be, how do you risk assess from this point forward, right. You put out your targets, you kind of took a look at what\u2019s going on with the offshore elements, it looks like the offshore rig market is still kind of on a slide downward. So from this point forward Paal, if you were to look at the offshore market, how would you risk assess it from here. What do you is the biggest driver? Is it more, what\u2019s the risk on activities really what I\u2019m trying to ask you from your standpoint. Is it Brazil; is it outside of Brazil, where -- how do you see that dynamic spinning up?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well if you focus in on deepwater where I think the biggest discussion has been, this is where the biggest projects are and this is where the biggest discussion are on rig rates all right. We looked at this in detail and if you look at the deepwater market, it\u2019s really two separate stories, you have Brazil and you have the rest of the world. In 2013, Brazil represented around 30% of the global deepwater drilling activity and in Q1 of 2014 Brazil was 20% down in activity while the rest of the world was up 3%. Now for the full year of 2014, we expect Brazil to be down more than 20% versus last year, while the rest of the world we see as being up high single digits. And as we previously indicated in January, the growth in the rest of the world deepwater is going to be driven by sub-Sahara Africa and Gulf of Mexico, so really no change to that. And we also see descent growth in both exploration as well as development for deepwater.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","And then if you take that information Paal, when you roll that up into your outlook from a total international revenue growth standpoint, how should we think about that, is that kind of mid-single digit or double digit still double digit growth, how would you look at the international revenue dynamic for the year?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well if you look at the activity outlook or revenue outlook for us in the international markets, again we see well rated CapEx spend growing north of 6% and it\u2019s going to again be driven by both land and offshore. There are a few offsetting factors versus what we said in January, so if you quickly go through those, we do see solid growth in deepwater drilling activity excluding Brazil. In Latin America specifically, we now see this as being flat driven by lower revenue in particular in Brazil but also to a certain extent in Mexico. In Europe and Africa, we are still showing good growth and basically in line with the previous outlook.","In Russia, the activity outlook is unchanged but the revenue will potentially be lower due to the currently weaker ruble, so what\u2019s going to happen with the ruble as the year progresses we\u2019ll have to see, but if it stays where it is now then revenue is going to be somewhat lower than what we initially expected while activity is the same. Now Middle East and Asia is stronger than we initially expected and that\u2019s driven by several countries in the Middle East as well as Australia. So that\u2019s kind of how we see overall international.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Great. And then one last follow up, one of the key drivers for the margin performance and earnings performance over the last couple of years has been this internal dynamic for technology and excellence and execution and everything else. As you look out at the North American market going forward, you\u2019ve now established firm leadership versus your peer group. Do you expect the excellence and execution program in technology if your peer group were to grow margins by 100 or 200 basis points, is that\u2019s something that you think you can keep pace with or exceed given the dynamics in play right now.","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, like you say we've outperformed our competitors in terms of both topline growth in margin evolution [indiscernible] since like mid-2012. So at this stage I am quite pleased with our position both on land and offshore in North America. So we expect to maintain our margin leadership and at the same time grow faster in revenues. So if our competitors can grow by 100 and 200 basis points, I don\u2019t see why we cannot do the same or exceed it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Thanks. Good morning. Paal so at a recent industry gathering, you offered some interesting commentary about industry challenges and you referenced the fact that E&P CapEx over the last 10 years have grown by 400% or as oil production was only 15%. And you mentioned the fact, that in the E&P value chain, the oil companies were the ultimate integrators of all the technical work associated with finding hydrocarbons and the collective oil services, community was accountable for not delivering on required performance progress. And you also mentioned that the required improvement was not going to come from yet another round of procurement driven price reductions across the E&P value chain. So along those lines, as the industry is in introspective mood with where the IOCs and deepwater [indices] (ph) in terms of getting their deepwater cost and alignment, apart from the mix shift from infrastructure to well CapEx, what structural reforms are clients contemplating, implementing and the discussions you\u2019re having with your clients along those lines?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think if you look at the short term actions they are taking today, they are looking at bringing the deepwater rig rates down. I mean, if you look at what\u2019s happened on deepwater day rates over the past three, four, five years they have increased significantly and they have been completed disconnected from the other deepwater oilfield services, right. So today the rig rental makes up around 50% of the deepwater well cost, so customers have really been looking for the opportunity to get the rig rental rates down and the opportunity is here in form of the high number of new arrivals, all contract expiring and a significant reduction activity in Brazil. So I think this is the opportunity. In the short term they are trying to get some relief on cost. ","Now my comments in terms of a procurement driven exercise across the industry, is more focused in on, we need to basically drive off the technical performance as an industry, whether that is process efficiency or reliability of the projects that we execute. So what some of my customers are doing is they are, they are approaching us a lot more than in the past in terms of doing fully integrated projects, where we are a lot more engaged in the upfront planning and the sign of the work. And where we have a more performance based contracts in terms of how we execute the work as well. So these are some of the short terms actions that they are taking. And I think beyond that I think the service industry needs to take responsibility in terms of finding way of transforming themselves to drive both their internal efficiencies and their technical performance versus the customers that is how we can create more value and support our customers.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Okay. And secondly, coming out of the last quarter, you offered some helpful, I guess, parameters for the first quarter earnings possibilities. Do you have just a high level broad commentary with regard to what we should be focused on with regard to second quarter earnings possibilities?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, if you look at Q2, we should see seasonal recovery in Russia and China and also less weather impact in U.S. land. Now this is going to be partially offset by the normal spring break up in Canada which has already started. And beyond this we are expecting steady growth in the underlying business as per the other discussions we\u2019ve had so far today. So our aim for the second quarter is to bring Q2 EPS back to the level of Q4 of last year. That is for us a good target.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Good morning. And Bill Herbert, thank you for asking the question. And all thank you for the answer on the integrated projects. Let me carry that on, you mentioned several times in the press release about integrated projects, their accretion to margins. Can you talk about performance related contracts and what those returns look like relative to the rest of your business?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, in general, Jim, the performance based contracts are accreted to our margins. So we take on performance based contracts where we have a pretty good handle on the environment that we operate in. We have a very good handle on how our customers are operating and are interfacing and supporting our operations. And also what kind of controls we have to drive performance. So I would say in general our performance based contracts and a lot of them are within the drilling group, if you take away the production incentive contracts, they are generally accretive to our margins and if you look at the drilling group margin evolution over the past two, three years, you see a very steady improvement from the time we took over Smith in back in 2010.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you for that. My follow-up question is, your self-help efforts, your transformational efforts internally, those mean a lot and they\u2019re structural and they last for a long time. Which markets do you see those efforts having the biggest impact in over the next two to three years?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think they will have impacts globally. We piloted some of these things in North America when we did the initial restructuring of North America land back in when we started in 2010 and that\u2019s being some of the basis for our improvements in North America over the past three-four years. But what we are doing is now starting to pilot in small scale in various other parts of the world and this is going to take several years before we get fully implemented. But at the end of the day, the transformation programs that I\u2019ve been talking about publicly over the past year, will impact all parts of the company, both geographically and in terms of technology.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Okay. And if I could, when we look at the globe of the world, what area, what region do you think has the best upside to margins over the next two to three years?","Paal Kibsgaard","It\u2019s difficult to think, but I would say that -- as I said in my prepared remarks, if you look at incremental margins, we are going to focus in on driving incremental margins throughout our business. With some of the, I would say challenges in particularly in North America land with that we\u2019ve been facing on pricing, it is still more difficult to drive very high incremental margins in North America although we are going to try, but the overall international markets I still think has a significant incremental margin potential and as I also mentioned, year over year Q1 we had 86% incremental margins in international.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Crandell from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Jim Crandell - Cowen Securities","Thank you. Paal, if well based CapEx is up 6% globally, is that an environment that you can grow your revenues in double digits?","Paal Kibsgaard","It\u2019s a difficult question to answer. I mean is it possible? Yes. Are we going to get to double digits? I can\u2019t really say and I wouldn\u2019t commit to it. But the fact that we have the potential of growing our revenues higher than the 6% is I think is very clear.","Jim Crandell - Cowen Securities","Okay. Second question Paal is getting back to North American pricing for today\u2019s technology, not newer technology, but is the 6% increase in well based CapEx in the U.S. in 2014 sufficient to drive pricing anywhere in the U.S. in any product lines for again today\u2019s technology?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think overall I don\u2019t think 6% is going to be sufficient to have a wide spread price increase in commodity type of technologies. Now you might have small pockets where there is a surge of activity and there is insufficient capacity to deliver. You might have situations where new technologies are introduced or where efficiencies are stepped up, where you can drive your effective pricing. But at this stage I would say that we are expecting North America land pricing overall, we are hoping it\u2019s going to flatten from where it is now, that\u2019s going to be the forecast I would say that we have going forward and then we are looking on top of that to drive up our effective pricing through a new technology introduction and by driving efficiency of our operations.","Jim Crandell - Cowen Securities","Okay, good answer. And then last question, Paal you talked about Brazil, what is the risk in your opinion of continued slides in activity in Brazil throughout this year and even into 2015? It seems like every rig that\u2019s coming off contract they\u2019re releasing.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, so as already said, I think Brazil activity, Brazil revenue for us this year is going to be significantly down versus 2013, it\u2019s a combination of both activity as you say as well as the pricing on the new contracts that we took on during 2013. So there is no surprise that Brazil revenue is going to be down significantly and that\u2019s already factored into these discussions and the outlook that I\u2019ve been giving today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Paal, you mentioned before China there was some weakness in the quarter. Where do you see the outlook? Is this temporary and then what\u2019s going on there for the year and beyond?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, we still expect solid growth in China in 2014. It\u2019s going to be a bit lower than 2013 partly due to some of these budget reductions that we have seen from the NOCs. But our focus in the China land market is very much on penetrating it further and if you look at our overall penetration of that market it is still very low. So, we aren\u2019t immediately impacted significantly by these budget reductions. We are seeing significantly high demand for our new technology, for our technical expertise and also for project management. So that\u2019s why we are still quite optimistic about China. And growth is going to be driven by land both in terms of conventional type gas and shale gas, and offshore is also going to continue to be solid. So I would say solid growth in 2014, a bit lower than 2013.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then in the Middle East it seems to be pretty active area, as you mentioned. Is there a way to quantify what kind of revenue growth could be possible from the Middle Eastern areas, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, that area?","","Paal Kibsgaard","It is vague. Yes, and we have done it. But I\u2019m not going to share the outlook with you in great detail, other than we see it -- we saw it as a major growth driver for 2014 and it has confirmed its potential and it might even be slightly up in April versus where we thought it would be in January.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So could it be in the upper teens growth rate there or mid teen growth rates, in that kind of range?","","Paal Kibsgaard","","I\u2019m not going to give you a number. You can look at the Q1 year-over-year number which was pretty solid.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil; please go ahead.","","Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil","Thanks, good morning. Paal, I found your comments on the southern Iraq interesting. I know Iraq had been one of the five countries I think you had outlined previously as kind of the highest growth markets for you. Has there been any change in terms of your thought on Iraq in general here in how the proceeds for Schlumberger, as going forward and maybe just on a year-over-year basis?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, for 2014 the main change has been that the activity in the south is going to be down. And this is mainly driven by ongoing discussions between the IOCs and the Ministry. There are things that they need to sort out and agree upon before they will move forward and award some of these lump-sum turnkey contracts that are pending. So until that happens, there isn\u2019t going to be a lot of work awarded in the south. And with the upcoming elections, we don\u2019t think that that situation and these bids are going to be awarded in the next couple of quarters. We think that is probably a late year event before it happens. ","So that\u2019s why activity in Southern Iraq for this year is going to be down. Now offsetting this is very strong activity growth in Northern Iraq. And here we have an excellent market position. It\u2019s a lot focused on high-end exploration and we are able to offset the reduced activity in revenue in the South with growth in the North. So that 2014 Iraq revenue is going to be flat year-over-year and the margins are also now quickly approaching the average for the region. So overall, it\u2019s somewhat downgrading of the growth in Iraq, but both margins and as well as the offsetting factor of the North is positive.","Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil","My follow-up would be, I know you said sometime, talking about the topline expectations in Latin America and the headwinds in Brazil. Your commentary on Mexico, I think is least as we start to think about the exiting 2014 on a year-over-year basis seemed more positive. Just thoughts there in terms of when you perhaps see year-over-year growth in Mexico or I guess number one, my follow-up to it will be just on the margins in Latin America. You\u2019ve done a pretty good job of holding those relatively flat. Perhaps I missed it, but I don\u2019t think I heard any thoughts on the kind of margin growth we should expect that to move forward here in Latin America or just is relatively flat a good expectation?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I think overall for Latin America, I think flat is a good word. I think we see overall revenue to be flattish this year. And we are going to work very hard on maintaining our margins around the levels that we had in 2013. So far this year that's worked out well. And we will continue to focus in on that. ","So, obviously a significant negative on Brazil which we already talked about. Mexico is more of a positive story. But in the short-term here what we see is a lot more budget discipline from Pemex; and also a little bit more hesitance towards spend as this ongoing reform proceeds. But as you know, we had some significant wins in the mega tenders, where we have gained significant shares and we will be ramping up activity in Q2 and into H2. So we expect to be exiting Mexico this year on a pretty good note and that will be a good driver for us in 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Bernstein; please go ahead. ","","Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein","Paal, can you talk about your strategy in North American and rod lift? You see a path to transform legacy products through technology development or is there any interest in the space largely based on a view of end-market growth?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, so we are interested in North America land artificial lift markets, and we have followed it for some time. There is clearly significant growth potential there. It\u2019s a huge market. There are hundreds of thousands of wells that installed rod lifts and we see a significant opportunity to apply more science and technology into this markets and also to help drive production and cost per barrel. So, if you want to be part of transforming a market which obviously are ultimate goal this year, and transforming it to the benefit of our customers, we are firm believers that you have to play in it; you cannot change it from the side lines. So while we have a growing ESP business in the North America land for the, shale liquid wells, we also believe that we need to have a complete offering and what we are looking to do now is to combine our ESP offering with these rod lift companies that we have both over the recent quarters. And then ultimately provide a life of well lift solution to our customer base. And that could be ESP for part of the life and it could be a rod pump for the other part of the life. So we are working on this and we will give a further off take on this business both I would say further strategy as well as technology in our June investor event.","Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein","Great. In an unrelated follow-up in Russia, Rosneft appears to be taking a new strategy toward contracting rigs. Have you noticed a change in how they cooperate with the service companies? Are they starting to push back on pricing for any of your services?","Paal Kibsgaard","As far as I know, we haven\u2019t had any recent discussions with Rosneft on pricing beyond what is normal for our services. Exactly what Rosneft do in terms of oil contracting rigs, I don\u2019t have any further comments to what their strategy is, no.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim","Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. But, Paal I wanted to ask you about Saxon and sort of more strategically Schlumberger in the last few years has been moving away from the more asset intensive segments with the sale of rigs in Russia, and obviously the spark business model in U.S. pumping. Can you -- is something changing with respect to that strategy or was this just an acquisition or consolidation of opportunity?","Paal Kibsgaard","No you\u2019re right. I mean, we continue to focus on return on capital employed and to be, would say capital efficient as we go forward. So there is no change in the strategy here, but let me just give you a little bit of the rationale for why we are acquiring Saxon. So land rigs has always been a key part of our integration platform for well construction. ","Now in the past, and what led to the set-up of Saxon where we have basically sold them the rigs, we sold the rigs to Eurasia in Russia as well is that our priority in the past have been basically to have access to rigs from a trusted provider. It\u2019s more a capacity issue that we\u2019ve been focusing in, in the past. What we are doing now is that we are evolving this view to also seeing the land rig as a critical element of how we drive drilling performance. So what we planned to do at this stage now and Saxon is generally focused on the international market where we have basically all of our integration related business. We plan to invest in optimizing rig design and rig operations by combining Saxon\u2019s rig engineering and rig management capabilities with our existing drilling expertise from both IPM and the drilling group. So there are some third party rigs within the Saxon fleet today, it\u2019s quite a few and we will continue to support them, and if there are opportunity to do third party rentals, we will continue to do. But we are predominately buying Saxon because we want to have our own rig provider that we can help, help us drive the performance of our integration business for well construction.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim","Very interesting. Thank you. On Venezuela, I know that PdVSA has been working with IOCs and [indiscernible] to try to work with terms and get activity higher to raise production. Can you may be talk about what you see happening in that market over the next year, do you think there will be success there and the 2015 could be a much bigger year in Venezuela potentially?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, for us Venezuela today is actually quite good. Activity in Q1 was solid. It was up more than 20% year over year and as you say, we have a close working relationship with PdVSA and as we put our payment agreement with them in place, payments are regular and they are according to plan. So we are in reasonably good shape there. ","So looking forward for this year, we see continued increase in the rig counts. And these addition of rigs are mainly focused in on the [indiscernible] and we continue to ramp up our resources and expertise in the country, right. We have a number of projects with PdVSA where we are working with them to drive operational efficiency and obviously to help them drive up production. So we see Venezuela for 2014 to be one of the positives in Latin America.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of Jeff Tillery from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Wondering, if you -- you guys have introduced a couple of [leasebacks] (ph) to the U.S. frac market from your stat capacity. I wondered if you could just talk us through how you are thinking about further efficiency gains in your frac fleet here in the U.S. as well as the ability to for the market to absorb incremental capacity for new well this year?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think the overall activity in terms of new wells and in terms of frac stages is going to be up in 2014. And whether we will add more capacity into this, I think is going to be a function of the pricing and the incremental margins we will get on the addition of fleets that we put in. All the fleets that we have introduced over the past three quarters, these criteria have been met, and that\u2019s why we have been adding them, right. So we are currently today operating at 82% in terms of 24 hour operations, which has been obviously a key driver for efficiency. And other than that we are focusing in on term contracts. So we have about 90% of our pressure pumping contract volume on term. And we do that because we see that as a key element to help drive efficiency. That\u2019s how we get predictable work. And we have a close working relationship with our customers for planning and scheduling. And also having term contracts and longer term relationships other than the spots, also helps us in the way we work together with them in terms of technical collaboration as well as new technology introduction. So, I am reasonably optimistic about our ability to continue to gain share in that market. What\u2019s going to happen to base pricing, I think base pricing as of now we are looking for it to flatten out.","","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Your second question is just around the seismic outlook. I know the backlog can be choppy for that business, but it was up a reasonable amount sequentially to exit Q1, does that -- has that changed at all the Schlumberger outlook for the marine seismic business as the rest of the year plays out?","","Paal Kibsgaard","No, we haven\u2019t changed our outlook for the seismic business since January. So like you said, the backlog was up 196 million sequentially and 49 million year-over-year. This was driven both by land and marine. And in terms of the 2014 outlook for seismic, we maintained the outlook that we did in January, that it\u2019s going to be flattish in terms of overall spend this year. We continue to see pressure on basic marine pricing, we saw that in Q1. But in terms of Q2 and Q3 activity and our bookings and utilization is looking quite reasonable. So we did no change to what we looked at in January. ","Simon Farrant","Okay, that\u2019s all the time we have for questions today.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits, was $0.65. This represent decreases of $0.13 sequentially and $0.85 when compared to the same quarter last year.","During the quarter we reported $2.1 billion of pre-tax charges. These charges are the direct result of the very challenging market conditions we\u2019re operating in and they include severance, impairment, and restructuring charges.","The asset impairment charges largely relate to our North America business, which as you know has been the hardest hit during this downturn. All of these charges are described in detail in our earnings press release.","Our fourth quarter revenue of $7.7 billion decreased 9% sequentially. Approximately one-third of the revenue decline was attributable to pricing. Despite the very challenging environment, both in terms of pricing and activity, pre-tax operating margins only declined by 132 basis points sequentially to 16.6%. This was due to continued strong and proactive cost management across the entire organization.","Sequential highlights by product group whereas follows. Fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.2 billion decreased 7% sequentially, while margins decreased 230 basis points to 24.2%. These declines were due to decreases in exploration spending that largely impacted wireline internationally. We also did not see the year-end surge in multiclient and software sales that we typically experience in Q4.","Drilling Group revenue of $3 billion decreased 8%, primarily due to pricing pressure and activity declines internationally that have mostly affected drilling and measurements and M-I SWACO. As a result of strong cost management, Drilling Group margins only declined 173 basis points to 16.7%.","Production Group revenue of $2.7 billion decreased 10% primarily due to the continued decline in land activity and further pricing pressure in North America. Production Group margins were essentially flat at 11.3% as SPM projects and higher earnings from our investments in OneSubsea compensated for the effects of the lower activity and pricing pressure.","Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 18.2% in the fourth quarter. This was lower than the previous quarter by about 2 percentage points. This decrease was largely due to the geographic mix of earnings between North America and the Rest of the World, as well as the favorable revolution of certain tax contingencies and an R&D credit during the quarter.","Excluding the impact of Cameron, we expect the ETR in 2016 to be around 20%. On a pro-forma basis, we expect the combined Company ETR to be in the low 20s, although this would remain sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings.","Our cash flow generation continues to be very strong. During all of 2015, we generated $8.8 billion of cash flow from operations. During the fourth quarter, we generated $2.2 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $800 million during 2015 and $200 million during the fourth quarter.","In light of our strong cash flow generation, yesterday our Board of Directors approved a new $10 billion share buyback program. This new program will be effective once the remaining $1.4 billion of authorization under the current program is exhausted.","During the quarter, our net debt deteriorated a $343 million to $5.5 billion as we continue to invest in future revenue streams. During the fourth quarter, we spend $627 million on CapEx and invested approximately $600 million in SPM projects and $150 million in multiclient projects.","Full-year 2016 CapEx excluding multiclient and SPM investments is expected to be around $2.4 billion. During the quarter, we spend $398 million to repurchase 5.4 million shares at an average price of $73.86. This is despite being prohibited under the securities laws from repurchasing our shares for about one month prior to the Cameron shareholder vote.","Let me take this opportunity to talk a little bit about the Cameron transaction. In order to ensure an efficient capital structure within the group, Schlumberger Holding Corporation, our principal U.S subsidiary that we will also refer as SHC, is the legal entity that will acquire Cameron.","SHC will acquire approximately 137 million shares of common stock from its parent and transfer these shares to Cameron shareholders. SHC will also pay cash of approximately $2.8 billion in connection with this transaction.","During the fourth quarter, SHC issued $6 billion of notes. These notes have the weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.15% and have maturities to ranging from 2017 to 2025. SHC will use the proceeds from this debt issuance to partially fund the purchase of the 137 million shares from the parent company. SHC will then use a combination of cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings to finance the difference between the proceeds received from the issuance of these notes and the cash required to complete the Cameron merger.","As a result of this debt issuance, Schlumberger\u2019s pre-tax interest expense will increase approximately $40 million in Q1 as compared to Q4. As we close the Cameron transaction, we will begin to incur merger and integration related costs. These will include transaction costs, the cost of the integration team, one-off purchase accounting adjustments, as well as one-off cost to achieve the synergies. These amounts will be most significant in the quarter the transaction closes and the quarters immediately following the merger. We will separately call out these charges for you as are incurred.","And now I will turn the conference over to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you Simon and good morning everyone. Negative market sentiments intensified in the fourth quarter with global oil production of oil continuing, extending the various trend in global oil inventories and causing a further fall in oil prices, which reach a 12-year low in December. The worsening market conditions added further pressure to the deep financial crisis throughout the oil and gas value chain and prompt the operators to make further cuts to the already low E&P investment levels.","For many of our customers, available cash and annual budgets were exhausted well before the half way point over the fourth quarter, leading to unscheduled and abrupt activity cancellations, creating an operating environment that is increasingly complex to navigate and where the traditional year-end product and multiclient seismic sales were largely muted.","As planned we implemented another significant adjustment to our cost and resource base during the fourth quarter, including the release of 10,000 employees as well as further streamlining of our overhead infrastructure and asset base.","In spite of these significant structural adjustments, our overall fourth quarter results were in some areas impacted by events that were either outside of our control or where we chose to maintain cost and resource levels, pending availability of additional customer budgets in the New Year.","However, as we exited the fourth quarter, I believe we\u2019ve made the necessary adjustments to our cost and resource base and that we\u2019re well positioned to continue to deliver solid financial results in both the first quarter and throughout 2016, which will clearly be another very challenging year for our industry.","Looking closer at our fourth quarter results, global revenue fell 9% sequentially, driven by a continuing decline in rig activity and persistent pricing pressure throughout our global operations together with a broad range of activity disruptions, project delays and cancellations.","In North America revenue was down 14% sequentially, which is inline with the reduction in the drilling rig counts and driven by exhausted customer budgets and cash flows together with the extended holiday period.","Our North American pre-tax operating margins remain very resilient at 7.1% driven by proactive cost and resource management, excellent performance from our supply chain and distribution organization, strong execution and new technology sales from our operations, all of which were further supported by our transformation program.","On land, in both U.S and Canada, the weakening activity resulted in additional commercial pressure for all product lines and in particular in pressure pumping where pricing levels drop further into unsustainable territory for both operating margins and cash flow.","We also saw continuous pricing pressure and activity reductions in the U.S., Gulf of Mexico, as the drilling rig count drops by another 2% sequentially and where year-end multiclient seismic sales were largely muted.","Turning to the international markets, revenue were 6% lower sequentially as customer budget cuts, the start of the seasonal winter slowdown, and the absence of the traditional year-end product and multiclient seismic sales all impacted results. Our fourth quarter international operating margins drop to 22%, driven by a further pricing pressure and unfavorable revenue mix and a significant impact of activity disruptions, particularly in the Middle East and Asia.","In Latin America revenue declined 1% sequentially with pre-tax operating margins improving by 229 basis points to 23%. In terms of revenue, solid activity in Mexico and Ecuador was offset by a further budget reductions in Colombia and Brazil, while the weakening of the peso had a negative impact in our fourth quarter revenue in Argentina.","Margins remain resilient across the area as the cost and resource base adjustments made during the previous quarter took full effect and as we continue to leverage our transformation program. This combination more than offset the persistent pricing pressure we saw throughout our customer base.","In Europe\/CIS\/Africa, revenue fell 9% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins dropped 138 basis points to 20.8%. The drop in revenue was led by Russia and Central Asia, where a further weakening of the ruble, the start of the seasonal winter slowdown in Russia, and a noticeable reduction in activity throughout the Caspian region, all impacted the results.","In Europe, activity in Norway was resilient, but this was more than offset by a significant reduction in continental Europe and U.K., while in Africa solid in Nigeria and Algeria was not enough to offset the further weakening in the Central and West Africa.","In the Middle East and Asia, revenue declined by 5% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins decreased by 448 basis points to 22.5%. The sequential drop in revenue was led by Asia where we saw a general weakening in activity throughout the region, which was most pronounced in Malaysia and Australia, where project ended and customer budgets were cut further.","Fourth quarter revenue was also down in the Middle East, where solid activity in Kuwait and Iraq was more than offset by reductions in the rest of the region. In terms of operating margins, pricing pressure across the area was only partly offset by adjustments to our cost and resource base and where project cancellations, delayed start off of new project, and activity disruptions due to 2015 budget limitations, all contributed to the sequential reduction in operating margins.","Our fourth quarter results cap a year where we\u2019ve faced the most severe industry downturn in 30 years, but where we through proactive management and strong execution, have shown that we can navigate the challenging operating environment better than most and produce solid financial results while maintaining the bandwidth to pursue and capitalize on opportunities that strengthen the competitive position of the Company.","So as we prepare for another very challenging year, I\u2019d like to summarize what we\u2019ve delivered in 2015, as this sets a very good benchmark for our expectations and ambitions for the year to come.","Looking first at the top line, full-year revenue dropped by 27% in 2015, driven by a 39% drop in North America where we\u2019ve further strengthen our market position in spite of our decision not to pursue work that falls outside of our financial return requirements. Our international revenue fell by 21% in 2015, which is comparable to the drop in E&P investments.","Included in this revenue drop is both the impact of our higher leverage towards the exploration, deepwater, and seismic markets, where E&P investment saw significantly higher reductions and also included the impact of the strong dollar against a number of foreign currencies.","These revenue mix headwinds are fully absorbed in our results at this stage, which makes our international business a highly compressed coiled spring, which we will capitalize on when E&P investments and customer activity starts recovering. In addition to this, we\u2019ve in the past year significantly increased our tender win rate, which further strengthens our very solid contracts portfolio and puts us in a great position to increase market share going forward.","Looking at 2015 profitability, full-year global operating margins fell by only 342 basis points to 18.4%, as we maintained our wide margin lead in the international markets and as we now are also approaching a similar margin gap in North America. We\u2019ve managed to protect our margins due to a very proactive approach to cost and resource management and by further accelerating our corporate transformation program. Together these actions have delivered detrimental margins of 31% in 2015, which is about half the level seen in previous downturns.","Turning next to cash, our free cash flow in 2015 was about $5 billion, which represents net income conversion rate of 114%. This includes CapEx of $2.4 billion, which is now down to 59% of DNA, in addition to investments of $1.4 billion in future revenue streams in the areas of SPM and multiclient seismic.","Our ability to generate free cash in this part of the cycle is unmatched in the oil field services industry and gives us a unique ability to capitalize on the significant business opportunities that the current market conditions present. From our free cash flow we\u2019ve returned $4.6 billion of cash to our shareholders through $2.4 billion in dividend payments and $2.2 billion worth of stock buyback.","In addition to this, we\u2019ve spent about $500 million on M&A, where we continue to target smaller disruptive technology companies that we can integrate into our existing and future workflows and deploy through our expensive global organization. The strength of our free cash flow can also be seen from our net debt level which has only increased by $160 million on a full-year basis, driven by the financial performance I\u2019ve just described.","With respect to the pending Cameron transaction, the integration plans are now largely completed and we are fully ready for day one. We still expect to close the transaction during the first quarter of 2016, and we\u2019ve already received antitrust approvals from the U.S., Canada, Russia, and Brazil.","The fact that we structured the deal to include 78% of stock provides us with a necessary installation from the ongoing market turmoil and during the fourth quarter we also secured the required financing for our U.S entity that will make the acquisition.","Turning next to people, we\u2019ve in the past year unfortunately have to reduce more than 34,000 employees, which represents an unprecedented number for the Company and where we all have been impacted as we\u2019ve gone through the disheartening process of letting colleagues and friends go in all parts of the Company.","I\u2019m at this stage optimistic thing we\u2019ve completed the workforce reductions required in this downturn and I look forward to be able to shift focus throughout our organization from the negative sentiments of the past year towards a brighter future as we work through the remaining challenges of this downturn.","In terms of R&D, we did reduce investment levels in 2015, but we were still able to protect our capabilities and ensure the progress of all our key projects. In the past year we made solid advances on several new technology fronts through a combination of organic and inorganic efforts and we look forward to update you further on this in our external communications in the coming year.","And lastly in 2015, we significantly accelerated our corporate transformation program, stepping up both investment levels and the detailed engagement of our global organization. As part of this, we prepared a comprehensive and granular three-year transformation plan covering each of our 600 business units with specific deliverables and business impact goals set at all levels in our organization.","In parallel with this, we\u2019ve delivered noticeable cost savings and efficiency gains that can be seen in our 2015 financial results, together with a 23% reduction in our customer NPT rate, which is the largest annual improvement we\u2019ve ever achieved.","In summary, while 2015 has been extremely challenging year for the industry and for Schlumberger, we\u2019ve clearly demonstrated our ability to navigate a complex landscape and capitalize on the opportunities the current business environment presents and we\u2019re fully prepared to repeat these efforts and achievements in 2016. So while we all look forward to a recovery in the oil price, and the market conditions in our industry, it is evident that the longer the current market environment continues, the stronger we will emerge as a Company relative to our competitors when the upturn ultimately comes.","Turning next to the market outlook, we still believe that the underlying balance of supply and demand continues to tighten, driven by both solid growth in demand and by weakening supply as the dramatic cuts in E&P investments are starting to take effect. In North America, our shale oil production is declining more or less as we expected and was in December below the levels from one year ago.","The apparent resilience in production outside of OPEC and North America is in many cases driven by producers opening the taps wide open to maximize cash flow, which also means that we will likely see higher decline rates after these short-term actions are exhausted.","So while the global oil market is still being weighed down by fares to reduce growth in Chinese demand, the magnitude of additional uranium exports and the continued various trends in global oil inventories, we still expect a positive movement in oil prices during 2016 with specific timing being the function of the shape of the non-OPEC decline rates. This means that the market outlook for oil field services in the coming quarters will remain challenging at the pressure on activity and service pricing is set to continue.","It also means that 2016 E&P investment levels will fall for a second successive year and that any significant recovery in our activity levels will be a 2017 event. Still at Schlumberger we remain confident in our ability to weather this downturn much better than our surroundings and to our global reach the strength of our technology offering and our corporate transformation program, we\u2019re currently creating a considerable leverage that will enable us to increase revenue market share, deliver superior earnings and margins and continue to generate unmatched levels of free cash flow. Thank you very much.","We will now open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ole Slorer","Thank you. Thank you very much and congrats with another great -- relatively great year with free cash flow and solid performance.","Simon Ayat","Thank you, Ole.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thanks.","Ole Slorer","When it comes to the macro outlook that you just painted, how should we think about the overall oilfield macro cycle? And relative to the internal momentum that you\u2019re creating within Schlumberger with respect to the ongoing transformation process, I presume that a lot of the lowest hanging fruit has been picked in the transformation process. So if you could just bring us up to speed about how we should think about earnings projections over the next couple of quarters, several quarters with respect to those two kind of factors?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, if you look at our earnings trajectory in the coming quarters, it is obviously largely going to be driven by what continues to happen in the market around us in terms of the spend from our customers. But if you look at our ability to, I would say, counter the significant pricing pressure as well as the activity reductions, the transformation is indeed playing a significant role. I think it\u2019s fair to say, like you say that a lot of the low hanging fruits we\u2019ve already picked, but we\u2019re now getting into the deeper part of the transformation where we\u2019re making significant structural changes to how we go about doing our work and conducting our business. And this is basically laid out in the three-year plan that we worked on in 2015, which is going to take us from 2016 all the way out to 2019. And here we\u2019ve broken down all the initiatives into specific actions and plans and targets for all the various business units we\u2019ve around the world and I think with this, I would say, formalized way of driving performance I think we should look to put even more impact into our results in the coming three years and what you seen in the previous years.","Ole Slorer","Okay. I\u2019ll take that. With respect to the free cash flow that you generated and clearly having a strong balance sheet, today is, I\u2019d imagine, whereas an awful lot when it comes to the bargaining power that you\u2019ve around the world. So how should we think about the opportunity around generating that or putting that to work as internal CapEx versus SPM, which I saw you just picked up a bit now again in the fourth quarter, and versus acquisitions?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, first of all, we continue to have a very strong focus on generating the cash. And I think 2015 was another solid year. It was not perfect. There were several things that I think we could have done better, but $5 billion of free cash flow in this environment is not bad. Now how we go about spending the cash, there is really no change to the philosophy that we\u2019ve in any part of this cycle. The first thing we look to is to reinvest into the business and that is CapEx for the service and product segments that we have. In 2016, we\u2019re going to keep CapEx flat with 2015 and that you may ask why? If you look at the base business, it is indeed coming down, but we\u2019ve certain new activities that we\u2019re looking to invest into in particular the land drilling market for the rig of the future and there is a few other strategic investments that we\u2019re looking to make when it comes to our internal CapEx. In addition to this, we continue to invest in future revenue streams, both multiclient seismic where we\u2019ve a significant program going on in Mexico. And at this stage of the cycle, there are also significant SPM opportunities and we\u2019ve really stepped up our efforts in screening and evaluating these opportunities and we will capitalize on them when they meet our internal requirements. Beyond this, we review dividends annually. We are not increasing dividends this year. And then beyond that for the coming year, it\u2019s going to be a balancing of the opportunities we\u2019ve on M&A and the opportunities we have to buyback our stock. That is how we\u2019re planning to spend the cash. Simon, you want to add something?","Simon Ayat","No, I think you\u2019ve summarized it very well. I guess, 2016 is going to be marked by the big event of integrating Cameron and there is a lot of transaction as I described. We bought up $6 billion and we will be paying for the acquisition. We are also issuing shares, but we\u2019ve the $10 billion in new program that w e will commence as soon as we exhaust the previous one.","Ole Slorer","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James West from Evercore. Please go ahead.","James West","Hey, good morning, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","James West","And congratulations also on -- just excellent execution really all year for you and your management team and all your employees and especially in the fourth quarter.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you very much.","James West","I wanted to follow-up a little bit on what you were talking about there in the second part of Ole\u2019s question about really the SPM business. It seems -- I did notice the pickup in the fourth quarter, that\u2019s probably project timing, but are you -- at this point are you chasing more projects? Are you getting more inbounds? And you talked a little bit about or you mentioned that your screening process had been updated or upgraded. Could you talk a little bit more about that and how you see this playing out over the next couple of quarters, couple of years?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, we\u2019re seeing significantly more SPM opportunities at this stage, of the cycle, given our ability to generate cash and given the status of our balance sheet. So we\u2019ve -- we haven\u2019t changed our screening process, but we\u2019ve put more resources into it, so we can process more of these opportunities. And we\u2019re prepared to step up our investments in SPM. As you noted, there was a step up in Q4 and it might not be at that level every quarter going forward, but I\u2019d say that going into 2016 SPM is an area that we\u2019re interested in investing further in. It provides us with solid long-term contract. It provides us with the ability to deploy our entire capability set and generate good returns and good cash for the Company. So it is a very interesting opportunity set for us that we\u2019re actively pursuing.","James West","Okay. And then maybe another follow-up, the press release was littered with technology success stories and it seems like the technology adoption rate has picked up significantly during the downturn. I know you have given out numbers before on sales, percentage of sales on new technologies. Could you give us an update there on what you\u2019re seeing on the adoption rates and if that percentages has improved?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, during this downturn the level of new technology sales which is basically technologies that we have commercialized in the past five years is at a significantly higher level than what we\u2019ve seen in previous downturns. The new technology sales as a percentage of total revenues in 2015, is 24% which is markedly higher than what we saw in the previous downturn in 2008, 2009. This is partially down to the broad range of technologies that we have, and in fact that a number of them are focused on driving, I would say cost and efficiency for our customers. And these type of technology are as valid in terms of being bought and being operated during the downturn as they are in the upturn. So strong sales, and we continue to commercialize new technologies during 2015. So this obviously has had a very good impact on our financial performance in the past year, and I expect it to continue to do that in the year to come.","James West","Perfect. Thanks, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.","Angie Sedita","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Angie Sedita","I echo the sentiment, very solid quarter for the quarter and for the year given good business conditions, so well done. Maybe, Paal, we can go a little bit more granular on thoughts and obviously 2016 is a question mark, but thoughts into Q1 on a geo-market basis and walk us through where you\u2019re thinking on a revenue and margin sign, if you will?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I\u2019m not going to review the details by air Angie, what I think we\u2019re going to do. If you\u2019re looking for an indication of how we -- what we plan for and how we see Q1 shaping up, its going to be another very challenging quarter both from an activity and a pricing standpoint. The reasons new lows in oil prices is going to be reflected in lower REIT content and more activity disruptions we believe. This is going to be continued budget pressure throughout the first half from all customer groups where they now have to operate within cash flow. In addition we\u2019re going to see the winter slowdown in the Northern hemisphere in Q1 which is going to be another activity headwind. So I would say that, rather than going into margins and revenues, if we focus in on EPS, I would say that the current Q1, EPS consensus is probably a best case scenario from what we can see today in terms of Q1 earnings.","Angie Sedita","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on Cameron, I know there is only so much you can say at this point. But if you have any further color, you can talk about on the opportunity set within Cameron as you move forward. But also talk us through or walk us through the integration of Cameron within Schlumberger, both operationally and how it will show up in the financial?","Paal Kibsgaard","Right. So, on the start up of the integration we are largely ready with our integration plans. We\u2019ve had a sizable team made up of both Cameron and Schlumberger please working diligently on preparing these plans since we announced the transaction back in August. We reviewed all the plans in December and they have been approved, and we are basically ready for day one at this stage. Closing is now basically pending a few more countries in terms of antitrust approvals, and we do expect that we will close during the first quarter. In terms of synergies, the detailed work that we\u2019ve done has really confirmed the numbers that we put up at the announcement. Lots of opportunities which initially are going to be cost focus, but this transaction is largely a revenue transaction and we are very excited about what we can do by joining the R&D forces of the two companies and creating the integrated drilling and production systems that we have laid out earlier. In terms of integrating Cameron as an organization, it would actually be a fairly simply task. Because Cameron as it is today will become the fourth product group of Schlumberger together with characterization, drilling and production. And Scott Rowe, the CEO of Cameron is going to join us and continue to head of Cameron in its present form. So the main thing we were focusing are in terms of integration initially. It\u2019s going to be to coordinate the customer interface and to streamline the back office and also then morph or merge over time the R&D organization. So it is relatively a simple integration, because Cameron would slide in, in its present form into Schlumberger as the fourth group.","Angie Sedita","All right. Fair enough. Thanks. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead","Hi. Good morning.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Kurt Hallead","Good morning. I just had a -- I had a couple of quick follow-up questions and some discussions within investors around the SPM dynamic. And in that context, Paal, just given the decline in oil prices year-to-date and the write down on the project in Colombia, there\u2019s some questions out there just relating to potential incremental risk around existing SPM projects, and maybe you could put that into the context of maybe how you access risk on varying projects and maybe how you look at it from a portfolio approach?","Paal Kibsgaard","Right. So if you want to -- let\u2019s start off with the write down we did in Colombia which is really an isolated event. This is a project that\u2019s being going on between 10 and 15 years. We\u2019re in the later years of the project. And it\u2019s really the only project at this stage in our portfolio that has our compensation directly linked to the oil price. So with only a few years left and the oil price being at the very low level, this is what caused the impairment of the -- or the remaining balance we have. If you look at the rest of the portfolio and the new contract that we\u2019ve entered into in recent years, these are all fee per barrel type of contract where obviously the project economics are linked to the oil price, but where our compensation is basically an isolated fee per barrel set up. So as with any of these projects they do carry a higher risk than what our base business does. But we are -- I would say very comfortable with being able to -- I would say identify and manage these risks. And with the screening process we had with the internal approval process that we have, I\u2019m very comfortable with the step that we have in terms of the projects that we take on and that these all will generate very good returns for the company. And I would also say that the project in Colombia overall provided also very good returns and good cash flow throughout the life of the project.","Kurt Hallead","All right. That was great color. Then maybe if I could follow-up just on the margin front. If I understand correctly, you guys are trying to manage your business such that you can maintain a 20% margin maybe internationally here at the trough and maybe 5% in the North American market. I know a lot of that is being driven by your transformation process. And given the drop that we\u2019ve had recently in oil price and the impact that we\u2019ll have on E&P spend drop in 2016, how much harder do you think its going to be to maybe maintain those targets?","Paal Kibsgaard","But obviously fighting the margin pressure with both dramatic reductions in activity and significant pricing pressure, it\u2019s tough. We have the added tool in our tool kit which is the transformation on top of our very, very solid management team that is excellent at executing, but it is tough to maintain margins at the levels that we currently see. I\u2019m very pleased with how the North America team has managed and navigated in the past year, and 7.1% in Q4, I think is excellent. It\u2019s going to be tough to continue to keep it at these levels. But with the energy and the focus our team on the ground in North America has, I\u2019m optimistic that we will continue to significantly outperform the rest of the field there. Now if you look at the international margins, they are actually holding up recently well. We\u2019re now six quarters into the downturn internationally, and we\u2019re all at 253 basis points down which is basically half what we saw in 2009 in the last downturn. But it\u2019s a very dynamic environment, and there\u2019s always going to be quarterly variations driven by unplanned events. And if you look at LAM for an example, we had a big drop in Q3; yes we managed to close that back in Q4. Some of the actions that we put in place in the third quarter took full effect. Now in Q4 we did see a significant impact on our MEA margins and part of this is pricing and part of it is permanent activity reduction. But there is also a significant part which is temporary which is down to delays and stoppages. And if you look at the team we have on the ground, they have a long list of actions in place to address what they can in order to offset some of these margin headwinds. So I can't promise you that we\u2019re going to get all the margins back in MEA, but I would say that the MEA team is clearly unhappy having being surpassed by the LAM team at the most profitable area. So I really look forward to the internal competition between these two.","Kurt Hallead","That\u2019s great color. Thanks a lot, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Michael, your line is open. Check your mute button.","Michael LaMotte","Great. Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Simon Ayat","Good morning.","Michael LaMotte","Paal, you mentioned a couple of times the three year transformation plan, and I imagine you\u2019ll go into more detail in April. But can you just broad stroke the key categories that were identified as new areas of opportunity in the three year plan?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. There is no new areas that we have identified. What we\u2019re doing with the three year plan is that, in the past couple of years there\u2019s been a lot of work done in the central team formulate the detailed concepts and principals of how we want to change, how we operate our business. And these initiatives and these concepts are all now fully mature and they come together with a change management process that we have also put a lot of effort into designing. And what we\u2019re doing with the three year plan is basically formalizing how each of these initiatives will now be translated into actions and results throughout the global organization. So in the past couple of years we have been pursuing the low hanging fruit. We are now going into the -- to the structural changes of our business that would also provide an additional step of savings and improvements in the years to come. But the focus is around asset and inventory management, its maintenance and repairs, transportation, distribution, supply chain, back office, quality assurance. It\u2019s all the things that we\u2019ve talked about in previous years, but its now being formalized and itemized down to the business unit levels. We have around 600 business units down to the country level and they all now have specific actions and targets on each of these line items to implement the changes that we have been preparing centrally for the past few years.","Michael LaMotte","Okay. And as we think about the financial impact, is order of magnitude similar to the low hanging fruit, it\u2019s just the timing in terms of the flow through, the impact may take a little longer? How do we think about the implications on the financials?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I\u2019d say the impact of the transformation going forward will at least be as big as it\u2019s been in previous year and probably even higher in the years to come as we really start changing fundamental parts of how we conduct business. So this is not decreasing I would say, it\u2019s stable to increasing in terms of impact going forward.","Michael LaMotte","Okay. So low hanging fruit doesn\u2019t mean expect less going forward?","Paal Kibsgaard","No, absolutely not.","Michael LaMotte","Great. All right. Thanks. I\u2019ll turn it back.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","James Wicklund","Good morning, guys.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning, Jim.","James Wicklund","Obviously the Cameron, Schlumberger OneSubsea JV has been a big success, it led to marriage. And now you\u2019re doing an MoU with Golar, and looking on gas monetization solutions. Can you talk about how far the breadth -- how far this takes you, the Schlumberger Octopus grabs another segment of business? Can you talk a little bit about where this should go and why you did it?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well this is an MoU where we\u2019ve had -- we had good discussions about the concepts of how we can combine some of our capabilities and efforts with the capabilities that Golar has and this is something that we will continue to work with them going forward. It is an interesting I would say combination. And I don\u2019t have a lot of comments beyond this at this stage other than that it is the partnership that we\u2019re looking to establish and to grow going forward.","James Wicklund","Okay. And just again, breadth. You\u2019ve got now subsea, you\u2019ve got equipment, you\u2019re doing gas monetization. Kurt and James asked about the SPM business. You had said before in previous conference calls that you'd embrace a number of different business models. Is this the fruition of those kind of statements?","Paal Kibsgaard","I would say it is. But we don\u2019t know this, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that the main part of our business is, I would say oil free services and products and equipments. So we will continue to focus on leading each individual market that we continue, that we participate in for individual products and services. But with the integration capabilities and with the ability we have to pursue different type of business models, we are also looking to combine all of these things like you indicate Jim, to create more business opportunities for the company. So we are not pursuing only these. We have a huge focus on making sure that we standout and we continue to drive performance in the base business. But when you combine all of these things, there is a broad range of opportunities for us that we\u2019re also pursuing.","James Wicklund","That\u2019s very helpful. And my follow-up, if I could. Are we willing to take the chance and say that 2016 could be the bottom of the cycle or do you guys think today that 2017 will be worse than 2016?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think it\u2019s too early to say Jim, but I\u2019m -- I don\u2019t currently think that 2017 is going to be worse. I think -- but with that said, I\u2019m still not ready to say that we are troughing in 2016. I\u2019ll be focusing in on executing basically quarter-by-quarter. I\u2019m still optimistic, and I would hope that 2016 is the trough, but I\u2019m not ready to rule on it yet.","James Wicklund","We'll keep our fingers crossed as well. Thanks sir, very much.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Co. Please go ahead.","William Herbert","Thank you. Good morning. Back to SPM, I\u2019m curious with regard to the projects that you\u2019re seeing. Is there any change with regard to the kind of projects that you\u2019re seeing now on a leading edge basis, more offshore versus onshore? And then moreover, with regard to as you evaluate these projects, recognizing that there\u2019re are fee per barrel on the one hand, there must be an embedded oil price assumed as you\u2019re looking at these projects in terms of a threshold oil price is required for the NSC to make capital if it is an NSC partner on these. So can you talk about the mix of projects, how it has changed and embedded oil prices associated with the capital allocation?","Paal Kibsgaard","Right. So, on the projects there is no shift in what the projects are. I mean, we\u2019re looking at a certain set of projects. These are relatively small compared to what our customers would be interest in. And they are generally late life fields where we can come in and try to change the decline curve and add reserves and production to the field in late life. We are generally focused on LAM, and the only thing I would say is that the opportunity set has increased. There are more customers that are coming to us now that has these types of fields and they\u2019re interested in doing these types of business models with us. So there\u2019s not a dramatic shift in the type of assets that we\u2019re looking at, but generally there\u2019s more of them. And for the fields that we enter into a contract zone, obviously we will have to look at the total economics of the field for the lifetime of the contract which is generally I would say at least 15 years. So in that it\u2019s obviously important that the total project is economical, and then the way we set up our contract is today generally on the fee per barrel where we are I would say insulated against variations in oil price. That being said, if it goes down, we don\u2019t get hit at all. But again we are leavening the upside to our customers if oil prices are higher than what is in the assumption. So we have a very, I would say solid process on evaluating this. And like I said earlier in the call we\u2019re actively pursuing these type of contracts where we can get the terms that we want contractually, and where we are satisfied that the reservoir holds the upside both in production and reserves.","William Herbert","Okay. And another one from me, sort of an extension of Jim's question in terms of testing the boundaries as to how broad, how plausibly broad your business model extends to; and that is; are you contemplating or evaluating anything on the clean technology front?","Paal Kibsgaard","No, not at this stage. I mean, we continue to -- I mean, if you look at minimizing the environmental impact with what we do at the company and our carbon footprint absolutely, we have several programs in place both in terms of, of how we conduct business as well as how we develop new technologies on this. But in terms of venturing outside of our current space which oil conservatives, there is no plans of doing that at this stage.","William Herbert","Okay. Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Anderson","Great, thank you. A question on kind of your Middle East Asia Pac business; obviously margins came down a good bit this quarter and a lot going on behind the scenes. I was wondering if you could help me kind of sort out some of the dynamics behind there. You talked about some activity disruptions in the Middle East. There's pricing going on. Asia Pac is probably also down -- probably also going to get hit pretty hard as well. Can you help us kind of understand some of those and how much of that\u2019s kind of one time you think on the quarter?","Paal Kibsgaard","Now I tried hard -- I tried to answer that earlier David in the call and I would just say that, yes MEA margins dropped a fair bit in Q4, but there are variations in terms of all operations of activity that you will basically get some variations and in margins going forward. I gave LaMotte the example. Now there is significant pricing pressure. There is lower activity in parts of MEA, but are also some temporary aspects of what happened in the quarter where there were delays of big projects in terms of the startup where we had significant resources standing by and there were also some customers that stopped activity during the quarter because they were running out of annual budgets. And these budgets are going to be replenished now in January in which case we decided to carry the cost under resources. So I cannot promise you that we will regain all the loses in Q4 in terms of margins, but lots of actions in place to try to repeat what we\u2019ve done in LAM over the course of 2015.","David Anderson","Those operational disruptions, do you think a lot of those are going to come back in the first quarter?","Paal Kibsgaard","Some of them will. And some of the -- for the ones that -- well we know which one they are and those are the ones to be carried the resources for. And for the ones that aren\u2019t, you also know what they are in which case we have been cutting the resources.","David Anderson","And then on the pricing concessions, Paal you\u2019ve been talking about and you talked about it last quarter as well. Is this on kind of new work that's being tendered or is this kind of pricing concessions on existing contracts?","Paal Kibsgaard","It\u2019s a combination. When you tender for new work you will need to access what the growing rate in the market is, and in some cases you\u2019ll get the opportunity to hang on to the existing contracts or even extend them provided there are some concessions given. So this is a combination.","David Anderson","Okay. And would the transformation -- does the transformation you think offset pricing over time largely?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well if you look at internationally in 2015, we have managed to offset internationally quite a lot of it. Can we do all of it? That\u2019s probably going to be tough. But it is a significant counter to the pricing pressure that we\u2019re seeing, yes.","David Anderson","Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","William Sanchez","Thanks. Good morning. Paal, I was hoping before we ended the call that perhaps you could just speak generally about customer expectations internationally in terms of CapEx for \u201816. I mean, do you guys have a bottoms-up view yet at this point in terms of the size of the decline we could see as we try to think about calibrating overall top-line international revenue declines potentially for \u201816?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well I mean, if you look at 2015, national spend was down about 20%. And then there is a range of surveys out now from third parties and the kind of average or consensus from these surveys is about, I would say more than a 10% reduction in international spend. So, if you go by these then yes it will be another challenging year. But also I think while we look at full year numbers, I think its also important to keep in mind the five or six quarters slide we have seen now in international E&P spend where we have had a significant drop in our revenue from Q4 of 2014 versus -- down to Q4 of this year and into Q1 of \u201916. So while the year-over-year numbers for full year matters, I think it\u2019s also important to look at the quarter levels we have now which is obviously significantly down. And actually if you do the Q1 revenue consensus for us, based on what your guys, analysts have done, four times that is already 17% down overall in revenue for us. So in that sense, the current level of activity and spend is already way down on a full year basis going forward.","William Sanchez","Okay. Thanks for that. I guess Simon, one for you. Given the pending Cameron acquisition here in the first quarter, is there any blackout period on Schlumberger being able to buyback stock as we approach that close?","Simon Ayat","No, none. Actually we are -- we will, after the blackout because of the earnings which is just in couple of days, we will be free to go back to the market. No, none, Bill.","William Sanchez","Okay. I\u2019ll turn it back. Thanks for the time.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of Dan Boyd from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Daniel Boyd","Hi. Thanks, guys. I have a question for Simon, and more on the currency side continuing there. It looks like you\u2019ve done a really good job so far this year of managing the currency risk. So, I would just like to understand how do you manage the currency risk in SPM projects, especially as you ramp those? And then if you could just help us, you quantified the revenue impact from currency this year. Can you help us with the international margin impact from how well you manage the currency?","Simon Ayat","Okay. Well, thanks. The last question. Let me just take overall the currency situation. As far as our international operation overall we have a natural hedge which, what it means is basically we match the revenue that we get the local currency. It is inline with our local cost and local currencies, it varies between jurisdictions. So in some areas we loose a bit on the currency but then gains in other places compensate for it. In 2015, you\u2019ve seen the numbers; we have lost a lot of revenue because of currency. And almost 20% of the reduction of revenue between 2014 to 2015 was currency but actually did not impact the margin significantly. So it is all international. Yes, there is a bit of Canada, but the rest is outside NAM and we manage it as I said, it is natural hedge. We prevent ourselves from taking more local currency than we consume locally for local cost. As far as SPM is concerned, normally most of our SPM projects actually are dollar based, revenue wise, and those that have local currency they will basically reflect the same policy that I just mentioned to you, that we don\u2019t take more than what we locally require for our cost and the third part that it is also bigger in SPM project. So naturally -- we are naturally hedged.","Daniel Boyd","Okay. So that -- are you saying that your margins didn't benefit from the currency? If your EBIT held up this year, you could have a few hundred basis point benefit in your margin. Is that accurate?","Simon Ayat","No, the currency -- big impact of the currency this last year was, one because of Venezuela, because we changed the currency rate. But otherwise did not impact us on the margins.","Daniel Boyd","Okay. Thank you.","Simon Farrant","Turn it over to Paal, Matt ","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Simon. So before we close this morning, I\u2019d just like to summarize the three most important points that we have discussed. First the business environment in the oil industry we can further into fourth quarter leaving traditional reductions in both activity and pricing levels and making 2015 the worse industry downturn since 1986. In spite of this we delivered strong full year performance compared to previous downturns generating $5 billion in free cash flow and returning $4.6 billion in cash to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In addition we spent $500 million on technology acquisitions that further broadened our portfolio and yet we increased our net debt by only $160 million.","Second, 2016 will be another challenging year during which we will aim to continue to deliver superior financial results empowered with proceeding and capitalizing on the broad opportunity set the current market environment presents. We remain constructive in our view on the market outlook for the medium term, and continue to believe that the underlying balance of supply and demand is tightening driven by growth in demand, weakening supply as the massive cuts in the E&P investments take further effect and by the size of the annual supply replacement challenge.","Lastly we look forward to closing our merger with Cameron International during the first quarter where the integration planning is largely complete for day one, and with anti-trust approvals all progressing on track. We are excited about what the combination of our two companies will bring. I look forward to joining forces with more than 20,000 Cameron employees.","Overall we remain confident in our ability to continue to weather this downturn embedded in our surroundings through our global reach, the strength of our technology offering and the extent of our corporate transformation program.","That concludes the call.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.43. This represents an increase of $0.05 sequentially and up $0.08 when compared to the same quarter last year.","During the second quarter, we recorded $0.12 of severance charges. Our second quarter revenue of $8.3 billion increased 6% sequentially, largely driven by the growth in OneStim in North America and higher reservoir characterization and drilling activity internationally.","Pretax operating margins increased by 75 basis points to 13%.","Highlights by product group were as follows. Second quarter reservoir characterization revenue of $1.6 billion increased 5% sequentially, primarily due to higher wireline activity in offshore North America, further progress on OneSurface integrated production system projects and increased SIS sales internationally.","Margins increased 166 basis points to 21.4%, primarily driven by the recovery of higher margin wireline activity and stronger SIS software sales.","Drilling revenue of $2.2 billion increased 5% sequentially, while margins decreased 83 basis points to 12.9%. The revenue increase was primarily driven by strong international drilling activity as a result of the start of integrated drilling projects.","Margin was negatively impacted by startup costs associated with new projects as well as operational delays.","Production revenue of $3.3 billion increased 10% sequentially and margins increased by 239 basis points to 9.7%. These results were primarily driven by OneStim growth in North America combined with higher activity in the Middle East and Asia area.","Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 1% sequentially. This decrease was largely driven by declining project volumes in OneSubsea, which were partially offset by higher sales for surface systems and valve and measurements in North America.","Margins were essentially flat at 12.8%.","The book-to-bill ratio for the Cameron long-cycle business was at 1. ","Now, turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 17.2% in the second quarter compared to 17.6% in the previous quarter. ","Looking forward, the ETR will be sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. As a result of the continued recovery in North America, we anticipate that the ETR will increase next quarter and over the remainder of the year.","We generated $1 billion of cash flow from operations during the quarter. Our net debt increased $600 million during the quarter to $14.6 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investment of $3 billion.","During the quarter, we spent $103 million to repurchase 1.5 million shares at an average price of $68.45.","Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included CapEx of approximately $520 million and capitalized cost relating to SPM projects of $194 million.","During the quarter, we also made $693 million of dividend payments.","Full-year 2018 CapEx excluding SBM and multiclient investments is still expected to be approximately $2 billion.","And now, I will turn the conference call over to Patrick.","Patrick Schorn ","Thank you, Simon. And good morning, everyone. In my comments today, I will first discuss revenue growth by geography without Cameron and then conclude with some Cameron-specific remarks on second quarter performance.","Looking at our results in North America, revenue increased 12% sequentially. Or more precisely, revenue grew by 9% on land and by 22% offshore.","The land revenue increase outperformed both the 7% increase in the US land rig count and the 8% improvement in the US land frac market stage count.","In Canada, activity dropped as expected as the spring breakup took effect. Offshore revenue grew due to market share gains in the well construction arena. Multiclient seismic license sales were also higher as we continued to focus on the new asset-light model at WesternGeco. ","OneStim pressure pumping revenue grew by 17%, driven by the deployment of additional frac fleets.","Net pricing remained stable as increasing capacity across the market matched increasing customer activity.","We were also able to leverage the improved efficiency of our operations to grow revenue and gain market share. in particular, the investments in vertical integration supporting our pressure pumping operations has allowed us to respond rapidly to the increasing customer trend of separating pumping services from sand supply.","This means that we're able to bid competitively on both integrated or standalone sand supply contracts to participate in the full revenue potential of each, particularly as we add more capability in sand supply on a regional basis.","In the US land drilling market, activity was also strong with a growing customer interest in integrated well construction services, while demand also remained robust for rotary steerable systems.","Based on industry figures, the average length of laterals have increased by 30% over the past four years and new well designs that balance lateral length with optimized stimulated reservoir volume to maximize productivity and manage cost continue to be tested.","This approach is evident in SBM projects as well. The Palliser asset in Alberta, for example, restarted drilling activity after the breakup in June, initially with one rig, before quickly ramping back up to four rigs in early July. Drilling technologies have been key to increasing performance here.","PeriScope mapping service was combined with the PowerDrive Orbit rotary steerable system to enable drilling within a thin pay zone in three wells. A 100% reservoir contact was achieved in the same pay zones, which exceeds the previous reservoir contact of 85% to 90% in offset wells.","In addition, PowerDrive Orbit enabled a higher ROP than wells drilled by others and also achieved the longest lateral level drilled on this asset at a length of 4,244 meters.","Turning now to our international business, second quarter revenue, excluding Cameron, increased 6% sequentially as we responded to the challenges of mobilizing 29 rigs for new integrated drilling projects simultaneously in various geographies.","With the commissioning of the newbuild rigs in places and the reactivation of stacked equipment in others, startup costs and operational delays impacted our financial performance in the quarter.","In Latin America, revenue increased 3% sequentially. In the Mexico and Central America geo market, additional rigs mobilized for an integrated drilling services contract on land, while work over and production services also experienced increased activity.","In the Latin America South geo market, activity strengthened with projects restarting in Brazil and increased hydraulic fracturing and coiled tubing activity on an unconventional land SBM project in Argentina.","In Latin America North, activity was stronger in Colombia, while revenue was sequentially flat in Ecuador due to operational delays.","Revenue in Europe, CIS and Africa, across the product lines, excluding Cameron, increased 5% as drilling activity in the North Sea and Europe recovered from the winter slowdowns. This activity increase was concentrated around development work in the UK in addition to exploration activity in Norway after recent Equinor contract awards.","Drilling activity was also higher in Continental Europe and, in particular, in Romania. ","Revenue in Russia was essentially flat sequentially due to delays in the startup of summer offshore campaigns, while land drilling activity remains solid.","Revenue in sub-Saharan Africa increased with the start of new projects in Angola, Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Cameroon with well intervention activity accelerating and development work resuming in response to higher crude prices.","The North Africa geo market benefited from solid activity in Libya despite a challenging security environment and from integrated services activity in Chad.","Middle East and Asia revenue, excluding Cameron, increased 7% led by the Far East and Australia geo market.","In the northern Middle East geo market, good progress was made on OneSurface production projects in Kuwait and Egypt, while the Eastern Middle East geo market benefited from the startup of integrated drilling projects in Iraq.","In Saudi Arabia, an additional 8 rigs have now been mobilized for lump-sum turnkey work on the Ghawar Field, with limited revenue growth in the quarter due to delays and logistical challenges in the startup phase of the project.","In Asia, growth in the Far East and Australia geo market was due mainly to increased activity in Indonesia and offshore Australia, while China benefited from a ramp up in activity for shale gas and tight oil plays, including first gas production on a China SBM project.","In Southeast Asia geo market, operations began on drilling projects in Myanmar, Vietnam and India despite some startup inefficiencies. Southeast Asia experienced also some delays in Malaysia, although work on recently awarded contracts is strengthening as we move into Q3.","Last, let me turn to Cameron where increased revenue for Surface Systems and Valves & Measurements was more than offset by lower project backlog at OneSubsea. Revenue declined 1% sequentially as a result.","Geographically, the revenue growth in North America and Latin America was more than offset by weaker revenue in the Middle East and Asia, while Europe, CIS and Africa remained flat sequentially.","Beyond the numbers, I would like to highlight a series of contract awards that point to anticipation of more offshore activity restarts. For example, awards by Transocean marked the sale of the seventh new Cameron managed pressure drilling system. In addition, we extended existing service contracts to cover maintenance and service on BOP systems on 13 of Transocean ultra-deepwater and harsh environment fleet, as well as an order for a complete drilling package for deployment on a newbuild rate for service in the Caspian Sea.","These orders support our view that the broad-based recovery is now also reaching the offshore market where drilling contractors are beginning to order equipment to upgrade rigs in anticipation of increased activity.","And with that, let me pass the call over to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard ","Thank you, Patrick. And good morning, everyone. The broad-based recovery in the international markets has now finally started, which led us to recover sequential revenue growth in almost all geo markets and nearly product lines in the second quarter.","One of our many growth drivers in the emerging international upcycle is our integrated drilling business where we, through our systematic R&D investments and domain leadership in drilling hardware, fluids, software, have created a highly-differentiated well construction platform which today enables us to win most of the tendered work, while at the same time delivers solid financial returns.","Our tender win rates and backlog increase for integrated drilling projects over the past year is the highest we have ever seen. And based on these project wins, we will, in 2018, mobilize a total of 90 land rigs, mostly third-party, which by itself is equivalent to a midsize line drilling contractor.","In the integrated drilling business, the reduction of interfaces and improved definition of responsibilities between our customers and us create significant improvements in both quality and efficiency that benefit both parties.","At the same time, the performance-based contracting model and the increased freedom we get to optimize drilling plans, select the appropriate technologies and continuously innovate in the way we run our operations create additional value which is shared with our customers.","One example of the operational innovations we are currently deploying on all our new drilling projects is multi-skilling and remote operations, which allow us to reduce the overall headcount on the rig site by up to 35%.","Another example of operational innovation is how we are rapidly increasing the utilization of our operating assets through our global traceability system, our centralized planning centers, a more scientific methodology for equipment maintenance and our unique data-driven drilling optimization software.","As a result, our drilling and measurement product line is, for instance, on track to double the asset utilization of our globally sold-out rotary steerable fleet over the course of 2018 alone, which helps improve the financial returns and reduce the level of current and future CapEx investments.","Still, the ongoing mobilization of all the services needed for our new integrated drilling project will leave us with no spare equipment capacity by the end of 2018. ","In anticipation of this pending capacity shortage, we have already started to engage in pricing discussions with many of our customers, which will allow us to invest in additional capacity and it would allow our customers to secure this capacity in return for improved commercial terms.","In North America land, we continue to deploy additional fracturing fleets during the second quarter, while pricing stayed flat as industry capacity additions matched the growth in customer activity.","Although the rate of permitting and the overall activity levels remain high, the takeaway constraints in the Permian could temper the activity growth over the coming quarters, which is something we will monitor closely going forward.","During the second quarter, we completed a very important milestone in our transformation program with the successful rollout of our new and streamlined field organization just in time for the emerging international upturn.","This milestone caps six years of methodical investment into a new blueprint for our field operation workflows and organizational structure, including stronger and more professional functions, all equipped with cutting-edge planning, execution and collaboration tools.","The need to modernize our operating platform was clearly identified as far back as the late 1990s, but due to the technical complexity and the associated change management challenges, it was left unaddressed until 2012 when we launched our corporate transformation program.","Our modernized field operations and support organizations will, going forward, set new standards for internal efficiency, quality and teamwork, which will lower our need for capacity-related CapEx investments compared to previous cycles and, at the same time, support our promise of delivering 65% incremental margins in the coming upcycle.","As part of this transformation milestone, we also completed the second and last step in the simplification of our management structure, which will improve our agility and competitiveness and further lower our support costs.","This was the basis for the headcount related charge we took in the second quarter, as outlined by Simon.","Next, I would like to update you on the global oil market and how we see the oil selectivity unfolding in the coming quarters.","The fundamentals of the global oil market continue to evolve favorably for our international business as the balance of crude oil supply and demand tightens further.","Global GDP growth remains robust and oil demand growth was strong in the first half of this year, helped by cold weather in the northern hemisphere.","Despite the increase in crude prices, the reporting agencies have not made any changes to their global oil demand forecasts, which still stands at 1.4 million barrels per day for both 2018 and 2019, while we await further clarity around any potential demand headwinds from the ongoing US-China trade dispute.","In spite OPEC's recent decision to increase oil production, the supply base continues to weaken, with growing geopolitical pressure to remove Iranian barrels from the market, with no apparent resolution to the falling production in Venezuela, and with Libyan exports continuing to be volatile.","At present, OPEC spare production capacity is limited to 2.1 million barrels per day from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE, which is approaching the lowest levels seen in the last two decades.","In North America, the pressure on infrastructure and export pipeline capacity from the Permian Basin is becoming an increasing constraint to production growth, which will likely not be resolved until the second half of 2019.","The USA shale producers are also experiencing production challenges linked in part to well interference as infill drilling in the producing acreage increases and as drilling continues to step out from the tier 1 acreage.","And lastly, after more than three years of E&P underinvestment, the international production base has started to show accelerating signs of weakness with noticeable year-over-year production declines in 15 of the world's producing countries.","These developments underline the growing need for increased E&P spending in particular in the international markets as it is becoming apparent that the new projects coming online over the next few years will likely not be sufficient to meet the increasing demand.","Looking forward to the third quarter, we expect the broader-based international recovery to continue with sequential growth driven by Russia, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, while we expect more nominal sequential growth in Europe and Africa.","In North America land, we do not presently see any impact on the established activity outlook and we plan to continue to deploy additional fracturing and drilling capacity, while we closely monitor the evolution of the market, ready to adjust as needed.","Due to its nature, the backlog-driven business of Cameron has a cycle lag compared to our well-related product lines. However, the reduction in backlog for the long cycle businesses is starting to slow, while the short cycle product lines are responding well to the recovery in both the North American and international markets.","Overall, for the third quarter, we expect a similar rate of sequential revenue growth to what we saw in the second quarter with a corresponding EPS growth that should again be in the range of 10% to 15% as we complete the major mobilizations for our new drilling projects.","These numbers further assume a quick recovery from the offshore strike in Norway and the unrest we are currently seeing in the Basra region of Iraq, which have both impacted our operations in July.","Over the past four years, we have been opportunistic and expanding our offering to our targeted M&A program and our corresponding R&D investments, which has allowed us to increase our total addressable market by 50%.","Our broad and industry-leading technology offering, together with our unmatched geographical footprint and our fully modernized operating platform, make a very powerful combination that puts us firmly in the driver's seat to outperform in the coming global upturn.","And on that note, the entire Schlumberger team of 100,000 women and men are ready and primed to capture the growth opportunities coming from the positive market fundamentals we are now seeing.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up for questions. Thank you. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","James West","Hey, good afternoon, Paal. ","Paal Kibsgaard","Hey, good morning, James.","James West","So, it looks like, from my standpoint, 2018, you talked about 90 land rigs being mobilized, with the 28 last quarter. Offshore, starting to kick in. You're talking back about your 65% incrementals at some point here when we get pricing. Could you maybe give us an idea of what regions of the world \u2013 I mean, obviously, good growth in Asia and Australia this quarter and continued growth in the Middle East. What regions of the world \u2013 or is it just everywhere \u2013 that's starting to inflect? This is a big inflection for international.","Paal Kibsgaard","I agree with you. It is a big inflection for international. And I would say that we are basically seeing it everywhere. We're not going to see the same sequential growth rates from every region in every quarter.","James West","Sure.","Paal Kibsgaard","And while Russia and the Middle East was a little bit slower and sequential growth, this quarter, we're seeing them right back with strong performance anticipated for Q3.","Asia continues to be strong again for the second quarter in a row. And Latin America, which we only had about 3% sequential growth in Q2, is going to be a lot stronger again in Q3.","So, we are basically seeing new activity, new products being discussed, more activity on the existing products we have in pretty much every corner of the world. It's not going to be a straight line for each of the regions, but we are very encouraged with what we see. ","We have, with the management team being a lot in the field during the second quarter, seen a lot of our customers. And, overall, the mood is actually quite upbeat, which is quite a while since we have seen this on our field visits.","James West","Sure. Absolutely. And then, with respect to pricing, it sounds like you've got a little bit in 2Q or maybe some smaller contracts, but the discussion about the absorption of all your equipment by year-end, is that already a done deal based on contract awards that have already come through?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah. That's pretty much a done deal. That's basically mobilizing and honoring the commitments that we have already taken on. So, yeah, I would say, during the course of the fourth quarter of this year, we will be, I would say, fully utilized in the international markets. And beyond that, we will look at adding capacity partly through CapEx, but also a fair bit through driving the efficiency of our asset base that we have in place, now further helped by the upgrade we've done to our field organization.","But during the fourth quarter, we will be fully mobilized. And we have already started these pricing discussions with our customers. Part of it is going to be price book uplift. Part of it will be potentially better terms and conditions. And, in particular, also payment terms. We are still, I would say, not really satisfied with the evolution of our working capital and this is mainly down to slow payments from our customers, which we are actively looking to address.","James West","Got it. Good luck. Thanks a lot.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thanks, James. Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS Securities. Please go ahead.","Angie Sedita","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Angie Sedita","So, nice to hear the enthusiasm on the international side. It certainly feels more tangible than it has in sometime. So, maybe you could talk a little bit about some of your integrated project awards. I think that was a key factor in where you see it as absorption and capacity and how that plays into pricing.","And then, I know it's early, but maybe you had some early thoughts on international E&P spend for 2019. Is low double-digits a stretch or is that a possibility?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah, okay. On the first part of your question in terms of the areas of international, as we discussed with James, we see it generally everywhere at this stage at varying rates. But in terms of the drilling projects, we also see them in most regions, right?","Obviously, on land for lump-sum turnkey, we see that in Latin America, very much so in the Middle East and also some in Asia. And we also have integrated projects more from a project coordination standpoint happening on land, but also now occurring in the shallow water where \u2013 offshore where we also are starting to see an uptick in activity.","So, overall, it's quite exciting. It's been a while since we were able to kind of talk as optimistically about the international market as we can now. So, it's all positive.","Now, to your question on 2019, it's obviously early for us to make predictions about what our customers are going to do. I don't think they have really started their planning exercises yet. But, obviously, we have a pretty good handle on our revenue backlog from all the project wins we have and the outlook generally we have on our business.","And I can at least say from our standpoint that our growth in international for next year will be double-digit. Don't ask me where in double-digits, but it's going to be double-digits.","Angie Sedita","Okay, thanks. That's very helpful. And then, going to North America and the Permian, you made a little comment here on your deployments. So, maybe talk a little bit further about OneStim and the deployment for the rest of 2018 and going into 2019.","And also, very interesting on the sand strategy with the vertical integration, your commentary by your customers and should we expect further integration into sand. So, maybe a little bit on OneStim and then on sand.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah. On OneStim, we had continued to deploy our spare equipment. And we basically said that, by the end of this year, we will be in a position to have deployed it all. We will do whatever rebuild is necessary and that's currently ongoing. It's progressing well. And we continue to deploy now into the third quarter. We are aware of the emerging Permian takeaway constraints, but we have yet to see any real impact on the activity growth or any activity on pricing. So, we are continuing to deploy and things are progressing well with OneStim.","Now, as for the vertical integration, we have been investing into this now for about three years and we now own several sand mines. And our investment into sand mines will be concluded basically this month. We will then have sufficient sand mine capacity to take care of 100% of our current and also projected frac work. ","We see this as a significant competitive advantage going forward because there is a quickly growing trend from our customers now to separate the tendering for frac services and frac sand. ","And through the investments we've done and vertical integration, all the way from the sand mine to the rail, to transload and also trucking for the last mile where we have vertically integrated all aspects of this, not for 100% of our capacity, but for a fairly significant part, that allows us now to bit very competitively for the standalone sand tenders, which means that we can obviously compete in the entire revenue stream continuously, which would have been a lot more difficult in the event we were not vertically integrated.","So, we are basically done this month with our vertical integration investment program and we're now in a prime position to really take advantage of that and continue the deployment of the remaining spare frac capacity we have by the end of the year.","Angie Sedita","Thanks. Very helpful. I'll turn it over. ","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you. Thanks, Angie.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Scott Gruber","Thank you. Paal, can you discuss the outlook for the drilling segment, both revenues and margins in the second half? You mentioned double-digit growth internationally next year. Will the double-digit growth start to manifest within drilling in the second half just given all the rig deployments? And then, as the startup costs fade, how should we think about the margin trajectory within drilling?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah. So, I would say the double-digit growth was an overall Schlumberger international projection for next year. For the second half of this year, I gave some indications around how we see Q3. And, obviously, given the significance of these integrated drilling contracts, we expect significant growth within the context of the overall growth from the drilling group. There's been a heavy mobilization burden on them in the first half of the year. It will continue into, for sure, Q3, and that has impacted margins. We're not, obviously, happy with that level of margin, but we also understand that there are challenges with these type of deployments, right?","So, you can expect, going forward into the second half, that both margins will improve and we also would expect that the drilling group will be in the high-end of our sequential growth as we go into the third quarter.","Scott Gruber","Got it. And while we're on the forward outlook, consensus currently stands at $0.51 according to FactSet for 3Q, are you comfortable with that figure, given the trends you see today?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well as I said in my prepared remarks, our view in the third quarter is that we will again grow roughly on the top line at the percentage rate as we did sequentially in Q2, which is roughly 6%, which I think is more or less in line with the revenue consensus.","On the EPS side, we're still again looking at probably 10% to 15%, which, if you do the math, will probably be in between 47 and 50. And again, that's going to come down to how effective we are in getting the mobilizations done. And the quicker you get the mobilizations done, the lower your cost will be and the quicker you will also get the wells into a position where you can recognize the revenue and the profit.","So, there's a bit of a range and it is down to the fact that we still will have a very heavy burden to lift on the mobilizations. So, that's the kind of range I would give you at this stage.","But I would say, overall, what is really driving our business going forward is going to be our ability to drive the topline and I'm very pleased with where we sit in terms of contracts, tender wins and the fact that we can execute these contracts going forward.","Scott Gruber","Got it. Thanks for the [indiscernible] color. ","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead","Hey, good morning, Paal. Appreciate that summary on the operational outlook. Maybe I can ask a question here relating to cash use, cash flow expectations, especially as you get these projects up and running internationally and maybe even kind of give us a rough glimpse on how you expect free cash flow maybe through the back half and maybe give a rough sense as to what cash flow could look like as we go into next year.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah. I'll make a couple of quick comments and I'll hand it to Simon to elaborate a bit. But I would say, first of all, we are not satisfied with the free cash flow in the second quarter and even the first half overall. The main issue around the cash flow is the consumption of working capital. And while we have a pretty good handle on inventory and payables, the main issue here is still high DSO and customers paying slowly.","I'm not worried about being paid ultimately, but the rate of payment is too slow. And this is something we're already addressing in our commercial discussions with our customers. We had a very good handle on the internal part of the DSO, but we know need to get a bit more traction on the customer side.","So, typically, our cash flow \u2013 free cash flow improves considerably in the second half of the year, which we do expect it to do this year as well. So, we're overall going to be on track for the year as we plan, but the start in the first half has been slow versus our expectations.","Simon, you want to elaborate?","Simon Ayat","Not much to add here. But as Paal mentioned, we're not happy with the first half. It is similar to what we did last year, but we should have done better.","The working capital consumption was a bit higher than what we expected. But the second half of the year we always improve and we expect the improvement to come and meet our target for the year.","You ask on next year, well, we haven't done any detailed work yet, but given the fact that it is going to be a better year with our growth and we are \u2013 we will maintain our investment at a level which is \u2013 that meets this growth. So, we expect to do better.","The other element of the cash consumption is, obviously, buyback. As you see, we will continue for this year at the modest level. So, in order to preserve the cash to meet the business needs.","Kurt Hallead","Okay. Appreciate that. Maybe I can follow-up as well. Paal, you reference you're still \u2013 or have a target of over 60% incremental margins. Obviously, as the cycle kind of kicks in, you get pricing. Sounds like you talk about a broad-based recovery, you talk about accelerating activity levels, you talk about improving pricing on the international front and then double-digit kind of revenue growth internationally next year. ","I don't know. Is it safe enough for us to assume that, with all that as the backdrop, that you could potentially 60% incremental margins in 2019? I'm not trying to hold you to that or pin you down. I'm just trying to kind of gauge based on your commentary and what you've said your targets were in the past.","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, we're ready to ultimately be held to the 65% incremental. That's for sure. Whether we will see the full effect of it next year, I think it's going to come down to how much pricing we will get.","What I'm very confident about is our ability is to drive the internal efficiency from all aspect of our operations, right? And what we have done this quarter with the full implementation of our, I would say, fully modernized operating organization is going to be a key driver to make that happen. So, there is a lot of excitement in our field operations around now having his organization in place, with cutting-edge tools and the ability \u2013 they know how to drive overall efficiency from the vast international operating base that we have. So, this is going to be a key component of ensuring that we deliver on the 65%.","So, whether we get all the way there next year, I think it's going to come down, I think, more of how much pricing we get because I'm very confident about our own ability to execute efficiently.","Kurt Hallead","Okay, great. Thanks, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you very much.","Operator","Next, we to go to the line of Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","James Wicklund","Good morning, guys. ","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning, Jim.","James Wicklund","And I'm glad we get to talk about international and we can now talk about international pricing. So, that's all indicative of things definitely improving.","Paal, I realize that we haven't planned for 2019, 2020 and beyond. But I look back at your margins and reservoir characterization and in drilling, which are your most international segments. And in 2015, you had margins of 26% in reservoir characterization and 18% in drilling and we're well below that now.","I'm not asking when those margins recover, but is there anything fundamentally different in the market going forward that would stop you from getting back to those historical margins at some point in the next couple of years?","Paal Kibsgaard","Jim, no. I don't think there is. Obviously, we have conceded on price a fair bit over the past four years. ","James Wicklund","Yeah. That's near term, though. ","Paal Kibsgaard","Absolutely. ","James Wicklund","It takes a long time to recover.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah. So, no \u2013 and I'm confident that we can recover at least a fair bit of that. And I think that alone, I think, should be enough for us to get back to those kind of margins. This quarter, reservoir characterization made a pretty big step forward already.","And the main issue around the drilling margin is not, I would say, the overall execution capabilities and the technology portfolio, which is highly differentiated. It is the fact that we are carrying a lot of mobilization and startup costs and, with that, inefficiencies.","So, I would expect you to see fairly noticeable margin progression over the coming quarters in drilling. So, for us to within next few years get back to those margins that you were indicating for characterization and drilling, I see as absolutely achievable.","James Wicklund","Excellent. Excellent. That's very helpful. My follow-up, if I could, we talked a little bit about Cameron. I know the book-to-bill is at 1. The backlog declined a little bit. There's been a lot of talk about FIDs picking up this year, but from an exceptionally small base. A lot of the FIDs that have been issued are getting slow-rolled by their clients.","Can you talk a little bit \u2013 you have so much exposure and margin exposure to deepwater \u2013 and deepwater, the offshore drillers have, obviously, ran and their stock price is up this year. Is there any increased visibility on when deepwater may start to pick up and when Cameron may move that book-to-bill from 1, which is just fine, to a higher number? Do we have any visibility on deepwater at this point?","Paal Kibsgaard","Patrick, do you want to comment?","Patrick Schorn","Sure. So, Jim, I think that, at this moment, and what we have continuously said is that once the recovery starts, we obviously start seeing it on land and we clearly are now having very clear evidence of what is happening in the shallow offshore.","Equally, we are preparing ourselves further for deepwater to start again as well. Whatever size of a bonanza this is going to be, I think, at this moment, it's somewhat unclear. ","But from the work that we have been doing in completing our technology portfolio, making sure that we have a leading technology on the boosting side and, clearly, the work that we already signaled that we're doing with Subsea 7 to get a JV that prepares us even more to be ready to play significantly in this market, we do see that we are going to go back in the years to come into deepwater activity because looking at the longer-term supply\/demand, there is a certain amount of assets that will have to be developed.","So, we're still positive on this market. I think, at this moment, it is a little bit tough to call a deepwater revival short term, but we are preparing ourselves further and, certainly, expect over the longer-term the book-to-bill to go in more favorable numbers.","James Wicklund","Okay, gentlemen. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Dave Anderson with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. ","David Anderson","Hi, good morning. So, as you're ramping on the LSTK contracts and you talked about the 90 rigs you're mobilizing this year, I was just wondering kind of what this looks like going forward. You, obviously, have quite a bit of appetite for this stuff to work. Could you see another 90 rigs, let's say, mobilized next year. I'm just trying to get a sense as to, ultimately, kind of the breadth of this opportunity that you're seeing coming in front of you here.","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, at this stage, we don't have visibility into 2019 for that, but I think it's fair to say that we're not expecting to see a similar type of ramp up of that number of rigs in 2019. We expect to be very competitive in every bid that is out there for lump-sum turkey anywhere in the world at this stage. And we feel very confident in our ability to compete and win these tenders and also turn the tenders at competitive rates into good profits for Schlumberger.","But I don't anticipate the same level of ramp up in 2019 as in 2018.","David Anderson","Is this still largely concentrated in Saudi and I think we see a little bit of Oman. Can you just talk about maybe some other \u2013 I don't know if you want to get too specific here, but are you starting to see it's more broad-based in the Middle East or it's still sort of concentrated in Saudi?","Paal Kibsgaard","No, it is not concentrated in Saudi. Saudi is a very important market for us. And we have a big ramp up of rigs in Saudi over the year. But we have, in addition to that, countries like Mexico, Iraq, India, just to name a few and there are other countries in the Middle East and Gulf area as well where we are starting to take on these double contracts. So, this is much more broader based than one particular country.","David Anderson","Thank you. On a similar subject, Patrick, you had talked about the Palliser block and where you are with the four rigs. I was wondering if you could give us a little toast, kind of where you are in terms of the progression on the wells and the success of that project. We haven't heard too much about that.","And during the quarter, there was some talk about monetization. I was just wondering what that means. Does that mean you could potentially be kind of maybe selling out some of your working interest to taking on partners? Just if you could give a little bit more color on that, that will be great. Thank you.","Patrick Schorn","Okay, Dave. So, at this moment, we have about 15 active SBM projects. Palliser, the one in Canada, we did talk about that. We are at the moment active again with four rigs. We'll do well over 100 wells on that asset during this year. As you noticed, it is one way we are shifting from a gas-producing asset to an oil production. The wells are performing very well. We're pleased with the reservoir performance that we see, with the well locations that we have. So, this is going as per plan. Quite keen on that.","Ecuador remains active for us with the three assets that we operate there. In Argentina, we're picking up further on the Bandurria Sur asset. And, again, there, we're having very good success with the technology that we deploy in the reservoir.","And then, maybe the last one to highlight would be Nigeria where we have a project with First E&P and NNPC. And that is on track to FID here very, very soon.","So, just to give you a bit of a broader view on it, the opportunities for new projects really remain plentiful, but we are only considering those at the moment that really fit with what we call the SBM-light business model, where capital intensity and cash flow are much more key criteria in defining which project ultimately fits with us and which doesn't, which is much in line with the communications that we have had previously.","So, in the SBM-light context, we've also spoken about monetization of the SBM investments. And there are several assets in our portfolio that are reaching a level of maturity where we have generated the value that we are going to be able to sell. And maybe we'd have to think really about farming up or selling certain portions of our equity in these fields. And this is what we want to do in the next 12 to 18 months once we really start reaching peak valuation on them.","On the last point, maybe around SBM, what was highlighted during this quarter was that we exited the OneLNG venture which might've come a bit as a surprise. It's still a business that we believe very much in, which is a business around stranded gas and FLNG technology. But, for us, it has been a decision that we exited purely based on the intensity of capital required for this project. And when we entered, we were very clear on \u2013 we are very keen on investing in the upstream, not so much in investing in the vessels itself as that's really not where our money is best employed. ","And maybe with that, I've given you a bit of an idea where we are with the main activities around SBM.","David Anderson","Great. Thanks, Patrick.","A - Patrick Schorn","Thank you, Dave.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons. Please go ahead.","Bill Herbert","Thanks. Good morning. Paal and Simon, so assuming a double-digit increase in international revenues for 2019, how should we think about capital spending consolidated as a percentage of revenues in 2019? Should it look much like it has in 2018 or should the capital intensity go lower given the mobilization unfolding for this year?","Paal Kibsgaard","So, obviously, we haven't gone through the detailed planning for next year. So, it's early to kind of make firm statements about this. But I think, directionally, I think you can expect that the CapEx as a percentage of our revenue going into this upcycle versus previous upcycles is going to be considerably lower.","What the absolute number for 2019 CapEx would be? Like I said, it's too early. But I think the planning number I would have on my piece of paper today would still be around the $2 billion mark. And I think, with that, coupled with the big upside we are now starting to see from the complete modernization we have done of our operating platform is going to drive significant asset utilization efficiency.","I mentioned in my prepared remarks that drilling and measurement, for instance, in 2018 alone will double their asset utilization of our sold-out PowerDrive technology. So, you can expect us to be, for the base business as well, a lot more capital efficient in this upturn compared to what we have been in previous upturns. And we haven't been too bad in the previous upturns either.","Bill Herbert","Okay, great. Thanks. And you mentioned that pricing was stable in the second quarter for Lower 48 and I presume that meant frac and OneStim. I'm just curious, given the occlusions that are unfolding in the Permian and the slowdown in drilling activity that we've seen in the past eight weeks and what likely will be a slowdown in completions activity, can you comment on the cadence of OneStim deployment going forward?","And then, moreover, just your expectations in general for pricing. It seems like it's softening on the margin for the industry.","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, in terms of the cadence of the OneStim capacity deployments, I don't want to go into the details of it. Other than that, we basically said that over the course of this year, we would rebuild the equipment and be in a position to reintroduce it into the market. We are continuing to progress well with that plan. There will be always some variations in the deployment rate by month or by quarter. But, at this stage, we are not altering the plan based on some of these takeaway constraint discussions that are on the Permian. We have yet to see that in the projected activity growth. But, again, this is something we will monitor very closely. And in the event, there is a need to adjust, we will adjust. But as of now, we are continuing to deploy. And this is why we are outgrowing both the rig count and the stage count in the market with these deployments.","And as to pricing, flat pricing for the OneStim business roughly in the second quarter and we have not seen any kind of major movements beyond that so far into the third quarter either.","So, looks pretty stable as per now and we continue with our plan. And as with anything in the North America land market, you've got to be on your toes because it can change quickly.","Bill Herbert","Okay, thank you. Next, we go to the line of Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jud Bailey","Thanks. Good morning. A question, Paal, if I could. You referenced the expectation of double-digit international revenue growth next year. I'd be curious \u2013 number one, how do you think about visibility for choosing that kind of growth next year? And then, number two, how do you think about the drivers of that growth? I guess, for me, their regional standpoint and also how you'd see the potential split between offshore and onshore growth playing out next year as well?","Paal Kibsgaard","Again, I gave the double-digit international growth numbers basically because we are confident on the backlog we have of contract wins. And we know where these wins are and how it's going to shape up. Now, we have not done the detailed planning. So, I can't give you any kind of granular review of where it's going to come. But, in general, we see growth in all geographies next year. I would say, land is still likely to be the driving force of it. Obviously, a lot of our lump-sum turnkey sits on land. And this is where the shorter cycle barrels are. But I think we will start to see movement in particular on shallow water as well. I believe there are some movements in shallow water rig rates, which I think is a very good precursor to what is likely to happen.","And going back to deepwater, deepwater drilling activity in 2018 is roughly going to be 10% up versus 2017. And I think the growth in deepwater would probably continue and potentially accelerate as well into 2019.","So, I know I'm not giving you the details you're looking for mainly because we haven't done the detailed planning as of yet, but I see no region of the world which we see as a region that is not going to grow in 2019. And we find that to be very good news.","Jud Bailey","Okay. I appreciate the comments. And I'd say, my follow-up would be, most of the commentary so far industrywide has been on the expectation that development work will kind of dominate the next leg of deepwater activity. Are you seeing any hints of improvement in terms of exploration on the deepwater side? Or is it still dominated from [indiscernible] side?","Paal Kibsgaard","It's a good question. Obviously, in terms of the absolute volume. it is dominated by development. But we are starting to see that exploration spend appears to be turning a corner as well. I mean, the current level of exploration investment over the past, whatever, three, four years is, obviously, clearly, not sustainable. And we are starting to see some uptick there. Q2, in terms of exploration rig count, was actually up 22% sequentially and about 7% year-over-year. And we expect that, in 2018, exploration, drilling and well services spend is probably going to be around 12% higher than 2017. So, both deepwater and exploration is starting to show kind of double-digit growth already in 2018. And I can only see that accelerating going into 2019.","And associated with exploration, we are actually also starting to see more interest and more discussion with our customers again on formation evaluation. This being either wireline or LWD and actually customers going back into \u2013 talking more reservoir with us. And, obviously, this is very good news for some of our high-end measurement related businesses as well.","So, exploration is coming. And it's also associated with increased focus on reservoir information evaluation.","Jud Bailey","Great, thank you. I'll turn it back.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","And our last question is from the line of Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Waqar Syed","Thank you very much. Appreciate that. Paal, the pricing improvement that you expect later in the year, would that start to have a benefit in first half of 2019 or do you see that, by the time it turns into contracts and revenues, it could be late 2019 or even 2020?","Paal Kibsgaard","No. I think the pricing discussions we are starting to have now \u2013 and we had some pricing improvements already happening in the second quarter, they're not big enough to be material, so you can see them in our results. But we tracked it very carefully and we have specific plans by customer and by contracts and by market on how we're going to engage into recover some of the big concessions that we have made.","So, the pricing improvements we are now discussing and seeking should have a gradual impact on our results going forward, right? So, I would say the discussions we are having in the second half of this year should have an impact on our results in the first half of 2019. To what effect? It's still early to say. But with activity continuing to go up, with ourselves at least being fully deployed capacity-wise by the end of the year, I think it's only natural that pricing comes up and starts to have a \u2013 be a bit of a tailwind on our results and it's been a pretty significant headwind for, what, four years in a row now. So, I'm encouraged in terms of what I'm seeing around the pricing discussions and also optimistic that this will become more of a noticeable tailwind as we go into 2019.","Waqar Syed","And then, just finally on that \u2013 as you go into 2019 and you're expecting a revenue growth internationally in double digits, could you do that with the same kind of capital budgets, around $2 billion, or do you think the CapEx will need to grow as we go into next year?","Paal Kibsgaard","No, we can do that with that same CapEx budget of $2 billion. That's on the back of the modernized field operating platform.","Waqar Syed","Okay, great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. ","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Waqar.","Paal Kibsgaard","So, before we close today's call, let me summarize the main messages. Oilfield activity strengthened in the second quarter, both in land in North America and also throughout the international markets. And as a result, we delivered strong sequential revenue growth. ","With a total of 90 rigs being mobilized over the course of 2018, the integrated drilling services model is one of our many growth drivers in the global upcycle we are now entering.","The second quarter saw us complete an important milestone in our transformation program as we rolled out our modernized field and support organization.","And linked to this, we also completed the second and last step to simplify our management structure, which altogether puts us in a great position to outperform in the emerging global upturn, both in terms of topline revenue and bottom-line earnings growth.","With that, we conclude today's call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Malcolm Theobald, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Malcolm Theobald","Thank you, Keeley. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited First Quarter 2012 Results Conference Call. Joining us on the call from Paris today are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results, and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights. ","However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements. [Operator Instructions] And now I'll turn the call over to Simon.","Simon Ayat","Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.98. This is a decrease of $0.13 sequentially and an increase of $0.27 compared to the same quarter last year. ","Oilfield Services first quarter revenue of $9.9 billion decreased 4% sequentially. This decrease is largely attributable to the effect of the traditional year-end surge in product, software and multiclient sales that we experienced in the Q4, as well as the previously announced lower reutilization and downward pricing trend in our North America hydraulic fracturing business. ","Oilfield Services pretax income of $1.9 billion decreased 10.4% sequentially while pretax operating margins declined 147 basis points. Sequential revenue and pretax margin highlights by product group were as follows: First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.6 billion decreased 7% sequentially, and margin declined 189 basis points to 26%. These decreases were due to the seasonally strong WesternGeco market client sales, robust year -- end of year SIS software sales that we experienced in the Q4. ","Drilling Group first quarter revenue of $3.8 billion was flat sequentially, while margins improved 28 basis points to 17.4%. First quarter Production Group revenue of $3.5 billion decreased 4.4% sequentially, while pretax margin fell 338 basis points to 17.6%. These decreases were primarily attributable to the pricing pressure, lower utilization and cost inflation in Well Services North America, as well as the effect of the seasonally strong completion and Artificial Lift Q4 product sales. ","From a geographic perspective, North America margins declined 409 basis points to 22.8%, while international margins were essentially flat at 19.1%, despite the significant impact of the Q4 product and software sales and the seasonal drop in activity in Russia, China and the North Sea during Q1. ","The Distribution segment contributed $713 million in revenue and $35 million in pretax operating income. Last week, we announced that we reached an agreement to sell Wilson. We will, therefore, report our entire Distribution segment as a discontinued operation in the second quarter. ","Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 23.8% in the first quarter, consistent with the previous quarter. We still expect the effective tax rate for the full year 2012 to be in the mid-20s. However, this can vary on a quarterly basis due to the geographical mix of earnings. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $5.8 billion as compared to $4.85 billion at the end of Q4, representing a $951 million increase, resulting from the seasonal deterioration in working capital we typically see during Q1. ","Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $961 million of CapEx and $324 million of stock repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.38 million shares at an average price of $74. CapEx is still expected to be approximately $4.5 billion in 2012 as compared to the $4 billion we spent in 2011. And now I turn the conference over to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Simon. Our first quarter results showed good progress as we continued our strong focus on execution and operational excellence. In terms of activity, we saw growth in exploration and deepwater markets in line with our outlook for the year, while we experienced the normal seasonal slowdown in multiclient and product sales, as well as in activity levels in some areas of the northern hemisphere. ","In North America, we executed well in all parts of the business during the quarter. Sequential revenue was down 3.5%, and margins were down 409 basis points, driven by lower multiclient sales and the dynamics in the hydraulic fracturing market. We have, over the past 2 quarters, signaled that hydraulic fracturing pricing is starting to come under pressure. And during the first quarter, the downwards pricing trend seen in the gas basins also reached the liquids-rich basins. So far, the pricing impact varies by basin as excess capacity is moved around, but we expect to see lower pricing reaching all basins in the coming quarters. In addition, the continued movement of rigs and frac capacity adds costs and lowers utilization, which together with the pricing impact, puts pressure on margins. ","Elsewhere in North America land, our wireline logging, coiled tubing and some drilling product lines saw revenue growth, while pricing remained flat to slightly up. In the Gulf of Mexico, deepwater activity grew in line with our outlook for the year and was further supported by a number of new drilling permits granted during the quarter. Our deepwater market share and operational performance remains very strong and are reflected in our operating margins, which are now back to pre-moratorium levels. ","In the international markets, revenue was down 4% sequentially due to lower product sales and the seasonal slowdown in Russia, China and the North Sea. At the same time, sequential margins were essentially flat, driven by very strong execution in all areas. During the quarter, international activity progressed in line with our outlook for the year, driven by the deepwater and exploration markets, in particular in East and West Africa and also by strong land activity in the Middle East and North Africa. ","In terms of pricing, bidding remained competitive on large tenders for standard technology. However, we see pricing sentiments are starting to move upwards, as most of the large international contracts have now been rebid and our service capacity is getting tighter. Before discussing the quarter's results by area, I have a few comments on Marine seismic where vessel utilization was strong during the first quarter. At this stage, we are already fully booked for Q2, while Q3 capacity is filling up quickly, driven by higher activity in West Africa, the North Sea, the Arctic regions and Brazil. While some of the upcoming work was bid last year, current bid pricing is up around 10%, and we expect pricing to continue to go up as the year progresses. The WesternGeco backlog increased by 16% during the quarter. ","In the Middle East and Asia, revenue was down by 4% sequentially, while margins were down 40 basis points. During the quarter, we saw strong activity growth in both Saudi Arabia and Oman, and this trend is set to continue for both countries in the coming quarters. In Iraq, the steep growth trends took a pause in the first quarter, as a number of our customers postponed awards and startups of new contracts, due to uncertainties around the security situation and infrastructure capacity. Towards the end of the quarter, sentiments were again turning positive. And following award of the outstanding bids in the second quarter, we expect to see strong growth in the second half of the year. ","In Latin America, revenue was down 4% sequentially, while margins were up by 182 basis points. In Mexico, offshore activity continued to grow during the quarter, and we also saw a moderate increase in IPM activity on land. We are currently mobilizing for the Carrizo production incentive contract, with operation scheduled to start around midyear. In Brazil, the deepwater rig count remained flat during the quarter, while we saw solid activity in our IPM projects. There continues to be active bidding for Petrobras with award of the main outstanding contracts likely taking place over the next quarters. In Ecuador, we signed a production incentive contract for the Shushufindi field during the quarter, with planned start-up around midyear. ","In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue decreased by 3% sequentially while margins were down by 109 basis points. During the quarter, we saw strong growth in activity in Nigeria, Angola and East Africa, driven by both deepwater exploration and the major development projects. And the activity outlook for seismic and rig-related services in this region remains very positive. In Russia and the North Sea, we experienced a normal seasonal slowdown due to winter weather, but both markets are on track for solid activity growth for the year. In Libya, activity continued to grow during the quarter, and we're also back to profitability in March. Activity will continue to ramp up during the year, as additional rigs become available and is set to reach pre-conflict levels in early 2013. ","Let me now turn to some of the technology highlights. The Reservoir Characterization group saw continuing strength in exploration and deepwater activity during the quarter, as witnessed by the number of high-technology logging and Testing Services deployed in projects around the world. In addition, we previewed our new generation seismic streamer during the quarter, which uses a novel 4-component sensor to measure the reflected wave in much more detail, including its direction. This is a major step forward for marine seismic, similar to the medical industry moving from a 2D x-ray to a full 3D CAT scan, and it will further widen our technology lead in Marine seismic. ","In land seismic, we continue to deploy our new, unique technology, which offers a step change in land seismic imaging quality. In addition to operating UniQ on our own land seismic crews, WesternGeco recently created a new division to sell and lease the UniQ technology to other service companies, as well as to energy companies who maintain their own crews. The decision to sell and lease the UniQ technology will open up an additional $1.3 billion market for our WesternGeco product line. ","In the Drilling Group, new technologies introduced during the quarter included the MicroScope high resolution resistivity and imaging service, which will further support our customers in estimating reserves, placing horizontal wells and optimizing completion design. In addition, the Pathfinder iPZIG at-bit inclination and imaging service helps optimize well placement in target zones and is developed for unconventional oil and gas markets. The iPZIG service has already been successfully field tested in coalbed methane, heavy oil and shale plays in North America and Australia. ","In the Production Group, HiWAY activity continued to grow rapidly with operations conducted for more than 45 clients during the quarter and with a number of fracturing stages growing by more than 25% sequentially. In addition to deploying HiWAY through our traditional business model, we also introduced the Spark [ph] business model in the past quarter to expand the market uptake of HiWAY. Here, we provide HiWAY job engineering and monitoring, proponent chemicals, as well as blending services, while the hydraulic horsepower, which often makes up 2\/3 of the well-side CapEx, is provided by a third party. To date, we have pumped around 70 HiWAY stages in North America with the Spark [ph] model, and we will start conducting jobs in key international markets in the coming quarters. ","Also during the quarter, Framo Engineering was awarded the Gullfaks subsea wet gas compression project for Statoil. This represents the first subsea project of this nature in the world and builds on the unique technology position of Framo Engineering. ","Let's now turn to the outlook where the main risk of a global double-dip recession appears to be behind us, although there are still uncertainties linked to the global financial markets and potential geopolitical events. In terms of oil demand, the 2012 outlook has also stabilized after a series of downward revisions in recent quarters. Based on the weakness of non-OPEC supply, OPEC spare capacity being at the 3-year low and supply risks from a number of sources, we do not expect oil prices to weaken significantly in the coming quarters. In the U.S., the production growth from unconventional gas, coupled with very mild winter weather, has driven storage to record levels. This has sent natural gas prices to a 10-year low and has led to a subsequent drop in gas activity, which is unlikely to recover in the near term. ","In the international markets, natural gas and LNG prices remain solid and, based on the demand outlook, are unlikely to weaken significantly in the near term. In terms of our activity outlook for the year, we maintain our positive view on the international markets with rig count growth north of 10%, driven by the exploration and deepwater markets, as well as key land markets. With our strong focus in execution, a very solid contract base and a rich new technology portfolio, we are well prepared to capitalize on these trends. ","In North America, the transition from gas to liquids-based activity will continue in the coming quarter, and the outlook for dry gas drilling activity remains uncertain. We still expect U.S. land rig activity to be in line with Q4 2011 levels provided the ongoing drop in gas rig activity continues to be offset by increasing activity in the liquids-rich basins. The other main uncertainty in North America is the evolution of pressure pumping pricing, which based on the ongoing transition, is set to continue down in the coming quarter. Still, our well-balanced service portfolio on land and our strong leverage towards the Gulf of Mexico puts us in a good position to outperform in the North America market going forward. ","Thank you very much. I will now hand the call over to Malcolm for the Q&A session.","Malcolm Theobald","Thank you, Paal. We\u2019ll now open the call for questions. Keeley?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of James West at Barclays.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Paal, I thought the change in your prepared commentary about international pricing was interesting, especially since you highlighted sentiments. Is this sentiment changes from your competitors who are now out of capacity and need to raise pricing? Or is it your customers who are pushing back less on price increases as technology and expertise becomes more important with rig rates moving up as quickly as they are? Or is it a combination of both?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think it's a combination of both, James. So if you want my perspective, bidding is always very competitive, whether we are at the peak or the trough of the cycle. Now the key to pricing trends is the sentiment, which is again driven by the view of activity outlook. And if you look at the activity outlook going back a couple of years, it's been under a constant cloud of uncertainty, whether it's natural disasters, geopolitics or the global economy, right? So even though there has not been too much overcapacity or a lot of overcapacity, there's still been a constant negative pricing sentiment. Now I think the industry is starting to realize, and we are certainly starting to realize, that in spite of the ongoing macro uncertainties, the tight supply and demand fundamentals gives a very solid basis for activity growth as we have seen consistently in 2010, 2011 and also now in 2012. So when you couple this fact with stabilizing GDP growth and also oil demand outlook, as well as tight service capacity in the industry, it really creates that positive pricing sentiments that I'm referring to.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's extremely helpful. And one of the offshore drillers mentioned yesterday there's been a big change in the last kind of 6 to 12 months around their customers' views of capacity. I assume that you're seeing that similar trend that your customers are now becoming -- I guess that sentiment would argue that the customers are becoming a little bit more concerned about the oil service industry's ability to provide the services they need for their programs.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. I think that's fair. I think there are more concerns over capacity now. And like I said, there was never that much overcapacity. And I think whatever overcapacity was there, I think it\u2019s dwindling quite fast. We are actually quite tight in several of our product lines already. And I think it's also worthwhile to note is that over the past 2 years, most of the major international contracts have now been rebid. So there is now an opportunity to start raising prices on the smaller upcoming contracts, which we are in the process of doing, right? And then if you look at what's happening in rigs and seismic, typically there, the contract size is smaller. And that's why you can see them move quicker in terms of testing prices. With big multisegment, multiyear and multi-rig contracts like some of the big ones we are -- we have been bidding on over the past 2 years, you really don't want to be shut out. And I think that's where pricing on the large contracts has been very competitive and with that kind of slightly negative pricing sentiment. But I think most of those contracts are now either bid or even awarded, and there is now an opportunity to start raising prices on the smaller upcoming contracts without any significant risk.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of David Anderson of JPMorgan.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I thought it was very interesting in your release that you noted a number of reservoir enhancement projects, highlighting ESPs and Framo, a number of projects, and then again on the production management contract in Ecuador. Now investors typically associate Schlumberger with exploration, but you seem to really be gaining ground on the other end of the production curve. I was just wondering if you could help us understand how big a part of this business -- of this is your business now. And is this something we could potentially double over the next couple of years, considering all the mature production coming out of the IOCs?","Paal Kibsgaard","You're referring to these production incentive contracts, specifically?","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. But also to talk -- a lot of talk about Framo in there.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's obviously a different kind of part of your business that we don't -- that seems to be getting highlighted more these days.","Paal Kibsgaard","No. That's a fair question. So if I just take one step back. We have, for a long, long time, been very, very strong when it comes to Reservoir Characterization. And with these transactions we've done over the past couple of years, we\u2019ve also built a very similar position of strength in drilling. And our focus now from a portfolio standpoint in terms of further building portfolio is very much focused on the production side. So you are quite perceptive in picking that up. When it comes to the production incentive contracts, we see this as quite a strong growth vehicle for us going forward. This is why we created a separate product line focusing entirely on this. This part of our business was previously managed then under IPM and basically was a subset of IPM. So today it is not a significant part of our business, but it's probably one of the fastest-growing parts of our business. It is a new business model where some of the award -- some of the contracts are awarded, but quite a few of them are actually just negotiated straight without bidding in many cases. So it is one of the areas where we, as a company, can get the highest multiple on our services due to our strength in characterization, due to our strength in drilling and also due to our strength, which is now becoming even stronger, in production, right. So if that business can double over the next 3, 4 years, it can. It is still a relatively small part, but I would say it's one of the fastest-growing parts of our business.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. As a follow-up, I guess it's not quite related. But I just want to ask you about Argentina. Obviously, everybody's got a lot of questions down there in Argentina. You guys have staked out a big position down there. I think you've talked about doing 80% of frac stages. Can you just help us kind of walk through kind of some of the political risk and how you guys are navigating that? Does this -- what's happened in recent days, how does this change kind of your philosophy in terms of that market? Does it change your views on putting capital on the market? How are you thinking about this kind of new risk paradigm, I guess?","Paal Kibsgaard","It's a fair question. So we have moved a fair bit of capacity into Argentina over the past 12 months, which actually I'm quite happy that we've done, because if you try to move capacity into the country now, you might be spending 12 months in customs or whatever. And so I think the key now is that we have a very strong position there. We haven't really changed our view on the potential or the resource base. That's absolutely there. Now with the government repealing the Oil Plus program [Oil and Refining Plus program] and also making import and export somewhat more challenging, there is some more short-term uncertainty. But we are still quite positive on the medium to long term of Argentina. And I think whatever way they are going to develop these resources, and they will, there's going to be a strong need for our expertise and for our products and services there. So I think at this stage, we continue to operate as we have been doing, but we have observed some of these political changes, right. But as of today, it hasn't really impacted our business.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In other words, the work is still there. It's just you're going to be working for a different operator, essentially.","Paal Kibsgaard","Potentially, yes.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Kurt Hallead at RBC.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Paal, my question is going to be focused -- I'll get it off the table here on North America and your outlook for the remainder of the year. And if you can maybe parse that between -- I know you mentioned pricing pressures in the frac market. Can you give us some color on what's going on in some of the other product and service lines? And can you also just help us understand maybe the margin progression in North America as it relates to, if you will, the frac and service components? Contrast that to Gulf of Mexico and contrast that to seismic. That would be very helpful.","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay. I'll have a go at that. So I think -- if we start off with North America land, the way I see it, we are facing 2 main uncertainties going forward, right. So the first one is the outlook for gas rig activity. Now with the record storage levels and natural gas pricing below $2, the drop in gas rig activities have to continue down from the current levels in the low 600. How low it's going to go? It is unclear at this stage. As the activity flow are supported by the lease commitment drilling in Paris [ph], is actually not that significant. Now on the other hand, the other main uncertainty is pressure pumping margins, which are under attack from several fronts. Firstly, utilization is likely to remain challenged because the lower well inventory leaves the frac fleets chasing the rigs much, much more than what we used to do 6 or 12 months ago. If you look at the bid pricing, it continued to drop in both gas and liquids during the quarter. On average, towards the end of the quarter in gas, we were bidding about 20% down sequentially and, in liquids, about 10% down sequentially on average between the liquids basins. Now in the first quarter, the new pricing started to significantly impact margins in the gas basins and in some of the liquids basins, while the rest of the liquids basins I see being impacted of the new pricing in the coming quarters. Now there's another key thing to realize as well, and that is that in the liquids, there are more stages per well. But the horsepower required per stage is actually much lower because we pump at lower pressures and lower rates. So while you need the fleet in liquids, you actually need fewer pumps or less horsepower -- or actually fewer pumps per fleet and less horsepower per fleet in the liquids, which again is going to contribute to the oversupply of horsepower. So if you add to these factors the fact that there is significant horsepower and order for the industry, we believe there is considerable uncertainty around the outlook for pressure pumping pricing and the margin. So the fact that it's coming down in Q2 I think is a given. And I think there's also significant uncertainty around H2, and it might come down further in H2. Now if you look at our side, we obviously are in the pressure pumping business, but we have the least exposure to this business if you compare us to our main competitors. And some of the other mitigating factors that we have done is that we have HiWAY within pressure pumping, and the off-take of HiWAY is going very well. We had another 25% sequential growth in the number of stages during the quarter. And we also introduced the Spark [ph] business model, which is then focused on the blending or lower pressure part of frac-ing. And obviously, as I said, we have significantly higher leverage towards wireline, logging and coiled tubing and drilling of land and also towards the Gulf. So I think, overall, there are issues around pressure pumping ,which is going to have an impact on the business, but we are quite well-leveraged towards other things which should give us an advantage going forward.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Very helpful. And maybe just as a follow-up to that and sticking just to the North America at this juncture, would you expect that when you take seismic in your Gulf of Mexico and what's going on with the frac market, when you roll that all together, margins coming down in aggregate for North America in the second quarter, do you expect the low point for margins potentially to be second, third quarter? Or do you think that given the negative momentum in the frac market, it\u2019s just going to drag margins down throughout the course of the year? What would be your best guess right now?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think, like I said, what is clear is that Q2 is coming down. And that's due to the fact that the -- there'll be more impact on the pressure pumping pricing and also we have the Canada breakup. Now what is going to happen in the second half of the year? I think that pressure pumping margins are going to continue to be under further pressure. Now to what extent we can offset this from seismic, from deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and from the other part of our land offering, which actually is holding up well in activity and actually holding up very well in margins, obviously, we have the ambition of trying to offset as much as possible of this. And now whether we're going to be able to do that is going to be a function of how severe the pressure pumping pricing and margin decline is going to be. And at this stage, I simply don't know.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Scott Gruber at Bernstein.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I want to inquire about the impact of contract role internationally. Paal, you mentioned that the majority of the large contracts have been repriced. But are all of these contracts in force today, such that the negative role has passed assuming probably static pricing on future contracts?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I mean, there are still some contracts that are being evaluated and are going to be awarded. And I think the main of these are centered around Brazil and Petrobras. But I would say the majority of the large international contracts have been awarded, and they are already in effect, right. So most of the pricing concessions that have been given in the large contracts, I would say, are in our operations today.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then can you provide some color on the revenue split internationally between these long-term contracts, whether it's for bundled or discrete services, the full IPM contracts and the shorter-cycle work? What's the broad split between those 3 buckets?","Paal Kibsgaard","It's very difficult to give a number. But I would say that the large multisegment, multi-rig, even multiclient type of contract is, I mean, is centered in the certain parts of the world. You have -- obviously, you have Brazil. You have part of it in the Far East around the Pan-Malaysian contract, and you have some of them around the North Sea, right. So it is -- they are significant contracts for the markets that I was referring to, but it is only a part of our international operation, right. So we have -- there's a lot of other contracts. And if you look at the volume of work we have, for instance, for other NOCs and for independents and even other IOCs, that's still quite significant. So I can't give you a number. We put a lot of focus on it in our commentary because they are key kind of battlegrounds for pricing, but they\u2019re only a subset of our total contract portfolio internationally.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. But it's fair to say that given that there's few awards coming out this year -- I think there's only 2 big tenders to be signed -- the shorter cycle work, the seismic activity, they're going to be a much more significant drivers in '12 versus repricing on big tenders?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think that's fair to say, yes.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Bill Sanchez at Howard Weil.","William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Paal, I see that you all are keeping your CapEx guidance flat at $4.5 billion for the full year. You've outlined here I think a modest bump in terms of your international rig count growth expectation for the year, and I know you're keeping a close eye in terms of North America pressure pumping capacity additions. Where do we stand right now in terms of maybe -- have we already seen the reallocation of capital from the North America markets to the international markets to start funding those opportunities you have there more fully? Or is that something we could still expect going forward?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, first of all, Bill, there is no change to the rig count outlook for international. So I believe we said it's north of 10% in Q4, and we're saying north of 10% at this stage. So really no change to the activity outlook. International is coming in basically exactly the way we were foreseeing it, right. But when it comes to our CapEx, yes, we are upholding the $4.5 billion outlook. So in the Q4 call, what I said was that the budget or the plan was $4.5 billion, but we would look at the year in 2 halves. So in the first half, we would invest at 2011 levels, which is around $1 billion per quarter and then potentially ramp up of another 20% to 25% in H2 based on how things were going and also based on our view in 2013, right. So if you look at where we stand at the end of Q1, Q1 was at the planned rate of around $1 billion, and Q2 is going to be quite similar. The main change was that we halted the NAM pressure pumping additions, and we redirected this pressure pumping capacity or CapEx to the international markets, giving them their pressure pumping capacity earlier in the year. Now for the rest of the year, we're going to make a call on H2. Whether we actually go for this 25% ramp or not, we will make that call during the coming quarter. If I was going to do a preview, I would say that the NAM pressure pumping CapEx will likely be lower than planned. And any CapEx additions in North America for pressure pumping is likely to be more focused on the low-pressure blending part rather than on pumps, based on what I was referring to in my North American comments. While internationally, I think you could see a ramp further from the spending level now in H2, but within the envelope that we've already given.","William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And if you do go ahead and make the adjustments on the pressure pumping side in North America, Paal, would that be outright cancellations of capacity? Or would you just shift that in -- those deliveries into 2013?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, we\u2019re already cutting in North America for pressure pumping, right. So we will see how much international wants to pick up from that. And the balance we will then either work with our suppliers. We'll see what we will potentially keep in inventory and basically manage that. But we have a very good dialogue and setup with our suppliers there. And I'm very convinced that we can manage that in a good way.","William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","One follow-up for you. As we look at certainly very good performance in margins in the first quarter, and everything I think you've outlined from a pricing and activity standpoint suggests margins just continue to improve here. I'm just curious of your thoughts as we continue to see mobilization of people and tools for you into these incremental opportunities in the deepwater contracts. Is there any expected margin drag you anticipate on your international businesses as a result?","Paal Kibsgaard","No. I mean, there's always additional costs when you mobilize and start up new projects. But I mean, this is an ongoing business expense, and we have these type of costs on an ongoing basis, right? So we are focused on delivering steady international margin growth throughout 2012, right. And the starting point of this is really our focus on very strong execution. And I'm very pleased with what each part of the business has done so far this year in terms of very good cost and resource management. I'm also very pleased with the program that Smith and M-I is having, in particular internationally. They're doing very well both in terms of growth and in terms of margins. And then we have a very strong portfolio of new technology that we're introducing as well, right. So I think, overall, there are always added costs when you start up new projects, but this is part of ongoing business expenses and not something that should really impact our results.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Bill Herbert at Simmons & Company.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Continuing with the margin question internationally here. I mean, clearly, first quarter margins, at least for most of us, were better than expected. Flat quarter-on-quarter given the extreme seasonality in Northern Europe and Eurasia was impressive. Starting from a higher base than you did last year, for sure, but with regard to the road map for international margins over the course of 2012, you said steady improvement. Does that sort of convey the same order of magnitude of improvement that we witnessed last year Q1 to Q4? Or do you expect better than that?","Paal Kibsgaard","I don't even remember what the -- what's really...","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","You were up 250 basis points from Q1 to Q4 of last year. You went from 16 to 19-and-change. You\u2019re starting at 19.","Simon Ayat","I'm sure you know that I'm probably not going to give you a number, right. But I would just go back to say that there is opportunity within how we execute with getting at least slight pricing -- I would say slight -- effective pricing traction maybe in the second half of the year for more of the activity mix, as well as from the sell-up of new or high-tech technology. So we have margin expansion potential during this year. Whether it's going to be 250 basis points or not, I'm not going to give you a number on that, other than we are working very hard, both through how we execute and also how we position ourselves for the new and upcoming contracts to drive margins up.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Two questions on seismic for you. Very positive commentary with regard to the outlook for pricing. On your bidding, you're up 10%. Do we actually start to get pull-through from that pricing improvement on your P&L second half of this year?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. So what you have is for our upcoming work in Q2 and Q3, some of the work was bid last season, which is obviously on last season's pricing, right. But there is a part which is bid now. And more of that in Q3 than Q2, which is going to be at that higher pricing and then will have the pull-through that you're looking for.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. And then last question on multiclient. Central Gulf of Mexico lease sale coming up here this summer. Did we see the benefit of that in the fourth quarter? Or do we expect to see the benefit of that in the second quarter predominantly?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, so first of all, we did not see it in the first quarter. I think we saw some of it in the fourth quarter. I think there is still some uncertainty around how much of a boost we're going to have in Q2 because the IOCs and the large players, many of them have already purchased data either to pre-commit to the service that we've done over the past 18 months and also from late sales that they did back in Q4. So in order for it to be significant in Q2, I think we need a lot more interest and activity or participation from the independents, which we so far haven't seen yet.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Michael LaMotte at Guggenheim.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Paal, I'm really kind of intrigued by the Spark [ph] model. And in particular, if I think about the contrast of bundling as a means of trying to create value, you\u2019re essentially dislocating the most commoditized and the horsepower. I'm wondering what -- 2 things, one, what that means for your margins kind of unlocking the big capital component, and two, sort of how far you think this model can go. Could we ultimately see horsepower in your view sort of going the way of even a rig market, being completely disassociated?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think it's a bit early to stretch it out that far now, right. I think we -- first of all, margin-wise for the Spark [ph] model, these margins are accretive to our pressure pumping business, and it\u2019s also quite attractive from a return on assets or return on capital standpoint, right. And that makes it quite interesting. Part of the reason for doing this is that we have seen a trend where some of our customers have started to vertically integrate on the pressure pumping side with quite limited ability to do any kind of sophisticated higher-end blending type and pumping more sophisticated fluid systems, right. So we, through HiWAY, have really the only significantly differentiated fluid system in the market at this stage. And that's why we see that as a very good fit with some of these more -- with some of these pressure pumping companies that are owned by our customers. So that's the starting point. How far it can go? I don't know. I think the main view I have or we have is that the pump itself is not a significant part of the pressure pumping operation. It's going to be much more the fluid or the engineered fluid system that is going to create -- that basically creates the conductivity downhole that drives the value proposition going forward, right. And I think this is why you see as soon as there is enough supply of pumps, the pricing goes down very, very quickly, right. So I think there is a chance to get a lot more sustainable pricing and performance in the pressure pumping business if your business is more centered around what really generates the value, and that -- as far as we see it, that is much more the fluid system than the actual pump.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. Totally unrelated follow-up, on the international gas side. Our view is that LNG prices are going to remain very strong for a very long time, which has obviously set off a scramble for exploitation of stranded gas, as well as redevelopment of more matured gas in places like Indonesia. I'm curious within the context of the 10% rig count growth, if you could give us a bit of a sneak peek into '13, what the bigger constraints are to seeing faster growth on the international gas front? Is it a rig constraint? Or is it at this point just about getting operators sort of focused on projects and queuing them up?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think it's a bit early for me to make a firm comment on that. We haven't looked at it in that much detail. But I would say that if it's conventional offshore, I think that there is no immediate, I think, shortcoming of rigs at this stage. I think it's more getting the projects lined up, right. But if you go more towards higher-end rigs, that might be constraint. But it's a bit early for me to comment on it in terms of 2013, I would say.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Maybe as a follow-up then, do you see more work coming from new basins such as a Mozambique or the sort of redevelopment of more mature provinces like Indonesia?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think we see both. I think the Far East with Indonesia, with Malaysia and Thailand is looking to be quite busy this year and going into next year. And obviously, there is significant focus on East Africa from an exploration standpoint. So I would say that both those regions and those type of developments in mature, more mature basins, as well as the newer basins are seeing good growth.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jim Crandell of Dahlman Rose.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Paal, first question is in seismic. Given how pricing is improving and giving the contract outlook, do you think it's possible at this point for you to reach last cycle\u2019s peak margins at WesternGeco in 2013?","Paal Kibsgaard","Again, I think it's too early to say. We are starting to see the signs of pricing traction, which we have been looking for, for the past 12 or 18 months, right. So capacity has tightened. If I look at the number of 3D vessels coming into the market scheduled for this year, which I think for the total market is only around 3, I don't see any issues with further capacity additions in terms of how it will impact pricing. So I think there are good chances of getting sustained pricing traction at least through this year, and then it's going to be a function of, I think, how much capacity is being added to the market, right. But the fact that margins are coming up is clear, but I think it's too early to say, yes, whether we\u2019re going to see the peak margins of the previous cycle. And I think multiclient activity is also going to play into that equation.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And my follow-up, internationally, particularly offshore, it seems to me as if one of your big competitors wants to have a higher market share in LWD, particularly in deepwater, particularly offshore. And I would argue that your other competitor wants to have a higher market share in wireline. You're a company that measures market share very closely. With pricing coming up, do you think you\u2019ve at least maintained your market share in both of those 2 businesses over the last year?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I do. And I would say that international market share is really a function of the number of good contracts that you have, not the number of bad contracts. Also, international market is a function of how many contracts you retain and not necessarily how many contracts you win. So our contract portfolio today is very strong. There is significant upside potentially in terms of new technology, and this whole aspect of operational integrity and quality of service is still key market share drivers, right. And I've been quoting numbers about D&M replacement ratios in previous quarters. I think in Q4, this number was 31:5 that we replaced our competitors on rigs or wells or contracts, 31:5. And that number for Q1 is 30:3. So we continue to take work that our competitors might have previously won in terms of bidding, but they can't perform it, whether it's quality or capacity. And I think the other thing I would say is on -- that there is also an ongoing discussion about competitive pricing on deepwater and the margins we have there. I think the key -- if you want to look at how we have managed to maintain market share and maintain profitability, you need to look at our margin gap towards our closest competitor, which has expanded in the past year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Becker at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","In the past, we've seen the share repurchase program characterized as aggressive and opportunistic. During the first quarter, it looks like the pace slowed considerably from what we saw last year. As we go through 2012, should we expect a less aggressive share repurchase program compared to 2011?","Paal Kibsgaard","Simon, you want to answer that?","Simon Ayat","Yes. Okay. Well, thanks for asking the question. We obviously slowed down the repurchase program in Q1. Now I want to take advantage of this question to highlight our strategy on how we consume our liquidity. So after dividend, the cash is used for -- our first priority for the cash is really the business needs, and this is CapEx, the working capital when we have expansion and the small acquisition. And any excess cash, we will spend it on buyback. Last year, we did expand, if you want, beyond the excess cash because of following the acquisition of Smith and the number of shares we issued in that transaction. So we decided to be more aggressive in the buyback. You're going to see it more in our traditional way, which is basically avoiding the increase in the number of share due to the stock-based compensation schemes that we have. So it will be slower, yes.","Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Makes sense. And then, Paal, recently, you announced an expansion of the core analysis capability in Houston. And I appreciate it's a pretty small part of the business, but can also generate very high returns. What role do you see core analysis playing in your business as you go forward?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, it's a key part of the Reservoir Characterization workflow, right. And we have, over the past 5, 6, 7 years, gotten further into that business. We have a great company up in Utah called TerraTek, which is leading in really high-end core analysis. And we've combined this with other parts of the company, as well as with our fluid analysis and some of the companies we bought there. And this is a key part of the characterization workflow. It is not a significant volume in terms of revenue, but like you say, it is higher-margin, and it's also a critical part of putting together that entire workflow and the entire, I would say, answer product to our customers.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mike Urban of Deutsche.","Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Obviously, a lot of focus on the international pricing comments that you made. I wanted to take a little bit of different approach and talk about some of the other potential drivers of margin in the international business. In particular, I would think of things like mix of business as being a potential driver of margin and then also the volume. Now, you've talked about rig count, but are you also able to expand out of scope work and things like that as you grow into some of the infrastructure investments and some of the projects that are out there maturing? Just wondering if you can comment on those 2 items.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. I think all those items that you're listing are key contributors to how we will drive margins, right, in addition to when we get pricing -- more pricing power. But the starting point for driving margins is very strong execution with respect to cost and resource management. We have a lot of focus within the company around leveraging our size and our footprint, even in a better way than what we have done in the past. We have a very strong international setup. And the way we run and conduct our business from a support standpoint from asset management, from maintenance and regional distribution of support activities, we have upside in terms of how that's run. And we are in the process of streamlining and upgrading how that's done. In other words, we will have a benefit to the bottom line, right. In addition to that, as I alluded to earlier, Smith and M-I is performing very well and continuing to improve margins under our international structure. We managed to lighten their support cost base. And also as they continue to grow, the flow through we can get on their business, even without pricing improvements, is actually quite good as well. And then like you say, the activity mix is favorable to us. Deepwater activity and exploration activity is highly accretive to our margins. And we also have a very strong portfolio in new technology. So I'm not going beyond what I said earlier in terms of how fast we can expand international margins, but we have potential to expand them, and we're working hard on getting that done.","Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And then in terms of some of the pricing improvements that you've talked about. Not so much on the large projects, which again, is still kind of competitive. But the shorter cycle stuff, smaller projects, how quickly will that flow through, just given some of the lead times that we typically see internationally? Is that something that could still materialize in 2012? Or is that a more material move next year?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think you will have contracts where we will test pricing and likely win during this year. And we also -- when I refer to the wells or the projects or the contracts where we are replacing competition, we are obviously not replacing our competition on the same price as they bid at, right. So there will be some opportunities for smaller contracts with higher pricing. How quickly that's going to be material to the overall results, it's yet to be seen, right. But the fact that, that trend is starting, it will be a positive contribution.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Angie Sedita at UBS.","Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Paal, I mean, we discussed here with international pricing and a change of sentiment, one of your largest peers said that they are \"pushing for pricing\" on small to midsize projects. I mean, obviously, it's not only sentiment. It's what your competitors are doing. So are also seeing this in the marketplace? And if so, are you seeing this specifically in certain regions and product lines?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I wouldn't go into what regions we are seeing it. We are also testing pricing on smaller contracts. The main segments that we are seeing this in are the ones that are the tightest in capacity. Obviously, seismic, we already talked about. But then I would say wireline and drilling and measurements are the other ones where we are basically seeing this.","Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then given that North America is obviously flattening out and weakening and yourself and your peers are moving CapEx from the U.S. markets, the North American markets, abroad. Do you think there is -- or is there any risk that the international markets don't tighten further in 2013 if this CapEx moves abroad?","Paal Kibsgaard","I don't really think so. I think the main shift of capacity or CapEx would be around pressure pumping. And to what extent, I'm sure the other main or big integrated services companies is going to look at making sure that international operations get the right amount of pressure pumping capacity as well, right. Which over the past couple of years, at least we have been in many cases given priority to North America with [indiscernible]. So we are now getting back in and making sure we are properly set up in all the key basins where we need pressure pumping capacity. And I would say today, we are almost there. So in terms of how the international market is tightening, I don't think a shift from North America to international is going to be a significant problem because the activity level in North America is not really going down. The main issue you have is that there is oversupply of pumps.","Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All right. Fair enough. And then finally, you also mentioned you are halting your capacity additions and pressure pumping here in 2012. What does that imply as far as when you'd stop seeing new capacity additions from Schlumberger? Is that Q3? Or is it still coming into Q4? Can you give us a little color there?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. I can't give you the time because we will add back capacity when we can get utilization. I see really no point of adding capacity or pressure pumping capacity into the market now if I can't get the utilization, right. So it will be a function of when we can get that. And also, what I was saying is that the demand of pumps or horsepower in the liquids is going to be lower than what we had in the gas. So what we also can do is by investing and blending in low-pressure equipment, you can, in many cases, create more fleets out of the same horsepower in liquids than what you actually had in the gas, right. So our focus on CapEx in North America, if we need to add fleets, will be to add the low pressure part of a fleet and then basically use the existing horsepower first until we run out of that.","Operator","We have time for one more question. That will come from the line of Robin Shoemaker at Citi.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Paal, I wanted to ask you -- going back to international side, in terms of the specific regional markets that may be holding back some of your margin progress, I\u2019d just like to highlight -- or ask you to highlight maybe a couple of those. I mean, I would start actually the first question with regard to Russia and how you see the evolution of that market, including potentially using higher-end technologies.","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I would say -- first of all to your question about the overall margins. I would say that all parts of the business, I think, are doing a very good job in terms of how they execute and how they focus on both market share and margins in parallel. So that's the first point. But in Russia, specifically, we see very good growth in the Russian market for this year, in particular in Western Siberia. And just picking up on your point in terms of how higher-end technology can apply more there, I think what we're seeing in Russia is a continuous upgrade on the rig capability, more towards western standard and more towards higher-capacity rigs. And as you upgrade the rig base, the need for higher-end technologies that can drive efficiency will obviously and go up, right. So we are seeing a continuous, I would say, high-grading or upgrading of the rigs in Western Siberia. And with that, we will have a wider market for higher-end technologies. And what we have done over the past decade in Russia is that we have established a very solid footprint from the Russian companies that we have bought. And we have been continuing to use their locally made technology to have a deployment mechanism for higher-end technology when that becomes a requirement. So I would say that we are very well set up in terms of our footprint in Western Siberia, in particular through the Eurasia partnership and deal that we made last year. And with the continuous upgrade of the rig capabilities, the demand for higher-end technology is going to grow.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then in your earlier comments, you mentioned an improvement in sentiment in Iraq, right, just quite recently. And so is the profitability level in Iraq likely to rise through the year as we get more -- as more rigs go back to work?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I would say that our overall profitability in Iraq, I think, for the past 2, 3 quarters has not really been an issue, and we continue to see that's not an issue. So we had a pause in the growth rate, and that was more down to uncertainty around the security situation as the U.S. Army left towards the end of last year. And also some concerns around the rate of new infrastructure, in particular, offloading capacity in the Gulf for Iraq production. So those were the sentiments that I was referring to that was turning positive towards the end of the quarter. And there is a number of contracts to be awarded and also started up, which I think a lot of it is going to take place during the second quarter. And beyond that, we see very strong growth going forward, and also, we see profitability being quite reasonable for us there.","Malcolm Theobald","On behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I would like to thank you for participating in today's call.

And as a reminder today's call is being recorded.","I'll turn the conference now over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead sir.","Simon Farrant - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited second quarter 2015 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from London where the Schlumberger Limited board meeting took place yesterday.","Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer.","Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paul. Simon will first review the financial results and then Paul will discuss the operational and technical highlights.","However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind our participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information is included in the earnings press release on our website. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements.","I will now turn the call over to Simon.","Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you Simon. Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges and credits was $0.88. This represents decreases of $0.18 sequentially and $0.49 when compared to the same quarter last year.","Our second quarter revenue of $9 billion decreased 12% sequentially. Despite the very challenging environment, pre-tax operating margins only declined by 49 basis points sequentially. This resulted in decremental margins of just 23%, which is a result of continued strong and proactive cost management across the entire organization.","Sequential highlights by product group were as follows: second quarter reservoir characterization revenue of $2.4 billion decreased 5% sequentially. This decrease was largely driven by Wireline and Testing as a result of lower exploration spending. Pre-tax operating margins decreased 84 basis points to 26.5% as an impact of the lower exploration activities was offset by increased higher margin software sales.","Drilling Group revenue of $3.5 billion decreased 11%, primarily due to the further significant drop in the North America rig count. Margins remained resilient at 19.5% as the strong cost management limited the margin decline to only 44 basis points.","Production Group revenue of $3.1 billion decreased 18% sequentially, as both activity and pricing for pressure pumping services in North America fell dramatically. Despite the severe revenue decline, margins only fell by 179 basis points to 12.8%.","Now, turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 21.1% in the second quarter. This was essentially flat when compared to the previous quarter. Our cash flow generation continues to be very strong. During the second quarter, we generated $2.3 billion of cash flow from operations. During the first half of 2015, we have generated $4.1 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $200 million during the second quarter and almost $0.5 billion during the first six months of the year.","Net debt increased $111 million during the quarter to $5.6 billion. During the quarter, we spent $520 million to repurchase 5.8 million shares at an average price of $90 per share. We spent $587 million on CapEx during the second quarter. Full-year 2015 CapEx, excluding multiclient and SPM investments, is still expected to be approximately $2.5 billion.","And now, I will turn the conference call over to Paul.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Thank you, Simon, and good morning everyone. Schlumberger revenue decreased 12% sequentially in the second quarter, driven by a significant reduction in land activity in the U.S. as the rig count decline accelerated, and by further pricing erosion in both North America and the international area.","North America revenue fell 27% sequentially while international revenue was 5% lower, as customer budget cuts and pricing concessions impacted results for a full quarter. Despite the challenging market conditions, overall pre-tax operating margins were maintained well above the levels of previous downturns as we continue to proactively manage costs and resources, carefully navigate the commercial landscape and further accelerate our transformation program throughout the organization.","The success of this approach can be seen in a double-digit pre-tax operating margin in North America and an international margin of 24.5%, which is 35 basis points up sequentially and 44 basis points up year-over-year. In the first half of 2015, year-over-year revenue has now dropped 26% in North America and 14% internationally. These levels exceed those of the 2009 downturn in both pace and size. Still, we have delivered first half decremental margins of 37% in North America and just 18% in the international area. These decremental margins represents a marked improvement over the equivalent figures from the last downturn which were in excess of 70%, particularly as we begin to approach what we believe is the market bottom.","While the market remains tough, we also believe we have been successful in adapting to a rapidly changing situation as far as the size of our work force is concerned. The absence of charges in the second quarter is evidence of this, as the adjustments made in the second quarter were absorbed in our normal operating costs.","In terms of corporate financial performance, we also generated almost $1.5 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter. This figure, which represents a conversion rate of 132% of the quarter's earnings into free cash flow, demonstrates our ability to generate free cash even in these market conditions.","Looking at our results on a geographical basis, North American revenue decreased 27% sequentially, a figure greater than the 25% sequential decrease seen in the first quarter and, again, significantly lower than the fall in the land rig count which was down 40% sequentially in North America land. In spite of this drop, operating margins in North America decreased by only 268 basis points sequentially, leaving our margins 465 basis points higher than the same period of the 2009 downturn. The strength of this performance was underpinned by our proactive approach to cost and resource management, the growing impact of our transformation program, strong new technology sales and efficient supply chain management all together limiting the sequential decremental margins to 20%.","In U.S., land activity was down in all basins in the second quarter with the rig count dropping below 860 for most of the month of June. In addition to the significant reduction in rig count, poor weather conditions with floods in Texas, Arkansas and Alaska also drove activity lower in the second quarter. The dramatic reduction in activity in U.S. land has created a massive capacity oversupply in the service industry with pricing quickly plummeting to unsustainable levels in particular for pressure pumping where many companies now are desperately fighting to survive.","Our approach to the market remain unchanged in the second quarter where we concentrate our activity in core areas and for key customers and where we beyond this proceed with stacking of equipment rather than operating with large losses. We continue to maintain our overall infrastructure and long-term service capacity and we are working closely with our customers to help produce cost per barrel through better operational efficiency and reliability and through the application of new technology, work flows and business models.","Based on this approach, we will ramp up our activity for opportunities that bring the required returns. The strength of our technology portfolio, the range of our work flow solutions and the depth of our shale understanding also enables us to pursue performance-based contracts where we initially underwrite the incremental cost of our technology and where we recover this cost plus the performance upside from incremental well production.","In Western Canada, activity was also down significantly in the second quarter with the rig count falling by 66% sequentially impacted by the early spring break-up and with the recovery expected to be limited during the summer months.","Offshore in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico deepwater rig activity was down in the second quarter and activity was also impacted by loop currents while pack ice of Eastern Canada also impacted our drilling and seismic operations in the second quarter. Offshore revenue was further impacted by the expected shift in service mix from exploration to development and completions as well as increasing pricing pressure. However, the primary driver for offshore success continues to be risk reduction and project performance and we are, therefore, fully engaged with our customers to help reduce overall AFE costs through better project planning and execution.","In the international markets, revenue declined by 5% sequentially driven by further budget cuts from our customers as well as further pricing concession. For the first half of the year, revenue has now dropped 14% compared to last year, a figure that is more than doubled the 5% fall experienced over the same timeframe in the 2009 downturn. Second quarter operating margins of 24.5% was up 35 basis points sequentially and 44 basis points year-over-year as first half decremental margins were held to 18% compared to 73% over the same period in the 2009 downturn.","These results fully demonstrate our leadership in the international markets which is built on flawless execution from the entire organization, proactive cost and resource management and the acceleration of our transformation program focused on work force productivity, asset utilization and reduction in unit support costs. In this environment, we focus on carefully balancing market share growth with protection of operating margin and by negotiating pricing concessions in return for additional work, integration opportunities or improved contract terms, knowing from experience that any permanent pricing concessions that we make will be very hard to recover even as market conditions improve.","Within the international areas, Middle East and Asia revenue declined by 5% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins improved 8 basis points to 28.7%. Activity remained robust in the GCC region, however, strength in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait was not sufficient to offset weakness in the Asia-Pacific region. Year-on-year revenue decreased by 13%, while margins expanded by 87 basis points.","In the Middle East region, our lump sum turnkey project in Saudi Arabia continued to gain momentum during the quarter however, our overall results were not immune to the customer pricing concessions we gave in the first quarter. In the United Arab Emirates, drilling and production related activity increased as work on the SARB North Island project ramped up and with further rig additions expected over the coming quarters. Drilling activity was also stronger in Kuwait, as the rig count increased in line with the country's strategic production targets, while unique land seismic activity grew with improved operational productivity.","In Iraq, revenues in the north declined further in the second quarter, while activity in the south of the country remained flat sequentially but it's expected to increase in the second half of the year on the back of recent contract win.","In Southeast Asia, activity fell in Australia as projects were completed both on land and offshore while activity in Malaysia declined as customer budget reductions affected both OpEx and CapEx investment.","In Latin America, revenue declined 7% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins improved 81 basis points to 22.3%. Revenue was impacted once again by decreasing activity in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia however, somewhat offset by increased activity in Venezuela. Year-on-year revenue decreased 17% and margins grew by 111 basis points.","In Mexico, revenue decreased significantly in the second quarter on further customer budget cuts that impacted both onshore and offshore activity. And in spite of new contract wins for both seismic and integrated well construction, the outlook for the second half of the year remains challenging. At the same time, the energy reform continues to progress on plan with the first major licensed award being announced in the third quarter.","Offshore activity in Brazil remained weak with the deepwater rig count being down significantly versus the first quarter, while in Colombia, the activity slowdown continued and now affects all product line.","In the Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago GeoMarkets, increased activity was driven by exploration work in Suriname and Guyana, while joint ventures in the Faja region of Venezuela continued to ramp up. Elsewhere in South America, revenue in Argentina remained resilient as growth in conventional activity partially offset pricing pressure for unconventional services. At the same time, SPM activity remains strong in Ecuador as the Shushufindi project continue to perform in line with expectations and with activity and production starting up on the new Kamana SPM project.","In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue fell 5% sequentially with margins edging off by 29 basis points to 21.3%. Year-on-year revenue decreased 26% and margins dropped by 85 basis points. Within the area, revenue increased in Russia and Central Asia driven by the seasonal recovery of conventional land activity and as the ruble strengthened somewhat. In the North Sea, the shift from exploration to development related activity continued, while customer budget pressure both in the U.K. and Norway resulted in lower sales of new technology.","In Sub-Saharan Africa both development and exploration activity was down sequentially as customer budget pressure resulted in several active rigs being demobilized. And in Algeria, activity was slightly up sequentially while work in Libya was limited as the security situation remained very challenging.","One year ago at our 2014 investor conference, we told you about our transformation program, which is designed to provide a new approach to how we run our business in order to enable fundamentally better performance. Our transformation leverages the drivers of technology innovation, equipment reliability, process efficiency, and system integration, all together delivering better management of costs, better quality of products and service delivery, and better generation of free cash flow.","While we set goals for new technologies and increasing elements of service integration, we also target a 10-fold reduction in customer non-productive time, a doubling in asset utilization, a 25% reduction in inventory days, a 20% increase in workforce productivity and a 10% lowering of unit support costs.","I am very pleased with the progress we have made one year later. While the transformation was designed to deliver our performance in any part of the cycle, the current market conditions have enabled us to increase customer dialogue and to accelerate the program throughout our global organization. The strength of our international margins so far this year is one demonstration of the performance impact from our transformation while the resilience in our North American margins is another proof point.","In terms of costs, our figures show that we are managing all aspects very well, including both fixed and variable compensation, as well as the cost of product and service delivery. In terms of quality, the investments we have made in training, new technology and enabling systems are now really starting to pay off, as can be seen by our second quarter quality results, where we set the new record low in terms of non-productive time incurred for our customers.","Last, in terms of cash, the reduction in CapEx intensity and the discipline we have shown with respect to managing working capital has delivered a very strong free cash flow in the first half of the year, with a cash conversion rate of 98%, including severance payment, which is well above our 75% target.","Turning now to the overall outlook for the second half of the year, visibility still remains limited. However, some tentative signs of change are emerging. On the supply side of the oil markets, the global market share battle between OPEC and the high-cost producers is still playing out, with the first signs of flattening North America production starting to show. Within OPEC, production in the second quarter was at the highest level for three years, as marketed supply was again increased at the expense of lower core spare capacity, which, in June, dropped to 2.3 million barrels per day.","In addition to this, non-NAM, non-OPEC production weakened in the first half of the year by 650,000 barrels per day, driven by Brazil and Mexico, with the further softening expected in the second half of the year, as the lower investment levels in many regions start to take full effect. Against these supply figures, global oil demand growth continues to strengthen, with the IEA having revised its 2015 estimate up to 1.4 million barrels per day during the second quarter. These factors all points to a potential tightening in the global supply demand balance in the coming quarters.","Turning to our industry, the largest drop in E&P investments is, as expected, occurring in North America, where 2015 spend will now largely be down by more than 35%, driven by both pricing and activity on land. We do believe that the North American rig count has now reached bottom, but that we will only see a slow increase in drilling and completion activity in the second half of the year, which will not make any material dent in the massive overcapacity that has been created. This again means that there will be little to no improvement in pricing levels and, hence, the market will still remain very challenging for the foreseeable future.","In the international market, E&P spending is now expected to fall more than 15%, driven by lower activity in most regions and further amplified by a very strong dollar, in particular, versus the Russian ruble and the Venezuelan bolivar. Given the nature of the business in the international markets, we do not expect any upward adjustment to existing customer budgets for the second half of 2015. Instead, we see a continuation of the trends from the first half, with very low exploration activity, tight management of development related spend, and continued pricing pressure for our products and services. However, we do expect that any improvement in oil prices in the second half of the year will potentially lead to increased investment levels in 2016, or through exploration and development related activity.","In the midst of the current market challenges, we remain focused on the things we can control, including our cost and resource base, the effective deployment of our technology and expertise, and the quality and integrity of the products and services we provide to our customers. The success of this approach is enabling us to maintain solid international margins despite a significant drop in activity, and at the same time, also allowing us to maximize our performance in North America. We remain very confident in our capacity to weather the current downturn better than our surroundings, and also significantly better than what we have done in previous downturns.","Our global strength, our technology differentiation, and our accelerated corporate transformation is creating a great platform for us to increase revenue market share, post lower earnings per share reductions than our peers, and continue to reduce working capital and CapEx intensity to deliver unmatched levels of free cash flow. And at the same time, this financial strength positions us well to take advantage of increasing market opportunities resulting from the current market environment.","Thank you very much. We will now open up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And first, with the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And thank you very much, and I think you're going to make it a difficult weekend for some of your peers since they ponder what they're going to say next week. But...","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Thank you.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wonder whether we could revisit your macro view. Are you more confident or less confident that the oil markets are tightening than what you were a quarter ago, given the most recent IEA report and some of the resolutions around previously sanctioned countries?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Well, I think our view on the macro and our confidence in the tightening I think is relatively unchanged. We've been saying now, I think, for a number of quarters, that we see solid oil demand growth. And again, this was revised upwards again this year to 1.4 million barrels during the second quarter. And we've also said that, with a certain lag, the large cuts in E&P investments are going to show up in the supply numbers. And we see it in particular in non-NAM and OPEC, which has showed a gradual weakening over the first six months of this year. U.S. monthly sequential production is flattening and the core OPEC spare capacity was also down to only 2.3 million barrels in June, a million barrels per day. So I think the tightening that we've been foreshadowing, we are still relatively confident that that will happen in the second half of the year.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, good. On the environment, as you highlighted, pricing is still tough. I mean, we're at the trough. But clearly, the trough means, probably, average pricing still rolling down. And how do you see the say, some of the second half pricing and macro headwinds relative to the momentum that you have created within the organization? It's very clear from what you're delivering here that some of the initiatives that you initiated, maybe a year ago are really starting to deliver. But how much more can we expect given what you're already doing?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Well, I mean, you're asking whether our results are sustainable, I guess, right? So I mean, if...","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, I mean, the headwinds relative to the internal momentum, how should we think about it?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Well, if we take the pricing part of the question first, I would agree with you that there is going to be a further impact on pricing in the second half of the year. We haven't seen the full impact of that. But I would say that there is probably still more relative impact in North America than what it is in the international markets. There is going to be impact in both regions in Q3 beyond where we are in Q2, but I think that's relatively larger in North America.","As to our ability to offset this, the transformation and the general way that we are managing the company and the focus we have on cost and resource management, through this, we are going to continue to create a financial leverage over the coming years. And we are going to take that leverage out in two forms. We will take it out through market share gains by being able to be even more competitive on price. And secondly, we'll take the other part out through very strong incrementals when we grow. Or, alternatively, very strong decrementals when we shrink.","So what we talked about in 2014 at the Investor Day in terms of what the transformation represents for the company, say, in the next five-year horizon, it is there. We are accelerating the impact from it. And we see this leverage as something that we will continuously take out in the coming years. So fundamentally, I think the performance that we are posting is sustainable. It's not going to be a straight line. But overall, what we are doing now is not a fluke.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, very impressive. Thank you very much. And Simon, congratulations with the free cash conversion. I'll hand it back.","Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning guys.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Good morning.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","How do you see the performance-based work evolving in the U.S.? I know you've won projects internationally in the quarter in your SPM work in Ecuador and other places, internationally. But can you talk about the issues with growing that business model in the U.S.?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","That's a good question. So I think, I would mention two specific things here. I think, firstly, what is very positive at this stage is that customers are, more and more, starting to buy in to the fact that we have technologies and workflows that can create more value. That is what we've been investing in for the past five years and that is how we wanted to try to create technical differentiation in the largely commoditized North American market. So with the dialogues we have with customers, both on geoengineering completions, on refracturing, in terms of more sophisticated fracturing fluid systems like broadband, it is very clear that the appetites to use new technology and more sophisticated technology is growing.","Now, some of the customers would take on that technology on a more of a standard type of contract, where we will still get a premium over what basic commodity type of technologies we'll give, while other customers will also like to go into a more risk-based contract setup. We are fine either way. We are looking to create technology differentiation, and I'm very optimistic about our ability to continue to push that forward in the coming quarters, even in this business environment.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And my follow-up, if I could, there has been a great deal made about the slowdown in deepwater project development, FID delays and major oil companies moving to onshore. Yesterday, we saw Conoco break a contract on almost a new rig. Can you talk about what Schlumberger sees in terms of the progress in deepwater development and how that's changed what you expect to see going forward, if you would, whatever, over the next couple of years?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Well, the immediate thing we see is, obviously, an impact on deepwater drilling activity. And this is largely focused in on the exploration side of deepwater. And that's a, it's a pretty significant reduction in that. Now, that is already incorporated or absorbed in our results where they stand today.","In terms of the deepwater projects, I think, yes, there are some projects that are being delayed and some projects being canceled, if possible, but I think in general, these are long-term investments, many of them are already deeply committed. So we don't see any kind of dramatic impact at this stage on the projects that are in the pipeline. Now, going forward, in terms of sanctioning new projects, I think it's going to be very important for the industry to be able to \u2013 the service industry together with our customers to be able to come up with technical solutions and field development plans that significantly reduces cost per barrel. And if we can do that, which is the overall objective for the industry, I think we can make many of the pending deepwater projects also economically viable in the future.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay gentleman. Thank you very much.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Thank you Jim.","Operator","Our next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. Please go ahead.","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks guys. I echo, certainly a good quarter, particularly with the decremental margins. So Paal, can you talk a little bit more about the decrementals? Obviously strong in North America and international, but specific to North America, can you talk about at least for the Q2 the impact of the transformation efforts versus new technology versus the head count? And also, are you seeing better uptakes from the new technologies this cycle than in prior downturns?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Yes. I think, basically, all the elements that you listed are the contributing factors to the lower decrementals. So obviously, we have a clean quarter this quarter. There are no charges in it, so this is basically straight-line business performance in the second quarter. And like you said, the overall impact on transformation, which we started several years earlier in North America, is part of driving this. We started our transformation and reorganization back in 2010.","I would say our North American organization has also been very proactive when it comes to cost and resource management. And as we just talked about earlier on one of the questions there, the uptake of new technology, both in North America and international, the rate of uptake, given the downturn, is actually quite strong and actually much higher than what we have seen in any previous downturns. So I think that comes down to the fact that a lot of the technologies \u2013 new technology we now have out have very clear cost and efficiency angles to them, which means that they sell equally easy in the downturn as they do in the upturn.","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate the clarity. And then, you referenced it briefly in your remarks regarding the international outlook for 2016, which is, obviously, very preliminary, but based on your recent conversations and thinking through your viewpoints on supply\/demand for crude, if we are in a $65 Brent world, what would your preliminary thoughts or color be on E&P CapEx on the international markets and do you have any color on the region?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Well, I think it's too early to make any firm predictions on E&P CapEx investments internationally next year. I would just say that we are relatively confident in the tightening of the supply\/demand balance of the second half of the year. That would, under normal circumstances, lead to some uptick in the oil price. And if we see some improvement in the oil price in the second half of this year, I don't think there is going to be any huge impact on the current year budget, but I think it's a positive indicator that we might have some increase next year. I don't think the increase in 2016 is going to be large, but I think there is a good chance that E&P investment levels next year will be higher than what we've seen in 2015.","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. I'll turn it over.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to David Anderson with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. Paal, I just want to ask about Iran. Obviously, assuming there is an Iran deal goes through, I just wanted to know if you could highlight a little bit of Schlumberger's service opportunities that opens up over the next few years. And would you expect IOCs to start moving aggressively in there?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Well, I think what the IOCs are going to do, I think, you are going to have to ask them. I don't know. Our position and our view on Iran is the following: we have fully exited Iran. When the sanctions are lifted and when it is permissible, we will evaluate going back in. So beyond that, I don't really have anything more to say about what we will do, but it's coming down to, firstly, that the sanction needs to be officially lifted, which they are not yet done.","J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, as a quick follow-up on the offshore. Can I get a little bit more detail? You've talked a few times about exploration spending coming down. I was just wondering if you can just help me understand how you see this exploration cycle playing out, say over the next 12 months. Do you think exploration can bottom by the fourth quarter? And then, at these costs, you talked about risk reduction in some of these contracts, do you think you could start seeing some sort of impact, some sort of turnaround in there by mid-2016, or something along those lines?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","I would say, potentially. We see the exploration spend down potentially around 30% again this year. That's including seismic, probably around the same level. So that is obviously a dramatic reduction if you look at what we already saw in 2014, right? So yes, we might not be too far away from bottom on exploration spend. But again, I don't see any dramatic turnaround immediately. We could potentially start seeing something towards the second half of 2016, if there is a kind of a gradual uptick of the oil price to at least plus\/minus $70. But nothing on the horizon, as we see today. It's still a very tough market. And we see this very, very clearly in some of our key high tech product lines, where our exploration revenue over the past six quarters has actually dropped by 35%.","So I don't think we are too far away from bottom because there's not that much left to cut. But the comeback I think is still a little bit out in time. But if you look at the level of spend today versus what is required for the industry to replace reserves and to find new oil field developments, we are obviously way under-investing. So this is not a sustainable situation. So the uptick will have to come. It's just that we don't see it on the immediate horizon.","J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thanks.","Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","James Carlyle West - Evercore ISI","Hey. Good morning Paal, or good afternoon, I guess, Paal, and congratulations on a well executed quarter. I had a question really related to the technology and technology uptake. It seems like this cycle is somewhat different than we've seen in previous cycles, where the technology uptake is actually greater. Last year, I think 27% of your revenues were from new technologies. Do you have a sense of \u2013 can you give us a number of what in terms of revenues, you're seeing in terms of new technology today, or maybe the first half of this year?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Yeah, so what we've seen so far this year, in terms of new technology as a percentage of our total technologies or the total revenue, is 22%. Now, this is slightly lower than the 25% target that we laid out last year. But given where we are in the cycle, this is dramatically higher than what we have seen in any previous cycle, right?","So yes, we are selling a significantly higher rate of new technology in this part of the cycle versus previous. And as I said earlier, this is down to, I think, the fact that we have a very flush new technology portfolio and offering, and I think we have been doing a better job in clearly demonstrating to our customers what these new technologies bring, in terms of lower cost per barrel, in terms of efficiency, in terms of higher production. And this is, again, why I think the uptake, although it's slightly down from where it was in the second half of 2014, it is still holding up very, very well.","James Carlyle West - Evercore ISI","Okay, thanks. And then kind of an unrelated follow-up here. On the third quarter in particular, clearly, we are going to see continued declines in revenue internationally and probably some margin degradation. In North America, do you still expect to see a significant revenue degradation and marked degradation as well? Could you give us some clarity on kind of how we should think about 3Q, and is 3Q the bottom?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Okay, well, let's start up with the beginning. So in terms of revenue, we expect that the sequential drop is going to slow in Q3, and it could potentially represent bottom when it comes to revenue. Now, if you look at Q1, we saw a 19% sequential decline, in Q2, we saw a 12% sequential decline in revenue. So for the third quarter, we expect something in the range of 5%, 6% further decline in sequential revenue.","James Carlyle West - Evercore ISI","Okay.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Now, if you look at the two main parts of the world, in North America, we do expect a slight increase on activity on land. But again, we see this being offset by weakening also offshore activity and further pricing pressure, both on land and offshore and internationally no major change. We think the overall weak activity is going to continue and also there's going to be sustained pricing pressure. In addition, we have the slowing down of activity for part of Q3 in the Middle East and also the maintenance fees in the North Sea.","Now, if you look at this cycle, so far we have proactively managed costs to protect margins. And I think we demonstrated that we are pretty quick on our feet and we can manage this very, very well. At this stage, our structure cost and our field capacity is really tailored to our Q2 activity level. But for now, we have decided to preserve our current structure for Q3, and this is in order to be ready for increased activity as we go forward.","So provided this is for a limited period of time, we are prepared to live with the temporary margin impact that carrying these slightly elevated levels of resources is going to have. It's not going to be a huge impact on margins, but it's going to be a little bit more than what we could have managed if we were to cut even deeper. So if you look at EPS, it's going to come down in Q3, and I think the current consensus of $0.77 is a pretty realistic number.","James Carlyle West - Evercore ISI","Okay, perfect. Thanks, Paal.","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International","Good morning. Going back to an earlier question, but I wanted to be more specific with regard to discussing the attempt at improved alignment with customers. Looking at three buckets, if you could talk specifically about refracking in terms of uptake, number of projects wins, what have you, engineering completions in the similar vein? And also on the deepwater front, getting more aligned and paid on the AFE versus NPT?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Okay, so if we start off with the land part, right? So on geoengineering completions in North America, we have over the past quarter engaged and are in contract \u2013 either we have signed contracts or either in contract discussions with several customers \u2013 on doing consistently geoengineering completions for them. And with refracturing, we are already engaged with eight different customers in North America land on doing refracturing for them. So both of these elements are picking up nicely. As I said earlier, some of the customers would like to go with traditional contracts where they just pay us a technology premium for what we bring, and others are still considering whether to go into a performance-based setup. And either way, we are fine. The main thing, as I said, we are looking to create technology differentiation. And again, this is going quite well.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International","If there is any resistance to your underwriting the cost of a refrac or an engineering completions, what is it exactly? What would be the resistance on the part of a customer from actually allowing you to do that?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Well, I think the only resistance will be the fact that when they see that we are prepared to do it, it must be a pretty good business proposition. And I think when they look at this in more detail, they'll figure out that there is no need for us to carry the cost because they happily will carry the cost because it's a good investment. So I think that's really the main \u2013 so there is no resistance. It's just a reflection of, do they want to capture more of the value themselves or would they like to outsource all the risk and potentially much more of the upside to us?","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International","And at this juncture with regard to the uptake on the land front, is it an even split between standard contracts and more of the underwritten contracts?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","I think at this stage, I would say it is probably more so standard contracts with the pricing premium rather than having to underwrite it. We offer underwriting to all of them but most of them actually do take more of a standard type of contract.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International","Okay. And any comments on the deepwater front?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Well, in terms of changing the business model on deepwater and being, I would say, more compensated on performance rather than standard type of contracts, it is not that much movement on that front. We are discussing with some of our larger customers various types of framework. We haven't concluded any of these yet, but I would say there have been good kind of productive discussions. It takes a bit more time. These are larger projects. It's a bit more complicated to do than kind of the single well things we can do on land. But I would say we have good discussions and a good dialogue, and I think there is openness from our customers to invite us to the table and basically have us participate more, but nothing really material in terms of new contracts signed yet.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International","Okay. And last one for me, your final sort of comment or one of them with regard to your opening narrative was referencing your balance sheet strength and your free cash flow generation, thus allowing you to take increased advantage of market opportunities. Can you elaborate on that? I assume in part that means acquisitions?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Simon, you want to comment on our use of free cash flow?","Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You know our priority to cash is still as we always declared. We will fuel the growth of the business and you've seen a slowdown on the CapEx because of times. But obviously, we continue to invest in SPM and multiclient. As far as acquisition, we do small ones on regular basis, and this is also funded through cash. We don't borrow for that kind of acquisition, but we will remain to be opportunistic on that front. But as I said, smaller acquisition that regular as far as to our use of cash.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning. I guess good afternoon where you guys are. Congratulations on a very well executed run, Paal, over the last 12 months.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Thank you very much.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Welcome. You indicated here that you're carrying a cost structure that is sized for kind of second quarter activity and willing to kind of deal with some near-term margin dynamics related with that cost structure if activity comes in a little bit more. I don't want to be too presumptuous, but then I would assume that you wouldn't want to sit for too much longer than one quarter with some sort of a margin drag. So can we maybe infer from your comments you're expecting a increase in activity, generally speaking, in the fourth quarter, that would be for North America, and then maybe international as soon as the first quarter of next year?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Yeah, I think you can read into this that \u2013 firstly, I think, we are pleased with how we've handled the downturn so far. We decided to be rather decisive in rightsizing the workforce for the downturn we are facing, and that includes both rightsizing and streamlining the support structure as well as the field capacity. So I think what you can read into the comments on the fact that we are prepared to carry slightly more costs into Q3, and this is not a significant part, it's slightly more, that is that we are indeed looking to be ready for growth in activity.","Now, I can't say 100% certain that it's going to come in Q4 or Q1, but what we're saying is that we believe we are getting close to bottom. We believe that we have demonstrated very clearly our ability to manage cost and resources, and in the event the upturn is a couple of quarters away, we are prepared to carry the cost, and I think that would be a much better management of our resources to enable us to be well prepared and positioned for the growth, and in the event it's pushed out a bit more, we can also do further adjustments, that's relatively easy. We have shown that we can do it. So yes, you can infer that we are looking and searching for the uptick and that we think that we are pretty close to bottom.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's great color. I appreciate that. Now, in the context of the margin performance in the international markets for the second quarter and we roll through into the third quarter, how can \u2013 like if I look from the outside in, I would have to say to myself, if you did so well in the second quarter, I assume you can do probably equally as well in the third quarter, right, because you're sized for it, you've been positioned for it. So why would margins come down internationally in the third quarter versus the second quarter?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Well, I can't say that they would or they wouldn't. I mean, obviously we would still like to maintain them where they are. We will internationally as well carry, I would say, slightly more resources than what is necessary for the third quarter. We see revenue coming down still a little bit from the second quarter level, and we could have shed some more resources to be prepared for that.","I think the only reason why the margins would come down I would say, in general, would be that we are carrying slightly more resources. There is also a further pricing effect that comes into it. But obviously offsetting this is, is the continued impact from transformation, right? So I would say if we decided to go forward and completely align resources to activity, we should be able to absorb a large part of the pricing. I think the way we are going now, you could potentially see a little bit of margin drop in Q3, but that will be more by design. The fact that we are willing to carry a bit more resources, rather than not being able to effectively maintain it.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right, that's great. And if I just \u2013 just on the pricing front, on the international dynamics, what area are you seeing the most pricing in terms of geographic and what product lines are coming under the most pressure right now?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","In the international market?","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Well, obviously, the product line that has been the most effective so far is WesternGeco on the seismic side, which has been now going on for a good, about, six-odd quarters, right? So I think our team in WesternGeco has done a tremendous job in streamlining the cost structure, improving how we operate our fleets. So we are very well positioned to kind of maximize our performance on the marine seismic business the way it is today. But that's probably where we have seen the most.","In terms of geography, you see it more or less everywhere, both on land and offshore, actually. But we've seen it in some of the large markets in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, the North Sea, even on land in the Middle East we have a significant pricing pressures, so we are navigating the landscape and we are \u2013 we have to give concessions, but we try to trade the concessions for something in return, either better terms and conditions, more integration opportunities, higher market share. And whatever is left to be offset, we are trying to offset with the leverage we are creating from the transformation.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, that's great, Paal. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to Jim Crandell with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Jim D. Crandell - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning Paal. What impact is the pending merger of Halliburton and Baker Hughes having on the awarding of business outside of North America?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","It's a bit difficult for me to say what the impact is. I mean that's more of a customer question, right? I think it obviously creates a bit of uncertainty from our customers. Firstly, is the transaction going to go through? If it goes through then it's from three to two players. If it doesn't go through, then obviously that warrants a different approach to how they potentially would like to award. So I think it creates uncertainty from the customer side as to how they go about awarding in tender situation, and it has probably also led to potentially slightly lower rate of tendering in this part of the cycle. This is the ideal time for most of our customers to tender given the fact that they know activity is down. So I think it's \u2013 that is probably one impact that it has.","If you look at our performance, I'm actually very pleased with our tender win rate in the first half of the year. I think we have done very well. I'm pleased with some of the key wins that we have taken on, and for me that should bode well, I think, for market share evolution in the second half of this year and into 2016.","Jim D. Crandell - Cowen & Co. LLC","And do you think you've won market share year-to-date internationally in the areas that you compete with Halliburton and Baker?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Yeah, there is nothing in our revenue numbers in H1 as of yet, but if you look at the amount of contract volume we have won, I believe we have won a higher share of the contracts out for bid than what our current market share is, which means that over time, we should gain share.","Jim D. Crandell - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, good.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","As these contracts are implemented, yeah.","Jim D. Crandell - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, good. And as a follow-up question, I have on the U.S. pressure pumping business, in this kind of environment that we're in today, are there many instances where customers are willing to differentiate and pay for technology?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Well, if you look at the total business volume in North America land, it is not a high percentage yet. But I would say it's a growing number of customers that are willing to have a much more open technology discussion with us. And they see the importance, I think, of moving away focus entirely from driving down the well costs to driving down the cost per barrel for the production that they have. And the only way to do that now going forward as we are nearing the assumed total of how cheaply you can drill and complete these wells you're going to have to get more production out of them. And I think it's very evident that the only way to get that done is through new technology and new workload.","Jim D. Crandell - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Becker with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Douglas L. Becker - Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Paal, maybe sticking with the pressure pumping topic. You highlighted unsustainability of where that business stands right now. How do you expect this to play out? Does the capacity simply shift to stronger hands, or do you see some meaningful capacity reductions?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","No, I think what you find in any of these commoditized markets, if companies go under, there might be a temporary impact on capacity, as the capacity shifts hands. But most likely, whatever capacity is in the market today will likely resurface with some other ownership, once those type of transactions are sorted out, right? So I don't think it's going to be a permanent capacity reduction from companies potentially going under. I think these assets will shift hands and resurface with different ownership.","Douglas L. Becker - Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That makes sense. Then maybe a quick one for Simon. In the past, you've mentioned getting payback on severance costs within a year. Is that on track, and does this simplistically mean cost savings of something around $750 million in 2015? And I'm just arriving at that number by summing up the severance costs from fourth quarter to second quarter.","Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So it is on track. It is, as we confirm, within one year. I'm not too sure about your number, but your logic is correct. If you take what we have declared, as far as the payments are concerned, this will be recovered less than a year.","Douglas L. Becker - Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And are the remaining head count reductions more concentrated in North America or internationally?","Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We are almost completed with what we have done. There is no more reduction.","Douglas L. Becker - Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Has that skewed more North America or internationally?","Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, North America was a \u2013 percentage-wise was higher, but it was global, yes. Global.","Douglas L. Becker - Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood. Thank you very much.","Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, that will be our last question. I'll turn it back to the presenters for any closing remarks.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO","All right, thank you. So before we close, I would like to summarize the three most important points that we have discussed this morning. First, the market evolution in the second quarter was the continuation of what we saw in the first quarter, with North America land rig count falling further and with pricing pressure increasing in both North America and international markets. In response to this, we have proactively managed what remains under our control and subsequently delivered our best cost and cash performance so far in any downturn.","Second, our strong performance has been amplified by the acceleration of our transformation program, which is being actively implemented throughout our global organization, and which has enabled us to increase pre-tax operating margins in the international areas and maintain double-digit margins in North America.","Third, we believe that we now have seen the bottom of the rig count decline in North America and that North America land activity will see a slow increase in the second half of this year, while service pricing is expected to decline further in the third quarter as the fight for market share continues to play out.","In the international markets, we expect no upward revision to E&P CapEx spend for remainder of 2015, as the trend of low exploration activity, tight management of development spend, and sustained pricing pressure is likely set to continue. Based on this, the third quarter could potentially represent the bottom of the cycle in terms of earnings per share, as the pace of the revenue drop is set to slow and as we continue our steadfast efforts to maximize operating margins in both North America and international markets. And with the streamlining of our cost and resource base undertaken in the past nine months, together with the acceleration of our transformation program, we remain very optimistic about our ability to deliver unmatched incremental margins as soon as E&P investments start to show any signs of growth.","That concludes today's call.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.","Simon Farrant","Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2014 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from New York where the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting took place yesterday. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.","However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the earnings press release on our website. We welcome your questions after our prepared segments. Please limit to one question and a related follow-up.","I will now turn the call over to Simon.","Simon Ayat","Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.49. This is an increase of $0.12 sequentially and is $0.20 higher when compared to the same quarter last year and represents increases of 9% and 16% respectively. Third quarter revenue of $12.6 billion increased 4.9% sequentially. Pretax operating income increased 7.1% sequentially, while pretax operating margins improved 45 basis points to 22.2%.","Sequential highlights by product group were as follows. Reservoir Characterization revenue of $3.2 billion increased 2.9%, while margin improved by 29 basis points to 30%. This growth was driven by a very strong performance in testing services, improved WesternGeco marine utilization and an increase in SIS software sales. These increases were offset in part by lower multiclient sites.","Drilling Group revenue of $4.8 billion increased 3.6% and margins improved by 60 basis points to 21.7%. These increases were largely attributable to robust drilling and measurement activity in offshore North America, Latin America and Russia and strong IPM activity in Mexico. The second quarter acquisition of Saxon also contributed to the revenue growth.","Production Group revenue of $4.7 billion increased 8.1%. This growth was led by well services largely as a result of the rebound from the spring breakup in Canada and a strong performance on US land. An increase in completion of product sales in Latin America and the Middle East and Asia and expanding artificial lift sales in North America also contributed to the growth. Margin expanded by 158 basis points to 18.3%, primarily as a result of the rebound from the Canadian spring breakup as well as from improved efficiency and recovery of logistical cost in well services.","Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate was 22.1% in the third quarter compared to 21.7% in the previous quarter. During the quarter, we generated $3.1 billion of cash flow from operations. For the first nine months of this year, we have generated $7.3 billion of cash flow from operations. This compares to $6.6 billion for the same nine months of 2013.","As we mentioned, starting last quarter, we began to report SPM investment separately in our cash flow statement, similar to the way we report CapEx and multiclient. While this change has no impact on our free cash flow, it does result in an increase in the amount of cash flow from operations that we report. The 2013 cash flow from operations figure has been restated to reflect this change.","Net debt decreased $221 million during the quarter to $5.8 billion. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.5 billion of stock repurchases, $519 million of dividend payments and $980 million of CapEx, excluding multiclient and SPM. During the quarter, we repurchased 13.9 million shares at an average price of $108.41. CapEx excluding multiclient and SPM is still expected to be approximately $3.8 billion in 2014 as compared to the $3.9 billion we spent in 2013.","And now, I will turn the conference call over to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results set a new record for Schlumberger, driven by North America and further backed by robust international performance. In the international markets, growth was led by Latin America and Europe, CIS and Africa in spite of headwinds in Russia and Libya, while Middle East and Asia proved highly resilient in the face of a significant slowdown in Northern Iraq.","Third quarter revenue grew 5% sequentially and 9% year-on-year, while pretax operating income increased 7% sequentially and 12% year-on-year. Several factors contributed to this performance, including continued market penetration of new technologies that helped further drive our international margins as well as margin gains in North America from operational efficiency and market share improvements.","Overall our performance demonstrated the advantage of size and the benefit of a broad technology offering and operational footprint, while providing further proof of our leadership in technology, reliability, efficiency and integration.","In terms of our financial performance, we generated more than $1.8 billion in free cash flow in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total up to $3.7 billion. This represents a 29% increase over the comparable period in 2013 and a conversion of 93% of our third quarter earnings into free cash flow.","Based on our improved ability to generate free cash, we continued our active stock buyback program during the quarter, buying back $1.5 billion of stock, which puts us firmly on track to complete our $10 billion buyback program within the stated two-and-a-half year period.","Looking at the operating areas, our North American results set a new record with revenue up 9% sequentially and 18% year-over-year, while margins increased by 137 basis points to reach 19.4%. This is in spite of headwinds from heavy rainfall in the Permian Basin that limited land activity in the US, loop currents that slowed offshore activity in the Gulf of Mexico and very low multiclient seismic sales.","In Canada, activity rebounded well after the spring break up in the second quarter. And this together with a further increase in land activity in the US helped generate record land revenue, representing a 9% increase sequentially. Much of this increase came from hydraulic fracturing operations, where stage counts were higher, where we also obtained improved cost recovery from our customers and where we saw strong performance from our supply chain and distribution organization following the challenges we experienced in Q2.","Offshore revenue improved by 12% sequentially, driven by strong activity in Eastern Canada and by market share gains in drilling services in the Gulf of Mexico. North America also benefited from further growth and expansion of our artificial lift business and I will return to this growth initiative later in the call.","Our international business posted strong results again in the third quarter with a 3% sequential increase in revenue and with pretax operating margin expanding 55 basis points to 24.6%, which is the highest level seen in five years in spite of the geopolitical headwinds experienced in Russia, Northern Iraq and Libya.","Compared to the third quarter of last year, international revenue was up 5% on the back of strong growth in key markets in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Australia and with strong incremental margins at 50%.","In terms of pricing, the international market remains highly competitive for basic services, and we see no sign of any general pricing inflection. However we continue to be able to drive effective pricing through sale of new and unique technology together with continued growth in integration and performance-based contracts. This combination puts us in a very strong competitive position, which we continue to leverage to drive market share gains and expand operating margins.","Within the international areas, revenue in Latin America was up by a strong 10% sequentially, with margins increasing to 21.9% and with all geo markets recording growth. Compared to the third quarter last year, Latin America revenue was up 5%, driven by Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador, with moderate growth in Mexico and lower revenues in Brazil. Pretax operating income also increased year-over-year, driven by strong activity throughout our broad and diverse contracts portfolio as well as through careful cost and resource management.","In Argentina, strong sequential growth was driven by rig-based activity for development of both conventional and unconventional resources. Customers are now seeing clear results from applying our industry-leading shale workflows and technologies in terms of both increased production and greater efficiency. In Mexico, revenue grew on higher IPM project work on land, resolution of the social issues related to our project in the south in addition to stronger deporter activity.","As the energy reform continues to move ahead, we won a significant multi-year contract to build and manage a national data repository and to prepare data rooms that will be needed for the country's first public oil tenders next year. In Venezuela, activity increased further in the third quarter, supported by strong uptake of new technology, while payments continue to be made in line with the signed agreements.","In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue grew 1% sequentially, while margins improved by 132 basis points to 23.4%, as exploration activities strengthen in Angola and new projects started in other parts of Sub-Saharan Africa. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue grew by 4% and margins were up by 103 basis points.","Activity in Russia benefited from a strong summer season, particularly offshore Sakhalin and in the Arctic, but growth was tempered by the impact of international sanctions. Earlier in the third quarter, we announced the likely effects of sanctions on our results in Russia and this ultimately translated into a $0.02 impact coming from restructuring costs to remaining compliance and some impact from activity and a weaker ruble.","In other parts of the Europe, CIS and Africa area, activity was mixed in the North Sea with increased software sales in the UK, but lower activity in Norway as peak seismic and drilling activity ended. In North Africa, significant operational delays were experienced in Nigeria and activity slowed in Tunisia ahead of the November election.","Operations in Libya continues to be challenging with a complex security situation and with activity remaining at the minimal level. We are currently carefully evaluating our operational structure in the country and will resize resources in accordance with the 2015 activity outlook. On the positive side, however, we remain active offshore and we continue to have a constructive view on the long-term potential of the country.","In the Middle East and Asia area, revenue was essentially flat with the previous quarter, with margins stable at 27.6% as growth in Saudi Arabia and Oman offset lower revenue in Iraq and India and with activity in Asia largely unchanged from the second quarter. Year-on-year revenue increased by 6% and margins grew by 149 basis points.","In the Middle East, activity growth was strongest in Saudi Arabia with new rigs mobilizing, exploration activity strengthening and development drilling increasing. We have added resources to match the additional work in the country and we expect to see further increases in activity as more drilling rigs are added and rig-less activity continued to expand.","We also saw solid growth in Oman with strong artificial lift product sales and market share gains in drilling services. Elsewhere in the Middle East, activity was lower in India on lower product sales and the effects of the monsoon season. Activity was also lower in Northern Iraq as unrest in the area increased and forced a complete shutdown of our operations for part of the third quarter. The security situation has improved more recently and rigs are slowly returning to work.","In Southern Iraq, there was no security impact on our operations in the third quarter, but activity remains lower compared to the same quarter last year as new contract awards continue to be delayed. With government approvals, our new contract award is still pending. We do not expect any significant improvement in activity in the near term.","Southeast Asia revenue was also flat for the second quarter as activity slowdowns in Australia and lack of exploration success in Malaysia and Thailand were offset by stronger activity in Vietnam, marine seismic work in Brunei and improved product sales in other Asia geo markets. China saw a sequential growth in shale gas development on land together with continuing strong activity offshore in Bohai Bay. Elsewhere in China, activity continued to be slow and we do not see further growth until our customers' spending plans become clearer.","I would now like to update you on the progress we have made in our artificial lift business since we outlined our growth strategy for this market in New York in June. First, in addition to our existing basin coverage in North America established through an active M&A program over the past year, we have in the third quarter completed several new acquisitions to further expand our operational footprint in Canada.","Second, in line with our goal of optimizing cost efficiency and reliability, we have injected additional supply chain, engineering and manufacturing capabilities to our road lift organization to drive additional value from the signed quality assurance, sourcing and distribution.","Third, in order to address the growing market for LIVE for well lift solutions in the unconventional market, we have combined all Schlumberger artificial lift technologies in North America into a single organization that will cover ESP, PCP gas lift and rod lift systems. This has given us one customer-facing organization with a complete technical portfolio capable of recognizing business opportunities throughout the entire spectrum of the artificial lift market.","Integration of the various components of this organization is progressing very well, with our ultimate goal being to offer our customers a complete range of industry-leading technology together with best-in-class local service. We remain on track to sell more than 7,000 pump jacks and installing over 5,000 PCPs in 2014 in North America. And through the careful execution of our growth strategy over the past year, we have now firmly assumed the leadership position in the global artificial lift market.","I would also like to give you a progress report of the transformation program we outlined in New York where we're already starting to change the way we manage our people, our assets and our inventory to further improve our financial performance. In Southeast Asia, we concluded the successful piloting of a centralized asset management and maintenance facility for our Wireline product line, reducing the downhole tool fleet by more than 30% compared to the previous level required to service the region.","The surplus of assets that this initiative created have already been redeployed to capture new business opportunities and support growth in other regions, and our Wireline product line is in the process of expanding this model to other areas.","We have also extended the coverage of our regional distribution centers to new areas in South America, resulting in an average 10% reduction in spares on hand versus 2013 for the product lines currently involved. Worldwide coverage for spares distribution will be achieved in the coming months with the creation of a third distribution center in Rotterdam.","Implementation of revised job execution and competency assurance process also continue and is already showing notable reliability improvements. In Wireline, the systematic deployment on new standard work constructions has already in 2014 produced a 30% reduction in customer non-productive time compared to last year.","Turning now to the economic environment, the outlook for global GDP growth softened somewhat during the third quarter on weaker data from Europe and China also leading to a slight downward revision of the absolute oil demand outlook.","Given the strength of the US economy and the ongoing efforts to stimulate and manage growth in Europe and China, we continue to believe that the slow, but steady recovery and the world economy is still intact and that the overall oil demand situation is largely unchanged.","While market sentiments are currently driven by short-term oversupply due to the continued growth in North America production, we still see the supply situation as relatively well balanced given the continued challenges in the non-NAM non-OPEC production base, lack of growth in OPEC's sustainable production capacity maintaining tightness in OPEC spare capacity and with the continued geopolitical risks in several key producers.","We therefore expect Brent to recover and stabilize when and at the level that is deemed appropriate by the main oil producers. The key to the overall oil market is still that the global oil demand is currently set to increase by 1.1 million barrels per day in 2015, which will require growth in the EMP investments.","Where the growth in EMP investments will take place will be a function of what level of the oil price stabilizes at and where a lower oil price will likely lead to more of the investment taking place in lower operating cost environment.","For natural gas, markets remain comfortably supplied, although there's awkward pricing trends in Asia-Pacific and Europe as winter approaches. Based on this macro setting, which continues to include a mix of economic and geopolitical headwinds and tailwinds, we maintained a long-term view that we outlined in June in New York, believing in continued solid demand for our products, services and expertise.","We also firmly believe that opportunities exist for differentiated growth through new technology and greater integration and that the transformational impact of our reliability and efficiency programs will further support and accelerate our financial outperformance.","That concludes my remarks. Thank you. We will now open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley.","Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley","Excellent execution. I have a few questions on various technologies but I think I\u2019m going to leave that for now. Probably what is on everybody's minds right now is the oil balance and the tipping point in oil and where we stand, the volatility has been tremendous. I think everybody is confused about what level of CapEx will be required given what's going on in Europe and Pandora's box talking about spare capacity and how you see it. So I wonder whether you could just expand a little bit about what gives you confidence.","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think if you look at what the sentiments in the market are today, it is obviously driven by the fair order supply. But if we go back to the status of the global economy, yes, there was a downward revision in GDP growth outlook, but this was only slightly. We're still looking at 2.7% and 3.2% growth in GDP in 2014 and 2015, and this is only 0.2% down for both years. So like I said, the overall slow but steady recovery in the global economy, we believe, is still intact.","Now if you look at the demand side, there was a corresponding downward revision on the oil demand for both 2014 and 2015, but the key here is to look at the absolute demand, because the IEA for 2014 changed both the 2013 actual demand and the updated 2014 demand. So if we look at the 2014 absolute demand, it is still at the February level and only 0.2 million barrels a day down from the July peak. And the 2015 absolute demand is now 93.5, which is still 1.1 million barrels a day up.","So based on this, we see the demand side of the oil market also as more or less unchanged. So then what's left is to look at the real supply situation, and we don't think that has changed dramatically in terms of fundamental supply capacity since Q2 as well. And that's because there is lack of growth in OPEC sustainable production capacity. And actually if you look at IEA report, the OPEC sustainable production capacity is actually down 800,000 barrels a day in September of 2014 versus last year.","There is also continued weakness in non-NAM non-OPEC production and there is still geopolitical risk related to both Libya and Iraq. So based on this, we see the overall supply picture as more or less unchanged as well versus Q2. So with the growth in demand for next year, we believe that there has to be increased spending levels and where this spending is going to take place, I think, is going to be a function of where the oil price stabilizes.","At the lower oil price, we believe that more of these investments will take place in lower operating cost environments. And if the oil price stabilizes back at the levels we saw earlier this year, then we might continue with a similar picture next year as we had this year. So that's our overall view.","Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley","To summarize, Paal, you believe that the spare capacity in the global system today is going down for the next two years?","Paal Kibsgaard","What I would say at least it's not going up. So far this year, it's been flat. When more production is offered into the market, it is at the expense of the spare capacity.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Paal, I was hoping you could frame in light of your macro outlook perceived international opportunities and threats or headwinds and tailwinds, if you will, and how that at least conceptually coalesces into an outlook for next year? I mean the market of late seems to have been unduly focused on the prominent threats. And then moreover also if you could comment on margins as well. I was struck by how resilient your Eastern Hemisphere margins were in light of the dislocation that unfolded in the third quarter.","Paal Kibsgaard","We are very pleased with the performance of our international business, including Latin America. So year-to-date, international revenue is up by 5%, which is outgrowing the growth in EMP spending in international market. And our operating income is up 15% with incremental margins of 66%. So today our margin stands internationally at 24.6%, which is the highest level we've seen since the 2008 pre-financial crisis peak.","And I think it's important to notice as well that about 80% of our global operating income growth so far in 2014 is actually generated in the international market on a relatively low growth in EMP spend. So if you look at what happened in 2014, like you say, there was a good mix of tailwinds and headwinds. And if you look at the tailwinds this year in terms of geographies, it's been Argentina, Ecuador, Sub-Saharan Africa, Saudi and the UAE, in terms of the type of basins, it's been land and conventional offshore that's been driving the growth. And in terms of customer groups, it's been independents and NOCs.","Now if you look at the flip side for the headwinds, geographically it's been Brazil, Mexico, Libya, Russia, Iraq and China in term of the basins has been deepwater and exploration and in particular seismic. And also in customer groups, it's been the IOCs going from solid growth to flat spending in 2014. Now these headwinds will make up around $1.1 billion of full year revenue reduction for us versus 2013.","So looking at our full year revenue growth for 2014 in the international market, it's going to be around 5%. And that includes absorbing all these significant headwinds. And we've managed this growth at the same time as we have expanded margins by about 200 basis points and as I mentioned very strong incrementals. So it really demonstrates the strength and the earnings growth resilience we have in our international business.","Now if you look at 2015, we expect that we will continue to see a mix of headwinds and tailwinds in the international market. The tailwinds may not be as strong depending on where the EMP spend levels are, but several of the headwinds will largely diminish as well. Brazil and Mexico are likely to be tailwinds next year. And deepwater exploration as well as Libya, Iraq, China should also be less of a drag than what we saw this year.","So that really leaves Russia and Asia as the main headwinds that we're going to be facing and the overall balance will become fairer in these two regions in Q4. So still we expect to see strong earnings growth from our international business also in 2015.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Your market share gains, you mentioned, in Gulf of Mexico and the 12% revenue growth were impressive, considering that we've all been reading and hearing about loop currents and weather and you guys had won the bad weather. Can you talk to us a little bit about your mix, your customer mix and the other things that are allowing you to do so well in the Gulf of Mexico?","Paal Kibsgaard","Jim, we have a broad portfolio. We have a good balance in the Gulf of Mexico between characterization drilling and production. Our offshore business in North America also includes a very strong position offshore Eastern Canada, which was also quite strong in Q3. But we were impacted by the loop currents, but at the same time, we have a sizeable business. And while some rigs were shut down for this, there were a number of rigs continuing to operate without any impact. So when you have a certain size and some of these events, it's easier to absorb them as you go forward.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","I agree completely on the outlook for spending and the need to maintain current production, but clearly US independents spin-off of cash flow and so that puts the US activity probably most at risk. I guess my question is, is there a risk that pressure pumping pricing in a slower market crashes again like it did a couple of years ago or have we had enough capital discipline in the industry that that's not likely to happen?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think it's going to be a function of activity, of course. So like you say, we agree that the 2015 activity, it's too early to say what's going to happen. But it is clearly going to be a function of the level of free cash flow for the EMPs, which was already negative in general at the WTI of 90. And the key going forward is going to be continued borrowing capacity. So there's really two scenarios here that we end up with a lower WTI, further cost inflation in the EMP value chain and reduced borrowing capacity, and this will likely have an impact on the spending growth rates.","On the flip side, if we see a recovery of the WTI and also we see a limited cost inflation in the EMP value chain, I think these are the factors that would support further spending growth. But looking at pressure pumping pricing, it's going to be a function of the activity levels and how much horsepower capacity has been ordered in the past couple of quarters. And I believe that it's a fair bit already on order. So if the spending growth is impacted, I think it can quickly put pressure on frac pricing, including both sand and transportation as well.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of James West with ISI Group.","James West - ISI Group","In the release in your remarks, I was struck by how many times you highlighted strength in deepwater activity and strong exploration activity, particularly in deepwater drilling. It seems like there is a big debate in the market right now about deepwater. How do you see that activity evolving over the next year or two?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think if you look at first the deepwater rig supply, it was at the record high in Q3. At the same time, the number of stacked rigs continued to increase. And there's a further 10-year rigs planned for delivery in Q4. So I think it's very clear that we are in oversupply situation of deepwater rigs at this stage.","Now if you look at deepwater drilling, which is really where we make most of our revenue, this year we expect to see a 6% decline in drilling rig activity for deepwater. Now this decline is mainly driven by Brazil, which is down about over 30%, and partially offset by the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. So when you exclude Brazil, deepwater drilling is actually up about 3% versus 2013.","So looking forward to 2015, we see flattish deepwater drilling activity in 2015, generally supported by lower rig rates. So we've weathered, I think, a fairly significant deepwater decline this year and we expect it to be more or less flattish going forward into next year.","James West - ISI Group","A lot of the commentary was around deepwater exploratory wells. Has your percentage of wells that you're working on a deepwater on the exploration side decreased, is it steady, is it increasing?","Paal Kibsgaard","If you look at the overall exploration market and the exploration spend, we expect now that the 2014 exploration spend will be down 45% versus last year. And this spend reduction is mainly led by seismic, which would be down more than 20%, while the exploration drilling is only slightly down. So I would say that the market is down overall, but the main driver for the reduction in exploration spend is predominantly seismic.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS.","Angie Sedita - UBS","Nice to see that big $1.5 billion buyback. As a follow-up to one of the earlier questions on pressure pumping and the just the soft North America and obviously its influx, I do believe that Schlumberger was considering building incremental new build capacity for 2015 given the market dynamics. How do you feel on that now? Is that on hold? What are your thoughts?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, we have a pretty sizeable pressure pumping business, which is including both North America and international. So we have made some orders for new pumps. We still have some pumps left in the idle asset program. But we made some orders for new pumps by the level that it doesn't really worry me. These new pumps will be distributed in between North America and international. And we've had fairly significant growth both in Argentina and Saudi Arabia over the past six to 12 months. So the orders that we've made is generally what we want to have on order in terms of long lead items to make sure that we can cover the business in any eventuality.","Angie Sedita - UBS","Obviously the Middle East is very strong, particularly the Saudi. But just theoretically, in the Middle East overall, excluding Iraq of course, where do you think Brent would need to be for them to begin to slow their drilling activities where they start to become uncomfortable? I know obviously they're drilling both for gas and for oil.","Paal Kibsgaard","I'm not going to make any predictions at what level the Saudis would change what they're doing. We have a very strong business in Saudi Arabia. Growth has been very strong this year. And as of now, we continue to expect solid growth in Saudi Arabia next year as well.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim","Paal, you mentioned the potential for inflation in frac value chain in US onshore. And I was just curious, given that most of that is now being driven by sand and transportation and distribution related to sand, how is that impacting the market for highway and broadband?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think there's no real impact from these things in particular to broadband and highway. I think the escalating cost of transportation and sand at this stage I think is something that all the players are looking to pass on to the customers. I think there's going to be a limit to how much of these additional cost escalation that our customers are prepared to take, given their free cash flow situation and also given the drop in oil prices. But there is no relative impact on these cost escalations on either broadband or highway.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim","Well, I was thinking more from a marketing standpoint if the sand availability would actually push customers to look for productivity improving alternatives such as highway and broadband?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, we do use less sand in highway in particular. So that is obviously a selling point. But it is more a function of what the philosophy of the customer is. Do they want to go with a slickwater frac, which generally now has a lot higher volume of proppant, or they go to a more cross-linked or highway type of frac, in which case the proppant volume is significantly less.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim","And are you seeing a shift in trend, one versus the other materially over the last couple of quarters?","Paal Kibsgaard","Not materially. Highway continues to do very well. And I'm actually very pleased with how broadband is going. Broadband at this stage of its introduction is growing significantly faster than what highway did back in 2011\/2012. And we are now continuing to engage in broadband, I would say, presentations and broadband sales and information at the sea level of our customers. So we engage at that level to establish a very clear understanding of what this technology brings and also to try to agree on pilot programs and evaluation of these pilot programs over a period of time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC.","Kurt Hallead - RBC","I wanted to follow up in particular on two things. You mentioned cost recovery dynamics that have been underway in the North American market. Do you feel that you're at a point now where you'll be able to get some net margin accretion going forward, or is it still just offset to the cost inflation?","Paal Kibsgaard","I still think in terms of price increases with our customers, we're generally looking to recover the cost inflation that we're seeing. Like we said before, we believe that the main way of driving margins in the North America pressure pumping business will be through efficiency and through introduction of new technologies that increases production or lowers cost or improves efficiency. So the main focus that we have now is to pass on the cost inflation that we have from our supply chain to our customers. And like I said, given the state of the free cash flow and where the oil price is, I think the appetite from our customers will be lower in terms of how much of the further cost increases they're willing to take.","Kurt Hallead - RBC","In terms of the challenges that occurred during the course of the third quarter that resulted in that announcement that the earnings would be impacted by $0.02 to $0.03 and the comment that you made about being a $0.02 impact in particular, what kind of lingering effect do you expect from Russia and maybe Libya going out into the fourth quarter?","Paal Kibsgaard","If you look at Q4 as a whole, this year we expect sequential growth in earnings per share probably around $0.05 to $0.07. That's our target. This is somewhat lower than the sequential increases we normally see in Q4. And there's really two primary reasons for that. One, as you alluded to, we expect to see a continued impact from the situations in Libya, Iraq and Russia and in particular the ruble effect in Russia is potentially going to be higher in Q4 than what we saw in Q3.","The second main factor is the cost focus that our customers have, which is likely going to lead to lower levels of year-end sales, including both software products, but in particular multiclient. Still the base business should continue to be solid, driven by both North America, Latin America and the Middle East, but somewhat lower sequential growth in earnings per share in Q4 this year than what we normally see.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil.","Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil","I think one of the things that's been a surprise to many is how much supply growth we see in that region. At a time when seems like you and others are really contracting in the area and there is very little service activity going on, just given your macro thoughts so far during the call, what are your views in terms of sustainability of Libyan production here given there's ramp-down in activity? And I guess what's the trigger point for you to make a decision on whether or not you start to cut headcount there, and is that strictly going to be just on land side or is that going to be offshore as well?","Paal Kibsgaard","In terms of our resource base, that's something that we continue to look at in any country that we're in. Offshore, we're currently operating one rig. There might be another couple of rigs added in the next couple of quarters, but that's not a significant part of the headcount that is related to the offshore activity. The main headcount is focused on the land business. And the land business is, as I said, at the minimal level. So we are currently looking at what the outlook for 2015 is.","Q3 of 2014 is about 50% down in activity in Libya compared to what we saw in Q3 of last year. And that low activity in our mind, if it's not changed, we'd obviously have an impact on the sustainable production capacity of Libya going forward. So the fact that Libya, which I think in OPEC now is listed as about 900,000, but obviously the key to maintain that production capacity is to continuously invest into it.","Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil","You mentioned Brazil now as a tailwind for next year. I know there's a Wireline services contract that's pending. Can you talk about timing on that? And would that be incremental to Schlumberger or is that strictly just a re-tender here of an existing contract?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, the two main contracts that have been out for tender recently have been the Wireline services one and the directional drilling (inaudible) contract. We maintain the market share we had in both contracts. We had the largest lot in Wireline and the middle lot in drilling and measurement, which we see as good, because it basically prevents us from having any significant mobilization or demobilization cost which are always key to the profitability of these types of contracts. And both of those contracts we got quite reasonable price increases while we maintain our market share.","So activity-wise or market share-wise, no change for us, but the pricing and really no additional cost of mobilizing or demobilizing. So I would say that these contracts are incremental to Schlumberger in 2015. I expect the contracts to be finalized over the next couple of quarters.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Tillery with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","In talking about the exploration results for you all, obviously seismic is down, but in the release several times the success in Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa specifically, there's been tailwinds for margins. Just given the customer degree of exploration success this year, how does that impact your view of, say, the next 12 to 15 months, just specifically in terms of how it could impact the ECA region?","Paal Kibsgaard","I agree with you. The exploration success both in 2013 and 2014 has been relatively poor, which I think is part of the reason why a number of customers are taking a step back and reevaluating their prospects and then how they're going to go about doing this. So like I said, we see exploration spend this year being down 4% to 5% driven by seismic. But looking towards 2015, we expect exploration spend to be flattish to only slightly down. And again, this is going to be driven by seismic. So we continue to see good exploration drilling activity and the main thing impacting exploration spend is still going to be seismic next year.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","The success you're having in bucking the overall trend, how much of the integration that you discussed back in June is a driving force in that?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think the impact of the whole range of transformation of efforts that we're doing as well as new technology and as well as our integration capabilities, all of these elements are key factors that allows us to produce outstanding results, in particular in the international market. And we expect that strength to continue to grow and expand going forward, as we further implement these transformational programs.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo.","Jud Bailey - Wells Fargo","In Norway, you've had StatOil who is starting to scale back activity and now you add on to that. You got a little bit lower commodity prices. I'd be curious to know how you see that market playing out maybe over the next one to two years with commodity prices as a headwind and StatOil kind of suffering through some cost overruns.","Paal Kibsgaard","In terms of what the commodity price is going to be, I think it's too early to say what level it's going to be at in 2015. Obviously there's been a sharp drop over the past two to four weeks. How this is going to evolve I think is still highly uncertain, and I still believe that there's going to be some kind of recovery happening.","Now rate into the North Sea, we still see low single-digit growth in activity for our North Sea geo market in 2015. And you got to break that down into three. First in Norway, we expect to see lower exploration activity and flat development activity. In the UK, we actually expect to see somewhat higher exploration activity next year and still flat development activity. And in addition to this, other in North Sea geo market, we continue to manage somewhat the remote activities, and there's strong remote activity next year. We have project in the Canaries. We have a project in Cyprus. And we also have a project in Mauritania that we manage out of the North Sea.","So overall for that business unit and the assets and the resources we have in the North Sea, we see still some growth in 2015.","Jud Bailey - Wells Fargo","You noted all the various headwinds and tailwinds internationally for 2015. It looks like, and you've alluded to this, Latin America is poised to finally show a nice recovery. Knowing what you know today, will Latin America be your best growth market in 2015 versus even the Middle East and Asia?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think it's still too early to say. But if you look at the trends that we saw in Q3, we are clearly seeing the recovery of Latin America with good growth in pretty much every geo market. So I'm quite optimistic about what Latin America can do next year. And one thing is the revenue growth. The other thing is the pretax operating income growth. And I would say for next year, I'm quite optimistic at this stage still on Latin America in terms of growing earnings and similarly also for Europe, Africa as well as the Middle East. So those will still, I think, be the three main drivers of earnings growth in the international market next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brad Handler with Jefferies.","Brad Handler - Jefferies","I'd like to come back to your artificial lift initiative. Maybe as a grounding for us, can you ballpark the revenue contribution that you've acquired just in terms of framing for us your starting point for growth?","Paal Kibsgaard","I can, but I won't. If you want to try to make some interpretation, we gave you some numbers on installations of pump jacks and PCPs. It might not be easily transferrable to revenue, but we've had a big program. We bought a number of smaller companies. And it has a reasonable contribution to North America and also to our overall artificial lift position. But I'm not going to break out and give you a specific revenue number.","Brad Handler - Jefferies","In an environment if there's a somewhat lower commodity price, what is your sense of the impact on artificial lift on the production side of the business, maybe a little bit more broadly presumably in the North America market?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, for the overall production business in the event that activity is down in North America, any part of the business might have challenges and pressure on pricing. I think again where you'll see it the fastest and the most will likely be in pressure pumping. In terms of artificial lift, we have not seen the same uptick in pricing when activity is very high, and I don't expect to see the same kind of pressure there as well. But any flattening of growth or reduction in activity will likely have an impact on pricing in any product line. But I think it's way too early to say even for North America whether we will be in that situation in 2015.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citi.","Scott Gruber - Citi","Another scenario if crude prices stay low, your project management businesses, both drilling and production, should be real differentiators. How bigger are these businesses as a percentage of revenue now, and given the contract backlog, what's the growth outlook for '15?","Paal Kibsgaard","We're not breaking out these numbers. Other than that, we've given some indication of how much our integration related business is. That's not all project management or production management. That's any type of integration. In a more challenging environment, the ability to take on projects and provide more integration to drive value will be a competitive strength.","Scott Gruber - Citi","And I believe that there's some flex in how you pursue with your internal transformation given market dynamics. So if we paint a scenario where upstream CapEx flattens and the expectation is flat for a few years, can you provide some color on what changes you make to your program and how quickly you think you can achieve some of your targets, realizing that some are partially dependent upon customer acceptance of your tools? How quickly do you think you can accelerate some of those changes?","Paal Kibsgaard","We have some discretion as to what we can accelerate in terms of the implementation, but some of these things are also based on the overall schedule that we've laid out and things that we have to develop in order to roll them out. But yes, there is some flexibility of accelerating investment and implementation in terms of part of the transformation. And these are things we are actually looking at now. We laid out our financial targets for 2017 in June in New York. And they were predicated on macro and industry assumptions. And if these assumptions end up being optimistic, we will see what we can do internally to still be within the ranges that we've given or at least close to them even if the macro assumptions are below.","I can't promise that we will do it, but that's obviously going to be the ambition. So new technology introductions, new technology sales and acceleration of transformation programs are going to be key drivers that potentially would allow us to do that.","Operator","And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Mr. Farrant for any closing comments.","Simon Farrant","Well, that's all the time we have for questions today.

For the conference, all the participant lines are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions; instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","With that being said, I\u2019ll turn the conference now over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead, sir.","Malcolm Theobald","Thank you, John. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2013 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from New York City and joining us on the call today are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.","However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I\u2019d like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Simon.","Simon Ayat","Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits was $1.29. This is the highest earnings per share for a quarter in the history of Schlumberger. It represents an increase of $0.14 sequentially and it is $0.25 higher when compared to the same quarter last year.","As a reminder, last quarter we completed the wind down of our operations in Iran and as a result, this business was classified as a discontinued operation. All the prior period amounts have been restated. Third quarter revenue of $11.6 billion increased 3.8% sequentially with 7% growth in North America and 3% International.","As you will recall from a financial reporting standpoint, we do not consolidate the OneSubsea joint venture. As such, this was the first quarter we did not record any revenue from the subsea business that we transferred to the venture. Excluding this effect, revenue grew by over 5%. Oilfield Services pretax operating income increased 9.6% sequentially, while the pretax operating margins improved 114 basis points to 21.5%.","Sequential highlights by product group were as follows. Reservoir Characterization revenue of $3.2 billion increased 7.3% and pretax income grew by just over 8%. This resulted in margins improving to 30.4%. This growth was driven by very strong international performances in both Wireline and Testing Services, most notably in Russia. Improved vessel utilization at WesternGeco also contributed to the growth.","Drilling Group revenue of $4.4 billion increased 2.8% and margin improved by 154 basis points to 20.3%. These increases were largely attributable to the Drilling and Measurements and M-I SWACO on robust offshore activity. Production Group revenue of $4 billion increased 2.5%, while pretax income increased 13.1%. This resulted in margin expansion of 165 basis points to 17.6%. Excluding the effects of the transfer of our subsea business to OneSubsea, Production Group revenue grew by over 6%. This growth was led by Well Services on a strong recovery following the seasonal spring breakup in Canada last quarter. Increased activity for Completion and Artificial Lift as well as continued increasing profitability in SPM, were also significant contributors to the growth.","Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits was 22.7% in the third quarter, compared to 23.3% in the previous quarter, reflecting the business mix between North America and International. The year-to-date effective tax rate for 2013 is 23.2%.","From a cash flow perspective, we have generated approximately $6 billion of cash flow from operation during the first nine months of this year. This strong cash generation has allowed us to continue to invest in growth opportunities, while at the same time, returning over $2.7 billion of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases during this period.","Net debt at the end of third quarter was $5.6 billion. This is unchanged from the end of Q2, despite the fact that we spent $833 million on our stock buyback program during Q3. During the quarter, we spent $953 million on CapEx and repurchased 10.1 million shares at an average price of $82.61. Total year for 2013, CapEx is still expected to be approximately $3.9 billion as compared to the $4.7 billion spent in 2012.","And now, I will turn the conference call over to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Simon. Our third quarter results continued to show good progress driven by solid performance in both the International and North American markets. Our strong focus on integration, quality and efficiency remains core to our execution, and I am pleased with the response we are seeing from our organization in addition to the impact the efforts are having on our results.","Sequentially, revenue grew by 4% excluding our subsea business, which in Q3 is included in the OneSubsea JV, while margins expanded by 114 basis points to yield a 10% growth in pretax operating income. Compared to the same quarter last year, pretax operating income was up 20%.","New technology sales coupled with further market share gains contributed strongly to the quarter\u2019s results, and this is also reflected in our revenue per rig indicator, which improved again sequentially. The size and breadth of our operations and the quality of our execution allowed us to once again show widespread consistency in terms of financial performance, with all four operating areas posting operating margins north of 20%. In addition and for the second quarter in a row, we posted sequential incremental margins over 50%, while free cash flow progressed from the already solid levels of Q2 to reach $1.5 billion driven by improving asset utilization and tight management of working capital.","Our International business continued to strengthen in the third quarter with year-over-year revenue growth of 12% and margin expansion of 134 basis points to reach 23%. Sequential revenue growth was 3%, dampened by operational delays in some regions, but proactive management and disciplined execution allowed us to generate 73% incremental margins on this growth. In spite of the operational delays experienced in Q3, we have not seen any structural changes to customer plans and we continue to maintain a positive outlook for our International business.","In terms of pricing, we are not seeing any signs of an inflection point. However, the current operating environment with highly competitive pricing on basic services and slow but steady activity growth where we can get a premium for new technology and for the quality of our execution, suits us very well, as it plays to our strengths and allows us to continue to generate superior financial results.","In Latin America, revenue was up 1% sequentially, while margins were flat at 20.6%. The sequential results were driven by strong performance throughout the area with the exception of Mexico and Brazil, where continuing challenges tampered growth. While we see the current headwinds reducing somewhat in 2014, we expect the situation for our overall business in the region to remain more or less unchanged in the fourth quarter.","On a year-over-year basis and in spite of the ongoing challenges, revenues were up 4%, while margins expanded 273 basis points. In Mexico, revenue was down sequentially driven by the completion of contracts in the north and lower product sales offshore, which were only partly offset by the ramp up of activity in the south. In spite of the challenges we had faced in Mexico this year, we remain optimistic on the longer-term outlook for this market, and we are actively positioning ourselves for the future opportunities.","In Brazil, revenue was also lower sequentially due to the startup of new contracts with Petrobras as well as due to lower activity for both independent and international customers. Based on the latest customer plans, we expect our activity to remain flat in the country in the fourth quarter. Elsewhere in Latin America, our business is progressing well driven by Ecuador, where the Shushufindi project continues to perform better than plan, by Argentina where we are actively involved in the Vaca Muerta shale work and by Venezuela where we are still ramping up activity following the signing of the payment agreement in the second quarter. In the Middle Eastern Asia, results were particularly strong, with sequential revenue growth of 5%, while margins increased 151 basis points to 26%.","On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 25% while margins were up by 330 basis points. In the Middle East, sequential growth was, again, solid in Saudi Arabia and Iraq, while the highest growth rate was seen in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, where we also have very strong market positions. We are currently in the process of transferring in additional people and equipment to Saudi Arabia to keep pace with the additional work that we are taking on, while the \u2013 while in the United Arab Emirates, we have just completed a large mobilization linked to a recent major contract win.","Asia also posted strong sequential results headed up by China, where conventional and tight gas activities on land were the main drivers. We also signed our first SPM project in China during the quarter and the team that will manage this tight gas project in the Ordos Basin will be on the ground in Q4. Elsewhere in Asia, Indonesia and Malaysia also showed strong growth in the third quarter, driven by offshore exploration and development work, while activity in Australia was flat sequentially.","In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue was up 2% sequentially and margins increased 189 basis points. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 7% while margins were up 83% basis points. Russia was, again, a major driver for our performance posting a record quarter with strong sequential activity growth as well as excellent incremental margins.","Our wide footprint in the region provides a solid foundation for our business, which is essential for addressing such a large and diverse market. These sequential results were driven by Russia land and Sakhalin on high exploration and development drilling, and going forward, we continue to see Russia as one of our fastest-growing markets.","In the North Sea, sequential growth was driven by strong WesternGeco seismic activity and solid drilling activity in Norway, while our UK business was impacted by summer rig maintenance. In North Africa, we had another challenging quarter in terms of top line growth due to operational delays in Algeria and continued security challenges and lower rig activity in Libya.","In Sub-Saharan Africa, activity was mixed as a result of project delays linked to the influx of new rigs to the region. Still the overall activity outlook remains robust as the surge of rigs into the market continues and as customers firm up exploration programs in frontier countries. In North America, we had a very strong quarter with revenue up 7% sequentially to set an all time high and with margins expanding by 57 basis points to reach 20.3%.","On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up 9% and margins were up 176 basis points. In the land market, the U.S. rig count remained flat sequentially while the seasonal recovery in Canada was more or less on par with last year. The downwards pricing pressure continued in most product lines in the third quarter including pressure pumping, although at a slowing rate.","Looking at our land performance, I am very pleased with the quality and efficiency of our execution as well as with the team work within our organization, which is a key driver for our results. We have come a long way since we started the transformation of our North America land business three years ago, to the point that we are now setting the pace in North America land just as we do in the rest of the world in terms of both new technology deployment as well as financial results.","As an illustration of this, we activated four additional hydraulic fracturing fleets in U.S. land during the third quarter, following a number of recent contract wins. As a result, our third quarter stage count increased by 7% sequentially. Looking at the North America offshore markets, we also posted solid sequential growth driven by new technology sales and the quality of our execution. Offshore Eastern Canada, we successfully completed an isometric survey in early September and activity continued to be strong in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico with minimal impacts from the hurricane season so far this year.","Let\u2019s then turn to technology, where I will give you an update on our ongoing progress in the shale markets in North America. Over the past 12 months, we have continued to actively promote our shale reservoir workflow to the market with a strong focus on optimizing both well locations as well as completion design. As part of these efforts, we have introduced a data consortium business model, where multiple customers with neighboring acreage can contribute reservoir and production data and then co-fund field and well studies as well as the construction of 3D reservoir models for the shale plays.","In return, each customer receives all the findings and conclusions from the consortium studies in addition to the reservoir model covering their acreage. We have so far conducted three such studies with very interesting findings and conclusions and these studies together with our technologies and workflows has helped to significantly improve the well performance for the participating customers.","One major conclusion we have confirmed is that in order to optimize production, recovery and costs of the shale developments, there is a clear need to shift focus from the level of a stage down to the level of the individual perforation clusters that make up a stage. The reason for this is that the studies including production logs show that in traditional completions on average between 30% and 70% of the perforation clusters do not contribute to production.","This means that we are not effectively addressing the available shale reservoir throughout the entire length of a stage and that we generally over-fracture a subset of the perforation clusters. Based on these findings, we are actively working on a number of technologies that target this opportunity.","During the third quarter, we started field testing one of these new technologies, a novel solids-based diversion technology. The diversion pill is added to the fracturing fluid at various times during the pumping of a stage and this effectively seals off the clusters that are currently taking frac fluid. This allows us to access the perforation clusters that have yet to be properly fractured.","This new diversion technology has two primary applications. first, in improving production and recovery by ensuring that more perforation clusters are accessed within a traditional stage; and second, in lowering completion costs by increasing the length of a stage, thereby reducing the number of frac plugs installed and subsequently milled in the well.","Diversion technologies are not new to the fracturing market. they have been around in the industry for a while in various forms, however, so far without showing tangible or consistent results. The novelty of our approach is in the robust design and engineering of the diversion pill and the fact that field test results so far are showing very promising results.","We plan to continue our field testing of this technology in the coming quarters, and in addition, we will also evaluate the technology as a potential way to refracture existing wells that are underperforming in terms of production. In parallel with our growing new technology penetration of the North America shale market, we have been gaining market share in hydraulic fracturing in recent quarters at what we consider acceptable incremental margins.","These market share gains led us to activate the four additional frac fleets I referred to earlier in my comments. In terms of the equipment, the four new fleets were mobilized from pumps made available from our existing fleets that are in operation, due to steadily improving asset utilization and hence represent a zero net capacity addition to our field operations.","This significant achievement is a result of ongoing R&D work focused on improving the reliability, extending the maintenance intervals, and reducing the maintenance costs of our hydraulic fracturing fleet. The strategy driving these R&D efforts has been to improve the design of the consumable part of our pump, rather than building a new pump that requires additional capital investment. These innovations have already helped to improve reliability and reduce the maintenance costs of our asset base.","Currently, only a subset of our fleet has been upgraded, but we expect that through our normal maintenance schedule, we will have the entire fleet upgraded by the end of 2014. This upgrade will be fully covered through our ongoing operating costs and involves no capital investments.","Let\u2019s now turn to the macroenvironment, where we in recent months have seen a number of positive signs in the world economy. The Eurozone is now out of its longest recession on record, the U.S. continues to show favorable trends in spite of the fiscal debate and the most recent data from China suggests a lower risk of a significant slowdown.","Overall, these factors are offsetting lower growth expectations in some of the emerging economies. These trends are currently expected to continue in 2014, translating into both a higher GDP growth rate and increasing global oil demand compared to 2013.","On the supply side, spare capacity, including the shut-in production in Libya, remains stable at around 4.5 million barrels per day. And even with an unlikely increase of Iranian crude exports in 2014, spare capacity will likely remain in the range of 5 million barrels per day in the coming year.","At this stage, we therefore expect continued support for Brent crude prices around $100 per barrel going into 2014. However, the makeup of the risk premium is likely to shift somewhat with lower supply uncertainty and potentially lower geopolitical risk, offset by more resilient demand and lower macroeconomic concerns.","The international gas market is expected to remain stable, supported by strong demand in Asia, while in the U.S. resilient production levels and strong competition with coal indicates that our recovery in dry gas drilling activity continues to be pushed out in time.","In terms of E&P spend, the second half of this year is unfolding in line with expectations. Visibility of 2014 is still limited, as our customers are in their planning process. but at this stage, we foresee a continuation of the overall trend seen in 2013, which should yield another year of steady activity growth.","In this environment, our entire organization continues to focus on both new technology sales and the quality and efficiency of our execution. In parallel with our ongoing operations, we are actively pursuing our internal transformation programs focused on leveraging the size of our operations and the breadth of our offering and with a clear goal of further elevating our performance in terms of top line growth, margin expansion and cash generation.","That concludes my remarks. I will now hand the call back to Malcolm.","Malcolm Theobald","Thank you, Paal. John, we\u2019ll now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We do ask in your time, if you can please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. First, we go to James West with Barclays. Please go ahead.","James Carlyle West \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning, James.","James Carlyle West \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Paal, clearly good progress in your strong momentum in the international markets, I know you touched on kind of how the year should end up here in case some broad guidance reports. I was hoping you could dig in a little bit further on 2014 and just give us your view of, we had obviously \u2013 we\u2019re going to have strong growth this year, probably low double-digit growth internationally on E&P spending, do you think that\u2019s going to be kind of steady, more the same, is it going to accelerate or is there potential for some slowdown in the E&P spending?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, as I mentioned, James, in my prepared remarks, I think it\u2019s still early to comment on specific numbers on what the international growth is going to be next year, but as I said, the \u2013 from where we stand today, I think a continuation of the trends that we\u2019ve seen this year is our most likely bet. That means reasonable growth in the spend levels, but that the market dynamics that we play in will continue to see steady activity growth, but competitive basic pricing. But as along as we can get a premium for new technology and the quality of our execution, we are comfortable that we can continue to generate solid incremental margins without a inflection in the pricing.","James Carlyle West \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understood, okay and then just a quick follow-up from me. On the international markets, you mentioned Russia is one that looks to be good for 2014. What other kind of key large markets are you looking at to drive this growth?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I would probably name the same five that as I\u2019ve been talking about throughout this year. So that\u2019s basically\u2026","James Carlyle West \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sure.","Paal Kibsgaard","\u2026Russia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East, with particular focus on both Saudi Arabia and Iraq, but UAE, we have also gained significant share in recent quarters and I see the UAE also to be a strong growth driver in 2014, and then, in addition, China and Australia, as we talked about again this year.","James Carlyle West \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","And next we go to line of Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks [indiscernible] Paal. So Paal, just curious your thoughts around the North American market and your ability as you said to utilize your efficiencies to increase the number of frac crews operating. Just wondering what\u2019s your concept in terms of the implication? You already have 20% excess capacity of equipment and if you are getting more efficient in utilizing your existing assets in the marketplace, do you think it takes a while longer for the supply, demand lines to cross with respect to frac?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I can only speak for us, but I would say that we still have upside in terms of the operational efficiency of how we conduct our business, which we show with the activation or basically creation of four additional fleets out of the existing asset base that is currently in operation. So yes, at least for us, I would say that in general it would take us most likely longer to consume the overcapacity we have, unless we gain significant share to the point that we choose to activate some other fleets that we have in the idle asset program as well. But as of now, we are continuing to focus in on the operational efficiencies of the assets we have in operation, and if we can get decent incremental margins on additional work that we potentially take on, we will primarily look to create fleets out of assets currently in operation before we look to the idle asset program.","Kurt Hallead \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","So from your standpoint, then if I were to \u2013 and if I understand what you\u2019re saying correctly that irrespective of the excess capacity in a marketplace that may exist or may continue to exist, given your internal drivers, you feel very confident about your ability to get margin improvement?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, in the pressure pumping business, not dramatically right, because pricing is actually still going down, but as long as we can offset that with new technology and operational efficiency, there is potential to get some improvement in margins in pressure pumping, but obviously what helps our margin as well is a strong offshore business and also a good drilling and characterization business on land, where the pricing pressures have been less than what we\u2019ve seen in the pressure pumping.","Kurt Hallead \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great. And then my follow-up question would be in the context of the level of optimism that you expressed in your commentaries here on the call and in the written commentary, how do you feel about the progression from an earning standpoint. I think the Street has tended to get out in front of itself a little bit too much and put you guys in a tough position where you had to hog numbers down, how do you feel about the earnings progression as it sits right now, as you head into 2013 and even more importantly into 2014?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, if we started looking at Q4 first, as you know, we do not give guidance, but I would say a couple of things about the fourth quarter. Firstly; that the fundamentals of our business remains intact going into Q4, but there are some seasonal effects that I think everyone should factor in. On the negative side of these effects is that we are likely to or we will see seasonal slowdown in some of our highest growth markets this year such as Russia and China, which will have an impact. We\u2019ll see the normal seasonal slowdown in Marine Seismic and we also expect to see some impact from the holiday season in North America. While on the positive side, we have the year-end product sales, which will offset some of this. But overall, if I look where the current consensus for Q4 is now, I would say it\u2019s about right.","Now looking into 2014, obviously very early to look at specific EPS targets, other than that; again, the fundamentals of our business remain strong, and our overall target is going to be to continue to deliver double-digit growth in earnings per share, and that will be for the fourth year in a row.","Kurt Hallead \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great. Paal, I appreciate it. Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from David Anderson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","David Anderson \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. So Paal, you\u2019ve been highlighting the new efficiency and reliability efforts that you\u2019ve been implementing throughout the organization. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how this has already attributed to margin improvement, specifically, as I kind of look at Europe, Africa, CIS margins. Over last two years, you\u2019ve gone from mid-teens to low 20s now and Middle East margins kind of took a step up. Could you talk a little bit about how much of that was due to these efficiency efforts that you have in place and how much is left in there do you think over the next couple of years?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I would say that the progression we have shown in these operating areas over the past year is partly down to very strong management focus on managing both working capital and costs in general, so that on basic activity growth without pricing, we can generate quite significant incremental margins. So our transformation programs are looking at some structural changes to how we are set up and how we conduct and run our business. I would say that there is not a significant part of these structural changes that have taken place so far. So a lot of what we are doing now is just managing with particular focus on driving both cash flow and incremental margins, and that overtime, we will see more of the impact of these structural changes as part of the transformation. So there is little structural changes impact on our results as of yet.","David Anderson \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, in other words, even without pricing, you should still see margins continue to improve in eastern hemisphere?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, that's what we're going to work towards, yes.","David Anderson \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Okay. On the U.S. side, I was just curious you talked a lot about the technology and particularly on the perforation clusters. I think in the release, you had talked about Whiting. I was just curious if you could kind of compare and contrast the E&Ps versus the majors in the resource plays that you are working in. It seems to us like the E&Ps are a lot closer towards the true development phase whereas the majors are a little bit further behind. I\u2019m just curious in terms of technology that you are talking about. Are we talking more of your conservation of the E&P side or are the majors kind of sitting back watching and then will implement this later? How do you see this playing out?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think generally, we talked to all of our customers about these things. So I don't see a huge difference between what the independents do and what the IOCs do in this market space, right. I mean, it's all about the acreage, the challenges and the main focus and priorities that they have. So we are openly discussing the whole range of capabilities and new ideas and innovations that we have with all our customers and I can't really separate I would say who is doing what. I think they are all eager to look at what can be done better and the way they are implementing obviously varies depending on what their priorities are.","David Anderson \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And next we go to Bill Herbert with Simmons & Co. Please go ahead.","Bill A. Herbert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","Thank you. Good morning. Back to your markings, Paal, for a second and your internal transformation. So I was struck by the fact sort of breadth and sweep of the internal transformation with regard to structural change, which you\u2019re trying to prosecute and this is the second consecutive quarter that you have generated incremental margins in excess of 50% and yet you say thus far that has very little to do with the internal transformation that you are trying prosecute?","Paal Kibsgaard","In general, yes. These \u2013 we always are doing pilots, we are trying things out at a small scale in various places around the world, but that\u2019s in its \u2013 still in its early phase. So yes, there has not been significant structural changes as to how we operate our international business. Obviously in North America, we started our transformation about three years ago, so a significant part of these structural changes have already taken place there, but in the international business, no there has not been any significant impact of structural changes yet.","Bill A. Herbert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","Okay and I think you mentioned that one of your objectives along with these internal transformational initiatives was to get back to prior cycle consolidated operating margins, which I think for something like 26% to 27% thereabouts. You are 20% today on a consolidated basis. Over what timeframe should we expect that evolution to take place roughly?","Paal Kibsgaard","But I\u2019m not going to give you a timeframe here. I mean, we have a horizon of these transformation objectives of plus, minus five years. Exactly when we\u2019re going to hit or if we\u2019re going to hit this targets is too early to say, but we set out quite an ambitious target and that is to get back to previous cycle operating margins and I\u2019m still optimistic and relatively confident that we are going to get there.","Bill A. Herbert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","Okay, and last one from me. Recently Total came out at its Analyst Day and announced a fairly significant reduction in capital spending over the next two years. And we\u2019ve sort of talked about this before, I mean, the IOCs in deepwater, NOCs are cash flow constrained and it tend on the one hand an opportunity rich on the other hand. So two questions in that particular regard; one, the outlook for seismic and two the outlook for deepwater capital spending in terms of rate of change going forward?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, that\u2019s a lot of questions wrapped into one. But I\u2019ll \u2013 let us start up with the seismic, so maybe I\u2019d say a little bit about our seismic results in Q3 and then on the outlook and then we can go on to the next part of your question right. But Q3 results gross were solid, multi-client was down a bit about 9% sequentially, which was in line with our expectations. In marine, we had a good quarter as expected, fully booked, good pricing from the new technology, but really no further traction on basic pricing and also on land, we had a very good quarter. We have restructured our land business over the past year, focusing now entirely on Unique deployed in Middle East and North Africa and we are now generating very solid operating margins on land, which is as long time since we\u2019ve done.","Now in terms of the outlook for seismic, as you can see from our disclosure, our backlog is now at $856 million, which is down 12% year-over-year, but this backlogging includes all four parts of our business; the marine, the land, the data processing and the multi-client. So actually the main driver for the year-over-year growth in the backlog is actually land, and that\u2019s basically due to the fact that we have downsized our business and focusing more narrowly on Unique and Middle East and North Africa.","So the marine backlog was slightly up year-over-year, but the visibility on Q1, Q2 is lower than what we had at the same stage last year. It doesn\u2019t mean that there are no surveys out there, but our customers are now in their planning cycle and they have been reluctant to make early commitment as to these surveys that they have on the table.","So I would say that we basically expect to gain further visibility on marine seismic activity during the fourth quarter. So there is a bit of uncertainty over that as of now, but I can\u2019t really conclude what that\u2019s going to mean for next year. So overall, the outlook for seismic, for data processing, land and multi-client looks solid, with some lower visibility on marine.","Now in terms of deepwater, there is \u2013 we\u2019re still quite, I would say, bullish and optimistic on deepwater. There are a number of new rigs coming into the market in Q4 and also going into 2014 and that\u2019s going to grow \u2013 that\u2019s going to drive the deepwater spend in 2014. So we\u2019re still optimistic on deepwater.","Bill A. Herbert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Our next question is from Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ole H. Slorer \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And thanks for that. Paal, I wonder whether you could elaborate a little bit more on what you said on the efficiencies in North America pressure pumping market. Your pitch sounded a little bit increased productivity from the well and reducing the number of stages needed, sounded pretty much like the picture on introduction of highway a little while back. Is it something more than highway gaining foothold?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I think highway is one technology that obviously has applications in the market. As I\u2019ve been saying over the past year or so, we continue to work on other technologies as well. So there is \u2013 while highway increases conductivity in the fractures that we create, this new technology I talked about today, the diversion technology, has a different objective, which is basically to ensure that we access all the perforation clusters along the horizontal section, which the industry basically today does not do.","So it\u2019s another technology, which in conjunction or in parallel with highway can help to drive production and reduce costs.","Ole H. Slorer \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. thanks for clarifying. Also on Framo, well, did you account for anything at all this quarter or is it the one quarter delay on how you report the equity income?","Simon Ayat","Ole, Simon here. We reported on one-month lag, but it is \u2013 we didn\u2019t report anything during this quarter from Framo. So\u2026","Ole H. Slorer \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So that would have added a couple of cents.","Simon Ayat","Quarter-to-quarter, it\u2019s basically in Q2, we have Framo and in the third quarter, it is part of the venture and it will be reported by the OneSubsea as they consolidate in Cameron.","Ole H. Slorer \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Simon Ayat","What did you say, Ole?","Ole H. Slorer \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","No, that \u2013 that\u2019s clear. Thanks for clarifying.","Operator","Our next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. Please go ahead.","Angie M. Sedita \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Angie M. Sedita \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Morning. On the North America market, clearly your strength in technology and execution have led to very impressive efficiencies and you noted the deployment of additional frac crews in the U.S. Do you think \u2013 on existing equipment and not using capital, which I think is very interesting, do you think you will be able to continue this in 2014, where in essence, you are adding additional frac crews into the market without adding any and or on-stacking any capacity or adding any capital?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, we don\u2019t plan to add any capital in 2014 based on where we stand now. So if we \u2013 it\u2019s all going to be a function of the amount of works that we will win and the first priority will be to try to address that work through the equipment we already have deployed. and beyond that, we are prepared to activate assets from the idle asset program, if we cannot address the work with the assets already in operation. but I think there is still upside in terms of the efficiency and utilization of the assets we already have in operation.","Angie M. Sedita \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Great, fair enough, and then as a follow-up to that, clearly, you are seeing significant efficiency gains through execution on the pressure pumping side. Are there other product lines outside of pressure pumping that are particularly apps to be able to drive additional product efficiencies through execution or are there specific regions that you think you could see more of it as you go into 2014 internationally?","Simon Ayat","Well, internationally, we continue to drive efficiency through other operations, right. There is no one item that I would single out. I think every product line that we have, all 15 of them, have specific programs and targets where they drive both the efficiency of our workforce as well as the utilization of our assets in all aspects of our operations. So, that's a key part of what you see in terms of the incremental margins that we are generating in the international market.","Angie M. Sedita \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Great. I'll turn it over.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","William D. Sanchez \u2013 Howard Weil Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Paal, I just had one question as it relates to your longer term outlook on Brazil. I know you hadn't always felt like this would be kind of a transition year in the contrary and you remarked 4Q you see activity flat versus third quarter which was down. Can you just give us your more longer term thoughts on Brazil as a whole and how we should expect that unfolding for Schlumberger here next year?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I would say that, our view on 2014 overall in Brazil is that it\u2019s going to be another challenging year. And it's mainly down to the activity levels that we see at this stage, which is relatively flat from where we stand now. That's a function of obviously of what Petrobras is planning to do, but also there is some impact in this in lower activity projected for both the Brazilian independents as well as on the IOCs in Brazil in 2014.","2015 is likely to be higher when the exploration work linked to the last license round is likely to kick in, but the majority of the activity in Brazil next year for us is going to be centered around Petrobras who are not looking to significantly grow activity at least from what we can see at this stage.","William D. Sanchez \u2013 Howard Weil Inc.","Okay. And for you, you feel like you are pretty well balanced in terms of service and equipment capacity in Brazil?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. We are we well set up in Brazil. We have a strong focus on both quality and efficiency and also introduction of new technology for these long-term contracts. So I\u2019m comfortable with our position and our set up in Brazil, it is challenging, but we are executing well.","William D. Sanchez \u2013 Howard Weil Inc.","Okay. And that was it from me. I\u2019ll turn it back. Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Michael Kirk LaMotte \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning guys. I wanted to follow-up Paal on the transformation program and in particular ask you about some of the metrics we can be looking at over the next five years. We tend to focus on top line growth and incremental margins and obviously the margins should improve and you\u2019ve given some good guidance there. But if I think about capital efficiency, can you give us some sense as to where you think ratios such as reinvestment rates, CapEx to revenue, asset turnover, some of the key utilization metrics that might better reflect the doubling of asset utilization and some of the other elements of the program?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I mean, I would reiterate the main indicators that I gave you during my talk in this conference in Q3. We are aiming at doubling asset utilization, which by itself means that we should be able to reduce the CapEx relative to activity in terms of growth going forward. So I\u2019m not going to give you a specific CapEx as a percentage of revenue , other than that, we reduce CapEx in 2013 while we were still growing and my initial, I would say, indication for 2014 would be flat to slightly down on CapEx and that is assuming that we are still going to grow in 2014. So the focus on asset utilization should help us reduce CapEx relative to growth going forward.","Michael Kirk LaMotte \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. And then one other point on the financial focus areas, you mentioned cross training of the workforce particularly in remote areas. I'm wondering what that means in terms of new recruitment and thinking about training of \u2013 cross training or existing employees as appose to the recruitment program, university program, et cetera and overall headcount growth?","Paal Kibsgaard","Right. So, we are not looking in the near-term to change significantly the level of recruiting, because this all cross training and ensuring that we got proper competencies for the people that we do cross train is going to take a little bit of time. So, in the near-term, there is no change, no significant change to the level of recruiting that we are planning to do.","Michael Kirk LaMotte \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Brad Handler with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Brad Handler \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Simon Ayat","Morning.","Brad Handler \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","I guess Paal in your comments you\u2019ve spoken optimistically, bullishly about deepwater development, I understand that and we are looking at the rigs coming in and perhaps thinking similarly. I guess I'm curious if you have pause related to a couple of the events that seem to be at least percolating, I guess of anecdotally, which is in the Gulf of Mexico a bit of swapping out of new in place of older rigs even if they're still deepwater, even if they're still BP. And there perhaps in West Africa and Angola and Nigeria it seems like it's a bit of a backlog in terms of getting some of those rigs signed and under contract. So I guess I\u2019m curious for your thoughts about that. And I imagine you're calibrating that into your comments, but I guess I'm curious if that gives you pause if there is an element where you are a little less encouraged perhaps, because of those kinds of developments?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well I\u2019m aware that some of the new arrivals that are coming into the market in 2014 still do not have contracts. But based on what we are hearing from the drilling contractors, they appear confident that these rigs are going to get contracts by the time they arrive. To the other point that you are making, yes maybe some of the older generation rigs will be replaced by the newer generation. But either way, we have a positive view on the market. There were significant growth in deepwater drilling activity in 2011 and we expect the continuation on that trend into 2014.","Brad Handler \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Fair enough. Okay. An unrelated question, you mentioned in you\u2019re \u2013 the written commentary about Statoil, a couple of nice multi-year contracts, I guess on the fluid side as well as cementing. I think that there are one or if not more of those contracts still outstanding. I wonder if you could speak to us about the lay of the land there if you expect there are some awards that might still come and if you can at all calibrate if the implications for you given the fact that you've won the ones that you've announced?","Paal Kibsgaard","You\u2019re talking about Statoil Norway?","Brad Handler \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Yes.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I'm not aware of any major outstanding contracts beyond the ones that we have \u2013 that's already been awarded earlier this year as well as the ones that we are referencing now. But I would say overall our position in Norway and our position with Statoil is strong from where we see it and we're well positioned there.","Brad Handler \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Very good, okay, thanks. I\u2019ll turn it back.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Robin Shoemaker with Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead.","Robin E. Shoemaker \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Thank you. So, Paal, could you give us idea now of what percentage of your fracturing stages are employing the leading edge technologies such as Highway and this recent innovation that you mentioned on the diversion of perforation clusters. I mean what kind of percentage are we talking about here of total stages fracked?","Paal Kibsgaard","So, we haven't disclosed what percentage of stages are done with highway. The only thing I would say is that we have seen continuous growth in Highway stages throughout this year and the year-over-year growth is very significant as well. So, we continue to penetrate the market on highway. But we haven't been disclosing what percentage of our own stages we are doing highway on.","And on the other technology I referenced, this is the technology that is in field test. So, it is very limited what the deployment is and it's not yet commercialized. So, I would say that this is something that we are trying out. There is still a fair bit of field testing done before we are potentially going to commercialize it. But I wanted to share with you this technology, because it is interesting and the early field test results are showing great promise.","Robin Shoemaker \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Okay. And just staying on that theme, you had mentioned in some of your earlier kind of outlines of the evolution of highway and other fracking technologies that you could eventually come to a point where you might not be necessarily providing the fracturing fleets themselves, but more providing technology for the fracking operations. Is there any \u2013 how far have we advanced towards that possible goal and is it in the foreseeable future?","Paal Kibsgaard","What you are referencing is what we call this Spark model this is basically where we provide the fracturing fluid, the engineering, the blending while we have a third-party providing the horsepower. So we have deployed this business model with a number of customers who are vertically integrated in North America, but the overall business volume is I would say is not significant but it's continued to grow this year from where it was last year when we introduced it. And similarly, we have also deployed this business model for part of our operations in China.","Robin Shoemaker \u2013 Citi Investment Research","I see, okay. Thanks very much.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","We will go to Waqar Syed with Goldman, Sachs. Please go ahead.","Waqar Syed \u2013 Goldman, Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much. Paal just following upon highway are there any particular basins in the North America where highway has had the best penetration and could you outline which ones are those?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. I would say the basin where we have had the most success and where the penetration is the deepest is in the Eagle Ford. So we have a significant number of wells and stages down there over the past couple of years and also I think a fair bit of data indicating the results that highway can bring both in terms of higher production and recovery and lower cost in terms of pumping less propane.","Waqar Syed \u2013 Goldman, Sachs & Co.","Now is it something to do with the geology of the basin or the structure of the formation or this technology is applicable in or effective in every basin?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well generally, we believe its applicable in every basin I think what you find is that there are two main applications of highway. One is to increase conductivity so you thereby increase production and recovery. And the other one is that you reduce cost because in general we pump about 40% less [propant] per job which is a cost saving.","So, what we found that is that in Eagle Ford, we have both a significant production recovery increase together with the cost savings. While the production increases we have not seen the same level of production increases in some of the other basins, which is partly down to the geology as you reference it right. But in general we have not seen \u2013 we've always seen I would say a flat or higher production and we generally always see lower costs. So it's just a matter of the technology uptake taking a bit of time when you look at a large market like North America land.","Waqar Syed \u2013 Goldman, Sachs & Co.","Sure. And then just on, in terms of your efficiency improvements how they are having an impact on the margins, could you quantify for us what the margin impact has been in North America because of these efforts. And if you didn't have those efforts where the margins would have been?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I can't really give you a number on that. I mean, the efficiency improvements going all the way back three years to when we started restructuring the land business is obviously a key part of the performance that we continue to post quarter-after-quarter. But at the same time, we have a very strong offshore business both in Gulf of Mexico and Eastern Canada and we also have a very strong business in Alaska.","So it\u2019s a combination of everything where we needed to improve the most going back three years was in North America land and there has been a significant improvement there. But at the same time, we have continued to progress on our offshore and high-end business as well.","Waqar Syed \u2013 Goldman, Sachs & Co.","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Jim K. Wicklund \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning guys.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Jim K. Wicklund \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Paal geographically and product lines, your incrementals are through the roof and that's fabulous. Where geographically and what product lines typically generate the highest incrementals?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think if you are talk about international market, I think we had great results basically in all regions, I would say takeaway Latin America at this stage in terms of incrementals right. We managed to keep margins flat in Latin America in a very challenging business environment and mainly driven by the headwinds or challenges in Brazil and Mexico while the business in the other countries in Latin America progressed very well. So the incremental margins were driven by ECA and the Middle East and the Far East.","In terms of product lines, obviously characterization continues to do well. I mean their incremental margins were not as high this quarter but they have been progressing very well year-over-year and so far this year. But both drilling and production continues to do very well. So I can't really single out one specific product line internationally other than that all of them are doing very well and together they come together extremely well.","Jim K. Wicklund \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. My follow-up, if I could, is Brazil has been a difficult year for everybody this year and it maybe next year. What percentage of your Latin American revenues generally come from Brazil these days with the contract wins you have?","Paal Kibsgaard","We haven't disclosed that. So I\u2019m not going to...","Jim K. Wicklund \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Is it your biggest market in Latin America?","Paal Kibsgaard","It\u2019s not our biggest market in Latin America.","Jim K. Wicklund \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Holm Turner with RS Platou Markets. Please go ahead.","Holm Turner \u2013 RS Platou Markets AS","Yes. Hi, guys. Just a question on the operational delays that you had in this quarter. It sounds like much of that came in offshore Africa, I was just curious if you could give us a bit more color on that. Was the delayed in new builds coming out of the yards or was it more on the operator side? and related to that, do you think you can get most of that work back in 4Q and if so, maybe see a bit stronger sequential progression that you would typically expect seasonally?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think the Q2 operational delays was really the sum of all the things you mentioned. Some of the rigs delayed coming from the yard, then you've got to commission them and get them started off and then it's having everything ready from the customer side to start operations. Right. So no one thing impacting it. But there was a significant planned influx of rigs and there were delays with several aspects of it which is not uncommon for these types of markets. In terms of Q4, there will be some improvement in Q4, but I think it's going to go into Q1, Q2 before everything is ironed out.","Holm Turner \u2013 RS Platou Markets AS","Yes. Okay, alright. And just to change gears a little bit. I was just wondering if you could comment on the growth in the Arctic market. There is a lot of things going on there, you have Exxon Rosneft kicking off a drilling campaign in the Kara Sea next year, there is increasing activity in the Norwegian side of the barrens and talk of doing some work on the Russian side and of course there is Cairn and Greenland and also some Alaska work. So just curious if you can talk about the opportunity in the Arctic in terms of service intensity and sort of your expectation for how quickly that market can become significant for Schlumberger?","Paal Kibsgaard","That's a good question. I think we see Arctic as a interesting market and a good opportunity going forward. We are, I think, very well positioned to take part in that in particularly in Russia, we're already involved in one Arctic project there Prirazlomnaya. At the same time we are also actively pursuing the other projects that are coming up both in, like to say, Greenland as well as other places in Russia and North America and Norway. So in terms of overall impact and activity, I think it's going to take a bit of time before it becomes really material. But there is a significant potential there that we are going to actively position ourselves to take part in.","Holm Turner \u2013 RS Platou Markets AS","Okay. Thanks. And last other thing is that, your two largest competitors talking about sort of 10% E&P spending growth next year in North America. Would you kind of echo that sentiment? And if so, I was just curious if you\u2019re position in the Gulf of Mexico would give you the expectation that you might grow a bit faster than whatever the E&P spending comes in, in North America next year?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, like I said earlier in my prepared remarks, I think it's too early to comment on specific growth numbers for any part of the world next year, given the fact that our customers are still in their planning cycle. I am optimistic though that we'll see growth in North America in terms of spend next year and potentially higher than what we saw this year. But beyond that I\u2019m not ready to give you a number at this stage.","Holm Turner \u2013 RS Platou Markets AS","Okay. All right, thanks guys.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.","Simon Farrant","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited first quarter 2015 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston.","Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our first comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.","However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information, is included in the earnings press release on our website.","We welcome your questions after the prepared statements. Now, I will turn the call over to Simon.","Simon Ayat","Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share, excluding charges earning credits, was $1.06. This represents decreases of $0.44 sequentially and $0.15 when compared to the same quarter last year.","During the quarter, we recorded $439 million of pretax charges. This includes $390 million of charges associated with the headcount reduction of 11,000, as well as an incentivized leave of absence program. This program provides us with some flexibility as we manage the uncertainties of the current environment.","In Venezuela, during the first quarter, the SICAD II exchange rate of VEF50 to $1 was eliminated and replaced with a new system known as SIMADI. The SIMADI rate was approximately VEF192 as of the end of the quarter. As a result, we recorded $49 million of devaluation charge during the first quarter. After this charge, the U.S. dollar value of our Bolivar denominated net assets is not material. Therefore, any further devaluations of the Bolivar will not have a significant impact on our results.","Our first quarter revenue of $10.2 billion decreased 19% sequentially, while pretax operating margin decreased 255 basis points. Approximately 25% of the sequential revenue decline was attributable to the currency effect and the absence of the year-end increase in product, software and multi-client sales that we experienced last quarter. The remaining decrease was driven by activity and price declines.","Despite the very challenging environment, pretax operating margin declined 255 basis points sequentially which resulted in incremental margins of only 33%. This is a result of prompt and proactive cost management across the organization. It's worth noting that although our revenue was significantly impacted by the fall in value of many currencies, this phenomenon does not have a significant impact on our pretax operating income. This reflects the benefit of our local cost structure which largely serves as the natural hedge against currency movements on our bottom line.","Highlights by both product group were as follows. First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.6 billion, decreased 21% sequentially, while margins decreased 447 basis points, to 25.7%. These decreases were largely due to seasonally lower multi-client and software sales and a fall in higher margin exploration activity. Drilling group revenue of $4 billion decreased 15% sequentially, while margins only declined 80 basis points. These declines were primarily driven by the severe rig count drop in North America.","Production group revenue of $3.8 billion decreased 22% sequentially and margins fell by 389 basis points, primarily on lower pressure pumping activity and pricing pressure in North America land. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 20.9% in the first quarter, compared to 21.4% in the previous quarter.","This decrease reflects the fact that we generated a smaller portion of our pretax income in North America during Q1. As we [indiscernible] throughout the year, the EPR will continue to be very sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. We generated almost $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations and net debt increased $100 million during the quarter, to $5.5 billion. This is all despite the consumption of working capital that we typically experience during Q1 which is driven by the annual associated with employee compensation, as well as the payment of $245 million in severance during the quarter.","Even with the challenges of the current market, we still anticipate generating very strong free cash flow. This is because, during the downturn, we continue to reduce our investment in CapEx and working capital requirements will also come down. This combination should more than offset the decrease in earnings.","During the quarter, we spent $719 million to repurchase 8.7 million shares, at an average price of $82.98. We spent $606 million on CapEx, full year 2015 CapEx, excluding multi-client and SBM investment, is now expected to be approximately $2.5 billion.","And now, I will turn the conference call over to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Simon and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter revenue declined 19%, driven by the activity collapse on land in North America and the associated pricing pressure. International activity was lower, as customers cut budgets in response to lower commodity prices and was also impacted by the normal seasonal effects in the northern hemisphere and the fall of certain local currencies against the U.S. dollar.","In spite of these top line headwinds, we have been able to minimize the impact on our pretax operating margins, to prompt and proactive cost management and by further accelerating our transformation program. This is reflected in our first quarter international margins which are essentially flat sequentially and are up year-over-year. We have also delivered better decrementals than in any previous downturn, with sequential decremental margins as low as 33%, with North America and the international areas achieving 39% and 25%, respectively.","The pace and magnitude of the activity reductions, particularly in North America, has been almost unprecedented and we have to go back to the mid-1980s to find anything similar. And while we thought we had adequate plans in place going into the quarter, activity declined even faster than expected which required us to revise our plans accordingly. This made managing the quarter challenging, including the decision to further reduce our workforce by 11,000 employees, bringing the total personnel reduction to 20,000 or around 15%, compared to the peak of the third quarter of 2014.","Looking at our corporate financial performance, we generated more than $1.2 billion of free cash flow, before restructuring payments, during the first quarter. And we remain confident in our ability to generate free cash, even in these market conditions. And we expect to maintain the cash quality of our earnings by continuing to convert 75% or more of our net income into free cash flow.","By geography, our North American revenue decreased 25% sequentially which was significantly lower than the 32% drop in land rig count. Operating margins in North America decreased 670 basis points sequentially, to 12.9%.","In spite of these severe activity and pricing declines, sequential decrementals were limited to 39%, as we maintain -- as we remain fully focused on flawless execution and proactive cost management. In U.S. land, drilling and stimulation activity was down in all basins, while activity also dropped significantly in Canada, while the reduction in rig count was further impacted by the early Spring breakup. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, deepwater activity was resilient in the first quarter, although we're seeing a steady change in service mix from exploration towards development work, driven by budget cuts from most of our customers.","On land in North America, pricing pressure was greatest for hydraulic fracturing services, although some of this impact was mitigated to increase new technology uptake, particularly for our BroadBand stimulation services and Infinity completions products. In spite of this, market pricing for certain products and services has already reached unsustainable levels; however, we're being selective in the pursuit of market share and very disciplined in the avoidance of loss making contracts.","We continue to work with our customers to have lower drilling and completion costs, by focusing on the savings that new virtuals and technologies can bring. We're doing this through our technology integration groups, that house the full arrangement of shale expertise, spanning formation evaluation, drilling, stimulation and completions. The experts making up these integration groups are located in the larger shale basins in North America land and have both the scientific understanding of how to optimize shale developments and also an in-depth knowledge of our complete technology offering which they combine to design the best solution for each reservoir and each well.","The track record we have established over the past five years has now given us the confidence to propose a range of new business models to our customers, where we initially absorb the incremental cost linked to our work flows and technologies, in return for an upside based on the actual production results. One example of our unique shale technologies is HiWAY which helps customers increase production and ultimate recovery while using less water and proppant.","In the period between 2012 and 2014, wells completed with HiWAY technology in the Eagle Ford showed a 26% increase in the best three months of production, compared to wells stimulated with conventional treatments. HiWAY technology also helped save around 1.4 billion gallons of fracturing fluid and about 2.8 billion pounds of proppant, in more than 1,000 wells. The success of the HiWAY technology is now being complimented and extended by the rapid uptake of BroadBand Sequence which has already shown remarkable performance for a range of customers in both new well completions and in refracturing of old wells.","In the international markets, revenue declined 16% sequentially, driven by seasonal weather impact, currency effects and customer spending cuts. But despite the severity of the sequential revenue decline and the unfavorable shift in revenue mix, we managed to minimize the impact on our pretax operating margins which was essentially flat with the previous quarter, at 24.1%.","This performance was achieved by strong execution, proactive cost and resource management and the acceleration of our transformation program. Which together, were able to offset the margin impact from both reduced activity and the pricing pressure we were seeing from all customer groups.","In terms of managing the pricing pressure, we remain fully focused on navigating the commercial landscape by carefully balancing the pursuit of market share with the protection of operating margins and by always aiming to trade any pricing concessions for additional work scope or better contract terms.","Within the international areas, Middle East and Asia revenue declined by 13% sequentially, while pretax operating margin improved by 30 basis points, to 28.6%. Performance was impacted by a double-digit sequential drop in revenue in the Asia Pacific region and by lower product and software sales, but was partially offset by robust activity in the DTC region.","Year-on-year revenue decreased 5% and margins grew by 230 basis points. In the Middle East region, our lump-sum turnkey projects in Saudi Arabia gained momentum during the first quarter and we expect solid drilling activity going forward, together with more fracturing and rigless work.","In the United Arab Emirates, development activity on the North Island of the [indiscernible] project has now started, with more rig additions planned over the next few quarters. On this project, Schlumberger has been awarded the five-year contract for the supply of integrated well construction services, with further details provided in our earnings press release. Activity in the rest of the DCC countries was also strong in the first quarter. While in Iraq, revenues in the North remain muted, at around half of the peak levels seen in 2014 and activity in the South of the country was steady around the levels seen in the fourth quarter.","In Southeast Asia, activity in China was seasonally lower in the first quarter, but activity also declined in the rest of the regions, as customer budget cuts continued to be implemented. In Latin America, revenue declined 20% sequentially, while pretax operating margin improved 59 basis points, to 21.5%.","Revenue was impacted by decreased activity in Mexico, Brazil and Columbia, as customer budgets were cut and also by the fall in the value of the Venezuelan Bolivar. Still, these effects were partially offset by slight activity increases in Venezuela, Argentina and Ecuador. Year-on-year revenue decreased 6% and margins grew by 39 basis points. In Venezuela, activity continued to improve with [indiscernible] and with several of the joint ventures in the Faja, while activity is also ramping up in Trinidad.","In Mexico, revenue decreased significantly on a combination of customer budget cuts, as well as seasonal weather effects that mainly impacted offshore activity. The reduced spend mainly affected non-development activity, although some exploration work was also delayed. Elsewhere in Latin America, offshore activity in Brazil remains weak, with a deepwater slowdown continuing, as Petrobras announced budget cuts early in the quarter. In Argentina, activity remains resilient in the first quarter, driven by simulation work and continued new technology uptake in the Vaca Muerta and with new project startups offsetting the completion of others.","In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenues fell 17% sequentially, with margins declining by 133 basis points, to 21%. Year-on-year revenue decreased 12% and margins grew by 66 basis points. The revenue decline was mainly due to continued weakness in the ruble and lower seasonal activity in Russia. In the UK North Sea, exploration activity fell to its lowest level in recent history, as customer spending decelerated, while rig count in the Norwegian sector appears to have reached a bottom. In Sub-Sahara Africa, both development and exploration activity was down sequentially across the region. In Algeria, our activity was flat sequentially, while work in Libya was limited to offshore locations, with onshore operations largely shut down for the quarter.","Looking at the industry as a whole, the current financial challenges will not disappear, even if oil prices were to recover to the levels seen in recent years. The industry is therefore forced to seek new ways of working together to reduce costs and create more project value. And we have seen a much closer collaboration between operators and large service companies, as a significant opportunity to create technical solutions that will achieve these objectives.","At Schlumberger, we're ready to enter into these types of collaborations. And based on our technical and financial strength, we're also prepared to promote more risk-based contract models, where we're compensated based on the solutions we have designed, as well as on the performance of our execution. And these contract structures are currently being tabled with a number of customers as part of the ongoing commercial discussions.","Turning to the 2015 outlook, visibility still remains limited. However, we expect the largest open in E&P investments to occur in North America, where 2015 spend is expected to be down by more than 30%. We further believe that a recovery in U.S. land drilling activity will be pushed out in time, as the inventory of uncompleted wells builds and as the refracturing market expands. We also anticipate that our recovery in North America land activity will fall well short of reaching previous levels, hence extending the period of weak pricing.","In the international market, we expect 2015 E&P spend to fall around 15% which will create challenges in terms of both activity and pricing levels, but considerably less than the headwinds seen in North America. The reduction in international spend will be seen primarily through lower activity levels, but also with some pricing impact for basic technologies and with a continuation of the already observed shift from exploration-related services towards more development activity.","In terms of geography, we expect the G to C states of the Middle East to increase investments in 2015, as the core part of OPEC prepares to recoup market share, as the rest of the global supply base continues to weaken. Elsewhere, we expect to see a double-digit reduction in E&P investment levels in Latin America, led by Mexico and Brazil. In Europe and Africa, led by the North Sea and Sub-Sahara Africa. And in Asia, led by China, Malaysia and Australia.","In Russia, conventional land activity in western Siberia continues to be resilient, but the overall revenue contribution from Russia will remain subdued until there is a meaningful recovery in the ruble exchange rate. While the global fall in activity level is severe, we remain focused on the things we can control which are our cost and resource base, the effective deployment of our technology and expertise and the quality and integrity of the products and services we provide.","We remain confident in our ability to weather the storm better than our surroundings, based on our favorable international leverage, our fair technology leadership in North America shale and the acceleration of our transformation program. These elements will together create the platform that should allow us to increase revenue market share from slower earnings per share reductions that our peers in the coming quarters and continue to reduce working capital and CapEx intensity, while delivering on matched levels of free cash flow.","Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. First question is from Ole Slorer. Please go ahead.","Ole Slorer","Yes, thanks a lot and congrats with some pretty magnificent effects on the efficiency initiatives that you're implementing. But my opening question would be, Paal, if you could just update us on your macro thoughts, the same way as you did on the previous two quarters? And your comments that the markets might be tightening in the second half of the year, particularly with respect to how you see non-OPEC, non-U.S., that 50 million barrel a day bracket, be affected by the lack of investment that we've seen over the past couple of years?","Paal Kibsgaard","So our view on the macro hasn't really changed, compared to what we said both on the October and January call. First of all, the 2015 oil demand remains strong. And I was actually right [indiscernible] in the latest IA report. It would now be about 1.1 million barrels per day. While on the supply side, we continue to see the market share battle playing out globally.","Now the key question, as we discussed before, is when and where the large cuts in E&P investment is going to show up in the supply numbers. And the latest production data from March is now showing the first signs of a tightening in supply. And we're basically looking at three main indicators.","The first one is the core OPEC spare capacity which was down by 400,000 barrels in March, to 2.5 million barrels. The other one is the one you alluded to which is the non-NAM and OPEC production which showed a slight weakening in the first quarter versus the first quarter of last year. And given the reduction in E&P spend internationally; we expect this weakening to continue throughout this year.","And the third one which everyone is looking at, is the U.S. monthly sequential production which is now showing the first signs of flattening. So based on this, as we said in January, we expect the global supply to continue to tighten in the second half of this year, so really no major change to our view on the macro.","Ole Slorer","And the follow-up question will just be on where you think you stand on your goals that you outlined at the analyst day last summer? I think you mentioned that you expected to be in the sixth to seventh inning or something like that, by 2017. But it looks as if things are going at lot faster. So just in terms of this understanding the momentum and how much more there is to -- juice there is to squeeze out of this lemon, could you give us your latest view on that?","Paal Kibsgaard","So if you look at how we're driving business performance today which a lot of the focus is around managing decrementals, there is really three components that are part of driving this performance. First is the transformation of the mindset of our entire organization, where we have, in the past couple years, taken teamwork and the tightness of the chain of command to a completely new level. So this allows us now to plan and execute and also to adjust with great pace and agility, all right And this is the process that had been going on for a number of years. And I think it really demonstrated the -- our capabilities, coming from this transformation and in the first quarter.","Now the second is just diligent focus on basic cost and resource management. And this includes both our internal cost structures, as well as the third party spend. And although we did well in the first quarter in this area, as well, these efforts are going to continue into the second quarter.","And then the third one is really the one that you're referring to which is the structural transformation of how we run the entire company. And here, we said we would be in the sixth to seventh inning in 2017. I would say that today, we're probably in the third inning, if you want to stick to baseball terminology.","It's a multi-year program. It's going to bring a steady contribution to our performance and we're today active in looking to accelerate the pace of this implementation and there is a great pool from the entire organization now to accelerate this and I'm very pleased with the overall progress, in terms of how we're doing.","Operator","Thank you. Next question from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","Bill Herbert","I wanted to actually reference your presentation of a few weeks ago which I thought was one of the better efforts, not only from Schlumberger but just from any industry participant in some time, so first of all with regard to a question regarding business model. You've referenced this in your earnings release, you've also referenced it several times, being prepared to move to more risk-based business models. And specifically, the significant opportunity associated with the re-fracking of older wells.","So what kind of uptake are you seeing, with regard to the re-fracking opportunity? And when you describe this as a significant opportunity, can you quantify what that means, in terms of how large it is?","Paal Kibsgaard","If you look at the work we've done so far and we posted some of the recent results in the earnings press release this quarter, a lot of the re-frack focus so far has been around being able to identify the candidates. And that's based on our understanding of the existing completions and the potential that these still hold.","And then the other part is around, how do you effectively do the refracturing while minimizing the costs. So we have, to our engineer completion and our shale formation evaluation capabilities, as well as BroadBand Sequence, now established that growth technology offering. So in terms of how many wells, I would say there are thousands of wells in North America land that are candidates for refracturing and this is both shale liquids and shale gas.","In terms of the market potential, I think you're talking billions, in terms of revenue opportunities, over an extended period of time. But this is quite a significant market opportunity. And I think the key here is that we're so confident in our ability to identify the right candidates and execute the refracturing work that we're prepared to take significant risks, in terms of how we go about doing this work. In many cases, if we can select the candidates, prepare to foot the entire bill for the refracturing work and then get paid back in production.","Bill Herbert","Okay and then second question is more of a macro question. Again referencing back to this presentation that you did a couple weeks ago -- the global drilling intensity slide, in which you juxtaposed the 2014 production numbers from the big three liquids producers, roughly the same, at about 11 million barrels per day. But significantly different levels of drilling activity to generate that output. 36,000 wells U.S., 8,700 for Russia and 399 for Saudi Arabia. And you also mentioned a host of markets that you didn't identify, but significantly lower than the U.S., with regard to drilling intensity.","So you stated that basically, required level of drilling intensity for many of the Markets, to keep production flat. But the question that I have is not only to keep production flat, but the production -- the flexibility and the wherewithal to increase production with increased drilling intensity. Can you speak to that, please?","Paal Kibsgaard","What they're saying with that slide is that over time, basins mature. And in order to firstly maintain production and subsequently increase production which I think, in many of the land basins, we will be looking to do that in the coming years, you will have to increase drilling intensity. That's the basic message.","So I think you're seeing that increase in drilling intensity happening in many basins around the world today. The drilling intensity is obviously generally far below what we're seeing today in North America land.","But that's basically because, in most of the other basins, we're still working within the conventional resource base. And as you move from the conventional towards more unconventional, you will also generally see an increase in drilling intensity from that. But I would say, even in the conventional basin, there is a growing drilling intensity which we're now looking to capitalize on, both through the subsurface integration of the [indiscernible] assembly, as well as now going forward with our focusing on establishing our read on the future.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse Securities. Please go ahead.","Jim Wicklund","Relative to Bill's question, I guess, I find the most fascinating thing about the call today is, you're willing to propose a range of different business models, take some incremental technology risk and you talk about a new way of working together. So we're not just talking re-frack market in the U.S. You're sounding like a whole new business model of how service companies and oil companies will operate in the future? I don't mean to sound too Star Treky.","But you're proposing something other than -- in the past, companies have been willing to take participation or risk at the bottom of a cycle. But you're talking about a structural change in the industry, it sounds like.","Paal Kibsgaard","I do, yes. And I think it's going to be very important, for the overall performance of the industry, that all the players that have something to contribute, not only to the implementation and execution part of the work we do. But also to how we design the solutions of what we're looking to build and develop, that they're all invited to the table. And I would say still remaining humble. I think we, from the Schlumberger side, we have a lot to contribute, when it comes to supporting the design decisions that many of our customers take for major drilling and completions developments.","Jim Wicklund","There is no question that you have more expertise than most any other oil company. But having worked for both oil companies and service companies, service company comes to me in the oil company and says, let me show you a better way to do stuff. The first reaction is, I got engineers that know how to do it. So this is pretty much a change in psychology, if you would or how the industry operates. You're talking about, this isn't a quick implementation, I would think, but over time?","Paal Kibsgaard","No, it's not a quick implementation and it's not something that we can do by ourselves. And currently, I think it's very clear. We're not saying that we can do the work our customers are doing better. But I think, given the capabilities that we have, I think we're underutilized today. And we have a lot more to contribute, even into the design elements of the work that is related to our expertise.","And I think by being invited to the table to contribute, complementing what they are doing, I think we can achieve improvements in design and engineer costs out of the system, before we go to implementation. And by factoring in our implementation or execution capabilities in the design, I think we can also simplify and streamline the execution part of the work, as well.","So this is something that we're going to offer, Jim. Some of our customers might take us up on it and some of the others might not and for the ones that are not, we will continue to work the way we're currently doing. But I think this is something that we believe can bring significant value and something that we're prepared to take on and also put some more skin in the game.","Operator","Thank you. David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open.","David Anderson","A related question what Jim was asking. I was wondering, more specifically, around offshore development and exploration. Obviously, with lower oil prices, it is a really challenging market right now. Some would even say the IOC business model is broken.","It looks to us like maybe in a couple years, this could be in a slowdown here. So I'm just wondering, this is a pretty big part of your business. Schlumberger's oil -- the services part, in the scheme of things, is in a huge park. Can you just help us under -- give us a bit of a road map for how you think some of the IOCs are going to navigate to the deepwater and exploration? And how you see this progressing, in order to get this fixed?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think if you look at deepwater first, this represents a huge resource base for the industry. Now given the level of development cost today, as well as given the level of recovery factors we're seeing today, the cost per barrel for these type of developments is challenged.","So there has to be a change in overall, in how these developments are done. We have to get the costs down and we also have to drive recovery up. And if you can do both, I think a large part of the reserve base and the discovery base that we have established over the past decade in deepwater, can and will be developed.","So I think this is the challenge that the industry has and we're prepared to contribute towards finding the right solutions. And I think when the industry really puts their mind to something, we will find a solution and it will be sorted out. As to the [Technical Difficulty] separation, I think the play book we're seeing now is the normal one. Exploration is the first thing that can be cut which is not going to have a short-term and immediate impact on production.","Looking at the current levels of exploration spend today, it is clearly unsustainable. I don't think it's going to get fixed or improved any time soon or at least not in 2015. But it is very clear that this level of exploration spend is not going to continue for many years.","David Anderson","Okay. And a separate topic on talking about the North America, you've talked about how the rig count won't go back to peak levels and I think we can all agree upon that. You talked a lot about the commentary around re-fracking opportunities. And clearly, you see that as a big opportunity, going forward. But what are some of the other structural trends that you think are influencing that view?","What are the other components that, as you think about North America and I'm not sure if you can give us an idea of where you think that rig count can be a normalized rig count, if you will. But can you talk about some of the other factors, structurally, that are impacting that view?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think if you look at what's taken place over the past three or four years in shale liquids in North America, there has been a significant growth in activity and there has been a growing free cash flow deficit for the E&P industry. So that's clearly not a sustainable way of the whole industry to operate here. Now, with that said, I think there's a core part of the North America shale liquids that is viable, even at the current oil prices and this will continue to be developed.","Now as we go forward, as the industry continues to improve. I would say, both on the cost side -- although a lot has already been done -- but even more so on the production per well. I think there can be a growing part of the -- I would say tier 2 and tier 3 acreage that can be developed.","But as of now, I think we're limited more to the tier 1 acreage at these type of oil prices. And that's why we're saying that, given the cash flow constraints, we don't expect that rig counts are going to come back to the previous levels of around 2000. It's going to come back to somewhere in between the current levels and where it was.","And for the service industry, that means that the pricing concessions that are currently being given, we unfortunately are going to have to live with for a while, because there's going to be a pretty significant order capacity for all sorts of services, given the lower activity level that we're going to recover to.","Operator","Next question is from Jim Crandell with Cowen Securities. Please go ahead.","Jim Crandell","My question has to do with the overall trend in international revenues and margins for here. If we look back at past cycles, often, the international business trends materially lag that of North America. I understand some things are different this time. But might we be looking at, generally, a deteriorating overall level of E&P spend? And maybe even Schlumberger revenue over the next 12 months?","Paal Kibsgaard","If you look at our view on total E&P spend globally, splitting it into North America and international, we're saying that the reduction in spending internationally is going to be significantly lower than what you see in North America. North America is going to be well above 30% and while we're saying around 15% for international.","So I think the key, beyond what the spend reduction is -- and we're already seeing that spend reduction. And by the way, international spend was more or less flat already in 2014. I think the key from our side is the underestimated, I would say, resilience in our international business performance. If you look at how we've been managing to keep margins and also to continue to protect our overall earnings capacity in the international business, we're doing a pretty good job.","And I think even with a 15% reduction in E&P spend, our revenues, year-over-year, was down 8% in the first quarter and our operating income was down 3%. So the key areas are our ability to continue to generate earnings, even in very challenging market conditions.","Jim Crandell","Do you think that the -- given your comments, have you seen your overall bottom in international revenues? Or do you think your overall international revenues will probably trend lower from the first quarter levels?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, at this stage, we see both North America and international revenue coming down further in Q2 [indiscernible]. But I would say more so in North America than in international.","Jim Crandell","And do you think that that will represent the bottom? Or do you think there could be further slippage in revenues, particularly internationally, in the second half of the year?","Paal Kibsgaard","I would say that the revenue reductions in Q2 are slowing in pace. I'm not ready to say that it's the bottom yet.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Michael LaMotte","If I could follow up quickly on this re-frack opportunity. I'm curious as to what the suite of services are? And how they differ from a conventional primary frack job? I imagine it's a lot more analysis involved. Can you just walk us through what the work flow looks like? And the level of intellectual capital that's employed in the process?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, sure. So the overall work flow starts with us basically getting the well files and the well data from the operator. Our team of experts is then reviewing hundreds of candidate wells and we're taking the ones that we believe have the highest potential for increasing production after re-fracking treatment. So they're looking at the completion. They are looking at whatever formation evaluation data we have and then coming up with our candidate selection.","Now in terms of the actual physical work execution at the well site, the first thing we need to do is to pull the pump out of the well and then prepare the well. But beyond that, it's just hooking up the fracturing treatment. And we basically pump a normal fracturing job, but with a BroadBand Sequence [indiscernible] space into the job. Generally then flooding off the existing perforations that have already been fracked, to be able to elevate the pressure in the well to fracture the additional perforations that initially weren't fracked when the well was first completed.","So the key enablers here are the ability of our subsurface experts to identify the right well candidates. And in addition to that, the BroadBand Sequence, the technology, where we can actually divert fracturing fluid into the perforations that haven't properly been fractured in the first place.","Michael LaMotte","And is there any limitation, in terms of the initial completion, the hardware, the construction of that well? Any physical limitation?","Paal Kibsgaard","No.","Michael LaMotte","If I could ask a follow-up for Simon, real quick. Just on the working capital numbers. The receivable turns looked pretty good, but working capital use in the first quarter was still pretty high. Is that inventory? Can you delve into that a little bit, Simon?","Simon Ayat","Normally, we have seasonality to the working capital and the first quarter is a quarter where we consume working capital. And this year around, actually the receivable was a positive. Inventory stayed flattish, but the biggest consumption was on the accounts payable and employee payable.","The first quarter, we basically meet all of the requirements of the incentives, the bonuses of the previous year. And as we highlighted, we also had the payment associated with the restructuring of $245 million. So the main impact on the working capital came from the other elements that I highlighted. So over $1 billion, by the way, Michael.","Michael LaMotte","Yes, that $245 million was in that, then, as well?","Simon Ayat","The $245 million was a restructuring cost, with Venezuela, obviously, it's not the cash element. The biggest issue is, as I mentioned, accounts payable and employee payable was more than $1 billion of deterioration.","Michael LaMotte","And then Simon, Paal mentioned 75% plus free cash flow conversion as a target. The Free Cash Flow deployment in the repurchase program was also impressively high. Is there a target there that we can apply, going forward?","Simon Ayat","So as we always said, Michael, the number or the amount that we will spend on the buyback is always a balancing number. Our priority is to invest in the business, whether it's CapEx or future revenue stream, SPM, multi-client. And then the dividend, obviously, we will continue to meet our commitment and revise it every year. And the balancing period will always be the buyback. And during the downturn, the conversion rate, you know, is always helping.","Michael LaMotte","Higher, yes.","Simon Ayat","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead","It's great to see when everything -- the whole plan comes into fruition and everything you outlined last year at your June energy investor day, so congrats on that performance.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Kurt Hallead","You're welcome. The follow-up question that I've been having and we had an opportunity to canvas a number of different investors last night and it still seems the primary question on everybody's mind, from this point forward, is how sustainable is this relative performance on decrementals? I think you addressed it broadly in your commentary, about the execution and transformation and so on.","And I think the million-dollar question out there is, are the decremental margins going to moderate into the second quarter and then second half of the year, from where they are in the first quarter? And in conjunction with that, how much of this decremental margin performance has really been, say \"one-off\"? Or how much of this decremental performance is truly structural in nature?","Paal Kibsgaard","If we focus in our discussion on decrementals around international business, right, where our decrementals sequentially, in Q1, was 25%, I think this performance is -- first of all, nothing one-off in that performance. And secondly, that performance is not just one quarter, either. I think the overall resilience in our well-balanced international business is largely underestimated. Actually, if you look at the performance going back to 2012, we posted 35% incrementals in 2012, 42% in 2013 and 69% in 2014.","So the fact that we have a very good handle of running the international business, in an environment where we've been facing growing headwinds throughout this period, both in exploration, in deepwater and seismic. And also with significant IOC spend costs, even starting in 2014, I think these incrementals clearly show that the decrementals we're posting in Q1 is just a continuation of a multi-year run of improving business performance.","Kurt Hallead","Now the follow-up I would have is, you talk about -- you outlined a view that the U.S. recovery will not match prior activity levels in a period of pricing pressure could be upon us for a period of time. Now in the context, the re-frack -- and I'm just trying to connect the dots. Because if there's a significant amount of re-frack that's going to happen, I would have personally thought that that would lead to a more rapid capacity absorption period and potentially a faster recovery period, in terms of pricing because everyone is going to get all this backlog of re-frack.","So can you just -- I might be a little bit slow. Can you help me connect the dots on how re-fracking won't lead to an acceleration in capacity absorption? And get your thoughts on that would be great.","Paal Kibsgaard","I think for the re-frack, this work scope, I think, is going to be limited to the companies that can do the two things that I stated earlier. Firstly, help the customers identify the right candidate. And secondly, have technologies that make the cost base of the refracturing feasible and economical. And based on the work we've done, in terms of identifying candidates during trials, re-fracks for a range of customers already, the economics, based on the BroadBand Sequence technology, is actually quite attractive in between re-fracking an old well or drilling a new well. So I think it would be limited to the companies that have that capability.","Now even if there were a range of companies that could do it, I still think that this market overall, in terms of absorbing capacity, isn't going to fix the problem. So if you look at the overall activity that we had last year, where we had about 2000 rigs operating, we're down now below 1000. If you take a pick anywhere in between the two numbers of where the recovery is going to come back, no matter what number you pick I think it's very clear that it's going to be significant over-capacity in the market.","And that means that pricing that is now already at very low levels is not going to improve in that situation. So re-frack is an opportunity for the companies that have the right technology to it. I don't think it's going to have a big enough impact to fix the overall capacity issue in North America land. But it will be, I think, a very good avenue of growth for the companies that can identify the right candidates and also have the technology to effectively re-frack, while keeping costs low enough to make it economical.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to Daniel Boyd with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Daniel Boyd","So Paal, you'll typically gain market share in a downturn and you're looking for E&P spend internationally down 15%. So should we take that and suggest that Schlumberger is going -- to revenues will decline something less than 15% this year?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think we have some good opportunities this year to gain market share. We talked about that in the January call. I think the -- this whole discussion around what we perceive to be the glass ceiling in the international market will potentially open up more market share opportunities for us. I think also, given the fact that we're able to run a very good and very effective business internationally, would also allow us opportunities to leverage that capability to further gain market share as well.","So we're not going to be obsessed about market share, other than, we're going to look for the opportunities. And we want to continue to navigate the commercial landscape by balancing both market share with continuous margin performance.","Daniel Boyd","So that's what I would expect, too. And then if you do the algebra, it implies sequential growth internationally in the back half of this year. But my question really comes down to international margins, because last cycle, we saw international margins bleed lower, even as revenues started increasing. What's your thought process? Or how do you think this cycle plays out?","Are we in a different position, whereas revenue increases, we could actually have slightly higher margins? Or is the pricing -- negative pricing impact going to bleed through again?","Paal Kibsgaard","We're already seeing challenges, both in activity and pricing and it's not the market. Obviously, with these significant spend reductions that's always going to be there. I think the difference we're seeing, at this stage, is that based on these incrementals that I referenced just in the previous question, our ability to continuously drive performance, to how we execute internationally and leveraging the scale we have of operations. And also have a steady contribution from the transformation that is what is allowing us to hold margins up the way they are.","We have significantly outperformed our competitors in margins over the previous two or three years and this has just got nothing to do with pricing. Every bid on lowest price for basic technologies in any country around the world, the only thing that differentiates us from the competition is that we're able to translate this revenue into higher margins, basically based on how we run the company.","So we're always winning any bid on the lowest price. And we have to be commercially competitive. But the key here is the internal [indiscernible] of the company and how we run and execute. And I think that ability has improved significantly over the past three or four years. And that's why we hope that we should be able to manage both decrementals and overall margins better, this time around, in the international market, than what we've done in previous cycles.","Daniel Boyd","So in other words as revenue increases you hope to, at a minimum maintain your margin level, at that point?","Paal Kibsgaard","We're continuing to try to do better than what we did in previous cycles, yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of James West with Evercore. Please go ahead.","James West","I was wanting to ask about BroadBand Sequence and I spent a lot of time with your technology guys last month in Houston. How much of that business now is a push model, being you going to your clients and talking to them about the attributes of that versus a pull model, where the clients are actually coming to you saying, we need this technology?","Paal Kibsgaard","I still think there is a mixture that any new technology in North America land, the uptake takes some time. But what we did differently this time around, with broadband in general versus what we did with HiWAY, is that in the third quarter last year, myself and a few of my chiefs, we went around to a range of North American E&P companies and presented the concept of this technology, and also offered them trial runs to try this out.","And that's why the general uptake of BroadBand Sequence has been significantly faster than what HiWAY was which was always, actually, quite good, as well, in 2011. But the rate of uptake of BroadBand Sequence has been significantly higher than what HiWAY was.","James West","Okay, got it. And then just an unrelated follow-up, we think about the international markets and I know you touched a lot on the U.S. market and production there. But internationally, that's a pretty heavy decline rates, as well, a lack of investment international markets. What do you see as the potential for a significant drop in supply from the international side? And on that topic, is it possible not to be bullish on at least brent prices, going forward?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think you're right. We believe that there is a weakness in the non-NAM, non-OPEC supply base. It was basically flat Q1, year-over-year. But given the reductions we're seeing in spend and the weakness in several of the key basins, we expect that weakness to continue and potentially increase, as the year progresses and I think that's why we believe that there will be some recovery in Brent. The question is, to what extent OPEC wants or is willing, to put more barrels on the market to stabilize prices at some level below $100.","Operator","Thank you. We'll turn it back to our speakers.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you. So before we close, I would like to thank all of you for participating in today's call. As your questions have indicated, you're all concerned that this market is quite challenging at the moment. I think it's useful to summarize the three most important points that we have discussed this morning.","First, the past quarter has been challenging to manage. But by being able to quickly adjust plans and by continuing to focus on what we control, we have delivered significantly better decremental margins, compared to previous cycles. And our international leverage and the acceleration of our transformation program, are together creating a strong platform for financial out-performance, also, going forward.","Second, we believe that the industry needs to think differently, in order to reduce project costs and increase project value. And we see closer collaboration between operators and the large service companies as a key element in achieving this goal. And this closer collaboration should also include more performance-based contracting models which we're fully prepared to enter into.","And last, while we continue to actively manage cost and resources throughout this downturn, by streamlining overhead structures and reducing field capacity, we can quickly add back capacity when opportunities arise to take on more work. Through the efficiency gains created by our transformation program and through our unmatched recruiting and training machine which is fully intact.","That concludes the call for today. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"19309":["Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) Q4 2011 Earnings Call January 20, 2012  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Paal Kibsgaard - Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Director","Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","Malcolm Theobald - Vice President of Investor Relations","Analysts","Michael K.

Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead.","Malcolm Theobald","Thank you, Greg. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Results Conference Call. Joining us on the call are Andrew Gould, Chairman; Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared statements will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results, and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.","However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements. [Operator Instructions] And now, I'll turn the call over to Simon.","Simon Ayat","Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.11 per share. This is an increase of $0.13 sequentially and $0.26 compared to the same quarter last year. We recorded $0.06 of charges relating to asset write-offs in Libya and the continuing integration of Smith. During the quarter, we were able to physically assess the status of our assets in Libya. This assessment resulted in us recording a pretax and after-tax charge of $60 million relating to certain assets that are no longer recoverable as a result of the political unrest. ","Pursuant to our integration plan, the Smith integration team, which has done an excellent job, will remain in place throughout 2012. As a result, we will continue to incur merger and integration charges during 2012 that we will continue to highlight separately. ","Oilfield Services fourth quarter revenue of $10.3 billion increased 8% sequentially. Of this $755 million sequential increase, approximately 20% of this growth came from the traditional year-end surge in product and software sales, and 19% came from the significant sequential increase in WesternGeco multiclient sales. Oilfield Services pretax income of $2.2 billion increased 12.3% sequentially, while pretax operating margins improved 82 basis points. Notably, revenue pretax income and margins all improved on a sequential basis across each of the 3 product groups and the 4 geographical areas. ","Sequential revenue and pretax margin highlights by group -- by product group were as follows. Fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.8 billion increased 12% sequentially, and margins improved 340 basis points to 27.9%. These increases were due to very strong WesternGeco multiclient sales, robust end-of-year SIS software sales and the strong exploration activity at Wireline. ","Drilling Group fourth quarter revenue of $3.9 billion increased 6.3% sequentially, while margins remained essentially flat at 16.8%. Revenue growth was led by M-I SWACO with strong performances in North America and Latin America. IPM had a very strong quarter, particularly in Mexico and Iraq, while D&M posted strong results in U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Europe\/CIS\/Africa area. ","Fourth quarter Reservoir production revenue of $3.6 billion increased 6.7% sequentially, while pretax margin improved 36 basis points to 21.3%. These increases were primarily attributable to the strong Completion and Artificial Lift product sales across all areas. Well Services revenue continued to grow as a result of capacity additions. The Distribution segment contributed $685 million of revenue and $26 million of pretax operating income. ","Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 23.8% as compared to 23.7% in the third quarter. We expect the ETR for the full year 2012 to be in the mid-20s. However, this can vary on a quarterly basis due to the geographical mix of earnings. ","Net debt at the end of the quarter was $4.85 billion as compared to $5.16 billion at the end of Q3, representing $314 million improvement. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.25 billion of CapEx, $636 million of stock repurchases and $242 million of pension and retiree medical contributions.","CapEx is expected to approach $4.5 billion in 2012 as compared to the $4 billion we spent in 2011. Yesterday, our board of directors approved a 10% increase in our annual dividend to $1.10 per share. This follows last year's 19% increase and reflects our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.","During the full year 2011, we repurchased 36.9 million shares at an average price of $81.15 for a total of $3 billion. ","And now, I turn the conference over to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Simon. Our overall fourth quarter results showed solid sequential growth, driven by stronger activity for most of our service product lines and by stronger product sales for Completions, Artificial Lift, SIS and WesternGeco multiclient seismic. ","In North America, we had a strong quarter with 6% sequential revenue growth and margins up 163 basis points. This was led by continued growth in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where market share momentum remained strong for our high-value technology offering and where operational performance was extremely solid. During the quarter, we moved a second wide-azimuth seismic fleet into the Gulf of Mexico, and we saw strong multiclient sales. In North America land, revenue grew in line with rig count, while margins increased moderately, driven in part by internal efficiencies and active cost management.","Pricing in our Wireline and Drilling product lines continued to show an upward trend, although slowing somewhat compared to previous quarters. In pressure pumping, downwards pricing pressure in the gas basins continued in the fourth quarter, while pricing in the liquids and liquids-rich basins remained more or less flat, excluding the impact of continued conversion to 24-hour operations.","In the international markets, revenue grew almost 9% sequentially, while margins were up by 91 basis points. Growth was driven by deepwater and exploration activity in East and West Africa and by strong land activity in the Middle East and North Africa. During the quarter, we secured a number of key contracts that further strengthens our international position. This includes a shale gas contract covering stimulation and project management for a pilot well campaign in the Middle East. We have already deployed a team of shale explorers to the country, and we have started to mobilize assets and prepare the project infrastructure. ","In terms of pricing, bidding remained competitive on large tenders for standard technology while we saw positive pricing signs in selected smaller tenders in Wireline and Drilling & Measurements. Our pricing upside continues to be driven mainly by technology and operational performance. ","In Marine seismic, we saw the predicted seasonal drop in vessel utilization during the quarter. However, utilization for the coming quarters is already looking strong, driven by higher activity in West Africa, the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. WesternGeco backlog grew to $1 billion in the quarter. ","In Middle East and Asia, revenue grew by 7% sequentially, while margins were up 124 basis points, driven mainly by the land business in the Middle East. In Saudi Arabia, the ramp-up of rigs progressed in line with plans during the quarter, and we saw strong growth in both rig-related and rigless activity. In Iraq, sequential growth was again solid, led by further startup of rigs and strong activity on both ongoing IPM projects and on individual product line contracts. Oman also showed very good sequential growth, driven by Artificial Lift and Wireline.","In Latin America, revenue grew by 11% sequentially, while margins were up by 15 basis points. Sequential growth was led by Mexico, where offshore activity increased and where land activity on IPM projects was strong. During the quarter, we signed our first production incentive contract with Pemex, covering the Carrizo Field, with operations expected to start at the end of the second quarter. In Argentina, we have established a very strong position in the emerging shale plays. So far, we have conducted a large part of the shale fracturing jobs in the country. And during the quarter, we secured a number of new service contracts in this market. In Brazil, another 4 deepwater rigs were added during the quarter, with a total now standing at 64. There continues to be active bidding for Petrobras. And during the quarter, we were awarded the largest share of the new mud logging contract. On land, activity remained strong, driven by IPM projects for OGX and Petro.","In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue grew 8% sequentially, and margins were up 125 basis points. During the quarter, we saw strong growth in activity in Angola, Nigeria and East Africa, driven by both deepwater exploration and the major development projects. Based on the positive results on the first pre-salt exploration wells in Angola, we expect strong growth in West Africa going forward.","In Russia, we saw solid offshore activity in Sakhalin, although this was partly offset by the start of the winter slowdown in Russia land. The integration of services from the Eurasia transaction is progressing well, and our preferred vendor agreement with Eurasia Drilling offers a strong growth platform in the active Western Siberia market.","In Libya, activity restarted early in the quarter with the initial focus on Wireline, coiled tubing and Artificial Lift services. Our infrastructure, field assets and workforce are fully operational, and we expect to see steady activity growth over the coming year.","Let me now turn to some of the technology highlights of the quarter. In the Reservoir Characterization Group, we completed the purchase of ThruBit during the quarter. ThruBit's technology offers a novel way of obtaining wireline logs in horizontal shale wells and is based on the deploying a slim tool through the drill pipe during the final wiper trip before starting the well completion. Today, more than 90% of the horizontal shale wells in North America are not logged due to the total cost of operations and the lack of a wellsite answer product that can guide operators in selecting the optimal completion intervals. Building on the ThruBit technology, we believe we can offer a cost-effective solution as an integral part of our shale reservoir characterization workflow to help open up this market.","In the Drilling Group, the integration work continued to progress very well. Synergies with Smith in 2011 surpassed even our revised targets, and the transaction was again accretive on an earnings-per-share basis in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Within our operations, we continue our efforts to drive drilling performance to the next level. One area of focus is the streamlining of our drilling engineering workflows, supported by the creation of integrated drilling engineering centers in our field locations. In these centers, we co-locate the members from our technical drilling community, allowing them to jointly drive the planning, design and support of our drilling operations using real-time wellsite links. So far, we have established 10 of these centers worldwide, and we have plans to double this number in the coming year.","In the Reservoir Production Group, HiWAY activity continued to expand with operations conducted for more than 35 clients during the quarter. The number of HiWAY fracturing stages grew by more than 50% sequentially. The expansion was particularly strong in North America, but international deployment also continued with operations, so far, conducted in 9 countries. ","In well intervention, we continue to build our new technology offering both on land and offshore. ACTive coiled tubing technology, which provides real-time down-hole data during stimulation and intervention operations, gained further tractions, particularly in the Middle East. In addition, we have started deploying the new LIVE slickline platform, which offers real-time telemetry for mechanical and basic production services. The largest uptake of LIVE has so far been in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where the combined capability of mechanical and production services in one compact and light unit is being leveraged for plug-back and recompletion operations.","Let's now turn to the outlook, where GDP growth for 2012 continued to be revised downwards during the fourth quarter and where positive signs from the U.S. and Japan were offset by continued concerns over the euro zone. In spite of the political efforts to resolve the issues, we expect the uncertainties surrounding the global financial markets to continue in the coming quarters. And although the chance of a global double-dip recession remains a possibility, we do not believe this to be the most likely scenario. In line with lower GDP growth, oil demand outlook was also revised downwards during the fourth quarter. However, the increasing rate of the emerging markets, the weakness in non-OPEC supply and a number of geopolitical concerns have supported oil prices. And absent a global recession, we do not expect prices to weaken significantly. ","For natural gas, the continued increase in unconventional gas production, modest demand growth and mild weather at the beginning of the heating season contributed to very high storage levels and low natural gas prices in North America. In Asia, on the other hand, the need for alternative energy sources following the Fukushima incident, along with fast-growing demand in the non-OECD countries, is maintaining high prices and significantly increasing LNG demand.","Looking at our industry, the general feedback from our customers and the findings from the recent spending surveys indicate that E&P investment in 2012 will be up, although the predicted levels vary. The surveys also suggest that exploration spending will continue to increase. Against this backdrop, we are planning for growth in 2012, although we are building significant flexibility into our plans given the uncertainties.","In North America, we expect land rig count to remain flat with Q4 2011, provided the ongoing drop in gas activity will be counted by increasing activity in the liquids and liquids-rich basins. We anticipate a continued recovery in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico with strong demand for high-value technologies. ","In the international markets, we expect 2012 rig count to be up around 10% versus 2011, driven by strong offshore activity in West Africa, the North Sea and Brazil, and by land activity in the Middle East, North Africa and Western Siberia.","Overall, we remain confident that any potential reductions in activity will be short-lived due to limited spare oil capacity and to growing international demand for natural gas. Furthermore, the breadth of our technology offering, the strength of our international footprint and contract portfolio and the balance we have established between our Reservoir Characterization, Drilling and Production Services in the North America market would allow us to continue to grow. Growth in worldwide deepwater and exploration activity will also favor Schlumberger. ","Thank you very much. I will now hand the call over to Malcolm for the Q&A session.","Malcolm Theobald","Thank you, Paal. We will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Greg?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brad Handler from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I appreciate your outlook comments, as always, Paal, but given this dramatic falloff in natural gas prices in the U.S. and subsequent concerns about E&P cash flows, if I could ask you to start in focusing on North American land. You've been clear about your strategy of re-establishing yourselves here, and you've just given your outlook for a flat rig count, but does this very quickly deteriorating outlook for gas -- is it influencing recent contracting behavior in U.S. land? And then, I'll just give you my follow-up now, which is that is it influencing your behavior, whether it's from a contracting link standpoint or a CapEx standpoint? Are there any changes that you're making now?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, if you look at pressure pumping pricing levels, as I said, we continue to see downwards pressure on pricing in gas in Q4. The liquid basins, we saw pricing basically being flat, some contracts being up, and some contacts being down. Now how this is going to evolve, I think, is still uncertain at this stage, right? There is obviously a chance that the continued flux of capacity from the gas basins into the liquid basins is going to have an impact on liquids pricing as well. We haven't really seen any downwards trend yet. But clearly, over the past quarter, the pricing has been flat, so that's basically where we stand on that. In terms of our view on North America land, like we said before, we remain committed to the markets. We have a build plan for 2012, which is obviously flexible. But we will remain committed to the market in terms of adding capacity, provided that we can get the utilization that we are looking for, right? And so -- in addition to how we see the North America land market for pressure pumping, we have also significant demand for horsepower international. We won a lot of contracts in the international markets requiring fracturing capacity. So in the event that we have the opportunity or basically decide to ship capacity internationally, I think that will be welcomed by our international operations.","Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So that's still an \"if\" condition. You're -- so far, there will be plans for the U.S.","Paal Kibsgaard","It is still an \"if\" condition. We have basically decided on a build plan for total pressure pumping with a certain allocation to North America, and we haven't changed that at this stage.","Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just to clarify, from a contracting behavior, with your customers, are they -- are contracts getting longer? Are they -- are you seeking to make them longer or contract -- are your operator customers seeking to make them shorter now? How is that timing dynamic work?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I would say that over the past quarter, we have -- over the past couple of quarters, we have shifted more towards term contracts. We now stand at around 80% term contracts for one year plus. And really, the only plays we play in the spot market at this stage is in the liquids plays, right, so I think there's been a shift in the market towards term contracts, and I think we are quite well positioned in that sense.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John David Anderson from JPMorgan.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So you\u2019d mentioned that North -- your outlook for North American rig count is flat this year. And you also said in your release that, basically, revenue is in line with the rig count, so -- which seemed to me that the upside here for you guys is really going to be in the Gulf of Mexico. And I was just wondering, if we strip out kind of the strength of kind of the seismic side, I'm curious as to where you are in your deepwater operations in the Gulf. Are you back to the kind of the pre-Macondo levels? Are costs now fully absorbed in that market? And I guess I'm just kind of wondering, are your margins now in the Gulf higher than in your U.S. land business?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. The simple answer to that is yes. This quarter, I think, was the first quarter where our Gulf of Mexico margins were accretive to North America. So obviously, there's been a lot of focus in on the multiclient sales for Q4, which was quite strong. But I think it's also important to point out the strength we have on the deepwater side for well operations, right, both Wireline and on the Drilling segments. So we're quite optimistic in terms of the outlook for the Gulf of Mexico, firstly, in terms of our market share position and in addition to how well we can leverage our high-end technology and operational performance in this type of market, right, so we see steady growth in deepwater drilling rig count during 2012, roughly about 1 rig a month. So we would be at pre-Macondo levels for drilling rigs in the deepwater by the latter part of 2012.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's great. And as a follow-up, I was wondering, can you just give us a sense as to kind of what's different now than before? I'm curious. We're seeing this on the rig equipment side that operators are clearly taking a much more conservative approach there. How has your business changed? Are you spending more time on the rigs that you're seeing now? Is it increasing testing? Is it more conservative operations? I was just wondering if you could just kind of give us a little insight in the how your operators are going about their business differently now.","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think all the operators are obviously even more thorough than that they were in the past, right, but we haven't seen a dramatic change in how operations are conducted. I think there was always a lot of focus on this. But yes, there's probably somewhat more testing and maybe double and triple checking of things. But generally, our position in the Gulf of Mexico at this stage, given the focus that we had now for, what, 4 years in our excellence in execution program, is even stronger than what it was pre-Macondo. So we are very well positioned, and that's why we are obviously quite optimistic in terms of the outlook for the market and also how this is going to weigh in on our North America performance.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. But according to kind of what your comments are, this is probably where you'd see all your growth in North America, or that most of your growth would come from the deepwater side?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, we don't know yet that. I mean, that's going be a large function of 2 things: what's going to happen to the rig count in terms of the reductions in gas versus potential increases in liquids; and even more so, what's going to happen to pressure pumping pricing.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil.","William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Paal, I wanted to ask you a little bit with regard to the comment in the press release as it relates to competitive bidding on the large tenders for standard technology. I was just curious as to what do you need to see happen here? What are you expecting to happen over the course of 2012 to change that dynamic, number one? And I guess secondly, we\u2019ve talked in the past certainly on Schlumberger's calls about the leverage to the exploration cycle. And clearly, people are encouraged where they continue to see deepwater adds here in the market globally. I was wondering if you could spend a little bit of time talking about the pricing outlook on the deepwater market globally here as well.","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay. So like you say, I mean, we still see competitive pricing for basic technology on large contracts, while we see some positive signs on the smaller contracts. On the large contracts, our unique high-end technology is, obviously, priced higher, and we always have significant seller potential as the contracts unfold over the years. If you look at the international service pricing, typically, there is a lag between the moves and the rig rates, which we have been seeing over the last couple of quarters and our service pricing, right, so there is a potential upside on that. But I think one reason why pricing hasn't moved so much in the international market is the market share plays that have been going on. And I think these are potentially coming to an end. Partly, that's going to come down to the activity increase that we potentially will see. But I think also another key factor to this is that there is a growing customer emphasis on operational performance. I think they are fully realizing that very low service pricing typically gives very low service quality. And I think one example of this is the rate that we continue to replace competition within our Drilling & Measurements segments. In Q4 alone, the ratio of we replacing competition, and they -- and them replacing also us was 31:5, and this is basically coming down to quality and technology.","William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Sure. Is it still prudent to think of a pricing inflection internationally as being more of a positive for your kind of 2013 margin outlook? Or is this something that we potentially start to see having an impact in the second half of this year?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think it's still too early to say. Like I said, we continue to test pricing on smaller bids. For the big bids, and there's not really that many big bids coming up in the coming year, we'd obviously be a little bit more conservative to make sure that we protect and potentially gain market share. But I think it's too early to call it. The only thing I would say is that there was a growing focus on operational performance, and that plays very well into our strength in terms of our quality and our technology.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And Paal, I just wonder whether you could help us a little bit of how to think about the first quarter. It's always sequentially a difficult one to get our heads around. This product sales in the fourth quarter, there is multiclient that doesn't necessarily repeat. You have seasonality in North Sea, Russia. Could you give us a little bit on how you would think about the first quarter and how it's shaping up? It just strikes me that expectations might be just a little bit on the high side of a natural range.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. I would agree with you, Ole, that the current consensus is probably somewhat on the optimistic side or on the high side. Just to comment on how we see the quarter from this point, I think the underlying activity continues to be strong, and it's driven by steady growth in the international markets and also strong activity in North America shale liquids. Like you say, we are going to see the normal seasonal slowdown in the North Sea and Russia, and I think also the sequential drop in product sales and multiclient sales. I think, also, there is some added uncertainty going into Q1 now in terms of the impact of the accelerating drop in North America shale gas activity, right, so generally, I would say that the current consensus is somewhat on the optimistic\u2026","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And from then on, it clearly becomes more of a standard pattern. But second thing, back to this international pricing again, I mean, rig rates, after deepwater rigs are becoming, again, very, very scarce, you highlighted what's going on in Angola pre-salt and the potential demand there. Rig rates may be pushing back to $600,000 again. I mean, historically, those have been levels where oil companies really start paying attention to technology that can improve reliability or technology that can shorten cycle time. And yes, you don't really talk about pricing, so could you help us a little bit with how you view the tightness in the rig market and the higher rates impacting either whether it's service quality for pricing or whether it's the standard technology or whether it's new technology?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. Like I said in the previous question, I think there is typically a lag between the moves in the rig rate and the moves in our service pricing. So I think that's the first point. But to your point in terms of what our customers are looking for, I think, like I said, there's a growing focus on operational performance. Obviously, that is even more where the rig rates are high, like in deepwater, but we also see that in more conventional offshore operations as well. So I think that international capacity is obviously one driver that's going to support pricing going forward because we don't see significant overcapacity in the international market. I think the main reason why there hasn't been more pricing movement is the market share plays that's been going on, right, so with the growing focus on operational performance, I think that is going to help drive pricing going forward. And again, that's what we are seeing on selected contracts even in Q4.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And these market share gains, are they offshore, or are they on big onshore contracts today?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think we've seen them basically in -- all over. So I mean, I think they are reducing in intensity as the 2011 was unfolding and potentially coming to an end, right, given this growing focus from our customers on operational performance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James West from Barclays.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Paal, I have a question about seismic. Obviously, good finish to the year for the multiclient business, and I think your original expectations for the Marine side of the business, which we could see pricing power materialize around the middle of 2012. Given the Gulf coming back and your strong market share position there, given Angola pre-salt opening up in a big way here, is there the potential that -- one, that the pricing could move -- moves could be moved forward a little bit; and two, that the magnitude could actually be higher than perhaps you had originally expected?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I mean, I would answer the question along the lines that we do see the seismic market -- or the Marine seismic market tightening. So Q4 saw the expected drop in utilization, but that utilization kept growing during the quarter. Q1 is already looking up in utilization, and Q2 and Q3, it\u2019s actually looking quite strong. So the Angola seismic commitments around the Kwanza block awards are going to draw several new vessels into that area. But Angola alone is not going to be able to create a global undersupply, but I think it's going to contribute significantly. So in addition to Angola, we see the North Sea and the Arctic looking quite strong for Q2 and Q3. And also, there's going to be likely stronger activity in the Gulf of Mexico in this coming year, right, so basically, we see the potential to drive pricing up as being a kind of a mid-year to a second half of this year event. The amplitude, I am not going to be able to comment on at this stage.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And how do you think about capacity additions at this point, both your capacity additions and industry capacity additions?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, there were -- I think 2011 capacity additions to the 3D market, I think, was in the range of 6 vessels. What seems to be on the slate for this year is 3. So I don't think these capacity additions are going to have any material impact to the -- to when the pricing inflection point is going to become. In terms of our capacity, we -- the first thing we would do is to convert some of the source vessels we have back to acquisition vessels, but we will only do this when we can assure that we get the utilization that we are looking for.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Paal, my initial question here is on the CapEx outlook that you got. I think it's $4.4 billion or so for 2012. I wonder if you could give us some general indication on how that might be weighted between international and North America. And then if you can, within that context, just give us some indication on how much you may have kind of put aside for your pressure pumping investment. Obviously, you don't -- I don't expect you to give us explicit numbers, but if you just give us some relative size, it would be really helpful.","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay. So for the overall number, just to kind of let you know how we are planning the year, so we're going to look at the year in 2 halves basically. So in H1, we are going to continue to invest probably around the levels of the -- the average levels of 2011. And then we have secured capacity that's going to allow us to increase capacity with about 25% in the second half of the year. That's going to -- that can take us up to the $4.5 billion level. Whether we go ahead and spend all of the $4.5 billion is also going to be a function of how we see 2013 because a lot of the additions that we're going to be making in the second half of the year are going to be obviously coming into play and into real capacity in 2013. In terms of how we are planning to add numbers in international, this is obviously going to be fluid, all depending on how the 2 markets evolve, right, but we are -- we have capacity, and we are ready to add as much CapEx in North America in 2012 as we did in 2011. But we're going to be looking at this on a quarter-by-quarter basis.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then once again, is it kind of 60% international, 40% North America? How would you think about the split?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I'm not going to be able to give you that number. I'm sorry.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","No worries, all right. Okay. And just quick follow-up on -- I think it was Ole's question a little bit earlier. You kind of referenced the, I think, Street consensus numbers being too high. I think you were referencing the first quarter specifically. Would you've been -- if that is true, how would you assess the full year consensus number as well?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think, commenting on the full year, I would refrain from at this stage. I think we -- again, we are looking at the year-end in 2 halves in that sense, right, so I think it's -- I wouldn't care to comment on the overall number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Paal, with regard to getting back to seismic, Central Gulf of Mexico lease sale seems to be highly anticipated again on the part of E&Ps that I have spoken to. I believe that takes place this summer. Normally, multiclient spending patterns are very back-end weighted, as we saw in this fourth quarter. What do you expect will be the pattern of spending this year given the fact that such a big lease sale is coming this summer? Would we expect to see strong sales in Q1 and Q2? How should that unfold?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, first of all, the Central Gulf of Mexico lease sale has not been confirmed yet. It's likely to happen around midyear. We still believe it's going to happen around midyear. It hasn't been confirmed yet. If it goes ahead, and if it is announced, we expect there to be multiclient sales prior to that lease sale, right, so exactly what levels they're going to be, it's a bit difficult to predict. But if there's a mid-year lease sale, I think our H1 multiclient sales in North America could be stronger than what they've been in the last couple of years. We are also in a very good position in terms of the multiclient library we have in the Central Gulf, which also plays strongly into this.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. Secondly and the follow-up here, your North American land margins in the first quarter, what did they do sequentially? Were they flat, up or down?","Paal Kibsgaard","Excuse me? Our North America land margins?","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Yes, sir.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, our North America land margins were up.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Scott Gruber from Bernstein.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Paal, you highlighted your forecast for about 10% international rig count growth, but clearly, activity growth is going to be biased to the offshore. So do you think customer spending could come any closer to 15% growth abroad?","Paal Kibsgaard","It's difficult to say. I mean, if you look at the surveys, they range a lot, right, so -- but I think with the additions of deepwater rigs happening this year, which is going to come into full fruition next year, and with continued spend in exploration, we are optimistic on our outlook for the international markets.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And I hate to continue to focus on offshore service pricing, but it's clearly a key point of controversy. Assuming that offshore spending -- that the bias in spending is toward the offshore, some of the guidance we're looking at suggests that spending could be up closer to 20% offshore, and I know that the industry has a fair amount of clarity on when that's going to hit and so therefore can be prepared for. But are they -- are the plans of your customers coming in above expectations? I mean, if the industry hits something close to 20% spending growth offshore, is the industry going be able to keep up from a supply standpoint based upon your own CapEx guidance and what you're seeing in the marketplace?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. I think looking at what is going to drive part of the spending in the coming year, again, is deepwater and exploration. There's been a lot of exploration successes in the last year, which, again, makes us optimistic in terms of our view of next year. Looking at where we see most rig count growth, I think the -- in percentage terms, there's also a bias, like you indicate, in our view towards the offshore versus the land and the international market.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Are the spending plans of your customers coming in ahead of your expectations, particularly offshore?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, like I said, there's a range in what the spending plans for the customers are, right, so I think, generally, when we say that we expect the 10% rig count in the international market, I think that is based on what we have seen from our customers, and I think that is -- whether that is ahead or behind what we are expecting, I think that is what we're expecting.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Paal, my question has to do with the workflow around international shale activity and, in particular, referring to the comment in the press release on the Vaca Muerta shale work in Argentina. Sort of 2 parts to it. One, if we dial back 6 or 9 months ago, where would you say that workload is today relative to the expectation then, i.e. are we seeing sort of an acceleration, or are we tracking on plan? And then the second part of the question is, with respect to the work that you're doing around resource evaluation, how that might translate into sort of market share and the contract differences in international shale versus a U.S. shale like the Eagle Ford?","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay. So just generally first on the international and conventional market, we are -- I'm very comfortable with our position there. So we won a number of contracts in all the 3 international areas, and these contracts typically entail both studies based on this shale reservoir characterization model, as well as the wellsite operations for drilling and completing and stimulating these wells. The -- what we see in the international market is that there's typically no work done on unconventional or shale without first starting up with these studies when it comes to the reservoir. And obviously, we are barely leading in the ability to do that, and that puts us in a very strong position in winning these initial study bids and then building on that into the wellsite operations, right. So like I said in the script, we won a number of these contracts in all parts of the world, and I would say that the increase in activity for us in international and conventionals over this year and going into next year is probably somewhat higher than where I thought it would be going back 2 or 3 quarters, right. So we expect to see strong growth in all the international shale plays for us in 2012. The work is still going to be around evaluation and pilot projects in general. But I mean, it's still going to represent very good growth for us. And I think the 2 markets that is going to take off the fastest, I would say, would be Argentina and China.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's great. And just to clarify then, Paal, that when you mentioned -- I think you said significant capacity wins overseas, you were specifically addressing Poland, China and Argentina?","Paal Kibsgaard","When I say that we would move significant capacity overseas?","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, we added significant capacity in 2011, and we are prepared to continue to add it to the international market based on the activity that's coming up, right, but I would say that the countries that you mentioned, Poland, Argentina and China are probably some of the key ones. But I would say that there is a growing focus on unconventional and shale also in the Middle East, and we are ready to add significantly more capacity there as well as we continue to expand operations there.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Jim Crandell from Dahlman Rose. Well, we lost Mr. Crandell. We'll move on to Robin Shoemaker from Citi.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Paal, going back to your comments about large tenders with standard technology and the market share intense competition going on there, is that confined to the 3 large service companies you normally compete with? Or are there new entrants disrupting that kind of IPM work in terms of the pricing structure?","Paal Kibsgaard","No. For the high-end technologies, I would say the companies that we generally compete with are Halliburton and Baker.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. But on the -- what you called the standard technologies, is that you what you -- is that also the case?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. I mean, on standard technologies and I would say on land contracts and so forth, it's Halliburton and Baker, and then also to an extent, Weatherford. Those are the main competitors. We don't see any other kind of new entrants into the market space that we are competing with at this stage.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And if I could ask you -- just if you could comment on this joint venture you signed with Petrofac and what kind of projects specifically that's targeting.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, so first of all, it's not a joint venture. It's a corporation agreement. And the kind of contract that we are looking to work with them on are these production incentive contracts, \u00e0 la the one we signed in Mexico during the last quarter, right. So these production incentive contracts are contracts -- they are service contracts, but they are contracts where we are going to be paid and compensated based on the fee per barrel over an agreed baseline for the asset that we are managing. So the background for the agreement is that both Petrofac and ourselves, we have very complementary capabilities, and we also see this market in between a traditional service company model and the oil company model to do this incentive contract as a very interesting growth opportunity, having complementary capabilities, where we are very strong on the subsurface, production engineering, well construction and product management, while Petrofac has all the surface facility, design capability and, also, operational fee management. These are quite complementary, and it's going to help us basically to bid on projects of a scale that we probably wouldn't do independently, and we can also develop these at a much faster pace. So it is not a joint venture. It is a corporation agreement, where we're going to be bidding jointly on these type of contracts around the globe.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Just to clarify on those kind of contracts, the fee per barrel, would you expect your margins to be comparable to the kind of margins you generally achieve in that region?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, we've been doing these type of contracts for almost 10 years. And this was actually -- the original intent of IPM was to get into these type of contracts. So we've been holding a portfolio of contracts for in between 5 and 10 years. Not many, but the ones that we've had and where we have actually developed our skill sets, which makes us confident to go for bigger projects now. For that portfolio, the margins on these contracts are highly accretive to our average margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS.","Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Paal, I appreciate your color and your thoughts on North America. Certainly, still, at least in the liquid plays, a tight market or a relatively solid market, and margins are still obviously attractive around the 30%, 35% level. In your belief, in your thoughts when you think about North America in 2012, 2013, if pricing starts to decline more on a widespread basis, and we're now in the margins at the 20% to 25% level, do you think the market will start to pull back on capacity additions? Or is that still attractive enough margins that we still could see capacity adds at the margin or even more so?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, it's a bit difficult for me to predict what all the other ones are going to do, right, but I would say that we will continue to invest into this market provided that we can get decent utilizations on the assets, and as long as the pricing and the margins are still attractive enough. What that level is, I can't really give you a number on, Angie, but we also have, like I said, significant demand for this horsepower internationally, so we're going to have to be balancing off -- if something was to happen in North America to the extent of what you're saying, we will look at basically balancing off how we add capacity into the global market and based on the returns that we can get. But at the same time, I would just want to stress that we remain committed to the North America market, and we are looking to gain share at the back end of the Reservoir workflow that we have established and also HiWAY. And HiWAY -- in a market that is going towards equilibrium, HiWAY is going to give us both pricing and cost leverage into the market.","Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, okay, that's very, very helpful. And then one more, just as a follow-up on the margin side. Obviously, we're still seeing some competitive behavior for large projects but strength in some of the areas that you can add technology. I would assume that it's fair to assume a measured and moderate progression in margins internationally? And is there any regions that could be stronger or weaker than another?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I would agree with your first statement that some measured improvement in 2012 margins internationally is reasonable to expect. I wouldn't care to comment on exactly where that would be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Crandell from Dahlman Rose.","James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Paal, can you comment about how you see your business under the Petrofac joint venture growing the types of projects that you're undertaking and maybe the risks associated with that?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, if you look at the projects we're taking on, it's generally focused in on managing payout production in mature assets. We are looking at opportunities in various parts of the world. Obviously, there's upcoming bids in Mexico. There is other opportunities in South America, but also in the other areas, there are opportunities. And part of the opportunities are linked to a shortage of, I would say, operator capacity to handle this type of work where they\u2019d rather prioritize, focusing in on high-end and new developments, right. So I think this is a growing market and something that we are looking to pursue. But maybe, Simon, do want to comment a little bit on how we handle these things from an accounting standpoint?","Simon Ayat","Yes, okay, sure. As Paal mentioned earlier, we do have several of these projects, although at the smaller scale. And basically, this project require a -- some investment upfront, which we -- basically, we will capitalize. And then as we go, we amortize it against the profile of the production or the enhanced production that we are compensated against. Normally, we have a very, very clear plan on the production profile and the baseline and the decline of the baseline. And we anticipate very well the type of compensation where we amortize the investment against. So as you all know, we do follow a pretty good balance sheet and, to some extent, I would say on the conservative side when it comes to things like this, so this will continue to be the style.","James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And as a follow-up question, Paal, being a couple of your major competitors have either strongly urged or almost required customers to take a number of their product lines if they're going to get their frac equipment, how does your strategy in terms of trying to package different Schlumberger product lines along with fracturing sort of compare with theirs?","Paal Kibsgaard","I missed the first part of your question. Repeat it, please.","James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Well, the first part, I think, is that your 2 largest competitors in North America in fracturing seem to be, if anything, requiring companies to take many of their other product lines if they're going to give them their frac equipment, all the way from requiring to maybe strongly suggesting. I'm wondering how your strategy in North American pressure pumping compares with that in terms of trying to convince companies to take different Schlumberger product lines along with the frac equipment on new builds.","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, generally, we are -- when we work with our customers, they ultimately decide what they want to buy from us. When we have product lines that together can bring more value, we promote that to our customers. And if they see the value the same as us, then, typically, they will buy it. Now in terms of forcing them to do something, we never do that. And I think the forcing is going to go away because -- whenever the horsepower supply and demand reaches equilibrium.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of Mike Urban from Deutsche Bank.","Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Paal, I wanted to follow up on a couple of the comments you've made on HiWAY. It sounds like you have made some pretty good progress from kind of a volume standpoint in stages run and also some headway internationally. And I think you suggested this, but just wanted to confirm that you do feel like you're at least beginning to get some of the pricing and, I guess, cost savings as well from that product. In other words, are you able to get the kind of benefits that you envisioned when you rolled out the technology just given that you are seeing a broader maturation of the pressure pumping market and things stabilizing and, as you said, in some cases declining.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I think we are still very upbeat in terms of the performance of HiWAY and also the future potential that HiWAY brings, right. As I mentioned, we served over 35 customers in Q4, predominantly in the U.S. And while you introduce a new technology like this, it takes -- it basically takes some time from the initial jobs you do for one customer until you can broaden the application for a number of customers, right. So we had 50% growth in stages sequentially between Q3 and Q4, and I think this is a testament now to the customer base that we have established. And we continue to expand the customer base, and I think that's really what's going to help us further grow the service going forward. In terms of the jobs that we pumped or the stages we pumped in North America in Q4, probably only about 15% of the total stages we pumped were HiWAY, while we are really starting to expand in terms of the customer base, right. So I think there is significant potential as we go forward for HiWAY. And we also continue engineering efforts to extend the operating envelope in terms of lower temperatures and higher temperatures for HiWAY.","Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then more broadly on the pumping market globally, you\u2019ve talked about some of the flexibility that you hopefully have with respect to adapting the market and allocating capacity. Is that primarily with respect to the new capacity that you're building? And how much flexibility does that give you? And are you doing things like skid mounting? I mean, just trying to understand how much capacity could potentially move around relative to a pretty fluid and dynamic market.","Paal Kibsgaard","No. I would say a significant amount of our North America existing capacity can also be moved internationally if we want to. We have standardized the type of equipment that we are operating, and that can be moved internationally as well. I don't foresee that happening. I think the main thing we're talking about now is how do we allocate additions from this point onwards. But again, we have a standardized fleet, which is mobile to any part of the world. ","Okay, so before we close, I have one last thing to add. This is the last call that Andrew will be attending. So having spent 37 years with Schlumberger, he steps down as Chairman in April of this year. So I would, therefore, like to take this opportunity to thank him on behalf of the entire company for his outstanding contribution, and I wish him all the best in the future. I am sure that as a shareholder, he will listen to our future earnings calls, but I hope that Malcolm will not let him ask any questions. So Andrew, thank you again. And I now will hand the call back to Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 10 a.m. Central Time today through February 20.

Welcome to the Schlumberger Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.","Simon Farrant","Thank you. Hello, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited second quarter 2017 results conference call. Today\u2019s call is being hosted from Paris, France, following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer and Patrick Schorn, Executive Vice-President New Ventures. We will, as usual, first go through our prepared remarks, after which we will open up for questions. By way of an agenda, Simon Ayat will first present comments on our second quarter financial performance before Patrick Schorn reviews our results by geography, which may include a discussion on Schlumberger production management. Paul will close our remarks with an updated yield of the industry macro. However, before we begin I would like to remind the participants that some of the statements we\u2019ll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements.","I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K and other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our second quarter press release, which is on our website.","With that, I hand the call over to Simon Ayat.","Simon Ayat","Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.35. This represents an increase of $0.10 sequentially and $0.12 when compared to the same quarter last year. During the current quarter, we recorded $0.40 of charges. This primarily relates to Cameron merger and integration charges as well as a financing agreement we entered into with our primary customer in Venezuela.","We received an interest bearing promissory note in exchange of $700 million of receivables. The accounting rules required us to record this note as its estimated fair value on the date of the exchange which resulted in a charge.","Our second quarter revenue of $7.5 billion increased 8% sequentially, largely driven by the production group as a result of strong pressure pumping activity in North America land.","Pretax operating margin only increased 175 basis points to 12.7%. Highlights by product group were as follows. Second quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.8 billion increased 9% sequentially, primarily due to higher international activities across its product lines beyond the seasonal rebounds in Russia and Caspian and the North Sea region.","Margins of 17% were essentially flat. Drilling Group revenue of $2.1 billion increased 6% sequentially, while margin increased 278 basis points to 14.3%. These increases were driven by strong directional drilling activity in U.S. land combined with the seasonal increases internationally.","Production Group revenue of $2.5 billion increased 14% sequentially, while margin expanded by 382 basis points to 8.9%. These results were driven by strong pressure pumping activity and the pricing recovery in North America land.","The Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion increased 3% sequentially. This increase was largely driven by higher sales in surface systems across all areas and increased valve and measurement activity in North America.","Margins increased 61 basis points to 13.8% as OneSubsea margins exceeded 20% for the fourth straight quarter as a result of strong project execution. The book-to-bill ratio for our long-cycle businesses increased to 1.1 in the first quarter. This marks the first time these businesses have been above 1 since the fourth quarter of 2013.","The book-to-bill ratio for our long-cycle businesses decreased to 0.8 in the Q2. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 18.9% in the second quarter compared to 15.3% in the previous quarter. This increase was primarily driven by the increased earnings in North America.","The ETR will continue to be very sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings between North America and the rest of the world. We expect the ETR will increase next quarter as North America continues to represent an increasing proportion of our earnings.","In the second quarter, we generated $858 million of cash flow from operations. Working capital consumes approximately $550 million of cash during the quarter partially reflecting the growth in activity in addition to increased investments in preparation for the growth.","Working capital also reflected the payment of $90 million in severance during the quarter. We remained very confident in our ability to deliver on our free cash flow target for the year during -- driven by a very strong performance in the second half of the year.","Our net debt increased $1.2 billion during the quarter to $12.6 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $6.2 billion. During the quarter, we spend $398 million to repurchase 5.5 million shares at an average price of $72.34.","We started off the second quarter with a higher rate of shared repurchases but reduces considerably as we progress on the EDC discussions, which will be 100% cash transactions. Paul will comment further on the EDC transaction.","Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $500 million on CapEx and the investments of approximately $180 million in SPM projects. During the quarter, we also made $697 million of dividend payments.","Full year 2017 CapEx, excluding SPM and multiclient investments, is still expected to be approximately $2.2 billion.","And now I will turn the conference call over to Patrick.","Patrick Schorn","Thank you, Simon. Looking at activity geographically we had a very strong quarter in North America with revenue growing 18% sequentially driven by increased activity from the unconventional basis in U.S. lands. Rapid deployment of our ideal hydraulic fracturing capacity and continued growth in our drilling related product lines all contributed to a 42% sequential revenue growth in U.S. lands.","Hydraulic fracturing revenue increased by 68% sequentially significantly outperforming the 23% increase in the land rig count. We remain sold out for several of our key directional technologies as our customers continue to move towards more complex well profiles with longer laterals.","Despite the significant costs associated with reactivating equipment and infrastructure as well as adding people all of our U.S. product lines were profitable in the second quarter. This was driven by increases in products and service pricing, improved operational efficiency, proactive supply chain management and the growing impact of our vertical integration investments around sand production and distribution.","Cameron also contributes to our strong financial performance with higher product sales in wells and measurements and increased activity for our service systems product line. While we saw sequential revenue reductions from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and seasonally in Western Canada.","Looking forward, we expect U.S. land activity to remain strong throughout the second half of the year with our frac calendar already fully booked well into Q4 and the high demand of our drilling services expected to continue. We are also on track to complete the OneStim joint venture during the second half of the year which will provide us with additional hydraulic horse power capacity as well as a full suite of multi stage completion technology.","Internationally revenue increased 4% sequentially driven by growth in all geographical areas. In most geo markets, growth went well beyond the seasonal recovery from the winter slowdown.","Europe\u2019s CIS and Africa revenue increased 6% sequentially, driven by strong growth in the Russia and CIS region where we saw the start of the summer drilling campaigns in Sakhalin together with continued strong activity in Western Siberia.","North Sea activity was strong in both the U.K. and Norway as rig count increased and summer exploration work began. While the rig count stabilized in Sub Sahara and Africa as activity started to recover on land and with early signs of customers preparing to resume activity on key offshore projects.","Revenue in Latin American increased 9% sequentially driven by solid activity and sales in Mexico and increased exploration and development work in Columbia. Argentina revenue was also higher on increased unconventional land development while activity in Brazil and Venezuela remained weak.","Ecuador revenue was also somewhat lower sequentially however with the cooperation of Petroamazonas, Shushufindi production has now turned around and started to recover towards the end of the quarter.","In the Middle East and Asia, revenue increased 1% sequentially as activity in Egypt, Iraq and the UAE remained solid. We also saw seasonal rebounce in activity in China driven by higher sales of completion products and services as well as our SPM gas project in the [Indiscernible] fields, while drilling activity and product sales also grew in Vietnam and Thailand.","Next, I would like to provide an update on our SPM business and the rational behind their ongoing investment program. Today, most of the work we undertake for our customers continues to be contracted as individual products and services, and we do not see this changing in the foreseeable future. However, building on our broad technology offering and deep domain expertise, we have overtime also established significant project management and integration capabilities which we offer to our customers through more collaborative and commercially aligned business models.","The SPM business model represents the ultimate alignment with our customers as we take on full field management of their assets risking the value of our product and services and sometimes cash and where we get paid a share of the value we generate from incremental production.","Our first SPM project started in 2004 after which we have gradually expanded this business to each day we manage 15 projects in 7 countries. In 2016, our SPM business generated $1.4 billion in revenue and has over the period from 2011 to 2016 delivered return on capital employed which is around 700 basis points higher than the rest of our business.","The SPM business therefore represents the highest multiple we can get on our technical capabilities and in addition these long term projects have provided a welcome full cycle baseline of activity, revenue and returns.","Over the past three years we have seen a surge in SPM opportunities from both existing and new customers which we have decided to proactively pursue. This is by no means a desire to change the face of our company which will continue to be focused on market leadership in each individual product line, but instead SPM can create a baseline of activity to support our presence in the different geographies.","We remain confident that despite our drive to expand our SPM business which has a different contract structure compared to our traditional business we are not significantly changing the risk profile of the company. That is because the biggest risk we continue to face as an oil field products and services company remains the cyclical nature of our industry.","The SPM business although different in nature and contractual structure will in fact help dampen the impact of these cycles, provided the projects we invest in at the necessary full cycle robustness which of course remains a key selection criterion in all our evaluations.","Through our ongoing investment program we expect to double SPM revenue over the next two years and overtime make SPM equivalent in size to one of our existing four groups.","In terms of financials we have made a total capital investment of $4.3 billion in SPM projects since 2012 which represents less than 10% of our cash flow from operations over the same period.","Our SPM investments are currently being amortized at an annual rate of approximately $450 million and the amortization schedules are periodically reviewed and adjusted to match project life and economics. The current investment in SPM projects on our balance sheet is $2.6 billion.","In the last 12 months we have announced future multiyear investment plans of $390 million with YPF in Argentina and $700 million with FIRST E&P and NNPC in Nigeria. In addition, we have started off smaller projects with SM Energy in the Powder River Basin in the U.S. and with [Indiscernible] in Western Canada.","Going forward, we will through a newly established venture funds look to access an increasing amount of external funding for our SPM business through the refinancing of existing projects where today we carry 100% of the project funding and by inviting financial investors to take a share in our upcoming projects.","So in summary, our SPM investment program is focused on establishing a full cycle activity revenue and financial base line in many of the countries we operate in as well as on continuously providing accretive returns when compared to our base business.","I will now turn the call back over to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Patrick. So next let\u2019s turn to the oil market where a sustained growth and demand continues to provide a much needed foundation for the outlook leaving little reason for concern over this part of the oil market equation.","The supply side however is far more complex with market nervousness and investors speculation generally overshadowing facts and physical fundamentals leading to unpredictable movement in oil prices inspite of a third year of global under investment.","The status of the global oil supply is best described by splitting the production base into three main block. First, Russia and the OPEC Gulf countries, second U.S. lands and third the rest of the world.","The OPEC Gulf countries and Russia which combine make or close to 40% of global oil production remain fully committed to sound and consistent stewardship of their resource base. This is reflected in a steady increase in oil selectivity over the past three years as the world\u2019s best well at economics easily absorbed the significant drop in oil prices.","These countries are also actively supporting the rebalancing of the global oil market by taking a procative role in moderating the current production levels. The other two blocks of supply are currently pursuing diametrically post directions to both investments and resource management driven by the respective stakeholders.","The production level from the U.S. land E&P companies which currently represent around 8% of global oil supply is largely driven by the U.S. equity investors who are encouraging, enabling and rewarding short term production growth inspite of marginal project economics.","The fast barrels from U.S. land are facilitated by a factory approach to both drilling and production and supported by a rapidly scalable supplier industry with a low barrier to entry. In this market the pursuit of equity appreciation outweighs the lack of free cash flow, net income and return on capital employed for both E&P companies and the service industry.","And although the fast barrels from U.S. land have already cooled the oil price sentiments as well as the evaluation of the equity investments themselves, this has yet to limit the investment appetite for additional production growth.","The last book of producers making up the rest of the world today represents over 50% of global oil production and covers a broad and diverse group of IOCs, NOCs, and independent operators. In aggregate, this group is for the third successive year highly focussed on meeting the cash return expectations of their shareholders whether these are equity investors or governance.","The operators meet these requirements by striving to keep production flat by producing their existing outlets part of their normal and by limiting investments to what provides short term contributions to production at the expense of increasing deflection rates.","These producers have also benefited from a production tailwind of 500,000 barrels to 700,000 barrels per day in each of the past three years coming from new projects where the majority of the investments were made in previous years.","And with a low rate of new projects being sanctioned since 2014 this tailwind will taper off in the coming years. This harvesting approach is not uncommon for conventional oilfields that are in their last years of life prior to being shut in. However, this investment in stewardship model is sustainable for a vast resource space that is both expected and required to provide a substantial part of global oil production for decades to come.","Needless to say, the longer the current under investment carries on, the more severe the cliff like decline trend will likely be when the producers run out of short term options to maintain production. And given the size of the production base, it would be difficult for the rest of the global producers to compensate for this pending supply challenge.","So, how does this supply and demand situation translate into the current status of the oil market? Following the extension of the OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts agreed in late May, the oil markets and also included, we are expecting to see clear reductions in global inventory levels in the second quarter leading to a more positive sentiments in the oil market.","Instead, oil prices and market sentiments became unexpectedly more negative driven largely by fear of oversupply from the growing production from U.S. land where investments and activity is booming. This increasingly negative sentiment is reflected in the oil markets interpretation of the latest industry data points. First the fact that oil to the inventories are coming down so much slower than expected is currently a major concern for the market, although inventories are still coming down and the drills are expected to accelerate in the second half of this year.","And second, the fact that production from Libya and Nigeria has increased in recent months it is also a major concern for the market even though these countries were excluded from the production cuts because their production levels were low at the time of the agreement.","What we are currently witnessing is that the U.S. equity investors and E&P companies have spooked the oil market investors into believing that the fast barrels from U.S. land will flood the markets and leave inventory levels elevated for the foreseeable future.","Therefore their pursuit of short term equity returns from the U.S. land E&P stocks is actually preventing the recovery of the oil market and sending oil prices further down thereby eliminating any equity appreciation that the investments set out to create in the first place.","So what does this mean for the outlook for oil prices and E&P investments? The latest developments in the oil markets has created more uncertainty around the shape and timing of the global industry recovery. However, the near to medium term market evolution will continue to be dictated by the following three factors. First, with the moderation and the investment appetite towards the fast but marginal barrels from U.S. land leading to a stronger focus on E&P financial returns and the need to operate within free cash flow.","Second, with the key OPEC and non-OPEC countries extends the production cuts beyond the current nine month agreement. And third, with the emerging trend of a gradual investment increase in the rest of the world accelerate, develop mitigate or at least dampen the pending medium-term supply challenges.","These three factors are somewhat interdependent and forecasting the forward part from the current market situation is at present difficult given the unpredictable and at times irrational behavior of the broader oil market.","Still it remains clear to us that the current underinvestment in the rest of the world with increasing certainty create a mounting supply challenge over the coming years which will require a significant increase and acceleration in global E&P spend.","At present we are seeing the first small signs of increasing investments in the rest of the world. However, the further evolution of this emerging trend will still be governed by the actions of the OPEC Gulf countries and Russia on one side and the U.S. equity investors and E&P companies on the other.","New fund moderation from the U.S. producers combined with continued moderation from the OPEC Gulf countries and Russia should pave the way for a steady increase in oil prices.","This in turn will provide an investment platform that will allow all three supplier groups to increase E&P spend to jointly help mitigate the pending supply issues. On the other hand, an absence of moderation from both sides could lead to further drop in oil prices which in turn would both accelerate and amplify the pending supply issues.","In this market we continue to focus on serving our customers and driving on business forward by broadening our technology portfolio and increasing our addressable market by further streamlining our execution machine and by pursuing new and more collaborative ways of working with our customers.","And in doing so we are maintaining a balanced coverage of the global oil and gas industry allowing us to effectively address current and future customer activity. This includes U.S. land where we today are seeing strong growth in both activity and service pricing.","The OPEC Gulf countries and Russia already continue to see strong activity and a broad uptake of our entire technology offering, as well as the rest of the world which in spite of record low activity levels still represent over 50% of global oil production and we\u2019ll at some stage need to return to considerably higher investment levels even to just uphold current production.","As part of our global focus we yesterday announced our intention to acquire a majority stake in the Eurasia drilling company in Russia. This extents the success for long-term relationship we have enjoyed with EDC through this strategic alliance we sign in 2011 which has enabled the deployment of a broad range of our drilling and well engineering services to our customers in Russia land.","The pending EDC transaction together with our recent investment in a land rig manufacturing facility in Kaliningrad will further broaden our present infrastructure and capabilities used to serve the conventional Russian land drilling market.","In Western Siberia, the land drilling contractors continue to have the leading role in providing integrated drilling services through turnkey models. And as the uptake of horizontal drilling continues to increase the deployment of integrated drilling systems through the EDC platform including our rig of the future, will allow us to bring new levels of drilling efficiency to our existing and new customers in this large market.","So we are pleased to have reached this agreement with the EDC shareholders and we are already well advanced in preparing the regulatory filings required to complete this transaction.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","James West","Hey, good morning, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning, James.","James West","So, thanks for the bit of your macro thoughts here. I wanted to dig in a little bit deeper on those macro thoughts in the oil markets. We\u2019ve seen a tremendous slowdown in equity issuance from the E&P industry in the U.S. which I know has been kind of a thorn in the side, if you will, of the oil markets and then of course you're talking somewhat about pick up internationally that coming somewhat sooner than we would have expected. How does this all play out? Do you think that investors as you talk to investors and certainly as you look at the market do you think that the whole, I guess, forgive the phrase shale game of share has kind of played out here in North America, the markets kind of picking up on the fact, there is no cash flow. Or do you \u2013 are you concern that this game continues for a while and so we\u2019ll kind of stuck in the mud?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think we talked about this before and this \u2013 the overall set up of the U.S. shale business where there hasn\u2019t been positive cash flow or positive free cash flow for what the \u2013 the last six, seven years. We have comment on that as that\u2019s being a bit of a surprise already. Now whether it will continue or not, I think its going to come down to two things, whether they can still continue to borrow going into 2018 and whether they continue to hedge.","So I think today they still operate beyond cash flow, but I think the situation for the rest of the year is relatively set. So we expect to see steady increase in activity both in Q3 and Q4. What will happen in 2018? I think is a bit early to say. But as of now I think its still likely that we will continue to see strong activity in the U.S. in 2018 whether it will have the same type of growth rate we\u2019ve seen in 2017, that might not be the case.","James West","Right. Okay. Fair enough. Thanks Paal. And then with respect to the lower 48 especially given that we\u2019re recycling cash at these kind of oil prices and the well costs are continuing to move higher both as you and others raise pricing back to much more acceptable levels, although I know you probably still think they're not quite acceptable but they at least go in the right direction here. Where do you guys shakeout in terms of actual well costs where you can actually for an oil price basis make money in the U.S. market?","Paal Kibsgaard","From our standpoint, or from the E&P?","James West","E&Ps.","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, it\u2019s difficult for me to say that. I mean you see a range of so call breakeven costs where some of the transportation premiums, the discounts to the WTI standard, the amortization of the infrastructure and land is not included. So, it is very difficult for me to say, but if you go back and look at both cash flow and profitability for most of the E&Ps in Q1 where the situation actually was quite favorable. There was limited pricing faction from the service industry and the commodity price were still high than what it is today. I think they were probably few of them even at that stage that really generated a profit.","So, it's difficult for me to say. From our standpoint like we commented on in the prepared remarks, we are now profitable in all product lines. And we see continued growth in activity going forward in the next couple of quarters. So at least our business is back in the back and we are now obviously actively pursuing market share.","James West","Okay, good. Thanks, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, James.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ole Slorer","Thank you very much. And thanks for shedding some light, Patrick on the SPM model. You said doubling this business over the next a couple years, does it mean that you\u2019ll double the $2.5 billion or $2.6 billion that you now have invested. And could you highlight little bit what incremental capital that would take. And also maybe \u2013 I saw in the NNPC agreement that there were some references to guarantees. And how do you go about getting guarantees when it comes to non-OECD players?","Patrick Schorn","All right. So, let me take a stab at that. So, firstly, we were talking about doubling the revenue that is what we said and clearly the longer term ambition remaining that we are growing at even further into the size what's today a group would be. The issue with these type of contractors that there is a variety of ways and how you can structure these deals and therefore the associated investments are actually quite different. It's very difficult to say that the basket of projects that we have today would be exactly the same type of basket that we have going forward and therefore the investments remain the same.","What we\u2019re doing on a continuous basis is evaluating the overall portfolio of projects that we have. Look at the risks that we are having vis-\u00e0-vis certain partners, certain countries and certain investment level. So we\u2019ll continue to play that by year., And as you are very familiar with is that we\u2019re not only trying to finance these deals from our own cash growth, so looking to take in partners in the deals through our venture fund going forward.","So I don't think that you can straight say, the amount of capital we had invested in the past is something we would double or quadruple going forward. That is certainly not the case. It\u2019s going to be a function of the type of projects that we take on. I think what is very clear is that the opportunity basket that we have today significantly larger than anything that we have seen in the past. Now obviously if you look at what have we learned in the years that we've done these type of projects is that there is a significant value in making sure that you are involved in the amortization of the hydrocarbon and therefore have a certain level of control when the cash returns back to where to us.","And in more and more of the contracts that we have today, we are doing this through offshore escrow accounts, being very clear involved in the chain of custody of the hydrocarbon. And therefore that we know exactly when we get paid as this is sometime particularly in times of low oil price, obviously something that is more difficult. When it comes to returns and guarantees that you can get, clearly some of the projects that we have and kickstarting new business models in certain types of environments will require us to properly address risks that are potentially there. And therefore we have in certain of our contracts a guaranteed return that we would have on the investments that we make and clearly that allows us to go forward with these types of business models.","Ole Slorer","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much. And Paal, maybe you can tap in to some of that $100 billion of Wall Street, money that\u2019s been pouring into the shale and when it comes to tapping your E&P events, it sounds like your returns are little better?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, that was absolutely the plan, Ole, that\u2019s the plan.","Ole Slorer","Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ll hand it back.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Ole.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Scott Gruber","Yes. Good morning or good afternoon.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Scott Gruber","So, speaking on SPM, James highlighted that there has been a slowdown in equity issuances by the domestic E&Ps and debt financing costs starting to creep higher, although they\u2019re not punitive yet. But given these trends and stagnant crude prices do you think there's an emerging opportunity for SPM in North America? It sounds like you recently signed a few deals? Are there more in the queue?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. Clearly, we have mentioned some of the deals here in our earlier remarks and clearly today there is an opportunity in North America for this business model because it is also allowing us to bring the appropriate technology into the shale plays that we have won it or into the tight oil and gas and therefore there is a increasing opportunity set also in North America and for that matter I would say that today we have opportunities in just about every geography around the world.","Scott Gruber","In other words, do you think if North America could become a material percentage of the book of business if you grow SPM to be its own reportable segment?","Paal Kibsgaard","Absolutely.","Scott Gruber","I understand. If I could sneak one more in. You had significant restart cost in North America land this quarter. Are you to dimension how this falls off over 3Q and 4Q, so if we simply say that those extraordinary restart costs in 2Q were index that like one, where thus this figure head into the Q4, because its something like 0.7 and 0.3, I\u2019m trying to think about how those extraordinary costs roll-off over time here?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. So we -- if you are doing the exit on Q2 I would say that Q3 will be pretty much 1.0 as well. We will continue to deploy at almost exactly the same rate and we expect to have all our total fleets of ideal pressure pumping assets in operation by early Q4. Now after that the startup cost will start to abate. It will come down in Q4 and going into Q1. But Q3 will see the same rate of deployments and unfortunate the same rate of startup costs. But we are very pleased with the progress we\u2019re making here and we have -- the rate of deployments that we have now in our pressure pumping business is unprecedented, we\u2019ve never gone at this rate before.","Scott Gruber","Great. Thanks for the color. I\u2019ll turn it back.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","Bill Herbert","Thanks. Good morning. Paal, you mentioned about the percolating visibility and an improved outlook for international driven by Russia and GCC, could you -- and also offshore FIDs. Could you elaborate on the nature of those projects, long cycle versus short cycle? And also interestingly reconciling, the increasing activity on the one hand on the part of Russia and GCC, but on the other hand keep in mind that they are effectively the fulcrum of the Vienna Accord. And I'm just curious as to how that tension interplays with each other?","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay. Well, if I first look at the overall the international market in terms of the nature of activity. What we -- first of all, what we are seeing in most of the basins around the world takeaway as we say Russia and the OPEC Gulf, we are at unprecedented lows in terms of activity. So I think it\u2019s very natural that activity starts to come back. We were somewhat positively surprised at the rate it came back in Q2. It is not a dramatic increase. But it was more than what we were expecting from seasonality.","And if you takeaway Cameron which is three, four quarters behind in the cycle compared to the legacy Schlumberger business. We grew the legacy business 10% sequentially in land, 8% in ECA and 2% in MEA. So these were numbers generally higher than what we were anticipating. So it is a combination I would say of land focus in all of the three reporting areas. But as we commented on this well, there are signs now of offshore project being prepared for FIDs and tendering, we see it in particular through OneSubsea business and a lot of this is tiebacks which basically the nature of that is going to be a lot more short cycle on the offshore business than what we\u2019ve seen in the past.","And generally on land it is all short cycle as well. So, the lion share of the activity we\u2019re seeing internationally is short cycle, which is what you would expect where the operators are looking to minimize the time between cash outlays and production coming back.","Bill Herbert","Okay. And is there a threshold oil price when you discuss broadly speaking with your international client base that results in E&P capital spending growth or alternatively results in a continued stagnation. What\u2019s the dividing line between growth and a standing still?","Paal Kibsgaard","We don\u2019t discuss the details of what their -- their decision-making is based on. Other than that we are very actively work with all customers in bringing cost to barrel down, whether this is offshore or on land. And given the fact that I would say a lot of the operators have been producing their assets quite hard over the past two, three years. I think there\u2019s a need to start replenishing reserves and also supporting production with more wells and smaller tiebacks and so forth. So, given the fact that this uptick has happened in the second quarter, but actually saw low oil prices than in the first quarter. I think this is more a general direction of the international production base.","Most basins have unprecedented low activity and investment levels, and we seem to be coming off the bottom now. It will obviously supported more by higher oil prices, but there has been movement in the second quarter, which has actually seen a more negative oil price sentiment. I think that\u2019s going to turn in the second half of the year in the terms of sentiments, but the start of growth momentum, although still nascent has happened in the second quarter.","Bill Herbert","Thank you, sir.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Jim Wicklund","Good morning, guys.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning, Jim.","Jim Wicklund","Paal, I don\u2019t disagree with you at all on the lack of return focused by the E&P industry. But onshore U.S. market is about the same size as the rest of the world added together. And so, if the E&P industry in 2018 were to live within cash flow, you\u2019d have to drop about 300 rigs in the U.S. The transition would be a higher oil price I guess and higher activity international. How do you manage for something like that considering the ramp up you had in North America in pressure pumping just over the last six months? If that were to happen is it a smooth transition for Schlumberger and it's obviously beneficial because your bigger internationally, but with everything that's happened is there a dislocation coming if that were to happen?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, first of all, I\u2019m not saying that that\u2019s happening.","Jim Wicklund","Please believe me \u2013 believe me, nobody is been able to rein in the E&P industry, so...","Paal Kibsgaard","Exactly. So, I think it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll see a major sort of tectonic movement here. But the fact that the industry in North America land continues to operate way beyond cash flow. I think that\u2019s going to be challenged if oil prices stay where it is. So that could mean for sure that the growth rate would slow. I don't think you\u2019ll see a significant reduction in activity, but I think the growth rate might slow.","So I think there is still going to be possibilities both to land and potentially raise more equity, but in the event we continue at the current oil prices. I think the industry is going to be a bit more strain than what we have seen in 2017. Now, how we would manage that? We obviously \u2013 we are redeploying very actively our idle frac capacity. These are assets that we own already. And we are hiring people to operate them. And we are in a cyclical business. And it's a matter of adding proactively when you have the opportunity to catch growth and generate incremental. And if there is a headwind then we need to deal with it.","Jim Wicklund","Okay. And my follow-up would be -- and it just kind of occurred to me. Are we to the point yet in pressure pumping in terms of demand cost of reactivation et cetera, are we at the point in pressure pumping or Schlumberger is considering ordering new pressure pumping equipment?","Paal Kibsgaard","No. We\u2019re not. We are very actively working on closing out OneStim JV with Weatherford with the DOJ. There has been some additional information from the DOJ which we are now providing them with. And we are obviously optimistic that we can close this during the second half of the year. And when that\u2019s done, we will have sufficient pressure pumping and a capacity to see us through at least 2018.","Jim Wicklund","Okay. Patrick, a question on year end of the business, you say that you\u2019re going to look for partners through the venture fund going forward. Have you already started soliciting partners for the venture fund? And what kind of partners do you want or expect to have?","Patrick Schorn","So, yes, we obviously have engaged with quite a few people in the financial world. We\u2019re working through a few banks focus on the variety of target groups that we are trying to look at, but it's mainly banks, family, offices, pension funds that are showing quite a bit of interest of being part of this. So at this moment a lot of these discussions are taking place, but as you well know there is a tremendous amount of money available looking for the right deal to be part of.","Jim Wicklund","Okay. Thanks guys. Good quarter. Have a good day.","Patrick Schorn","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Michael LaMotte","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Paal, you all have given I\u2019d said, more time to sustainability this year than we\u2019ve seen in the past. I was just wondering if you could talk about sustainability just from a strategic standpoint and how its impacting cultures as well as potentially the way Schlumberger does business around the world?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, we\u2019ve always been I would say focused on sustainability, the impact we have on the environment around us in terms of our operation, but also the positive impact we live in the various communities that we are part of around the world. What we haven\u2019t done up until the last couple of years is to really document this and put this together into something that we can present to governments, as well as to the investor base. And I think that\u2019s the main focus that we\u2019ve had now over the past few years.","There\u2019s also a certain report and certain things that we do become part of in order to get certain certifications and rankings in terms of what our efforts are. So over the past couple years we have put that together into the report, which is then available both to local communities, governments and to the investment community where we really summarize and demonstrate what is long-term commitment is all about.","And we understand the importance of this for the investment community for instance around what part of the investment community are interested -- invested in the company where the focus on sustainability is obviously a key decision criteria. So we\u2019ll see the importance of it. It's not something new that we started off. But we\u2019re taking the effort of putting together our efforts so there are much more transparent in summary.","Michael LaMotte","And so it becomes a key competitive advantage, do you think?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I haven\u2019t looked exactly what our competitors are doing here. What we are doing is something that we believe in and that we\u2019ve done for a long time. And I said the main thing we've done now is to just summarize it, and whether that\u2019s a competitive advantage or not. Maybe it is but we haven\u2019t done it for that reason. We\u2019ve done it because we believe in it and it's something in very worthwhile for us to do.","Michael LaMotte","Okay. And then, if I could just follow-up on the on the incremental margin question. When we have talked about 60%, 65% incrementals in the past for a country once it sort of reaches the inflection point of growth. Is there a growth rate that is really necessary to drive that kind of incrementals, I think about faster velocity driving some inflation perhaps acceleration of technology use et cetera. Is a slower growth trajectory I guess a struggle to achieve the kind of incremental margin?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think in the international markets, I would say whether \u2013 I mean -- if the growth rate there is higher, it would be -- I would say easier to generate higher incrementals. So we have a very good I think handle on the supply chain there. As we have in the U.S. as well, but the rate of inflation in the U.S. is always a lot quicker for significant activity increases. So, I would say that to get incrementals, higher growth rates would be -- would make it probably easier to do it provided that we have a good handle on the supply chain.","But the key for the 65% incremental, so is that we need to have some pricing. And also those incrementals will kick in when we have kind of transitioned business from part of it basically being still in decline and battling some pricing issues. We need to firmly reach bottom in all aspects of the business and then start recovering from there including pricing.","But the so far when we look at incrementals company wide for Q2 around mid-30s is I would say acceptable at this stage. I don\u2019t it's fantastic. And it's something that we have a very strong focus on going forward. And as we start to I would say, complete the last part of the bottom of the cycle, I\u2019ll expect that we get close to these incrementals that we had promised.","Michael LaMotte","Thanks, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","One moment please for your next question.","Paal Kibsgaard","If Kurt is not there maybe we can skip to the next one.","Operator","One moment please. Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead","Can you hear me? Everything is good.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. Hi, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead","Okay good. Paal, given the beat quarter and a general positive commentary in the press release and what you been saying here on the call. I\u2019m assuming that bodes well for some upside earnings revisions in the back half of the year. How do you feel about where Street numbers are right now if you look into the three quarter, fourth quarter this year?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, if you look at Q3 in terms of the business we expect to see continuation of the trends that we saw in the second quarter. So, for North America that means continued solid growth. We expect the rig count to continue to grow in Q3, although likely slow in somewhat in pace. We expect to see additional pricing and share gains in directional drilling and as I mentioned earlier we will continue to activate or reactivate frac capacity at the same rate as we did in Q2.","Internationally, we also expecting to see a continuation of these encouraging signs we saw from Q2. We do expect single-digit sequential growth in ECA and MEA and actually most of the deal markets in these two areas will see growth we expect in Q3. But due to activity mix and some completion of projects we likely see a slight drop in Latin America in Q3. So, I would say, combining all of this I believe that the current Street consensus for Q3 is a good starting point.","Kurt Hallead","Okay. And you know I think the stock is obviously creating on what expectations are for 2018 and then probably way too early for anybody to make that assessment for sure, but some of the commentary you had in the call today, you sort of paying say a more optimistic picture than when where sentiment is you know at this juncture. So what do you think the primary risk would be overall to an improvement in 2018 versus 2017 maybe you can give us some color, also maybe some benchmarks for us to look for in the back half of the year that would either give us more confidence or flag some additional risks as we look out to 2018?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes to comment on 2018, I think like you say is still too early. In terms of where we sit at the company and I\u2019ll comment on the overall in a second, but I think if you look at our position in North America land we have never been better positioned to capture growth both in the drilling manufacturing business. And internationally with some of the recent moves that we just announced plus the overall step out we\u2019ve had in total addressable market we are extremely well positioned to capture growth in every corner of the world as the global investment eventually will start to increase right.","So, I will say the short term risk from the trends that we are currently seeing I think would be that, that there is still I would say issues around how the markets sees inventory gross. So far in July it\u2019s been very positive in particular in the U.S. and if this continues I think that should bode well for a gradual increase in oil prices in the second half of the year. But as a matter of how fast the U.S. producers are putting barrels on the market and also what\u2019s going to be important is what OPEC and Russia does you know come the end of the 9 month production cut period, right. So I think there is issues around or risks around how they interplay between the U.S. producers on one side and the Russia OPEC producers on the other side, how they play this out over the next I would say year or so, we are very clear in our view that you go 2019 and 2020 we are going to have potentially significant supply challenges.","So the fact that global investments will come up in that period I think is very clear. What\u2019s going to happen in the period before we get there is going to come down to the plans of OPEC and Russia on one hand and the U.S. producers on the other.","Kurt Hallead","Okay, great. All right, that\u2019s awesome. Appreciate the color, thanks.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Byron Pope from Tudor Pickering Holt. Please go ahead.","Byron Pope","Good morning. Just had a question on SPM, so given the margin and returns accretive nature of your SPM work and the plans to double the revenue base over the next couple of years, could you just frame for us how you think about which of your three international regions in which you report revenues are likely to drive that SPM growth, I know you got projects in a number of different countries but I\u2019m just trying to think about it in terms of your three international regions?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I am disappointed but not going straight international. But I think that some of the very large opportunities that we see here at the moment and we are working on actively at this moment are actually right in North America. Apart from those there are significant projects coming up in discussion in the Middle East that might not strike you as the first place for SPM to take place but also there we have significant opportunities and apart from that it is going to be more of Asia, more of Africa those are the key type of areas that we are looking at the moment. But I don\u2019t think you can underestimate the impact that SPM can have on North America.","Byron Pope","That\u2019s it from me. Thanks.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jud Bailey","Thanks, good morning. I had a follow up on OneStim if you don\u2019t mind. Paal, you mentioned that you expected for the Schlumberger equipment to be fully utilized by the beginning of the fourth quarter. As you look into 2018, as you acknowledge there is quite bit of uncertainty as to how spending budgets progress, how do you think about deploying the auto Weatherford equipment into that environment? Do you look for contracts, do you kind of force the issue and try to push equipment out or how do you think about reactivating that equipment in a more uncertain environment for next year?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well I will say the following that the OneStim JV isn\u2019t focussed on the next couple of quarters. We did this because we have the medium to long term view on the North American land market. There might be challenges overall in terms of the volume of the market but I think there is still going to be a significant core that\u2019s going to withstand you know oil price challenges and still going to be profitable. And I think the combination of scale and efficiency and technology that we will bring and vertical integration is going to make OneStim very very competitive in any kind of market condition.","So, obviously if activity was to flatten out for a period of time when you come early into 2018, then we will deploy what makes sense to deploy and the rest we will keep idle and ready for deploying later. So, we are not doing this for the next couple of quarters we are doing this for the medium to long term","Jud Bailey","Got it, okay thank you for that. And my follow up is just kind of following up on some of the offshore commentary. If we cannot stay in this $45 to $50 range for an extended period of time, how do you kind of think about the various pieces offshore, obviously you are seeing an uptick in FID activity, obviously everything shallow water activity continues to improve, but how do you think about deep water on kind of big projects towards on a longer term basis if we stay in this kind of environment for a prolonged period of time?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think if we stay in this environment for a long period of time, I think you will unlikely see large infrastructure projects whether it\u2019s a significant gap between cash outlays and cash returns, but I still think that even in deep water there are opportunities for tiebacks and utilization of existing infrastructure tiebacks using you know multiface pumps and so forth, right. So there are opportunities that we are seeing through one SubSea which actually isn\u2019t all concentrated on shallow water. There is a fair bit of deep water projects being considered unprepared for FID as well.","So, but I think they are going to be all relatively short cycle in nature and we obviously we have a very bit position to participate in this and support our customers in getting those projects online.","Jud Bailey","Great. Right, thank you I\u2019ll turn it back.","Paal Kibsgaard","All right. So thank you for that final questions. I would now like to summarize the three most important points we have discussed this morning. First, we remain positive on the oil markets inspite of the current negative sentiments that have created more uncertainty around the shape and the timing of the market recovery. We believe that globally E&P investments will need to increase significantly in the coming years to address the pending supply challenges resulting from three years of under investments. And Schlumberger is uniquely positioned to capture growth in all markets as global investments start to recover.","Second, we have shown you why we believe in the potential of Schlumberger production management to provide an activity baseline to geomarket operations that also delivered full cycle returns that are highly accretive to our business. And third we are continuing to build out our offering both in terms of technology and geography. The OneStim joint venture with Weatherford add scale and technology to our integrated production services in North America land while our agreement to acquire a majority stake in EDC in Russia offers significant opportunities to expand our presence in the conventional land drilling market in Western Siberia. That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for participating.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"19018":["Schlumberger Limited.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Malcolm Theobald, Please go ahead.","Malcolm Theobald","Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon and good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited second quarter 2013 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Paris where the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting took place yesterday.","Joining us on the call today are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.","However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements.","Now, I will turn the call over to Simon.","Simon Ayat","Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits was $1.15. This is an increase of $0.18 sequentially and is $0.14 higher when compared to the same quarter last year.","During the quarter, we completed the wind down of our operations in Iran and as a result we have now classified this business as a discontinued operations. All prior period amounts have been restated. As previously disclosed, we completed the formation of our OneSubsea joint venture with Cameron prior to the end of the quarter.","We recognized $1 billion gain in connection with this transaction which equates to $0.77 in terms of EPS. We also recorded $0.26 of charges relating to the impairment of drilling related equity investments. From an operational perspective, we had a very strong quarter. Oilfield services second quarter revenue of $11.2 billion increased 5.8% sequentially, pretax operating income increased 15.9% sequentially while the pretax operating margin improved 178 basis points to 20.4%.","Sequential highlights by product group were as follows. Reservoir Characterization revenue of $3 billion increased 9.6% and pretax income grew by over 25%. This resulted in margins improving by 380 basis points to 30.1%. This growth was driven by very strong performance in both Wireline and WesternGeco combined with the seasonal rebound in SIS software sales and maintenance. Drilling group revenue of $4.3 billion increased 4.4% and margins improved by 97 basis points to 18.7%. These increases were largely attributable to the Drilling and Measurements and M-I SWACO on robust international activity. Production group revenue of $3.9 billion increased 4.4% while the pretax income increased 12.6%. This resulted in margin expansion of 116 basis points to 15.9%. Growth was led by Well Services as a strong performance internationally and in US land more than compensation for the impact of the spring break-up in Canada.","Completions and one intervention were also significant contributors to the growth. Now, turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 23.3% in the second quarter compared to 23.8% in the previous quarter. We continue to expect the effective tax rate for the full year of 2013 to be in the mid 20s, hwoever, this can vary on a quarterly basis due to the geographic mix of business. Yesterday, our board of directors approved the new $10 billion share repurchase program to be completed at the latest June 30, 2018.","Our strong projected cash flow over the next five years allows us to increase the level of share buybacks while also maintaining enough flexibility to continue to take advantage of growth opportunities.","Let me take this opportunity to remind you how we manage our cash flow. Our first priority is to reinvest into the business to drive growth. We do this through CapEx and the investment we make in R&D and future revenue streams.","From a dividend perspective, over the past 10 years, we have increased our dividend on average by 13% per year. We will continue to review this on an annual basis with our board. After that, we will continue to be strategic when it comes to M&A, then the balance will be spent on stock buybacks.","For the first six months of this year, we have generated $3.4 billion of cash flow from operations. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $5.6 billion as compared to $5.3 billion at the end of the first quarter.","Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $906 million of CapEx, $600 million payment to Cameron for the OneSubsea transaction and $500 million of stock repurchases.","During the quarter, we repurchased $6.84 million shares at an average price of $73.7. CapEx is still expected to be approximately $3.9 billion as compared to the $4.7 billion we spent in 2012.","Now, I will turn the conference call over to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Simon. Our second quarter results were strong as international activity recorded significant progress and North American results benefitted from solid execution in land and increasing deployment of new technology in deepwater areas.","Sequentially, revenue was up 6%. Margins expanded by 178 basis points, which together yielded a 16% growth in operating income. Compared to the same quarter last year, operating income was up 12%. The results were driven by solid activity levels in all our main markets as well market share gains for a number of our product lines on the back of new technology sales and our strong execution and integration capabilities.","I am pleased with the overall results and even more so with the consistency in our business performance throughout the company seen, for instance, in the margin levels of our four main operating areas, which are all at or above 20%.","The focus on the quality and efficiency of our execution is also reflected in our incremental margins, which were north of 50%, sequentially, as well as the cash flow from operations which was $2.3 billion driven by both, improving asset utilization and reduction in the use of working capital.","The strength in our international business was again evident in the second quarter with year-over-year revenue growth of 12% and margin expansion of 173 basis points to reach 22%, making up over 70% of the operating income of the quarter.","Activity and customer plans confirmed our expectations for the year in all our major growth markets, while revenue per rig continued to steadily increase as a function of new technology sales, increased integration related activity and a favorable business mix.","Our ability to consistently execute remains critical in the international market and is a driver for both, our market share gains and superior margin performance. While we continue to replace competition on contracts where they are unable to deliver, we are becoming more and more selective in terms of where and when we do so.","In Latin America, the revenue was flat, sequentially, despite a 2% drop in rig count, while margins increased 107 basis points to 20.6%. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 3%, while margin expanded 153 basis points.","Our Latin America business showed commendable resiliency this quarter by maintaining laser focus on execution, technology sales and cost control overcoming both, activity headwinds and new contract mobilizations and startups.","In Mexico with the third big round for production intensive contracts was concluded where we ended up bidding for only one of the six blocks. Drilling activity remained soft in the North and East regions of the country following the budget shifts announced in the first quarter.","In Venezuela we signed a new agreement with PDVSA and we are now in the process of ramping up our activity in the country while payments are on plan. Elsewhere in Latin America, the Shushufindi SCM project in Ecuador is progressing well with production levels well above the agreed targets. While, in Argentina, we continue to be active in reservoir studies and well side operations relating to Vaca Muerta shale development.","In Brazil, we continued to mobilize resources during the quarter for the new contract signed with Petrobras although overall activity levels were down sequentially. We have several new IPM projects starting in the second half of the year, however the overall activity level is expected to remain flat to slightly down for the rest of the year. Overall, our outlook for Latin America remains unchanged with 2013 being a transition year in terms of activity for the region and we remain comfortable with our position, our plans as well as the actions we have taken to handle the somewhat challenging business environment.","In the Middle East and Asia, revenue grew 11% sequentially on a 3% rig count increase while margins increased 178 basis points to 24.6%. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 28% while margins were up by 330 basis points. In the Middle East growth was again spearheaded by Saudi Arabia and Iraq but our United Arab Emirates and Oman geo markets also posted strong results. Common to all there markets is that we have gained noticeable share in the past quarters. Our business in Saudi Arabia continues to grow through a diverse portfolio of projects on both land and offshore and driven by both drilling and rigless activity.","In Iraq, we have on the back on an unmatched execution track record built up a significant business that is now starting to yield excellent results. Activity levels continue to increase both in the North and in the South of the country and with our business footprint and contract portfolio, we have clear leadership in what is shaping up to be a very interesting market for us.","Asia also contributed strongly to the area results by delivering a record revenue in four geo markets driven by robust market share and new technology sales. China led the Asia growth on a rebound from seasonally low land drilling and simulation activity in the previous quarter and also helped by an upswing in offshore activities. We also posted very strong in Australia, driven by continued growth in unconventional activity on land as well as offshore and deepwater activity in the Northwest and Papa New Guinea.","In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue was up 10% sequentially and margins increased 275 basis points. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 7% while margins increased 33 basis points. As expected, Russia led the growth in the second quarter as the high volume land as well as the offshore business entered the most active phase of the calendar year.","EMP investments and activity levels in the country remained very strong in terms of offshore and land activity as well as for exploration and development and Russia will be one of our fastest growing markets in 2013. In the North Sea, WesternGeco saw strong activity as the seismic acquisition season started while the offshore drilling rig count stayed more or less flat.","In North Africa, rig activity in Nigeria started to rebound following the security incident in the first quarter while rig activity in Libya remained flat due to delays and ongoing security challenges.","In Sub-Saharan Africa, activity in the Gulf of Guinea as well as in East Africa was robust. On the other hand, activity in Angola was subdued in the second quarter due to project delays. However, the activity outlook for the second half of the year remained strong driven by both exploration and development projects.","In North America, revenue was up 2% sequentially while margins increased 65 basis points to reach 19.7%. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were flat while margins were down 83 basis. In the North America land market, the rig count dropped 14% sequentially driven by the Canada breakup and also impacted by the June flooding in Alberta. While the downwards pricing trend in U.S. land continued in the areas of drilling, simulation and wireline, although this slowed in pace during the quarter. However, continued strong drilling efficiency, resulting in solid growth in horizontal wells and frac stages completed partly offset these headwinds.","Looking at our land performance we continue to execute very well in our product lines and we also see a gradual improvement in the uptake of our new shale technologies throughout the characterization, drilling and production groups. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the deepwater rig count is now 17% above pre-Macondo levels and on a year-over-year basis activity has increased by 30%. The call for reliable and efficient service delivery in addition to risk mitigation technologies continues in this growing market and is yielding very strong result for a number of a higher margin and higher market share product lines. In addition to the Dual Coil fleet operating in the Gulf of Mexico, WesternGeco also started isometrics operation in Eastern Canada during the quarter.","Turning next to technology. During the quarter, we closed the OneSubsea joint venture with Cameron and the JC is now operational. Cameron, with its long history of innovation and firsts in the subsea market is an industry leader in design capability, manufacturing excellence and successful installations. In addition to this, Schlumberger brings a deep understanding of the reservoir as well as industry-leading well completions, subsea processing and integration capabilities. Through the combination of these strengths, OneSubsea will offer best-in-class subsea solutions optimizing the complete subsea production system and helping our customers improve production and recovery from their subsea development.","In other areas, we saw growing customer interest in a number of our new or recently commercialized technologies. In Wireline, the Saturn 3D fluid sampling probe is enjoying one of the most rapidly growing deployments of new formation of our technology for a number of years. Its ability to acquire reliable pressures and high quality samples in difficult reservoirs has been impressive.","Reservoir Characterization, the SIS Studio Manager software, which went from concept to market release in only eight months is enabling and increasing number of customer geoscientists to access data, collaborate with peers and share best practices within [partout] workflows.","Within the Drilling Group, new and innovative drillbit technologies recorded significant progress. Drillbits equipped with Stinger conical diamond elements that add stability and improved drilling speed have now made more than 650 runs in North America alone since their introduction in the first quarter and have achieved an average improvement of 15% in rates of penetration.","In the second quarter, we commercialized the ONYX 360 rotating cutters that we believe will lead to dramatic improvements in different lengths in abrasive formations. Lastly, at the Production Group, joint deployment of LIVE slickline with ACTive coiled-tubing services demonstrated clear benefits in the efficiency and effectiveness of our well intervention services both, on land and offshore, and units were active in the quarter in both, Latin America and the Middle East.","Let's now turn to the macro environment, where the business outlook for 2013 has remained largely unchanged since April as expansion in the global economy remained soft. In summary, the U.S. has shown little or no impact of the financial sequester. The Eurozone is still in a two-year recession although the risk of any concrete to leave the monitor union appears reduced. And, recent Chinese data have been mixed with the outlook for long and progressive soft landing remaining unchanged.","The oil market picture is also largely unchanged. The market is more comfortably supplied than it was in 2012, but spare capacity remains below pre- Libya conflict levels. The year-on-year increase in North American supply is enough to face both, increasing global demand and the production declined in other non-OPEC producing countries. The call on OPEC remains unchanged and is in line with the group's production target of 30 million barrels per day. Overall, the market continues to support Brent prices over $100 per barrel.","For natural gas, the apparent rebalancing of the U.S. market is still fragile as gas production remained steady and as the power sector has already switched back to coal in some regions on higher gas prices.","Internationally, Asian LME prices eased on weaker Chinese demand trends, but remained close to oil parity. While in Europe regional supply declined from the North Sea and very cold weather supported highest spot prices.","Despite the overall slow progress in the economic environment, the latest releases of the third-party E&P spending surveys, so offer durations of upstream CapEx estimates making 2013 the fourth consecutive year of double-digit worldwide gains driven by the international and offshore investments notably in the Middle East and Asia regions, while the North American spending remained flat to slightly up.","These estimates are further confirmed by the recon outlook that shows double-digit growth in a number of both shallow water and deepwater rigs active worldwide and a 6% growth in the international land rig count in 2013.","In this market, we continue to focus on [key] control, which is the quality, efficiency and integration aspects of our operational execution. Through this focus, which permeates our entire organization, we continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver tangible results today as can be seen by our revenue market share gains, unmatched operating margins, strong cash flow and consistent double-digit growth in earnings per share.","We also remain confident in the outlook of the industry, in our strategic position within the markets we operate in an in our ability to further improve all aspects of our performance going forward, which remains the overarching objective of the entire Schlumberger team.","That concludes my remarks. I will now hand the call back to Malcolm.","Malcolm Theobald","Thank you, Paal. Greg, we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Good afternoon where you are. A question, Paal, for you on the North American market. You continue to show some differential performance on the margin front despite the fact that and show improvement in terms of activity, revenue and margins despite an anemic rate progression and a lot of discussion here about the well count and so on. So I was just wondering if you can us a little bit of additional color as to what product lines that you see will be benefitting from the shift in the type of drilling that\u2019s taking place in the U.S. marketplace and what kind technologies that Schlumberger has that will continue to enable Schlumberger to share differential margin performance going forward?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think if you look at what enables to show differentiated margins, I think its several things. Firstly, our ability to execute very well on land, whether that is on drilling or on pressure pumping but also the fact that we have a very well balanced portfolio in between drilling and production related activities on land as well as in between land and offshore. So we honestly have a very strong offshore business both rig related as well as seismic but what we have done in recent years is, starting off in 2001 was to restructure the business on land which in previous years, I would say, had underperformed and through that restructuring, I think, we are performing on par with the best if not better in most of our product lines.","So if you look at the trends of drilling, in the North America land market now going towards more and more horizontal wells, predominantly focused on liquids, all our drilling segments obviously benefit from that. At the same time, our pressure pumping business through new technology deployments such as HiWAY are also benefiting from this. We also introducing to the market our own multistage completion technology, which has been a gap in our portfolio in recent years which also should enjoy quite significant growth going forward. So I think it\u2019s a good balance between land and offshore, good balance between drilling and production on land and overall a very strong focus on execution.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","And as a follow-up on that, with respect to the overall margin performance of Schlumberger, especially in the international marketplace, are you getting any sense that we are starting to see a shift in the industry that will demonstrate Schlumberger's relative product and services strength, whether its deepwater or otherwise? Do you think whether that kind of an inflection point in the marketplace or we are going to see these strengths of Schlumberger?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, if you look at our margin performance in international over the past couple of years, I think we have been highly differentiated continuously, right. So I think we have done well in our contracts strategy, what contracts we are prepared to take on and the ones that we see more as must wins. We have continuously introduced new technology and we are also leveraging very well, I think our overall size and infrastructure. So to your question, whether its an inflection, we don\u2019t see any imminent inflection in big pricing at this stage. We are seeing a continuous uptick in another pricing indicator that we track which is revenue per rig. That is continuing to grow and going upwards. That obviously helps our profitability. What drives that up is new technology sales. It is our integration capabilities where we do more and more services and products on each rig and it is also down to the nature of the work that we take on. Typically take on the more complex and more intense work, because it is more difficult to do. If you perform well in that, that also is quite accretive to margins. So bid pricing, we still don\u2019t see any imminent inflection but we continue to drive revenue per rig upwards through new technology, through integration and there's very solid execution.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James West from Barclays. Please go ahead.","James West - Barclays","You mentioned in your prepared comments, the third party surveys, which of course you are well aware we do a very large survey. And, what we saw when we reran the numbers here in May and in early June was that international spending was creeping up about 300 basis points to 400 basis points. So, curious if you are seeing the same things from your customers who you are having the same post conversation that we are with.","Then secondarily, which markets do you agree with what we showed as the biggest growth areas of kind of Middle East, eastern hemisphere in general and which seem like markets that are Schlumberger's backyard essentially. Do you see those as the best growth markets for this year?","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay. So, to the first part of the question in terms of the spend, yes, if you look at the average of the spend surveys, we look at several. I think for international it was about 9% early in the year, and it was generally all of them revised upwards lately to average about 13%.","So, we generally agree with that upwards revision. We see continued strong activity levels in the international market and those spend surveys are also I would say confirmed from the rig count outlook and also the rigless outlook in terms of activity that we have the second half of the year. So, yes, we are in agreement that that upward revision seems to be reasonable.","Then second part of your question was?","James West - Barclays","On the specific regions where the spending has increased?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. So, we highlighted going into the year five major growth regions, right? So, we said that international would grow north of 10% this year. We would see growth in Latin America, but due to the kind of transitional nature both, in Mexico and Brazil as we indicated earlier in the year, we weren't expecting a lot of growth coming out in Latin America which is being confirmed and we said that the main growth markets would be Sub-Saharan Africa, Russia, Middle East, in particular Saudi and Iraq, China and Australia. Those were the five main drivers. So, basically and ECA and MEA were the main drivers of growth in international market.","James West - Barclays","Okay. Then just a follow-up from me, the market share gains that you also highlighted in your prepared remarks, are those happening in those markets that are going the most rapidly?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think, in general that's fair. I would say in particular in MEA, we are gaining quite good market share.","James West - Barclays","Okay. Great. Thanks Paal.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","David Anderson - JPMorgan","Paal, just a real quick [rig count] about six month behind schedule. Can you concur with that and does that have an impact on kind of your outlook for next 12 months?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, if you look at our view on the [rig count], we are still expecting the total rig count both drilling and workover to reach about 170 rigs by the end of 2013 or early 2014, so the rig count evolution in Q2 was flattish, but it is all about when new rigs arrive and how they are commissioned and so forth, but we are still expecting that we will reach the number that we have indicated earlier roughly by the end of the year or early 2014.","David Anderson - JPMorgan","Okay. Then I just wanted to make sure you touched on that you can't expect bids from us. I was just curious what was about those contracts that kept away? Was it location, work, was it the contract structure or you guys just holding out for another set of tenders?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, let me just give you a little bit of background on our view on these production incentive contracts. So, we've been very clear about our interest in production incentive contracts, but we also stress the importance of picking the right project with the right terms.","So, we evaluated all the 60s offered in the third in Mexico and based on the very detailed technical and commercially valuations we did, we only fund one field interesting. Now we've been at this field at the price that will give us the returns that we require and that is really factoring in the additional risks associated with these contract terms. The winner bid at a fee close to zero fee per barrel and basically we are not interested in doing that, so we did not win it.","David Anderson - JPMorgan","Okay. One last quick question on some of the buyback you announced today. Could you just kind of give us a sense on your philosophy on the pace of that buyback? You talked about the cash flow you are generating over next couple of years. Should we expect the majority of that to go towards share repurchase? I heard on some type of broke in terms of the deal but it seems like you have an opportunity here to kind of accelerate that over the next, all it, I don\u2019t know, three or four quarters here. Am I right in my assessment?","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay. Well, thanks David. As I mentioned in my remark, that the buyback is basically a balancing number for us when it comes to utilization of the cash flow. You are right in your assumption of the cash flow. That's why we said latest by 2018. So as the cash flow proved to be significantly better than what we have factored in the five year scenario in making the $10 billion program, we will accelerate it. We did this in the past. We look at our excess cash over a period of time, taking into consideration the growth that we are anticipating in terms CapEx and as I said investment in future revenue stream activity, be it multi client or production incentive contracts and any balance will go into the buyback. Yes.","David Anderson - JPMorgan","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey from ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Judson Bailey - ISI Group","Thanks, good morning. I wanted to ask a couple of questions on Mexico, if I could. The first is, that's obviously a big market for you guys. Are you there?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes.","Judson Bailey - ISI Group","I am sorry. Obviously a big market for you guys, pretty-diverse. Pemex still has pretty ambitious growth expectations in next few years. It obviously pulled back activity in the North. I wanted to get your thoughts. They have the lot of tenders coming up and tenders in process and it would look like, you could see pretty strong growth in that market next year. In your view, is there any reason for skepticism that Pemex may be wouldn't follow through or is there else going on down there that would give you some caution in terms of the growth opportunities down in Mexico?","Paal Kibsgaard","No, I don't see any reason for that. I do not think Pemex has signaled that there is a number of bids coming out for the remaining part of this year and probably into next year. We are going to actively compete for all of that work and we continue to see Mexico as a very interesting market for us.","Judson Bailey - ISI Group","Okay, all right. Then next question, just on North America. Obviously, very strong margin results factoring in Canada and everything else going on in that market. With the continued growth in the Gulf of Mexico and let's just say that the U.S. landmark, it kind of continues at this methodical pace with very little pricing traction. How should we think","about Schlumberger's margins in terms of, we would assume you would get some more market share gains, you would benefit from the very strong Gulf of Mexico and a rebounding Canada? Can you help us think about maybe the near term and the long term margins for the Schlumberger in the North America market?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I would say that over the past year when there has been significant struggles in the pressure pumping business, I think we have shown commendable margin resilience and again, as I alluded to earlier, it is down to how we execute on land as well as the balance between land and offshore. So in terms of what the margin progression is going to be, the main uncertainty is still what is going to happen in terms of pricing on land. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we still saw pricing pressure both in the drilling, stimulation and Wireline product lines in the second quarter but that was slowing somewhat in pace.","So assuming that the pricing is reasonably behaved and drilling efficiency continues to be the main activity driver going forward, I would expect us to show continued margin resilience and obviously we are looking to drive up margins in any operating areas. I can't promise you exactly how that\u2019s going to progress but we have a lot of focus on margins in every part of our business and we will continue to look drive it up in North America.","Judson Bailey - ISI Group","All right, great. Thank you Paal.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Thanks, good morning. Paal, I was wondering if you could sort of reconcile on the one hand for double-digit E&P capital spending growth, not so much for this year but on a structural basis perhaps going forward internationally, and reconcile the tension between on the one hand the increasing need on part of the customer base to reinvest simply to","keep production flat and on the other hand increasingly challenged cash flows in a range bound oil pricing burn and rising cost environment. What do you think ultimately happens over the next several years assuming range bound oil prices? Does the rate of E&P capital spending growth decelerate or what happens?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think we are still optimistic about the further need to increase overall E&P spending going forward, right? So, we saw the upward revision for the spend survey this year. And at this stage, although it's early to conclude our next year the customers need to go through their planning process, but we are still optimistic about the initial projections for 2014.","The resilience in the spend as you say is linked to partly the working intensity linked to fighting decline, but also due to the overall size and complexity of the projects that are undertaking in particular in the international market.","So, I think for the company, for E&P companies that potentially are or will be facing cash flow issues, we expect them to be likely to shift more of the spend within the E&P spend from more infrastructure related projects towards more well CapEx.","So that obviously will be good for our business, because that's sort of where we make most of our money on, right? So, I think the general shift from infrastructure towards CapEx is where I expect to happen for those E&P companies that are facing cash flow issues.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Okay. Then secondly switching gears. At the reservoir level, I'm curious as to what your views are with regard to the outlook for U.S. oil production growth, I mean, clearly it's been extremely vigorous. We are up about $1 million barrels per day on a leading edge basis that's 15% to 20% year-over-year, yet I think there is a healthy debate here with regard to the prospects going forward, the prospect of the Bakken growth flattening out and filling their production growths vacuum with other basins, perhaps not as easy as some contend. Where do you fall out with regard to the domestic production outlook going forward stronger for longer, or decelerating or too early to make a case either way?","Paal Kibsgaard","It's a good question. First of all I would say that the overall production increases that we have seen on our North America liquids, they have been very impressive. We always maintained that it's too early to extrapolate the early production trends in terms of how great they see. Also, I think it's too early to conclude on whether the trends we are seeing on the Bakken, is something that is also sustainable, right?","For the early production trends, I think we need more information to look at the production of these wells over a longer period of time and I think we also we need to look at the initial rates or the inflow performance for the wells that the operators are started to drill outside of the fairway, right? As they step out on the acreage, so I am going to have to go for option three of your multiple choice there.","I think it's too early to say both, while we can extrapolate the initial overall trend from North America or whether there is any significant impact or the recent trend that we see in the Bakken.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Scott Gruber - Bernstein","Paal, I found you comment about becoming more selective regarding when and where you chose you peers interesting. Is this a reflection of capacity constraints desires to avoid problematic contracts some of those? Why is the stance shifting?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think obviously if a customer calls upon us and wants us, generally, we will do utmost to serve them. At the same time, we also have to make sure that we prioritize putting our equipment into the customers that have initially selected us, and if we are going to go on replace the competitor on or their contracts, we obviously need a significant pricing increase from the initial rates that our competitors took the work on for, right?","So, and there's also other strategic considerations as to where do we put our capacity while it's a priority in terms of the customer mix this well, so can't really going into the details of how we select, what to do. I would just say that we will always look to serve our customers as best as we can. But at the same time, we are continuing to look at how we optimize our business mix and how we maximize the return from the resources that we have up in operations.","Scott Gruber - Bernstein","Okay. Then an unrelated follow-up. Can you discuss the efforts internally to improve the working capital management? If you look over the last six months you guys have held the line here on receivables and other current assets but I assume that you are not completely satisfied in the working capital at this point. Then if you have year end targets that you could share with us, that would be greatly appreciated?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well maybe I will say a little bit about what I think the investment community call self help initiatives, right. So first of all, in Schlumberger we believe that in order to maintain and extend to our market leading position, we always need to do better tomorrow than what we did today. So, company wide programs addressing execution improvements they are not really sporadic or episodic with us. They are a way of life. So we have, in recent years or in the recent year, put more focus on working capital on cash generation. In the past before we had more focus on more cost and resource management to be trying to balance the focus on both cost and resource management with cash management.","So we have specific programs running focused on capital efficiency, around receivables and also around inventory management and we build it into our business plans and we also build it into the incentives of the entire management team. So this is really how we try to put focus on it and what we put focus on in Schlumberger will generally do quite well.","Simon Ayat","I would like to add a bit to what Paal said. The last couple of years since the acquisition of Smith, you probably noticed that the working capital as percentage of our sales has gone up a bit. This was all planned. As a result of expanding certain segments or product lines of Smith internationally, which are more inventory intensive segments or products line, we had to increase inventory to meet the expansion that we have done internationally. One of the main reasons for acquiring Smith and integrating it with the rest of Schlumberger is also to use the footprint of Schlumberger, which meant that some of those segments that were mainly U.S. focused we took them overseas and therefore an increase in inventory. We have managed to do this now and going forward we will not have to increase it at the same pace that we have done before.","Scott Gruber - Bernstein","Great, I appreciate the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley","Thank you. First of all, congrats on your decision to return a greater part of cash flow to shareholders. I think there is a very clear difference at the moment in this evaluation of companies who do that and those who don't in this slower growth environment that they are in. First of all what were the biggest technologies that drove your share gains?","Paal Kibsgaard","In terms of specific technologies, let me elevate it and maybe focus in on the product lines. So I would still say we have gained more share in wireline and drilling and measurements. Those are the kind of spearheading segment for these efforts, right. So there is number of new technologies that we have introduced in both these product lines over the past year or two and the uptake of them is good. What we also find now, as you know, we have restructured our engineering manufacturing into same organization about five years ago and this is really starting to pay dividends now because the new technology that comes out, it's performing much better than the initial technologies that came out five or ten years ago. There were lot more teething problems, which we are basically now avoiding. So, the new technology, which is commercialized within its first year, is actually now growing significantly faster than what it did may be five or ten years ago. So, I would say, wireline and drilling and measurements are still the ones again that are gaining the most share.","Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley","So it is then fair to say that this is largely driven by offshore?","Paal Kibsgaard","No I think, it's both on land and offshore.","Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley","Okay, and a follow-up question would be, what market share changes are you seeing in the offshore market? One of your largest competitors continuously make claims that they are gaining share across all kind of (inaudible) technologies?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I don't know who they are gaining share from, because it isn\u2019t us. So I think, we are in the offshore market we obviously already have a quite a high share, but we reference Gulf of Mexico in some of these discussions and we continue to gain share in the Gulf of Mexico and in several of our high end product lines.","Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Just finally, how far away do you think from being a new pricing cycle in North America pressure pumping?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I would say there is still significant overcapacity horsepower in the sitting on the sides today, so I don't see that happening in 2013, at least. I think, we are still going to have overcapacity as we exit this year.","Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley","Finally, what are some of technologies that are reducing the pressure pumping in tentatively of shale oil and gas in North America?","Paal Kibsgaard","What technologies do that?","Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley","Yes.","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, HiWAY is obviously one of them. We use significantly [less] and also generally less water in the operations that we do with HiWAY. The other way of reducing or lowering the intensity of these operations is to use much more of the subsurface approach prior to actually designing the jobs, right?","So, having a much better understanding of the subsurface will allow you to design the completion of the well and the amount of horsepower water and pump use by be more selective in which stages you frac and also using more sophisticated frac fluids like HiWAY.","Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley","Are you seeing a change in attitude there with the shale oil gain becoming more and more of a large company gain?","Paal Kibsgaard","Not a dramatic change, but I would say we have. We are starting to get several key customers that we are collaborating much closer with than what we've done in the past and where we engage all the way from characterization to drilling and production and taking a much more sophisticated approach to how we go about working with them on their developments, right?","So, it's still relatively slow, but through some of the contracts we won over the past 12 months to 18 months, we have established as part of those contracts, a very strong technical collaboration agreements, which are also benefiting technology penetration.","Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley","So, on Forest Oil, the contract being in Eagle Ford, how would you characterize that in the context of just that?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I can't really comment on that. Forest will release their results I think in a couple of weeks. We'd need to refer you to them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim","Thanks and good afternoon, guys. I wanted to just follow up on the North American onshore market and a little bit on the Forest Oil as well as Spark. Let me ask the questions just from the context of shift in business model in North America. I think both with Forest as well as Spark, you've tried to introduce a new model to the U.S. land market and I was just wondering now as you've been out marketing concepts like that for a while what the perception has been and what you think the uptake and penetration rate might look like?","Paal Kibsgaard","On Spark, we are seeing a reasonable uptake on it. Nothing dramatic which we weren't expecting either. It's mainly focused on customers that are have vertically integrated. They have their own horsepower with very limited capabilities in terms of pumping more sophisticated fluid systems, so we continue to do Spark-related activity, but it isn't a significant part of our business which weren't really expecting either, but it's progressed reasonably well and we are happy with the performance from this. We are mainly doing Spark in North America, but we are also doing Spark in China for some of the frac operations there.","The other part of your question in terms of the Forest Oil type of deal, initially as we said when we closed the Forest deal, our main motivation for doing that type of a deal was actually to get a display window for our shale technology capabilities, so we haven't really been actively out promoting SPM or production incentive type of contracts in North America, beyond trying to get that deal done, so we could demonstrate our capabilities for the technologies that we have developed. So, we know other progress or we haven't really even been pushing that model beyond that one deal we struck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil","Thanks. Good morning. Paal, two questions, one, I wanted to follow up on just how things are progressing on the SPM side. In the first quarter, you mentioned you had 10 projects. Goal was that two to three a year. I didn't see anything in the press release with regards to another announcement there. Perhaps if you could just update us on your thoughts? And maybe perhaps your size for us on a revenue basis annually? What SPM is going to contributing to the top-line for Schlumberger?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, you are correct. We didn't sign any SPM projects in the second quarter. Our goal of adding two to three projects a year basically stands firm. But again, as I mentioned on my comments on the Mexico bid round, we will only sign the project that we believe are right for us. This is all about portfolio management. It is about picking the right projects, the right fields with the right terms and we have very stringent return criterias in terms of what we will engage in. So, our goal is two to three deal. If we can get the right ones, we will do it and if we can't find the right ones we won't do it. In terms of the impact on the business, it's still relatively a small part of our overall revenue stream, but by picking the right project it is a highly accretive part of our revenue stream and we will continue to focus in on maintaining it as highly accretive.","Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil","Right. Your view has been that these projects are accretive to margins and essentially every geo market in which you have rolled it out. Is that correct?","Paal Kibsgaard","That is correct.","Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil","Okay, great. Well, my second question was just a follow up on North America margins, specifically as it relates to Geco which was called out in the press release but you didn't you specify, perhaps I missed it in earlier comments, whether or not Geco really was being driven in the Gulf, more by the Marine side of the business or whether we saw multiclient or maybe a combination of both? Then maybe just address Gulf of Mexico Geco as we think about the balance of '13?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, in the Gulf, in terms of ongoing operations, we have one Dual Coil fleet operating. It continues to operate in the Central Gulf. It has got a good backlog of things to do there on the multiclient site acquisition. We have an ongoing multiclient late sales business where we had some revenue progression which is seasonal basically from Q1 to Q2. We don't break up what that revenue progression was in a multiclient. You can see what the total is. The total for Q2 worldwide was $250 million, up from $175 million in Q1. So a part of that was North America, but I would say as the general comment on the multiclient performance in North America in Q2, it was below our expectations. We were expecting more sales to multiclient than what we actually realized.","In addition to the multiclient business in terms of late sales and acquisition in the Gulf of Mexico we also started of the third-party survey offshore Eastern Canada and this is with isometrics. So those are basically the WesternGeco business in North America.","Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil","All right. That sounds like that continues in second half of the year should be accretive to overall North America margins?","Paal Kibsgaard","They should.","Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil","Okay. Thanks, Paal, for the time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.","Angie Sedita - UBS","Good morning, guys or good afternoon and it hasn't been said. So I will say, congratulations on a great quarter. Very impressive of you and the team.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Simon Ayat","Thank you.","Angie Sedita - UBS","On Mexico, Paal, I appreciate the color on the production of incentive contracts and the bidding there, but your thoughts on, I believe the next round of awards will be IPM potentially as much I have heard as $8 billion to $10 billion in contracts. You view that as the better and more attractive opportunity in the region and then along with that, have you had conversations with Pemex on the potential timing and is it multi-year for Mexico to open up and the opportunities there?","Paal Kibsgaard","So what we know about the bids coming out is that there are a series of bids. So probably there would be a single service bids, there would be IPM well construction bids and there will probably be more production incentive type of bids coming out as well over the next couple of quarters. So, as I said earlier, we are very interested in the Mexican market. It is going to be very highly competitive. It has always been highly competitive but it's about, as I said before, being able to bid strategically, trying to pick up the right contracts and the right opportunities and having a plan for how you would create value for Pemex and at the same time create value for Schlumberger as we engage in these contracts, right. So I gave you a quick summary of our view on the third run of the FDM contracts and we will continue to evaluate every opportunity for gaining more work in Mexico and will engage in it with a view to make returns for the Schlumberger shareholders.","Angie Sedita - UBS","All right. Then on the U.S. market, thoughts on the pace of activities for Q3 and Q4, are you seeing based on your conversations with the customers still steadily higher in Q3 as far as activity and Q4, the seasonal decline or are we going to run into the spent budgets that we did last year?","Simon Ayat","Well, whether Q4 is going to see the same as last year, I think it's just too early to say. Obviously, as WTI ticking up a little bit over the past month or so could be a positive preventing that from happening, but I still think it's too early to say what will happen in Q4.","Our overview on the second half of the year U.S. land is, I think rig count is going to remain relatively flattish, but drilling efficiency is going to be the main activity driver, again generating reasonable growth in stage count, sequentially.","Looking at Canada, we expect the H2 rig count at this stage to come in or the recovery in the H2 rig count to come in lower than 2012. While the stage can be expect to be more or less flat with last year. Then, again, continued strong activity in terms of offshore Gulf of Mexico, both shales and deepwater.","Angie Sedita - UBS","Then finally you mentioned Russia being one of your strongest geo markets in 2013, is that in part driven by the Eurasia deal, or is it outside of that project?","Simon Ayat","Well, the Eurasia deal is part of our business and it's important part of our business in Russia, but it is only part of it. We have significant other activities both, on land and offshore both, in Sakhalin, in the Caspian, in the Barents, in the Arctic, so we are very well diversified in terms of both, customers and regions that we operate in Russia and that's why I think we manage to sustain very high growth rates.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Jim Crandell from Cohen. Please go ahead.","Jim Crandell - Cohen","Paal, one of your competitors was indicating in the marine seismic business relative softness in bidding activity for the fall winter season. What are you seeing in the fall winter season relative to the spring summer season and how does pricing look for that season right now?","Paal Kibsgaard","For the marine market, we maintain our positive outlook, which we have basically conveyed over the past couple of quarters, right? The way we see its supply and demand appears to be relatively well balanced. In terms of bookings for Q3, we are basically already fully booked, and also Q4 in terms of backlog is filling up quite well. So, activity wise, things are looking quite good for us.","In terms of pricing, in the second quarter, we didn't see any significant further traction in terms of basic bid pricing, but we also track another pricing indicator, which is revenue per streamer and our revenue per streamer was up about 10%, sequentially, and that's mainly at the backend of new technology and the type of service we conduct and also some seasonality effect. That's basically where we stand.","Jim Crandell - Cohen","Good. That's helpful. And, one follow-up question about WesternGeco, when you used to break it out, this would of course be obvious, but could you give some indication where margins are relative to let's say the oil service average at WesternGeco, and I am just trying to handle on how much margin leverage there was there going forward?","Paal Kibsgaard","We are not breaking out about any individual product line is doing in terms of margins. I can't really comment on that, but given where pricing stands and given the very significant new technology portfolio, we have and just putting into operation both, on land in terms of processing as well as marine, we obviously see margin upside potential for WesternGeco.","Operator","And, we have time for one further question today. That question comes from the line of Jeff Tillery from Tudor, Pickering. Please go ahead.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering","One of my questions I have is around the U.S. land business. You mentioned improved well service and pressure pumping utilization several times in the release. What are your thoughts around bringing some of the never deployed equipment in to the market given where your margins are? How do you see that as an opportunity in the second half of the year?","Paal Kibsgaard","So we will look at bringing equipment in from what we have apart when we can get the utilization that we require for the overall group and at this stage we are not looking to bring anything back in that we have parked and I don't expect that to happen in 2013.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering","Great, thank you. Then my last question is just around the reservoir characterization business. With the significant margins increase there, I mean obviously multiclient helps, but if I look back historically there doesn't really tends to be a follow-up in multiclient sales in the third and fourth quarter relative to the second quarter. So any reason we should think about margins perhaps stepping backwards in the Reservoir Characterization business in the second half of the year?","Paal Kibsgaard","No, nothing fundamental. This is a huge business and there are mixed effects depending on what region grows and there is exploration and development type of mixes even in characterization, but overall I expect the Characterization Group to continue to post very strong margins.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering","All right, thank you guys very much.","Malcolm Theobald","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Malcolm Theobald, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Malcolm Theobald","Thank you, Julie. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Third Quarter 2012 Results Conference Call. Joining us on the call from New York City today are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results, and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.","However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the frequently-asked-questions document, which is available on our website or upon request.","We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements. [Operator Instructions]","And now, I'll turn the call over to Simon.","Simon Ayat","Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.08. This is an increase of $0.03 sequentially and $0.12 compared to the same quarter last year. As a reminder, all prior-period amounts have been restated as the Distribution segment has been reclassified to discontinued operations following the sale of Wilson in the second quarter and the sale of our investments in CE Franklin during the third quarter.","Third quarter revenue of $10.6 billion increased 1.5% sequentially. This increase was driven by international revenue growth of 3.1%. The international growth was offset in part by 2.3% decline in North America. Oilfield Services pretax income of $2.1 billion increased 2% sequentially while pretax operating margins were essentially flat.","Sequential revenue and pretax margins highlights by products groups were as follows. Third quarter Reservoir Characterization Group revenue of $2.9 billion increased by 4.8 percentage points sequentially, and margins improved 58 basis points to 28.8%. These increases were driven by improved reservoir utilization at WesternGeco, following last quarter's transits and dry docks, as well as a strong international performance in Testing Services.","Drilling Group third quarter revenue of $4 billion increased 1.2% while margins declined slightly by 34 basis points to 18.1%. The revenue increase was largely attributable to Drilling & Measurement on robust activity in the Middle East and Asia.","Third quarter Production Group revenue of $3.7 billion decreased 1.7% sequentially while pretax margin fell 148 basis points to 14.9%. These declines were largely attributable to our North America hydraulic fracturing business, as we continue to experience pricing pressure in U.S. land as a result of excess hydraulic horsepower capacity in the market.","From a geographical perspective, North America margins declined by 209 basis points to 18.6% while international margins improved 73 basis points to 21.5%.","Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 23.6% in the third quarter compared to 24% in the previous quarter. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $6.2 billion as compared to $6.7 billion at the end of Q2. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.1 billion of CapEx, $121 million of proceeds from the divestiture of our investments in CE Franklin and $149 million of stock repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares at an average price of $68.19.","In addition, during the quarter, we took advantage of the low interest rate environment by issuing $1 billion of 1.25% of 5-year notes due in 2017 and $1 billion of 2.40% 10-year note due in 2022. CapEx is still expected to be approximately $4.5 billion in 2012 as compared to the $4 billion we spent in 2011.","And now, I turn the conference over to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Simon. Our third quarter results continue to show steady improvement in both revenue and margin performance as seen in the overall pretax operating income, which was up 2% sequentially and 11% compared to the same quarter last year.","In the international markets, total revenue grew by 3% sequentially, in line with the rig count while margins were up by 73 basis points, reaching a 3-year high. Activity was solid, driven by both key land and offshore markets. However, regional growth rates continue to vary, driven by changes to activity mix and project schedules.","Service capacity remained tight in our Seismic, Drilling & Measurements and Wireline product lines, and we also saw signs of capacity tightening in our Well Testing business. Pricing continued a steady upwards trend during the quarter, driven by higher new technology sales, strong operational performance and further supported by proactive bidding on small- to medium-sized contracts.","In Latin America, revenue was flat sequentially while margins were down 113 basis points, driven by a shift in activity mix, operational delays and heavy mobilization costs linked to new contract startups.","In Mexico, activity remained steady during the quarter with continued focus on deepwater exploration, conventional offshore development and mature fields on land. We start operations on our -- in our first Schlumberger production management, or SPM, project covering the Carrizo Field, and we also began to mobilize for the second SPM project covering the Panuco block.","In Brazil, activity was also flat during the third quarter with growth on land being offset by less offshore drilling as rigs were redirected towards work-over activities. Still, the growth outlook for Q4 is positive with 3 additional deepwater rigs scheduled to start operations, together with higher forecasted stimulation vessel activity.","Ecuador saw strong sequential growth as we completed the mobilization of the Shushufindi SPM project. The project is now fully operational and activity and results are progressing in line with our plans.","During the quarter, we experienced operational delays in Argentina and Colombia, due to a range of local factors, but we are expecting to see solid sequential growth in these countries in the fourth quarter.","In the Middle East and Asia, revenue grew by 7% sequentially while margins were up 126 basis points. During the quarter, Saudi Arabia again posted strong sequential performance, driven by work-over, development and exploration activity. These results were further supported by solar activity growth in Oman, the United Arab Emirates, as well as Kuwait.","In Iraq, we completed our resource mobilization following the second quarter contract wins, effectively doubling our drilling activity in the country during the quarter. With this market share gain and our well-established execution track record, we have, over the past 2 years, established our traditional international market position also in Iraq.","In China, we continue to see strong sequential growth on land, driven by higher drilling and stimulation activity as our Chinese customers embark on more complex conventional and unconventional projects. Still, the GeoMarket with the fastest sequential growth in the third quarter was Australia, where offshore activity increased and where our strong contracts position in the Queensland unconventionals is starting to have an impact.","Following a very strong second quarter, revenue in Europe\/CIS and Africa grew by 2% sequentially while margins were up by a further 138 basis points. In the North Sea, we saw strong activity at WesternGeco, which was offset by startup delays on several smaller projects for other product lines, as well as extended summer maintenance shutdowns in both Norway and Denmark.","In North Africa, delays negatively impacted results in Algeria while issues related to the security situations slowed the activity ramp-up in Libya. Activity in Sub-Sahara Africa remained strong during the third quarter with significant sequential growth in East Africa.","Russia and Central Asia also saw strong sequential performance, driven by activity growth in Western Siberia while offshore activity remains flat for the quarter.","In North America, sequential revenue was down 2%, and margins were down 209 basis points. In terms of activity, the results were negatively impacted by a slower-than-expected seasonal pickup in Canada, a 3% sequential drop in the U.S. land rig count, as well as the activity shutdown in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico linked to Hurricane Isaac.","The negative pricing impact on our hydraulic fracturing business in U.S. land continued in the third quarter as the new pricing levels further penetrated our contract base. Furthermore, in U.S. land, we also saw the first signs of pricing weakness in our coiled-tubing business towards the back end of the quarter.","In the Gulf of Mexico, excluding the Hurricane Isaac impact, deepwater activity grew in line with our earlier outlook and the number of deepwater drilling rigs is set to reach pre-Macondo levels by the end of the year. We continue to show strong operational performance, and our Gulf of Mexico business is becoming increasingly accretive to our North American markets. In WesternGeco, we operated one dual coil fleet in the central Gulf while multiclient sales were flat with the previous quarter.","Let me now turn to some of the technology highlights for the quarter. In the Reservoir Characterization Group, we opened the Schlumberger China Petroleum Institute in Beijing. The institute houses more than 100 of our petro-technical experts, which, together with domain experts for most Schlumberger product lines, offer a full range of reservoir services to the various players in the Chinese oil and gas industry.","To further strengthen our position in the emerging shale market in China, we also signed a joint venture with the Chongqing Institute of Geology & Mineral Resources to provide basin studies, subservice data integration and optimize well and completion planning for the new players coming into the Chinese shale market.","Elsewhere, we continue to expand our presence and capacity for core and fluid analysis with the opening of our latest lab in Houston, which joins our network of over 25 labs around the world. We are also continuing with our strategy of combining our downhole fluid and core-sampling technologies with our lab capabilities to provide a seamless, integrated service.","In the Drilling Group, we continue to execute our strategy, focused on creating the next step-change in drilling performance through total system integration, and we are progressing well with this work as can be seen by the improvement in the Drilling Group financial results over the past 2 years.","During the quarter, we reached a significant milestone where Smith Bits, for the first time in their history, captured the #1 market share spot according to the latest Spear's survey. This achievement is another testament to what the Smith segments can achieve through their unique technology and as part of Schlumberger, both with respect to the overall drilling workflow and our global infrastructure.","Another very interesting drilling technology being introduced by Geoservices is the advanced couplings characterization. Here, we performed continuous petrophysical measurements of the couplings as they come off the shakers. And through novel data processing, we can establish the reservoir quality of the rock and also tie it back to the specific well depth. This will offer a very effective way of optimizing well placement and completion intervals, for instance, in horizontal shale wells.","In the Production Group, we performed close to 2,100 stages with HiWAY way during the quarter, which represents record activity and a sequential growth of around 60%. In addition to the established HiWAY markets in North America, such as the Eagle Ford, we also saw meaningful penetration into several other basins, including the Bakken and in Canada. HiWAY's production results and completion cost savings have been the main driver for its penetration into these basins.","We also completed a study of public production data covering the Eagle Ford that show that average production from the HiWAY wells was 65% higher than non-HiWAY completed wells. In the international markets, HiWAY saw continued growth with a near doubling in stage count versus the prior quarter.","Let's then turn to the macro environment, where both the U.S. and European Central banks announced interventions to support growth in their respective economies. China continued to show signs of slowing growth, but so far, the slowdown appears to be actively managed and, for the time being, kept under control. Altogether, these developments have left the GDP growth outlook for 2012 and 2013 more or less unchanged from the previous quarter.","At the same time, the supply and demand balance of the oil market remains tight with continued production challenges in the non-OPEC countries and with OPEC spare capacities staying close to a 5-year low. Based on this environment, we continue to see Brent crude prices reported around current levels, although there could still be periods of volatility.","In the international market, we have seen no material change to overall customer activity plans or sentiments during the quarter, and we still expect our activity to grow in excess of 10% this year.","In North America, the activity sentiments are currently more negative, both in Canada and U.S. land, with liquids activity no longer able to offset the drops in dry gas drilling. This, coupled with ongoing pricing pressure in hydraulic fracturing, as well as early signs of pricing weakness in coil tubing in U.S. land, indicates no immediate change to the North American headwinds.","As we continue to navigate the overall macro uncertainty, manage the North American headwinds and capitalize on the steady international growth, we maintain relentless focus on the quality and efficiency of our execution. This execution capability, together with our balanced technology portfolio and unmatched international strength, will allow us to deliver double-digit growth in earnings per share in 2012, as well as solid margin progress, in what remains quite a changing business environment. This position and these capabilities also put us in the driver seat for continued outperformance in 2013, which remains the collective ambition of the entire Schlumberger team.","Thank you very much. I will now hand the call over to Malcolm for the Q&A session.","Malcolm Theobald","Thank you, Paal. We'll now open up the call for questions. Julie?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] With that, we'll go to line of David Anderson with JPMorgan.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Paal, question, international performance, particularly out of Eastern Hemisphere, is very impressive this quarter, particularly how it has progressed over the last year or so. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the drivers behind that. How much of this would you attribute to, say, execution, activity levels, pricing? And I guess what I'm really trying to understand is how much of this momentum do you see continue into 2013, in other words, is it sustainable now and we continue to build from here.","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay. So if I started with the Q3 performance, I would just say that I'm overall pleased with the progress. We are keeping very strong focus on execution as we have been talking about in earlier quarters, and we also are doing quite well when it comes to cost and resource management. We also continue to work on our internal improvement programs, which, by the way, is included in our normal operating cost. So in terms of margins, we saw further progression in Q3, and we had very good incrementals. And as I said in my prepared remarks, our international margins is now at a 3-year high. Some of the drivers behind this is slow but steady pricing increase, driven by new technology sales, as well as strong operational performance. But I would also say that the quality of service is still a market share driver for us, right? The D&M Q3 replacement ratio was again 34:3. So we're maintaining this 10:1 ratio, and this is actually starting to become meaningful for D&M now, which have shown significant improvement in financial performance during this year. So if you then take that performance and try to look forward, we maintain our positive view on international markets and also our performance there, right? We have a very strong international contract portfolio, and this portfolio has solid upside when it comes to both technology and the performance. And the other thing I would like to highlight as well is that we continue to expand the international presence of our smaller product lines. If you look at operations internationally today, we operate in over 80 countries and we have 17 product lines. But in 50% of these countries, we only have 50% of our product lines present. So I would say that we still have a lot of runway in terms of growth and as per market penetration. So in terms of margins going forward, I would just say that we will continue to leverage the size and the infrastructure and the execution capabilities to drive both the top line and further margin expansion. So as overall -- I mean, our view on the international market remains positive, and I'm pleased with the progress in terms of how we're executing. And I would expect us to continue to improve going forward.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","More specific questions, just Saudi, if you don't mind. How do you see Saudi market develop in the next several years, and how much of their growth is going to come from gas? I mean, I know we're not going to see the huge massive ramp-up we saw last cycle, but we're hearing more and more talk about gas being one of their focuses up there. So I'm just kind of curious, how much of gas do you see that big -- as a contributor there? And can you give us a sense as to how much that gas market in Saudi has grown over the last year?","Paal Kibsgaard","I don't have the breakdown of the rig increases that we've seen over the past year, right? But Saudi today is on track to reach 134 rigs by year end, which they, more or less, indicated. In terms of the outlook beyond year end, we don't expect this -- a dramatic increase in rig count, I would say, in the first half of next year. But rigless activity remains strong and is also a key growth driver for us in Saudi. But like you said, gas is important. Saudi Aramco recently announced a gas discovery in the Red Sea, which -- there's no firm plans beyond this. But with the gas discovery, I think it's reasonable to assume that there'll be more exploration activity around that. And there's also a lot of gas-related activity in the Northwest, linked to both tight gas and shale. So you're right to point out that gas is important, and I would say that gas, in terms of future growth in Saudi, is probably going to be one of the key drivers.","Operator","The next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Paal, I was just wondering if you might be able to provide us some perspective on -- you guys put out some very strong performance here relative to your peer group over the last couple of quarters. Maybe provide some perspective on how you plan on maintaining that performance differential going forward. And then in addition, some of your -- some commentary we've recently heard for some land drillers and from some of your competitors are calling for an uptick in activity in the U.S. market, U.S. land drilling market, going out into 2013. If you could give us some perspective on the outlook there, that'd be helpful, appreciate it.","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay. So the first part to your question was related to North America as well?","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just globally, really. It looks like your performance overall for revenue growth, margin performance, et cetera, has been exceeding your peers over the last couple of quarters.","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay. So if I -- if you go back to the first question, I answered that. I think a lot of the elements of our international performance I covered there. So maybe I just focus in a little bit more on North America.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough.","Paal Kibsgaard","So if you look at Q3, overall, again, solid performance for us in Q3. I'm pleased with the progress. Since we restructured our business about 2 years ago, we now have a very lean and focused North American organization. We have invested quite strongly in infrastructure over the past couple of years. So we are now able to leverage that. And we also -- after the Smith merger, we now have a very broad technology and workflow offering in the North America land marketplace, which we are also able to leverage. And finally, what I would say on the means we have to succeed, we probably have one of the best supply chain organizations in the North American market as well. They have done a really great job in particular, together with our pressure pumping organization, this year. So -- further on performance in North America, if you look at how we have been addressing the fracturing market, more or less from the beginning of this year, we have kept focus on what we call minimum effective margins. This is basically the product of our bid price times the utilization. So if these effective margins go below a certain level, we are prepared to lay down crews. So we laid down crews in Q2. We also laid down crews in Q3, and this is how we are able to protect better, I would say, the margins in our pressure pumping business. Now in terms of the other product lines on land, we continue to have solid performance both from Drilling and Wireline. Obviously, the Gulf of Mexico remained strong for us and was, in Q3, highly accretive again, even with the Hurricane Isaac impact, and this is with flat seismic sales quarter-on-quarter. Now if you look at the North America market going forward, from our standpoint, the -- on the plus side, we expect to see continued strong performance in the Gulf of Mexico from us, both when it comes to drilling activities as well as seismic. And we also see Canada having a positive impact for us in Q4 and Q1, although not to the same level it had in the previous year. Now on the negative side, fracturing margins are going to come down further in Q4 and likely also in Q1 as the new pricing levels work its way through our contract volume. But -- and also -- as I also mentioned, we also see some margin pressure in coiled tubing. Now what's going to happen beyond Q4 or Q1, I would say there's really 3 main questions in my mind. Firstly, will there be a Q1 recovery in liquids rig count after Q4? This is key to maintain the current land pricing overall, both for frac-ing as well as for the other product lines. The second question is will there be a share place in the frac markets and a new pricing floor, given the fact that there are significant excess capacity in the market, and also, when the guar leaf comes, is this going to be another source of market share place. And then the third question in my mind is in terms of how North America, overall, is going to perform, what are really the normalized frac margins. The way I see it or we see it, the frac market in North America today is largely a commodity market with a very low barrier to entry, where capacity is really driving the pricing. And we peaked at around 30% margins, and the trough is now in low single digits. And I would say, in my mind, that the normalized margins are more in the middle of this. They're certainly not towards the upside. So I think these 3 elements, obviously, are going to be important to sort of guide us in how the North America market is going to continue to evolve. But I would say I'm very optimistic, though, in terms of our ability to outperform on a relative basis in North America.","Operator","We'll go to the line of James West with Barclays.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Paal, as we think about 2013, I want to dig in a little more on Dave's earlier question. Given the large number of startups and staging for contracts, it's underway now, which I guess, first off, makes your margins look even more impressive, but there's a lot of work that's been awarded to yourself and the industry that's getting underway now. That should lead to significant growth in '13. I'm talking more on the international side, of course. Do you see international growth in '13 consistent with '12, or could it be above or below?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think in terms of the activity, like our outlook for international, it's still a little bit early to kind of pin it down in detail, right? We are just entering our planning process, and our customers are doing the same thing here. So I would just say that we maintain a positive view in international markets. We see growth in 2013, and I think the rate of growth, I think, is going to be much clearer by year end. But again, we have not seen any major shift in customer sentiments over the past quarter. So unless there's a dramatic change in their view of the market and their spend at the commodity planning cycle, we are optimistic that it's going to be more of the same for next year.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then on seismic, which has been an area of strength this year. It seems like the fourth quarter is mostly -- or close to sold out at this point on the marine side, and that would set up for a good 2013. Are you continuing to see good pricing gains on the Seismic side? And am I correct that the fourth quarter is mostly sold out, that that should lead to a very strong '13?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. I think that's correct. Q4 is more or less booked, as you say, largely driven by South Atlantic activity, both West Africa and, for us, Uruguay. So our view hasn't changed. We were indicating that we didn't think that Q4 would see the normal seasonal low, and that's actually transpiring. So going forward, we continue to test pricing for 2013 work. We already awarded some work for the next North Sea season, and the pricing is even up from what we have bid earlier, right? We are now pushing about 15% versus the 10% that we talked about earlier. So overall, we maintain quite positive view on the seismic market.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Scott Gruber with Sanford Bernstein.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Simon, a question for you on initial CapEx thoughts for '13. Baker's come out and guided for a big 25% reduction. Halliburton was out earlier, guiding for a decline as well. Are you anticipating a reduction in spending levels next year?","Simon Ayat","Paal just mentioned that we're going to -- we're going through the planning cycle. And I'm going to turn it over to Paal to tell you what the initial numbers that are coming, but we are going through a planning cycle as we speak. And there is a bit of shift between activity places that might require additional CapEx. But Paal have a little bit input now at the early stage?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. So firstly, 2012 CapEx spend is going to be around $4.5 billion, as we said, which is in line with the plan that we previously communicated. The main shift we've seen during this year, going back to what we were planning at the beginning of the year, is that we have significantly reduced NAM CapEx, and this has been offset by higher international CapEx. So as Simon was saying, the 2013 CapEx spend outlook, it's still early days. We are just starting in the planning cycle now. But I would say as a general view, at this stage, I would say CapEx would be likely flat to slightly down. The main drivers or the main focus for us in 2013 is going to be the international market, and it's going to be a traditional high-capital service segments, like WesternGeco, Wireline, Drilling & Measurements and Well Testing. Now while we continue to inject capital into these businesses, we also continued to drive efficiency and utilization for all of them to make sure that we can be as lean as possible with how we spend our cash, right? The other key thing for us next year in terms of CapEx is that we are -- we're also continuing to invest further in infrastructure, in particular in Sub-Sahara Africa and also in the Far East, in particular in China. And the last part as well, as I mentioned, we're looking to further expand our smaller product lines into the international market, and there is some associated CapEx with that. But overall, I would say, at this stage, CapEx is likely to be flat or slightly down.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And if I stood back and think about the broader environment, thinking not just about '13 but into '14, are we entering a period of declining capital intensity now that the big spend on U.S. pumping is over? I've realized there's still roofline investment going on abroad, but sounds like that's going to be flattish, maybe down, relative to this year. And it looks like, too, that the big spend on international shale operation is still a few years off. So if you look at CapEx relative to sales or cash flow, do you anticipate, potentially, a few years of declining capital intensity?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I wouldn't stretch it further than 2013 in the comments that I made. But I think your commentary around investment into pressure pumping capacity, I think those are fair. We have enough pressure pumping capacity at this stage to go around for a while, right, and, I think, so does the overall market. And you're also right in saying that the volume of international unconventional activity is not likely to sky rocket very -- anytime soon. With that said though, the investment into our high-end service line, such as WesternGeco, Wireline and Drilling & Measurements, in particular, for deepwater and exploration type of activities, there's lot of CapEx that goes with these activities. And the returns, both in the capital and the return on sales, is obviously very good to that. So if the market is there, we will happily invest into those businesses and as long as we get the right returns.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","But the investment in Seismic is primarily technology, not vessel spend right now, correct?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, we have 2 vessels under construction, which will be delivered in 2014, where a significant part of the CapEx associated with those vessels will be taken in 2013. Also, as we continue to ramp up the coverage of IsoMetrix on our seismic vessels, that will also be a significant CapEx spend, right? So the Seismic over the next couple of years will be a significant CapEx spend for us, provided the market continues to head in the direction we see now.","Operator","The next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Back to the international outlook for a second and recognizing the fact that, as you mentioned, the outlook for '13 should begin to crystallize much better towards year end, but it doesn't -- it's not all that obvious to me that the IOCs, even with very generous oil prices, are generating significantly abundant cash flows, surplus cash flows, which leads to the same rate of growth that we saw this past year. I'm curious as to how -- just conceptually, how growth rates in '13 could match 2012 if the cash flow generation is going to be less generous. And then -- I mean, is the swing factor the NOCs, the greater sense of urgency on the part of Petrobras, more catharsis in West Africa, greater uplift in Saudi? How do we match those growth rates year-over-year?","Paal Kibsgaard","Sorry. First of all, I'm not saying we would match the growth rates. I'm just saying that we maintain a positive outlook on the international market, and we see growth in 2013 as well, right? So it is still -- typically, we don't even talk a lot about the coming year and the -- after Q3, we typically leave that to January. But like I said, we are -- we maintain a positive view on next year. I think it's probably better to look at -- so maybe you can switch from activity and revenue to earnings, right? And I would just say that we obviously continue our focus on growing total earnings, and that's through both the top line and margins. And I would say that assuming no major negative change in the global economy and no further setbacks and a second lag down in North America, we are, at this stage, aiming for double-digit EPS growth in '13, right? And that would be a combination of top line growth, as well as margin improvement. So I think it's too early to kind of break it down to look at what the IOCs and the independence and the NOCs are going to spend next year, because we really don't have the data. But we are aiming for double-digit EPS growth in 2013.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then secondly, with regard to sort of coming back to the near term here. You mentioned you're not going to witness the same seasonality with regard to the contract business, thanks to good bookings in the South Atlantic margin. Do you have a window into the outlook for year-end multiclient sales at this stage in the Gulf of Mexico?","Paal Kibsgaard","No, not really, other than that there is a lease round in November in the western Gulf and there is another one, what, in March in the Central Gulf. Typically, the way the fourth quarter goes when it comes to multiclient sales, it's down to the last week of December when we finalized the last major sales, right? So it's difficult to say what it's going to end up on. But I would just say that in North America or in Gulf of Mexico, there is a lot of positive sentiments around the outlook for the Gulf of Mexico. Drilling rigs continue to rise. We will be at pre-Macondo levels by the end of the year. The lease rounds that are announced, I think, is a positive. So we maintain a positive view on the business there, overall. So I would expect there would be a good multiclient sales in Gulf of Mexico in Q4, but it's going to come down to the last week of December.","Operator","Next question is from Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil.","William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Paal, I was just curious if you could talk a little bit more about Canada longer term here. By our math, it probably is still north of 10% of your North America revenue stream. And I think what we found there's been some conjecture on whether or not this lower rig count has been more transitory here as opposed to something structural changing within the Canadian market. As we look out to next year, I know you mentioned earlier that you're aggressive in rightsizing your North American operations. But as you see Canada going forward here, do you feel like you're profitably rightsized for how you see the longer-term activity there in that market? Or do you think the industry, as a whole, is frankly probably overcommitted to that market at this time?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think we were a bit surprised when we looked at the -- when we saw the recovery in the rig count over the past quarter. We were expecting it to be pretty much in line with last year, right? Now this is a combination of high gas storage levels, as well as weather and structural conditions, right. So like I said before, we're expecting growth again for Q4 and Q1, but the activity levels are going to be well below last year. With that said, I think, overall, Canada they have a lot of resources, both on conventional gas liquids as well as heavy oil. So there will be a lot of activity, I think, in Canada going forward. We have, in my mind, a good setup there, and we will continue to invest into it as the market evolves. Where we probably have more opportunity going forward is in the heavy oil, which I think we are less represented than we are, for instance, in the shales and on the -- in Eastern Canada. But overall, the -- we maintain a positive view on Canada.","William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So as you see it going forward, you're rightsized properly for that -- for the activity levels you forecast and actually be looking maybe to put some incremental services in there?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes that's correct.","William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","My follow-up would be just -- as we think about international just near term, is there anything, Paal, that would alter the view of kind of what we saw in 4Q as we think about the seasonal uptick that you typically get in your business from your own product sales and the like, that fourth quarter revenue growth, internationally, should be pretty strong here as we look to 4Q?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. No, we don't see anything largely different than what we would expect in previous years. So there's typically an uptick in fourth quarter sales, both linked to software and, say, hardware completions sales, as well as multiclient. So there's always some variation and uncertainty what happens with respect to those sales. But overall, we expect that to occur again this year.","William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Because as I look at fourth quarter '11, you were up high single digits in Eastern Hemisphere, third to fourth quarter, that's probably not unreasonable to think about for 4Q this year?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I haven't looked at the numbers. But I would say that a similar type of uptick as we saw last year is not unreasonable to expect.","Operator","We'll go to line of Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Paal, I wanted to follow up on some comments that you made back at the last Analyst Meeting in Boston with respect to the supply chain and procurement initiatives. Can you give us a progress update as to how far along you are vis-a-vis those targets and perhaps some indication of the impact that that's had on the P&L thus far? I know it's a big part of the execution program, but focusing more on the cost side of the equation as opposed to execution on the field.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. So I think if you split it into quality and efficiency, I would say the quality part, we have worked on now since 2008, 2009, and it's starting to have a meaningful impact in terms of the overall reliability of our services, right? And that's -- you see that, in particular, in a segment like Drilling & Measurements. So that is part of why I believe we are superior when it comes to execution strength from a quality standpoint. Now the other parts that I referred to over the last quarter was more linked to the efficiency side, and this has much more to do with the internal things like asset utilization, transportation, shared services and this type of things. I would say we are much -- in a much earlier stage of capitalizing all those benefits. You always get some lower hanging fruit as you start focusing in on things. But these programs are multiyear, and we will see gradually fruits of them coming forth in the coming years.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you remind us of what the targets are for that program.","Paal Kibsgaard","I -- we have targets but I haven't shared the targets, and I don't intend to share them.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. The other question I had was with respect to the shale workflow. As we're moving from a horsepower-driven market, everybody's trying to differentiate themselves, and one of the common terms that we've heard just in the last few months has been around the notion of workflow. Can you address the competitive advantages you -- that you think that Schlumberger has in -- with respect to workflow?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. We've been talking about workflow now for a couple of years. So, I find it interesting to see that the broader industry is now taking up the concept and also want to take part in it, right? So the advantages we have is starting off with Reservoir Characterization and our ability to basically establish 3-dimensional models that can predict variation in shale quality, similar to what we can do in conventional reservoirs. Now when you have that capability, you can, firstly, place your wells in the right position aerially. And secondly, when you evaluate the quality of the rock in the horizontal section, you can also complete the parts of the horizontal section which is most likely to actual flow. Today, there's a significant part of the horizontal section that are frac-ed that never actually flows anything, which means that the frac itself was probably a waste. And then the last part also has to do with how you frac these wells. Today, we create a very deep fracture network, and we only are able to prop a small part of it, which means that all the horsepower and the water that you use to create a deeper fracture is also a waste, right? So I would say that we have a very clear view on where the waste in the current process is, and we have technologies and workflows that can help our customers address these. We see a further uptake of these technologies and these workflows in North America. And for the projects that we are involved in internationally, which are more exploration or appraisal focused, we always use these workflows overseas.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","If you had to sort of gauge growth internationally versus, say, penetration of the workflow domestically, which would grow faster do you think?","Paal Kibsgaard","I -- it's difficult to say. I would say, in the international market, the two markets that I would say would have the most meaningful activity growth in the coming couple of years would be Argentina and China. And it's interesting to see now that YPF seems to be quite eager to pursue the Vaca Muerta shale in Argentina. So there's a fair bit of rig activity moving into the Vaca Muerta. And I think in that sense, we are a lot more optimistic on the activity outlook for Argentina, at this stage, than maybe what we were one quarter ago. And you also seen some of the moves we have been making in China recently, and that's again at the back end of our view that China also will see a good growth in both tight gas and shale gas going forward, right? So to what extent that is going to generate growth versus the penetration in North America? I think it's a bit of a toss-up. But I would say more and more customers in North America are interested in the shale workflow and the associated technologies that we have to go with it.","Operator","Next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS.","Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Paal, you recently made some very positive comments regarding the clearly attractive subsea markets, and certainly, I understand you maybe in the early stages of looking at opportunities. But 2 questions. Would potentially a JV or an alliance with the subsea production company make sense around the now wholly owned Framo business? And two, given that you do now own Framo outright, would you consider bidding directly on subsea separation opportunities in the offshore market?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. When it comes to, generally, how we -- what we will do in the subsea market going forward, that's something that we're still evaluating, right? So I wouldn't provide any specific comments on any plans that we may or may not have in terms of how we address the market going forward. What I wanted to do when I put subsea on the agenda earlier this quarter was just to indicate our view on what the opportunity in subsea is. And a lot of the opportunity evolves around the fact that the recovery rates are, on average, half for subsea developments compared to what conventional topside developments are. And if you look at the capabilities we are -- we have in terms of subsurface understanding, modeling and prediction, the ESPs, the intelligent well completions and Framo, as you rightly point out, we have a lot of the ingredients that can help drive recovery from these type of developments, right? So would we bid directly or independently on processing projects? We would have to look at how big they were and how we potentially could align ourselves with other players that have some of the capabilities and some of the, I would say, technologies that also needs to go into that project, right? But we are undertaking a number of significant projects with Framo already, some of them we highlight in the press releases that we send out every quarter. And I would just say that Framo, as it is today, is one of our fastest-growing product lines, and they are at the cutting edge of technology. So as it is today, we are very pleased with how it\u2019s performing.","Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","No, fair enough. Great business. And then as a follow-up or a separate question, thoughts on Mexico and Russia for 2013, both of them appear that they could be a bit stronger with new opportunities, specifically in Mexico, and what type of opportunities do you see next year in both areas.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. As we started with Mexico, I would say that we have quite a positive activity outlook on Mexico, driven by both land and offshore, and offshore both shallow water and deepwater. The deepwater Gulf of Mexico activity for PEMEX continues, and we have a significant presence on that. There is also continued focus on mature fields in Mexico and a potential for more SPM activity. And there's also now more focus, again, on the shales in the north region as well from the PEMEX side. So I would say that the overall view on Mexico is quite positive for us going into 2013. When it comes to Russia, quite similar, also positive. We expect to see, again, continued growth in Western Siberia, where we have a very strong position through our local presence there, and then you'll have continued exploration activity, for instance, in the Baltic and the Bering Sea. And we also see very solid activity for Sakhalin and the Caspian regions. So you're right to point out Mexico and Russia as positives going into 2013.","Operator","We'll move on to line of Brad Handler with Jefferies & Company.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Let's see, maybe you can speak a little bit, guys, to SPM. You just touched on it with Mexico, I know. But can you give us a sense as to perhaps the run rate in the third quarter, how that compares to where it was a year ago or a couple of years ago on the top line?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. We don't disclose those details on other than -- we have -- if you look at the number of projects that we have won and are in the process of taking on at this stage, we are, I would say, significantly up in terms of overall activity and also, overall, the number of barrels that we actually manage, right? So a lot of the contract wins that we've had have been in Latin America. The Shushufindi project is the -- probably the biggest project that we've ever taken on, and the ramp-up has now been completed. We're operating 5 rigs in this project, and we are pretty much on track for the work program and the -- for the production profile that we laid out to achieve. The other project is in the Carrizo project in Mexico, where, again, we are just in the process of mobilizing now or are more or less finished and we are starting to mobilize for Panuco. So overall, I can't give you the exact number for revenue or for production. But we split SPM out from IPM about a year ago, and we did that to put a lot more focus onto these production incentive contracts because it is a differentiated growth opportunity for us, given the capabilities we have here. And also, the margins for this type of business is highly accretive to the overall margins of the company, and that's why we are continuing to pursue them. Now the overall sales process for this type of project is quite long. There's a lot of due diligence work needed to go in. And I would say that we are not -- we're not accepting every opportunity. If we're not satisfied with certain elements of how these contracts are set up, we will turn them down. And we have turned down contracts, even recently, that we decided were not good enough for us. So this is all about portfolio management and risk management, and we will take our time in terms of how we grow the business. But there's a lot of opportunities out there, and we will continue to pursue them.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","You anticipated a couple of follow-on questions anyway, but I'll sneak in another one in the same area.","Paal Kibsgaard","Sure.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","The -- maybe you can give us some sense of the degree to which, as it sits today, with what you won? There is a performance kicker tied to SPM. Or how integral is that to your selling process? Do all of them have performance bonuses, presumably based on production increases and the like?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. All the SPM projects are performance based. If it's only turnkey drilling or normal contracts, we don't classify them under the SPM product line. So this is where we are typically paid on a fee per barrel. So we will invest the value of our products and services. We will agree a decline curve with our customer. And the production that we will generate through our investments on top of that decline curve, we will get a certain fee per barrel for. And that's, overall, how we are paid. And that's why, generally, this will generate cash for our customers, and there are ways -- this is a way for them to unlock maybe aging assets that is not really a priority for them to spend their cash on. And then that's why this is quite a good business model. Now in terms of how this will be a growth avenue for us going forward, it's still a relatively small part of our business. But again we continue to focus on it, and we will continue to grow it in a -- I would say, in a somewhat conservative way.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. Is it -- do you think it's relatively less or more capital intensive than the balance of your business? Simon, have you looked at it specifically that way?","Simon Ayat","No. The capital associated with SPM project is not more than our regular business. What is more than our regular business is sometimes you have investments upfront, and this is part of the overall evaluation of the project and how we will -- how much is the cash flow required upfront and the investment. And the investment is not in CapEx, the investment in services that are spent ahead of time in anticipation of the uptick in the production and, therefore, the additional revenue that we'll generate. We are very conservative on how we will account for these projects, and there is a regular evaluation of the potential of the additional revenue and additional production that will basically compensate for the initial investment.","Operator","The next question is from Jim Crandell with Dahlman Rose.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Paal, I think in your remarks you talked about new Wireline tool introductions in the quarter. And your largest competitor also talked about that this morning, and theirs was focused very much on the deepwater, and then in return, and they mentioned the Gulf of Mexico. Can you talk a little bit about what your new Wireline tools are that you're introducing and what market they're earmarked for?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, the -- if you look at the 2 latest that we have introduced, is the Dielectric Scanner and Litho Scanner, is all part of the scanner family. So the Dielectric Scanner is focused in on formation evaluation in carbonates and heavy oils and mixed salinity. So these are special type of measurements with relatively broad applications, as you see, right? And the Litho Scanner is, again, a formation evaluation measurement linked to shale, which gives you shale composition and also total organic content, right? So what we are trying to do on the formation evaluation side in Wireline, at this stage, is to focus in on these, I would say, complex reservoirs or unconventional reservoirs in terms of formation evaluation, both in terms of fluid determination as well as the composition of the rock. So those are the 2, I would say, latest and 2 main introductions that we've done recently.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And as a follow-on, if the domestic rig count, domestic meaning U.S. land rig count, were to fall by another 10%, would you consider Wireline or LWD prices to be at risk of going down under that scenario?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. I think if the overall North America land rig count was to drop by 10%, I think I would be concerned about the ability to hold pricing on the other services on land, that being Drilling or Wireline, right? Like I said, we're already seeing some early signs of weakness in coiled tubing. Whether that is going to continue or it's more of a Q3-Q4 effect, which will bounce back next year, it's too early to say. But it's really the first product line that we have seen pressuring so far. The other ones are holding. But you're right to point out that if the rig count was to go down, overall, further, then I think there might start to be pressure on the others. We haven't seen anything yet, but that is something that I would probably worry about.","Operator","We have time for one final question from the line of Jud Bailey with ISI Group.","Judson E. Bailey - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about a couple of markets. Paal, you mentioned in your prepared comments some of the work you're doing in China. And I was wondering if you could give us a little more color just on that market, how we should think about it in terms of growth opportunity and what kind of product lines you're utilizing the most?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. So the -- what's happened in the China market recently is that there's a lot of drive, I think, from the government to develop the unconventionals, both the tight gas as well as the shale gas. They're importing LNG at very high prices, and they have a significant unconventional gas resource in the country, which they are very keen to develop. So tight gas remains the main focus of the 3 main Chinese national oil companies. But shale gas, the government has classified not as hydrocarbon but as a mineral. And when it's classified as a mineral, the -- it is basically open for any other company to bid for licenses and actually go ahead and do work. So there's a lot of interest from other type of companies, whether it's utility, coal companies or just private equity companies, to come in and take licenses in shale and to start developing them. Now a very few of these have any capabilities when it comes to reservoir evaluation or actual well-side execution when it comes to these things. They don't have their own service companies, which the 3 main Chinese companies have. So that's the opportunity for us to have significantly more penetration of the shale market in China as it evolves going forward. And this is, again, why we have made some of these moves in terms of joint ventures. So the joint venture with Chongqing is linked at the reservoir evaluation standpoint, while the joint venture we signed this quarter with Anton Oil is more focused on IPM activities around well construction and frac-ing of these shale gas wells. So there's a reservoir aspect to it, and there is the full portfolio of drilling and production-related activities that goes with it as well.","Judson E. Bailey - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's interesting. And would you say the better opportunity is it market penetration? Or just the growth of the overall market itself?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think it's actually both. In the past, we've had limited penetration because the state oil companies have their own service arms. We do some of the high-end activities for them. We help them out with certain things. But there's a lot more opportunity in the shale now for these other players to do a much more significant part of the work, so I think that's where the opportunity lies.","Judson E. Bailey - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. And my last question is just on Brazil. They've taken -- Petrobras has taken delivery to lot of deepwater rigs the last year or so. They're going to get more active in some of their presalt development, but another initiative of Petrobras is trying to stem some of the production declines at -- in Campos. And I just wondered -- I was curious if you could share your view on that market and the opportunities for growth, and to what extent you may be talking to Petrobras on some of their production issues.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. I would say that, just in general, the -- we maintain a positive view on Brazil. There has been delays in terms of rig startups, rig arrivals during this year and also when Petrobras turned some of the -- their deepwater capacity towards production. That obviously impacts our drilling rate and product lines as well, right? But they are putting priority on, like you say, stemming the decline and getting production back up again, so that makes sense. And we will work with them in whatever capacity we need to, to help them out with that. But overall, Brazil is going to show good growth going forward. There are probably going to be some bumps along the way, but we are there. We have a very strong presence. We have a very good relationship with Petrobras, and we'll work with them the way they want us to.","Malcolm Theobald","On behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I'd like to thank you for participating in today's call.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Malcolm Theobald, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Malcolm Theobald","Thank you, Julie. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Results Conference Call. Joining us on the call today are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results, and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.","However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the Frequently Asked Questions document, which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Simon.","Simon Ayat","Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.08. This is flat sequentially and $0.02 lower when compared to the same quarter last year.","As a reminder, all the prior year amounts have been restated as the Distribution segment has been reclassified to discontinued operations following the sales of Wilson and CE Franklin in the second and third quarters of this year.","During the quarter, we recorded $0.04 of integration charges and $0.02 of charges relating to workforce reductions in connection with an initiative to rationalize global overhead costs. The Smith integration charges was a little larger than our historical run rate due to the fact that we incurred a number of agency terminations and facility exit costs during the quarter.","Going forward, we do not intend to highlight these integration costs separately as they are not anticipated to be significant.","Fourth quarter revenue of $11.2 billion increased 5.3% sequentially. Of this $567 million sequential increase, approximately half of this growth came from the year-end surge in product, software and WesternGeco multiclient sales that we typically experience in Q4.","Oilfield Services' pretax income of $2.2 billion increased 1% sequentially. Pretax operating margins were down 83 basis points, as the positive effects of year-end product sales were not enough to overcome the impact of the higher-than-usual seasonal slowdowns in activity and contractual delays experienced during the quarter.","Sequential revenue and pretax margin highlights by product group were as follows. Fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization Group revenue of $3.2 billion increased 8.2% sequentially, and margins improved 31 basis points to 29.1%. These increases were largely driven by the traditionally strong end-of-year software and market client sales, offset in part by the impact of lower WesternGeco marine vessel utilization.","It is also worth mentioning that Testing Services, Wireline and PetroTechnical Services all experienced sequential margin growth as a result of more favorable revenue mix.","Drilling Group fourth quarter revenue of $4.1 billion increased 2.2%, while margin declined by 128 basis points to 16.8%. The revenue increase was largely attributable to robust drilling and measurement activity in the Middle East & Asia Area, and the strong performance from M-I SWACO in the Europe\/CIS\/Africa Area.","The margin decline was primarily due to contractual delays in IPM and an overall less favorable revenue mix. Fourth quarter Production Group revenue of $3.9 billion increased 6.8% sequentially as the result of strong completion Artificial Lift product sales across all areas combined with the new Framo subsea projects.","Pretax margin was essentially flat at 15%, as the impact of the strong Completions, Artificial Lift, and Framo performances were largely offset by continued pricing pressure in U.S. land as a result of excess hydraulic horsepower capacity in the market.","From a geographical perspective, North America margin improved by 65 basis points to 19.2%, while international margin declined 104 basis points to 20.5%.","Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 23.8% in the fourth quarter, compared to 23.6% in the previous quarter. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $5.1 billion, representing a $1.1 billion improvement as compared to the end of the third quarter. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.5 billion of CapEx and an improvement in working capital of approximately $850 million.","Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a 13.6% increase in our annual dividend to $1.25 per share. This follows last year's 10% increase and the 19% increase in 2011 and reflects our commitment to generate and return excess cash to our shareholders. During the full year 2012, we repurchased 14.1 million shares at an average price of $68.99 for a total of $972 million.","We did not repurchase any stock during the fourth quarter as our buyback activity for the first 9 months of the year more than offset the dilution caused by our stock-based compensation programs during all of 2012.","CapEx is expected to be approximately $3.9 billion in 2013 as compared to the $4.7 billion we spent in 2012, which included an acceleration of part of the first quarter of 2013 CapEx.","And now, I turn the conference over to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Simon. Our fourth quarter results showed continued growth in key markets in addition to the typical year-end products, software and multiclient sales. However, while revenue grew sequentially by 5% to set a new record for the company, pretax operating margin slipped by 83 basis points, and I will elaborate on this as I review the operational results by region.","Looking at the international markets, revenue grew by 6% sequentially, while margins were down 104 basis points from the 3-year high of last quarter. Overall service activity and product sales were strong during the quarter. However, results were impacted by the previously stated seasonal slowdown and contractual delays and also mobilization costs for several new projects.","International service capacity remained tight in our Seismic, Drilling & Measurements, Wireline and Well Testing product lines, while pricing in terms of revenue per rig continued its slow but steady progression during the fourth quarter driven by strong execution, new technology sales and proactive bidding on small to medium-sized contracts.","In Latin America, revenue was up 11% sequentially, and margins up 30 basis points, driven by strong activity throughout the region. In Mexico, rig activity grew both offshore and on land, with additional coiled tubing and stimulation work focused on unconventionals, as well as a full deepwater well testing program.","Activity in our IPM projects remained robust, and the ramp up in our Carrizo and Panuco SPM projects continued according to plan.","In Brazil, we saw strong sequential growth, driven by our Seismic and Well Testing product lines, while overall offshore activity continue to shift from deepwater exploration in the Santos Basin towards development and production enhancement work in the Campos basin.","In Argentina, activity also picked up during the quarter, driven by drilling and stimulation activity in the Neuquen basin and from the start up of a new IPM project in the Vaca Muerta shale.","In Venezuela, we have, in recent years, actively managed our activity levels relative to our receivables balance. During the fourth quarter, we saw a significant slowdown in the rates of payments, and we are currently working closely with our customer to resolve the situation.","In the Middle East & Asia, revenue grew by 10% sequentially, while margins were down 91 basis points, driven by activity mix and startup costs for several IPM projects in the region.","During the quarter, we saw the strongest growth in the Middle East, where activity on both land and offshore in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates led to record revenue levels in these countries.","In Iraq, revenue grew over 60% sequentially, also reaching an all-time high, as we started off the remaining rigs, leading to our recent IPM contract wins. Operational execution continues to be strong on our well construction project in Iraq, however, delays in obtaining the needed regulatory approvals impacted startup timing for several projects and consequently, profitability for the quarter.","China again posted strong results, with the seasonal slowdown on land being more than offset by activity growth offshore in Bohai Bay and the South China Sea. The focus on unconventionals in China remains very strong. And based on the strategic moves we made in 2012, we are well-positioned to capitalize on this growth opportunity going forward.","And in Australia, we continue to grow on the fourth quarter as rig activity ramped up further in our IPM project in the Queensland coalbed methane and also due to strong offshore drilling activity in the Northwest.","In Europe\/CIS\/Africa, revenue was down 1% sequentially and margins were down 203 basis points.","In the North Sea, we saw the start of the seasonal slowdown, in particular, for seismic activity, which had a significant impact on the sequential results. However, we maintain a positive outlook on the North Sea for 2013, driven by both exploration and development activity in Norway and the U.K.","In North Africa, further contractual delays also had an impact on fourth quarter results. While these delays continued into January, we expect the situation to be resolved during the first quarter.","Sub-Saharan Africa had a good quarter on offshore activity in both West and East Africa. Looking at 2013, the outlook for the region remained strong, driven by East Africa exploration, Angola pre-salt activity and Gulf of Guinea exploration and development work.","Russia and Central Asia saw flat sequential activity driven by the start of the seasonal winter slowdown both on land and offshore. However, we see solid growth in the coming year both in Western Siberia, the Caspian region and in Sakhalin, and the first arctic project is also expected to start up in the second quarter.","In North America, sequential revenue was up 4% and margins were up 65 basis points, driven by very strong performance in the Gulf of Mexico.","In North America land, our results were again negatively impacted by lower-than-expected activity in Canada and by an 8% sequential drop in the U.S. land rig count.","In our hydraulic fracturing business, the lower pricing levels continued to penetrate our contract base and further impacted margins in the fourth quarter. In addition, with the drop in liquids activity, we also saw clear signs of pricing weakness in our drilling, coiled tubing and cased hole wireline product lines during the quarter.","Still, the continued weakening of North America land margins was more than offset by strong activity and excellent performance in the Gulf of Mexico, where deepwater drilling activity reached pre-Macondo levels, as expected.","In WesternGeco, we continue to operate 1 dual coil fleet in the Central Gulf, while multiclient sales saw the normal year-end increase driven by the Central Gulf lease sales scheduled for March of this year. Overall, our strong operational and market share position in the Gulf of Mexico is becoming increasingly accretive to our North American margins.","Let me now turn to some of the technology highlights for the quarter. In the Reservoir Characterization Group, WesternGeco completed the first IsoMetrix season, which included 3 commercial projects. IsoMetrix results were presented at the SEG Annual Conference in November 2012, and the technology continues to attract a great deal of attention as exploration of difficult and complex reservoir prospects continues.","The first Explorer Class vessel upgrade through IsoMetrix, the WesternGeco Vespucci, is currently under way and 2 IsoMetrix vessels will be available in 2013. In December 2011, we announced the purchase of the U.S. company ThruBit, which offers a cons down [ph] open hole logging suite that enables wiper trip logging of horizontal wells. In 2012, ThruBit saw a rapidly growing client base and a 93% increase in revenue. Recently, the technology has been successfully applied in the Bakken to optimize the stimulation design in the horizontal sections, helping to improve productivity and to reduce costs.","In the Drilling Group, our Drilling & Measurements product line saw increased offtake of the NeoScope sourceless formation evaluation service. This technology offers a comprehensive suite of 12 formation evaluation measurements while eliminating the need for the traditional source and thereby reducing operational risks.","The offtake has been widespread, covering North American shale plays, Japanese methane hydrates, conventional reservoirs in the Middle and Far East and remote deepwater exploration work offshore South America.","In the Production Group, Well Services introduced the SPARK frac-through delivery platform in 2012, offering our vertically integrated customers access to Schlumberger's engineered fluid systems, such as HiWAY, while utilizing their own personnel and hydraulic horsepower.","The offtake of the new offering progressed well during 2012, with over 1,100 stages sold through a growing customer base in both the U.S. and China, and we expect continued growth for this offering in 2013.","Also in the quarter, we announced the creation of OneSubsea, a joint venture with Cameron to manufacture and develop products, systems and services for the subsea oil and gas market. This market represents a unique opportunity for growth, as the new joint venture seeks to create a step change in the reservoir recovery through integration and optimization of the entire production system over the life of the field.","The integration of the production system will be accomplished by combining superior reservoir knowledge and wellbore capabilities with industry-leading subsea technologies, altogether delivering enhanced productivity, reliability and integrity. We anticipate closing the transaction during the first quarter of this year.","Let's now turn to the macro environment, where there continues to be uncertainty. However, GDP growth outlook for 2013 remains in line with the previous quarter at the back of positive data points from China and the U.S. and a more or less unchanged situation in the Eurozone.","Looking at the global oil market, 2013 demand is expected to grow at similar levels with 2012, excluding any major macroeconomic changes. The supply side will see further growth in North America, while the rest of non-OPEC production will likely continue to face challenges, leading to a fairly similar coal and OPEC production in 2013.","Based on this, we do not see any major change in the global spare capacity in the coming year, and we expect Brent prices to remain in a broadly similar price band as seen in 2012.","In the international gas markets, LNG prices in Asia are expected to continue to benefit from high demand in Japan and China, while in Europe, the impact of lower demand is expected to be offset by decline in domestic production, leaving the market balance relatively unchanged.","Looking at our industry, there have been no material changes to overall customer activity plans or sentiments during the quarter, and we expect international E&P spend to grow around 10% in the coming year. Based on a favorable activity mix and continued focus on execution, we expect to grow our international operating income in excess of this number in 2013.","In North America, we see continued market uncertainty going forward. U.S. land liquids activity is expected to recover somewhat in the first half of the year. But for the full year, we see U.S. land rig count slightly down versus 2012. U.S. natural gas production remains strong, and at this stage, we do not see a significant recovery in dry gas-related drilling activity in the coming year.","Based on this, the industry will still be faced with oversupply of hydraulic horsepower. In addition, the lower rig activity in the fourth quarter has already created pricing pressure in many of the non-pressure pumping product lines in U.S. land, which will create further pressure on North America land margins moving forward.","So in summary, we expect the overall market trends of 2012 to carry forward into 2013, with solid growth in international spending and strong activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, with the offsetting factor being continued challenges in North America land. In this environment, our well-balanced business portfolio, wide geographical footprint and strong operational execution capabilities position us well to capitalize on these trends and to continue to show good growth in overall earnings per share.","Thank you very much. I will now hand the call over to Malcolm for the Q&A session.","Malcolm Theobald","Thank you, Paal. We'll now open the call for questions. Julie?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of James West with Barclays Capital.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So clearly, another good move higher this quarter for international volumes, but a little margin slippage, as you highlighted. It seems to me the contract delays, the startup costs, this is all pretty transitory. Is that accurate? And if so, take out the seasonal factors, I guess, for a second, when do those type of startup costs and delays, when do those abate, or have they already abated at this point?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I agree with you, the impact we saw in profitability in Q4 is down to mix some of these transitory delays and the seasonal slowdown, as you're referring to. So most of these issues are more or less behind us in terms of what was unusual for Q4. We will continue to see the normal seasonal slowdown in the North Sea, Russia and China land in Q1. And the only other lingering issue we have is the contractual situation in North Africa. But overall, the issues that were exceptional in Q4 are more or less behind us.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, good to hear. And then, we obviously agree with your international E&P spending outlook for this year. What do you see as the biggest growth areas for Schlumberger this year, and are there any markets that you think could be particularly challenging as well, excluding North America land?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, if I look at international, next year, we will see the most significant growth in ECA and MEA. We will also see growth in Latin America. But the overall activity levels in Brazil is more or less flat year-over-year, so that will have an impact on Latin America growth. But if I look at ECA, we see significant growth, overall, in Sub-Saharan Africa, where we have a very strong position. And we also see quite significant growth in Russia. So I would say, ECA, the main growth locomotives next year will be Sub-Saharan Africa, and overall, Russia, both land and offshore. And then in MEA, I would say overall, the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, but also Kuwait, U.A.E., Oman, will all be very strong for us. And in Asia, it's predominantly China and Australia which is going to be driving growth.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to maybe hit you up on the North American front. And I know that there's still quite a bit of uncertainty on the U.S. land, but I think the indications are that there's going to be a pickup in some time here in the first quarter. So with the pickup in activity on the horizon, wouldn't it be safe to assume that margins would pretty much hit their low points in aggregate for North America land in the first quarter? And if not, can you just kind of walk us through how you see things evolving?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I'm not ready to predict exactly why North America land margins are going soft. There is one new element of uncertainty this quarter, which is further pricing pressure outside of hydraulic fracturing, right? But if you look at our view on 2013 for North America, we do expect the U.S. land rig count to be up between about 100 and 150 rigs in Q1, and this is based on the feedback from our customers. So that's in line with what you're indicating. Now in terms of activity for the full year, we still see U.S. land rig count slightly down versus 2012, while the well count will be slightly up. Now if you look at Canada, the rig count is already over 500 so far in January. But we still see the full year also being down in 2012 versus -- sorry, down versus 2012. Now then the other major uncertainty in North America land is pricing. So it seems clear that we will continue to face oversupply of horsepower given the rig count outlook. So we don't really see any significant recovery in hydraulic fracturing pricing in the coming year. And then you have the ongoing uncertainty where we saw about a 5% pricing drop on average in the other product lines on land in Q4. And this is going to have an impact going forward. But I would say, at this stage, the further evolution is not clear. And I think it's going to be a function of how quickly the rig count climbs back up going forward, right? So I would say that in North America land, there will continue to be margin challenges in, at least, in the coming 2 quarters as far as I see it.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Now as a follow-up -- thanks for that. As a follow-up, obviously, the Gulf of Mexico has kind of been a positive dynamic. Can you give us some indications of what you might expect for maybe revenue growth in the Gulf of Mexico year-on-year? And is that all going to be driven by this -- the Oilfield Services product line? Or is there going to be some combination of Seismic and services?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, we expect both drilling-related activities as well as Seismic to be strong in the Gulf of Mexico for this year. If you look at the rig activity, we don't see any major rig additions in H1 after we had the surge of, I think, 7 additional rigs in Q4. But I mean, overall, rig activity year-over-year will be up more than 20% with that Q4 addition. In terms of Seismic, we are continuing to run 1 seismic fleet in the Central Gulf. You'll see what happens in terms of late sales leading up to the new sales now in March. But I'm also continuing to be positive on Seismic in the Gulf of Mexico.","Operator","The next question is from Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Paal, I wonder whether you could just elaborate a little bit more here on OneSubsea. You talked about the importance of enhanced recovery at subsea a little while ago. You closed the deal. Could you, now that you have some time to reflect on it, help us understand a little bit more how having access to OneSubsea will change the core business at Schlumberger or enhance it?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think, first of all, the creation of OneSubsea will allow us to make a much more significant entry into the overall subsea business. We have some very good, I would say, niche technologies. And Framo have seen tremendous growth in recent years. But it was evident that we needed to combine that with a much broader offering. And I think Cameron is going to be an excellent partner for us in -- with that in mind. So I think it's a bit early to say exactly what the impact in the rest of the business is going to be. If you look at the rest of our business, a lot of that will be focused around the life of field part of subsea, around well intervention, which is not something that we immediately are going to focus on in OneSubsea. But the fact that we are much, I would say, deeper in sanctioning the business through this JV will allow us to move a lot closer to the customer side that focuses on these type of developments. So overall, I see it as a strong positive for us.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Does it enhance recovery as a tail end of a field? Don't you think it's the opportunity for Schlumberger through having access to -- I'm talking about the impact on Schlumberger's core business, not what's put into OneSubsea. Or is it getting involved early-stage in helping how to design wellbores and with based on the knowledge that you have from the reservoir side, and how that could impact the design of a field development? I'm still not sure if I understand exactly how it's going to enhance Schlumberger's business the most.","Paal Kibsgaard","It's a good question. It's actually both. So through the OneSubsea JV, we'll obviously be much more involved with the customer discussions around how to develop these fields. And that has to do with our reservoir characterization capabilities, and it also has to do with our, I would say, wellbore capabilities around ESPs and intelligent completions. So I think both the reservoir understanding as well as the wellbore capability that we have will be integral to how these developments will be done in the future. And then, you add a much more intelligent wellbore to a more sophisticated production plan, say, on the seafloor, including both boosting and compression, and potentially, separation, that is how the overall development, in my mind, are going to be done in the future. So we will have that early involvement, where, through the JV, we will potentially secure people with reservoir background and well background into the project teams. And then beyond that, you have intervention, and I would say, later feel the activities that we will continue to be involved with as the life of the field progresses.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So it sounds as if you are trying to lift Schlumberger's position versus the old company to a higher level at an earlier stage on how fields are developed. Would that be correct?","Paal Kibsgaard","That's correct.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Second question will be on IsoMetrix. Could you give us any kind of feedback from these initial studies on how they have helped your clients solve more complex issues? Are there any examples of that now?","Paal Kibsgaard","Why, it's still early days, right? We have done 3 commercial surveys in this season. I think the -- it will take a little bit of time to process the data, but the early indication from what we have seen from the data together with our customers is very positive, right? And the ability to, I would say, image the reservoir much more accurately will benefit, in particular, the prospects that are more difficult to image.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Well, finally, Simon, I'd just like to congratulate you on the helping reign in the CapEx there and drive free cash flow. And if you could also convince your guys to do some more buybacks, then I think that would be very good for the share price.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim Securities.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","First question, Paal, Simon, I don't know which of you want to address this one, but I do want to follow up on Ole's comment on the lower CapEx and in particular, as it relates to asset turns and the efficiency initiatives that are currently under way. There are 2 aspects in particular that I'd like to ask you to address. One is the reliability of the tools, and two is just overall utilization. Both seem to be going up quite a bit with revenue growth forecasts up and CapEx down. Could you speak to those?","Simon Ayat","Well, let me just -- yes, thanks, Michael. What -- let me take just the overall CapEx. So as we said, we will spend $3.9 billion in 2003 (sic) [2013] as compared to what we spent, $4.7 billion. And it is the shift of activity, obviously, that impacted our decision to lower CapEx. And we, in 2012, had accelerated a bit into Q4 what we were going to spend in 2013. But you are absolutely right. The efficiency plans and programs that we have will improve the 2 turns and asset turns that we experienced in the past. It is an early stage in 2003 (sic) [2013] to see a significant impact from this, but it is a plan that is going to take several quarters, if not years, to get to a -- an optimum situation. But it is reflected in 2013, but the major part in 2013 is really more of an activity shift, acceleration in 2012, and to a lesser extent, the performance that you referred to. But the performance eventually will be a major factor in determining the CapEx spent in Schlumberger and the -- between the different segments. Is this good enough?","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, it's very good. And maybe, Paal, for the follow-up, I'm curious if internationally there are any signs of an emerging interest in tight oil or unconventional applications to conventional reserves or even shale oil? Is what's happened in the Bakken and Eagle Ford starting to go global yet?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think there's a general high interest of unconventionals in oil around the world. You find it in many countries. But where we stand today is it's still in early stages in most places. Whether it's all about data gathering, I would say, exploration in terms of can these resources be developed in an economic and viable way, if I look at the 2 countries, which are probably furthest down the road of -- on doing something that is more material, it is China and Argentina. And China is predominantly focused on shale gas at this stage, but I think there is more of a balance in Argentina between liquids and gas. So those are the 2 countries, which I think will see the most activity increase in the near term.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So from a field standpoint, it's still very much a gas focus, but is it fair to say that oil is perhaps sort of emerging from a science standpoint at this point? Or is it still too early?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think it's still too early to say how predominant that's going to be. I think the interest is there for the shale. There's a lot more data gathering and testing that needs to be done to see what's the balance between gas and liquids.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Scott Gruber with Sanford Bernstein.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","While the subsea tree market continues to grow, investors have been disappointed by a drop in Cameron's market share. Now that you had a chance to look under the hood of their business, what do you think are the prospects for a share gain in trees by OneSubsea? And what can Schlumberger do to help push for greater share of awards?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I don't want to make any specific comments about Cameron market shares or trees. I think we had a very good dialogue and discussion with Cameron in terms of their view of the market versus our view of the market. We have very coinciding views that it is very important to try to view something differently and focus a lot more on production optimization and recovery optimization. The tree will be a key part of that, but there's also a lot of other aspects around the subsea production plant, as well as I also referred to earlier, in terms of the wellbore technology and reservoir understanding. So when it comes to the situation around Cameron, trees, market share, I think you need to talk to Cameron about that.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Got it. And Simon, can you provide a split of growth or decline in the CapEx in '13 between North American and international?","Simon Ayat","The -- we're not going to go into all of these details, but the majority of the spend in 2013 will be related to international.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So will international be up a little bit in '13 then?","Simon Ayat","Yes, on an average, yes, it is up compared to 2012, and the reduction will be in North America.","Operator","Next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Paal, with regard to your outlook, you mentioned that your expectation was for international E&P capital spending to be up 10% and your growth in operating, international operating income to outpace the 10% growth in overall E&P capital spending. Could you talk a little bit about your expectations for international revenue growth? I would expect that you would also expect that to be up, outpace the overall growth in E&P capital spending as well. Is that correct or no?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think that's fair to say. I'm not going to go into the details of exactly what our numbers we are targeting. But I think it's fair to say that both revenue and operating income, we are aiming to grow that faster than that spend or rig count increase, right? And just for reference, if you look at our 2012 numbers, we grew revenue 16% internationally and operating income by 31% at the back end of a 8% growth in rig count. So I'm not saying we're going to repeat those numbers, but I think there is potential and we have capabilities of doing what I'm just saying.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Is there any reason to believe that your international incremental margins are going to be markedly different from the close to 35% number that you generated in 2012?","Paal Kibsgaard","I don't think there's any -- anything that is dramatically different in the international markets, 2013 versus 2012. While we can do the exact same incremental margins, we will obviously, continue to focus on doing that, but I'm not commenting anything at this time.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. And then last one for me, can we talk a little bit about the Saudi outlook? Coming out of the third quarter call, you mentioned that activity in 2013 for Saudi was going to be strong, largely based upon the pretty considerable increase in activity over 2012 and persisting over the course of 2013. But you did not expect, if memory serves, for activity in Saudi Arabia to grow considerably in '13 versus exit 2012. Is that the same position that you have today?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think based on our discussions with Saudi Aramco over the past quarter, we have changed it slightly based on feedback. As you said, we ended the year on about 134 rigs, which was pretty much in line with the plan that Saudi Aramco laid out early in 2012. We saw very strong [indiscernible] activity, rig lift activity in Q4, and also, they're starting up a deepwater rig in the Red Sea in addition to the shallow water exploration that they have there. Now in terms of the outlook, we are expecting around 160 rigs, up from the 134. So 160 rigs by year-end 2013, and that's the latest rig count we have from Saudi Aramco.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","So the 160 versus 134 is actually considerably better than what you thought coming out of the third quarter call, correct?","Paal Kibsgaard","That's correct.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Angie Sedita with UBS Securities.","Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Paal, I believe you see China as one of your fastest-growing GeoMarkets in 2013, and it is already a fairly good-sized market for you. Can you talk about some of the opportunities there? And can you also discuss the traction you've seen with the Anton Oil joint venture?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I can. So if you look at the market trends in China, for a long time, we had a very strong position offshore in Bohai Bay. But on land, our market access has been more limited mainly due to the Chinese operators predominantly using their own Chinese service companies to do their work. Now with the unconventional activity and the many new players entering there, this really opens up the land market, and at the same time, we're also seeing higher demand for new technology and also, the IPM business model from our traditional Chinese customers as they embark on more complex land projects, right? So at the back end of these trends, we've done a number of strategic moves in 2012 as you know. The 20% stake in Anton Oil is one. The other thing we did with Anton Oil was that we formed a JV with them, focused on IPM projects and oil cost on China land. So it is still early days for that JV, but we are actively pursuing work, and it gives us another, I would say, entrance into the China land market.","Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, very helpful. And then on North America, you mentioned the 5% drop in pricing and your non-pressure product -- non-pressure pumping product lines in Q4. Are you still seeing softness in pricing in Q1? Are you seeing any slowing of softness in Q1? Or is it status quo?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I don't really have a lot of information yet on Q4 -- sorry, on Q1, so that's why I'm saying it's still uncertain. We saw that drop in pricing in Q4, which was partly lead to the softness in rig activity. So it's unclear yet whether that is going to continue down in Q1 or whether the rig uptick, which we are hoping to see, will stabilize it.","Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow on non-pressure pumping, given the softness in pricing, what would it take for you to consider unstacking equipment? Would you need to see long-term contracts? Or would you need to see better pricing?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, we operate on the product of pricing and utilization, so if we can -- if that product is over our target or hurdle, we will reactivate fleets. We're not planning to do any of that at this stage, but we're obviously continuing to follow the situation closely. In Q4, we kept the crude count flat versus Q3, so we didn't lay down any more crudes in Q4.","Operator","Next question is from Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil.","William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Paal, I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about -- you mentioned not only in the press release but on your prepared comments regarding you're starting to at least be proactive on bidding on the small- and medium-sized contracts in terms of international pricing push here, and I'm just curious what kind of success rate are you having so far in making that push? And what's really driving that in terms of do you feel like now is the time to do that? Is it because we've pretty much booked, if you will, or is in the rearview mirror, the big, larger tenders that were a source of price competition last year? Those are behind us, it's now giving you a better fairway to go ahead and push more aggressively on these small- or medium-sized contracts?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I think that's fair. On the -- as we talked about throughout the conference calls in the past year, we have been pushing or testing pricing on these smaller to medium-term contracts, basically, throughout 2012. And I would say our success rate has been reasonably good. You win some and you lose some whenever you try to push pricing up. But I would say that overall, we are please with the contract win we have for those type of contracts and that type of pricing strategy. So you're right to say that on the large contracts, which is multi-service line and also multiyear, multi-rig, it is still quite competitive. But most of those contracts, we still represent a relatively small part of our overall contract volume. Most of those contracts are already bid. Not all of them are awarded, but most of them are bid based on where we stand in the cycle.","William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And I guess just one follow-up. I guess fair to say, Paal, given your comments around the operating income growth you see internationally, I guess, fair to think that your earnings growth 2013 versus 2012, you're still expecting that to be double digit, double-digit growth this year. Is that fair?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I would say, we're overall still aiming for double-digit growth in earnings per share in 2013, so this is assuming no major setback in the global economy and also, no further significant setbacks in North America, right? So I already highlighted the key growth drivers in international being ECA and MEA, while the offsetting factor is going to be what's happening in North America land. But yes, overall, we're still aiming for double-digit growth in earnings per share in 2013.","William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","If I could slip one more in. I guess everybody's trying to do the math in terms of just looking to North America performance and including the Gulf of Mexico contribution, is it fair to say, maybe Simon, is a question for you, 1\/4 of North America revenue this quarter is coming from the Gulf of Mexico? Is it that high?","Simon Ayat","It's correct that the Gulf of Mexico includes the -- compensated for the drop in land, yes.","William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Right, but in terms of just a percentage of your revenue contribution in North America from the Gulf, it's about 25% this past quarter?","Simon Ayat","A little bit lower.","Operator","We'll go to David Anderson with JPMorgan.","David Anderson","Paal, you had mentioned the increase in Saudi rig count this year. Can you characterize about where that growth is coming from? Is that primarily natural gas related?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I don't have the details of it. There is some -- obviously, there's some natural gas in it, but it's obviously still oil as well. So I don't have the breakdown for you. I have the breakdown in terms of drilling and workover. The 160 is about 117, 118 on drilling and the balance of 42 being workover.","David Anderson","Okay. And can you discuss kind of some of your unconventional workover there? Is that starting to become a bigger part of your business over there? Are you sort of in some kind of reservoir characterization stage? Or are you starting to kind of go at these wells and starting to look at doing some horizontal wells this year or you're expecting to?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I'll leave most of the commentary to how Saudi Aramco wants to communicate around their unconventionals to them. But we are involved with the project, which is still largely in the exploration type of phase, right? So still, it's limited in terms of oil activity, what we are involved with.","David Anderson","Okay. And if I could just -- completely unrelated follow-up, on your North America market, you talked about your SPARK initiatives some more contributing this quarter. Can you just kind of give us a sense as to basically how many kind of pressure pumping fleets that would represent? In other words, how many fleets are you not using and using and applying SPARK? And also, who are the ideal customers for these initiatives?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. So if you look at the number of 1,100 stages, it's obviously a very big number at this stage, and that number is also split between China and the U.S. So it is not a significant part of our overall capacity or revenue that is coming through this model, but we see that's an interesting model, as we continue to develop these engineered fluid system or frac fluid systems. So overall, today, it is not significant, but it's a new business model that we believe could grow to be more significant over time. And the type of customers that review it, this is typically the either smaller independent players who wants access to higher-technology frac fluid systems or vertically integrated customers that we do this for.","David Anderson","Okay. I guess my last question, kind of related to that is there seems to be quite a bit of a shift in operator behavior in North America over the last 6 months. What would you attribute that to? We hear a lot talk about budgets being used up and whatnot, but is this something that's about field economics and their efforts to lower service costs? And if so, where do you think they are in terms of their goals of cost? Are they satisfied where service costs are now? You just mentioned pricing on some of these other products have come down. That sort of implies to me they're not really satisfied. How do you think about it in terms of their economics right now?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I would say all the customers in North America that I'm talking to are still looking for us to help them drive more cost out of the system, whether that is efficiency or technology. Exactly what transpired in H2 or in particular, Q4 in terms of the lower activity, it could be a combination of lower commodity prices in terms of the subset reference prices below the WTI. I also think that a number of these customers have been operating north of 100% cash flow, and they felt it was prudent to scale back, and then also, you had quite a significant impact of the holiday season in Q4. So I think all of these elements were contributing towards the drop in activity. So I don't think there's been a really material change to the economics, but I think that the proof of that is going to be what happens now in Q1, whether they're going to be ramping back up again.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Jim Crandell with Dahlman Rose.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Paal, how do you see seismic vessels supply\/demand and pricing shaping up for the spring\/summer season?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, if you look at -- our overall market outlook for seismic remains positive. The capacity in the market still remains tight. If you look at our bookings for Q1, we are more or less fully booked, and Q2 is filling up relatively fast. So most of the pricing -- sorry, most of the bids that we have won for Q1 and Q2 are more or less at the same pricing that we did at -- in Q3 and Q4, which is it's about 10% up from that reference price of 2011. So there hasn't been a further increase in pricing as of yet, but we still see the opportunity now to cut pricing further for what remains to be a book for Q2 and also for H2. So we remain positive in terms of our outlook for the market. I'm not really concerned about all the capacity in the market at this stage.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And my follow-up question, Paal, is for the formation evaluation business in deepwater, I think your competitors were targeting a big push in that area given that this is the most exciting growth area in the global oil service market. Do you feel now that we're sort of well into this upturn in deepwater, with still -- a big part of it's still ahead that you've maintained your market share globally in terms of from doing FE work on ultra deepwater wells?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I'm very comfortable with both our technology portfolio, how they continue to execute in these type of projects and overall, the rate that we are winning work at, right? So I don't think there's been any negatives around this. And in fact, I think we continue to perform very strongly, both in terms of market share, revenue growth and profitability. So I'm pleased with the progress that we're showing on the formation and valuation side on deepwater.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","And is this in the area, Paal, that could show above average price increases, too?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, pricing is already quite strong in these types of environment, linked to the higher rig rate and also linked to the high -- with the high importance our customers are putting on operational integrity and reliability. So it could be that we could see more pricing power there, but I would say pricing there is already quite strong.","Operator","Next question is from Jud Bailey with ISI Group.","Judson E. Bailey - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Follow-up question on the Gulf of Mexico, you highlighted the strong growth in North America offshore. I was wondering if you could give us some sense -- obviously, there's some seismic in there in the Gulf. And [indiscernible] me if I'm wrong, but you include Canada and Alaska in there. Was all that or stop between seismic in the Gulf of Mexico? Or was there any big contribution from like Eastern Canada or Alaska in that offshore revenue increase?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, they are included in -- when we talk about offshore in North America, but both Alaska and Eastern Canada are relatively small compared to the size of our Gulf of Mexico business. I would say the predominant driver of the sequential increase in revenue is the Gulf of Mexico.","Judson E. Bailey - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then another question on Mexico. As international markets go, it looks like it's going to be one of the more positive ones for 2013. Could you give a little color or insight as to how you see that market developing over the next couple of years between some of the onshore activity and then -- and now they're getting more active offshore as well and what product lines?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I mean, overall, we're seeing pretty solid growth in activity in 2013 for Mexico, both land and offshore. There is deepwater activity going on. There is conventional shallow water activity, and then you have a range of types of activity on land, all the way from the unconventionals in the North. You have normal third-party work, and we have the IPM and SPM type of contracts. For 2013, in addition to the growth in activity, what we're also seeing is we are facing significant tendering activity in the next couple of quarters. What we're also seeing now is that several smaller players from U.S. land is starting to show up in Mexico, which could make the whole tendering environment even more competitive. So we'll see how that plays out. But that's one aspect that we are looking at. The other key for Mexico is also that PEMEX continues its overall transition towards the production incentive type of contract. And we really like this model, and we compete quite well in those type of bids. And the latest we've heard from PEMEX is that the Chicontepec SPM bid round is expected to be around midyear of 2013, so we'll obviously be preparing for that.","Judson E. Bailey - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And if I could just have one more quick follow-up, Paal, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly. In your comments earlier, did say you anticipated about 100 to 150 rig increase in the U.S. rig count in the first half of the year?","Paal Kibsgaard","Based on the customer feedback that we've had, we are saying up between 100, 150 rigs in Q1. That's what we heard from our customers.","Operator","Next question is from Brad Handler with Jefferies & Company.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I'm going to stick with the U.S. as well, please. You spoke about, I think, raising your stage count in the fourth quarter of '12 for hydraulic fracturing. I wanted to confirm that, please. And then I suspect that you think that the stage, that, that was a nice move in market share for you. I would imagine you think that with activity being down the way it was on the rig side that stage count was probably down for the industry. So can you confirm that and maybe quantify for us? And then we can talk about how we got there.","Paal Kibsgaard","No, I didn't mention anything about stage counts for Q4. I would just say that we haven't thought anything around that. I would say that, overall, in hydraulic fracturing, we have had a good, I would say, couple of quarters in terms of securing work, so I wouldn't be surprised that our market share could be up somewhat. But in terms of stage count sequentially, I haven't mentioned anything about that.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right. Maybe I misread it or misheard. No problem. I guess, then, let me just -- an unrelated follow-up, I suppose just more broadly on IPM, maybe asking globally, how might you expect that revenue to compare in '13 to '12?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think IPM is one of our faster growing product lines. We see a range of type of projects that IPM is getting involved with, all the way from just straight integrated service or project management for, say, deepwater drilling offshore, where we simply coordinate the interface without taking any project management risk to the project, but when we have a wide range of services on these remote rigs, for instance, that coordination will -- is one thing that IPM takes on. The other part is the traditional turnkey well construction, which continues to also grow in time for us, right? So we are very active with IPM, and it's doing very well for us.","Operator","And we have time for one final question from Jeff Tillery with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","The -- after the Q3 results, the commentary you guys had around kind of security and political turmoil concerns in North Africa and Mid East were kind of relatively muted in terms of your concerns overall for the region. Can you just talk about how that's changed in the last 3 months if any?","Paal Kibsgaard","Obviously, with events of the last peak here [ph], we are -- we're relooking at the whole situation there. It is -- if you talk about Algeria and Libya, they're already operating there with quite stringent security measures in banks. With what has happened in the last week, we are relooking at that. We are very prudent in how we go about doing business in any part of the world to make sure that we can offer up the required security for the people that we put into workforce there. So it's too early to say exactly what the impact of this is going to be, but I would just say that in these regions with high risk, we already have very stringent security measures in place.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just last question, unrelated, Paal, you mentioned around Venezuela and receivables and the payments there slowing. Is that -- does that change your appetite for taking on revenue at this point or is it just something that you're throwing out there as an item to be aware of?","Paal Kibsgaard","It is an item to be aware of. We are -- we have a long-standing relationship with Petrovesa. There is -- there are some challenges that they are facing in the country at this stage. We are committed to Venezuela for the long term. They have a massive resource base, and we want to be there for the long term. So we are currently just working very closely with them to kind of resolve the situation.","Malcolm Theobald","Now on behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I would like to thank you for participating in today's call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead, sir.","Simon Farrant","Good morning, good afternoon, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Today's call is being hosted from Moscow, Russia, following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting.","Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Schorn, Executive Vice President, New Ventures.","We will, as usual, first go through our prepared remarks, after which, we will open up for questions. For today's agenda, Simon will first present comments on our first quarter financial performance before Patrick reviews our results by geography. Paal will close our remarks with a discussion of our technology portfolio and our updated view of the industry macro.","However, before we begin, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I, therefore, refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings.","Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our first quarter press release, which is on our website.","Now, I hand the call over to Simon Ayat.","Simon Ayat","Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.38. This represents a decrease of $0.10 sequentially and an increase of $0.13 when compared to the same quarter last year. Our first quarter revenue of $7.8 billion decreased 4% sequentially, largely driven by seasonal declines. Pretax operating margin decreased by 169 basis points to 12%.","Highlights by product group were as follows. First quarter reservoir characterization revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 5% sequentially, primarily due to a seasonal decline in Wireline activities and lower SIS software and multi-client license sales following the usual, but muted impact of year end. Margins decreased 224 basis points to 19.7%, driven by the lower contribution from Wireline and SIS software sales.","Drilling group revenue of $2.1 billion decreased 2% sequentially, while margins decreased 85 basis points to 13.8%. The strong activity in North America was more than offset by seasonal lower drilling activity in the international areas. Production group revenue of $3 billion decreased 4% sequentially and margins fell by 291 basis points to 7.3%. These results were primarily driven by lower activity in the international markets and transient headwinds that impacted the North America hydraulic fracturing market.","Cameron group revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 7% sequentially. This decrease was largely driven by OneSubsea as a result of declining project volumes. Each of Cameron's other product lines also contributed to the decline. Margin decreased 169 basis points to 12.7%, reflecting the lower revenue during the quarter. The book to bill ratio for the Cameron long cycle basis was 0.8. However, the book to bill ratio for the entire group is now at 1, reflecting an increasing backlog of the short cycle businesses.","Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was approximately 18% in the first quarter compared to 19% in the previous quarter. Looking forward, the ETR will be sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings between North America and the rest of the world. With the continued recovery in North America, we anticipate that the ETR will increase next quarter and over the course of the year.","We generated $568 million of cash flow from operations. This is despite the consumption of working capital that we typically experience during Q1, which is driven by the annual payment associated with employee compensation. Our net debt increased $800 million during the quarter to $13.9 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $4.2 billion.","During the quarter, we spent $97 million to repurchase 1.4 million shares at an average price of $69.79. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included CapEx of approximately $450 million and capitalized costs relating to SPM project of $240 million. During the quarter, we also made $692 million of dividend payments. Full year 2018 CapEx excluding SPM and multi-client investments is still expected to be approximately $2 billion.","Now, I will turn the conference call over to Patrick.","Patrick Schorn","Thank you, Simon and good morning everyone. Revenue in the first quarter of 2018 dropped 4% sequentially with pretax operating income decreasing by 16%. In North America, drilling and project activity continued to grow, but our results were negatively impacted by lower than expected pressure pumping activity, together with pricing pressure and supply chain inefficiencies. In the international markets, the underlying business performed as expected for all product lines, including the expected transitory headwinds from the seasonal winter slowdown in the Northern hemisphere and the planned project startup costs associated with recent contract wins.","Looking closer at our North America results, revenue increased 1% sequentially with improved land revenue in the US and Canada and stronger offshore activity in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska, more than offsetting the seasonal drop in Western Geco multi-client sales from the US Gulf of Mexico. Cameron group revenue was lower, following the year end product sales of surface systems and valves and measurement. Onshore in North America, we experienced a slow start to the quarter due to freezing weather and as many shale oil operators took a conservative approach to ramping up activity after the holidays. However with oil prices stabilizing well above $60, both drilling and pressure pumping activity started to ramp up in the second half of the quarter and showed healthy first quarter exit rates. In this market environment, our North America land revenue, excluding Cameron grew 4% year-over-year, matching the increase in rig counts. Growth was driven by higher drilling and project activity with the ramp up of winter drilling activity in Western Canada and continued high demand for rotary steerable systems to drill longer laterals with our two fleet utilization increasing 24% sequentially.","In OneStim, we continued to add fleets, but less than planned due to market over capacity that led to lower utilization, inefficiencies, and softer pricing. These headwinds were compounded by inefficiencies and increased costs associated with rail, logistical issues impacting the supply of our sand in parts of our operations. Despite these disruptions on transformation of our logistics control and the vertical integration of our own sand supply successfully ensured strong service quality and overall business continuity for longer operations, which was recognized by our customer base.","During the first quarter, we continued to actively deploy our spare fracturing equipment including the first spreads from our newly acquired fleet and the operational performance of these new crudes has already reached the standard of our existing pressure pumping business.","Let's now turn to the international areas. Starting with Latin America, revenue decreased 16% sequentially. This was due to lower hydraulic fracturing stage count in Argentina, reduced activity in Brazil as we mobilized for new offshore projects for several international operators and that our cash-based operations in Venezuela declined further.","On the positive side, revenue in Mexico grew as onshore workover activity increased and as we continued to monetize our newly acquired Western GECO multi-client seismic library on the back of another successful background for new offshore acreage in Mexico during the quarter. Seasonally lower Cameron group revenue also contributed to the decrease. In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue decreased 6% sequentially, primarily due to seasonal activity declines in Russia and the Caspian Sea region that impacted all product lines.","Activity was seasonally lower as well in the UK and continental Europe GeoMarkets where operations were hit by weather delays and changes in customer drilling plans. In addition, SIS software license and Western GECO multi-client license sales were generally weaker sequentially, despite positive multi-client seismic sales in the Scandinavia GeoMarket related to license sales on the Norwegian continental shelf.","Revenue from our Africa GeoMarkets were in line with our expectations as solid performance from new onshore projects in Libya and Chad offset further delays for several integrated projects in Gabon, Nigeria and Ghana. Cameron group revenue during the quarter was higher, particularly in the Russia and Central Asia GeoMarket.","Turning next to the Middle East and Asia, revenue decreased 4% sequentially, driven by pricing pressure and lower grilling and hydraulic fracturing activity on land in the Middle East, which was partially offset by stronger drilling activity in Iraq, improved testing services revenue in Qatar and Egypt and solid progress on our long term surface facility project in the region. The move towards more performance based work in the Middle East was further reinforced during the first quarter as we won another IDS contract in Saudi Arabia for 70 long-term turnkey wells which comes in addition to the 274 wells awarded previously, for which we mobilized the first two rigs at the end of the first quarter. In Asia, fourth quarter revenue came in above our expectations, driven by accelerated sale of processing equipment in Thailand and project startups in India, competition encroachment in Australia and increased activity on land in China. Cameron Group was slightly lower with growth in Asia offset by seasonally lower revenue in the Middle East.","And with that, let me pass the call over to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you and good morning, everyone. As described by Simon and Patrick, our first quarter activity was generally in line with expectations, with solid year-over-year growth in Europe, Russia and the Middle East, positive recovery signs in Asia, continued subdued activity in Africa and Latin America, while transient market weakness impacted our business in North America land.","During the quarter, we observed mobilization and reactivation costs associated with new projects startups and we also started to reposition our spare capacity in the international market, as we look to maximize our ability to capture profitable growth in the coming quarters and into 2019.","So with one quarter of the emerging upturn behind us, let me give you our latest views on how the global oil market, E&P investments and oil selectivity will unfold over the coming year.","Looking first at the global oil market, the absence of the normal seasonal stock builds in the first quarter clearly demonstrates that supply and demand is now in balance, which combined with increased geopolitical risk is what has driven oil prices up by more than 10% over the past month. Global crude stocks and days forward coverage is already well below the five year average and bigger growth are expected from the current stock levels in the coming quarters.","These anticipated stock growths are underpinned by a continued strong outlook for oil demand with global growth continuing to be projected between 1.5 million and 1.8 million barrels per day in both 2018 and 2019 and with the current US China trade war tension not expected to escalate into lower global growth at this stage.","On the supply side, after three consecutive years of dramatic underinvestment in global E&P activity, the worldwide production base has [Technical Difficulty] the expected signs of weakening with noticeable year-over-year production declines appearing in several countries such as Angola, Norway, Mexico, Malaysia, China and Indonesia. This trend is expected to spread and accelerate and impact as the level of new [Technical Difficulty] from prior investments continues to fade into 2019.","With Libya and Nigeria producing at near-full capacity, Venezuelan production in free fall, and the potential of new sanctions against Iran, the only major sources of short-term supply growth to address the global production decline and strong worldwide demand growth are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Russia, and the US shale land shale oil operators. At present, the collective spare capacity of the three core OPEC countries is only in the range of 3 million barrels per day.","There are also emerging questions around whether the very bullish production growth outlook for US share oil can be fully met, as the industry is coming to face challenges linked to well to well interference as more infill training takes place. Lower production per well as drilling increasingly steps out from tier 1 acreage as operators look to overcome growing infrastructure constraints and as refineries approach current processing capacity for light oil.","In spite of these clear signs of a tightening oil market, there has been no upwards revision to 2018 E&P spending with North American and International upstream investments still expected to grow in the range of 20% and 5% respectively. Based on these investment levels and the current supplies, we believe it is increasingly likely that the industry will face growing supply challenges over the coming years and that a significant increase in global E&P investment will be required to minimize the impending production deficit.","The key indicator for this evolving trend continues to be global oil inventory level and not US inventories alone, as significant weekly swings in import and export levels often marks the actual evolution of the underlying US supply and demand.","Turning next to the oilfield services market, we expect drilling activity in North America land to continue to grow in volume and complexity in the coming quarters as more of our customers move towards longer horizontal lateral. In this market, we continue to be sold out of our differentiated directional and drill bit technologies as we again posted strong growth in the first quarter and we still command a solid pricing premium for our services.","In addition to our downhole drilling technology, we are now ready to introduce into the US land market the first complete version of our Rig of the Future as well as our new DELFI enabled drilling software platform that covers the complete drilling process all the way from well design and planning to wellhead execution and total system optimization. We are fully focused on the successful introduction of our new and unique well construction offering into the land market as we aim to provide a step change in drilling performance to our customers.","Next, we also see continued growth throughout 2018 in our North America land pressure pumping business, driven by strong underlying activity as well as market share gains, as we deployed a further 1 million horsepower over the course of 2018. With the activity and pricing softness seen in the first quarter as a number of companies added significant new capacity, we expect the market to remain close to being balanced in the coming quarters from an equipment capacity standpoint.","This means that frac pricing will likely be range bound and driven by short-term or local supply demand variations and that any upwards pricing movements will likely be limited to passing on people and supply chain cost inflation. In this environment, we have four differentiating factors that will ensure that our frac business meets our financial return expectations, the superior service quality we deliver to our customers, the technology driven efficiency improvement we create at the individual fleet level, the scale advantage we have as to deploy our new capacity and the increasing benefits we are generating from our vertical integration investment program.","In the international markets, tendering activity remained high and continues to be very competitive and with a clear move towards performance based contracts for many of our customers. We clearly welcome this trend as it offers [Technical Difficulty] and provides us with a clear financial upside, as we leverage our technology systems, people expertise [Technical Difficulty] capabilities to set new performance benchmarks.","In terms of pricing for basic standalone products and services we are yet to see an inflection point and there is still sufficient capacity in the market. However, as the early signs of improving rig rate for land rates, [indiscernible] continues to evolve over the coming quarters, the value proposition of our high end products and services become increasingly attractive compared to the basic performance offered by our competitors and this is where we first expect to see pricing traction in the international market.","In terms of geographical trends, our outlook for Russia, the Middle East and the North Sea remains solid and in line with our expectations for the year. While the emerging upside we are seeing in Asia will likely be offset by a somewhat slower growth trajectory in Africa and Latin America, where the start of the activity recovery now seems to be pushed out to the second half of 2018.","So overall, the international markets are evolving in line with our expectations for the year and we are excited about the outlook for Schlumberger. We are ready and primed to deliver superior growth, financial returns and free cash flow in the coming years by building on the broader technology offering and expertise in the industry, our unmatched scale and operational efficiency, strong capital discipline and a clear desire to provide industry leading cash returns to our shareholders.","Before we open up for questions, I would like to take the opportunity to thank the more than 100,000 women and men that make up the Schlumberger workforce. You are the best team in the industry and I want to thank you for your unwavering commitment to your jobs, to our customers and to the company over the past few years where we together have navigated through very tough market conditions. Now, things are again looking brighter for the industry and for Schlumberger and I look forward to facing the new and more energizing challenges of the growth market together with all of you.","Thank you. We will now open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question here will come from Ken Sill with SunTrust Robinson.","Ken Sill","This is a good quarter and a tough environment here. One of my first questions is on pressure pumping. You're planning to put 1 million horsepower out. How much did you actually deploy in Q1.","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I'm not going to go into the details of exactly how much we deployed. We continue to deploy and I would say that we deployed less than what we planned to, mainly because the overall softness that we experienced in the market. I think, the overall stage count growth market wide was a bit lower than expected and in addition to that, a number of other companies added fairly significant capacity to the market and this had an impact on softening pricing and also it impacted utilization. So we introduced somewhat lower, a lower number of fleets in the first quarter and it was more backend loaded, but we are back on our plan rate of introduction as we enter Q2 and our plan is still to deploy the full 1 million horsepower that we acquired during the course of 2018.","Ken Sill","Okay. And then to step to a big picture question, you're very optimistic about the outlook, makes a lot of sense given what we're seeing in inventories. Are you concerned with the Wall Street estimates on timing of the recovery or it seems like international is going to remain slow, North America up 20%. I think some estimate is a little bit higher than that, but it just doesn't seem like people are moving to raise their CapEx budgets very quickly. So I think the trend is very positive, but do you have any concerns about the timing of the growth in activity.","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, from an operational planning and execution front, from the Schlumberger side, international is unfolding this year as we were expecting. The rate of increase in investment levels is as you note significantly lower than what we see in North America, which was expected. But even with the 5% or plus or minus 5% increase in investment, we can generate I think quite reasonable earnings growth out of that, mainly because we have a much higher market here internationally. Our margins are generally higher and our ability to generate incremental is also much higher internationally than in North America.","So even though there is a 4 to 1 ratio on investment growth levels, the [Technical Difficulty] business and our ability to generate earnings. Based on that, I'm quite positive on what we can make out of this growth rate even in 2018. But if you ask me, if the investment levels in the international market is sufficient, I would say no, it isn't. So from a supply ability, I would be concerned whether the international market and the producers there are going to be able to produce sufficient to meet the growth in demand, but there's little I can do about that, but I would just say that international for us is unfolding as expected and I think there is only upside beyond where we are today going forward.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of James West with Evercore ISI.","James West","Thanks and Paal, good early evening to you. Paal, I guess first off, I wanted to ask about the - you had your board meetings in Russia, in Moscow this week. You obviously are still pursuing a transaction there with Eurasia. Could you maybe give us some color around kind of what you and the board saw this week, what you were doing? I mean similar to other major board meetings that you've had in places like Saudi, you picked Moscow for a reason and I love to hear that that reason and why - what you guys are up to in that market, given that it's a very, very large service market.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah. Thanks, James. Yeah. As you know, our board is very much engaged in our business and we dedicate one board meeting a year to go out into our field operations and engage with our employees, with selected customers and also industry experts in the various regions around the world. As you know, in Saudi Arabia, last year had a great visit there and if you look at the largest parts of our business, it is basically in between Saudi Arabia, Russia and the US. So the reason for picking Russia this year is that it is a huge part of our business. It is a business that has shown very good growth and strength over the past three or four years. And it was something that the board wanted to see up close a little bit more.","So this week, in addition to the normal board proceeding, the board had the opportunity to interact with a number of selected customers and partners, we engaged with some of the Russian oil industry experts and also the board had the opportunity to lead some of our 11,000 Russian employees. It's been a very productive week. We have provided the board with a broad industry and business update for Russia and we've also detailed our further investment plans in the country.","And as to the EDC transaction, Simon, do you want to comment briefly on where we stand on that?","Simon Ayat","Yeah. Let me give a quick update. Basically since announcing the deal was the EDC shareholders, we've been discussing with the respective authorities, all aspects of the transaction, including the size of our participation and the structure of the entity acquired in this state. As a result, we are very happy to say that we were able to satisfy and address all the concerns raised by the different respective authorities. What is more important that our objective of the deal remain unchanged, which is to deliver the best and most efficient operation to our clients through integration and deployment of technology. Schlumberger would remain the driver behind the operations of EDC as and when the transaction closes.","Paal Kibsgaard","So James, as to if and when it closes, there is nothing much more we can say than this, other than we do have very good engagement with Eurasian authority. The file is now with them. We need to give them time for them to do their job and we are at their disposal if there is any further follow-up that is required.","James West","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, Paal. Thanks, Simon. And then a follow-up for me, Paal, on the international side. You announced a number of major key contract awards last quarter and this quarter, but it seems to me there is a lot of stuff going on in the background that has yet to be announced as well as this international recovery really takes hold and gains momentum and understanding that spending activity this year is going to lag I guess the North American spending increase, it seems to me like heading into 19, we're looking at a pretty big inflection point for international. Is that a fair comment?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah. I think that's a fair comment. There is, as you note, significant tendering activity presently. What we are excited about is that a fair bit of these tenders are now shifting towards performance based contracts, which means that even if they're quite competitive the bid, we have a fairly significant financial upside by being able to execute in certain of these performance standards on these activities. So, I would say activity, we expect to continue to ramp during the year, very solid performance and outlook still in Middle East, Russia, North Sea. Asia is surprising a bit to the upside and we're dragging a little bit further on Africa and Latin America. We expect that to start increasing as well in the second half of the year. So I agree with you. I think the outlook for international is strengthening as we go through this year and should be even stronger in 2019.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS.","Angie Sedita","So Paal, a little bit further on the international side, you touched on it in your prepared remarks on pricing and the potential for pricing maybe late 2018, going into 2019. Maybe a little color there and then specifically you highlighted your obvious strengths on the technology side as far as deepwater. So maybe you can go into that a little bit further.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah. In terms of pricing, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, no inflection point yet when you look at basic products and services. But again the shift towards performance contracts will allow us to increase our effective pricing by performing well on these projects and I think we're very well set up to do that. And the other point which I wanted to mention as well is that as the emerging signs of the rig rate continue to evolve in positive direction and we've seen some encouraging signs in certain land markets for sure on shallow water jackups and even in selected ultra deepwater environment. So when the rig rate starts to come up, the value proposition or our high end technology and services and the value of service quality and execution is going to quickly become increasingly attractive when compared to the basic performance of our competitors. So I think this is where we expect to see pricing to come first and I think it's reasonable to expect that this will start to take shape in the second half of the year.","Angie Sedita","And then going back to Russia and EDC, what do you think on Eurasia Drilling would bring to Schlumberger. What's the opportunity set by owning that company or a portion of that company and just be opportunistic overall in Russia as we go into 2019?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, the opportunity set that are on Eurasia Drilling for us has always been the fact that it will allow us firstly to bring our latest total drilling technology systems to the Russia land market. It is a very drilling intensive market. Today, there is no real integration happening. We have a very strong purpose built downhole offering in Russia, partly through a combination of acquisitions we've made and also organic R&D investment made within the Russia R&D organization. And when we add that to the Rig of the Future where we are working on creating winterized Rig of the Future version for introduction in Russia land as well as the drilling sulfur package, there is huge, I would say, drilling performance upside in Western Siberia by introduction of both software and the rig and this is the whole excitement we have around Eurasia transaction. It is a very well-run company, a company we know very well. We have partnered and worked with them for a number of years, but being present on the ownership side that will allow us to take a stronger position in driving the technology direction and I think that is what creates the excitement.","Operator","And the next question will come from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup.","Scott Gruber","I have a question on SPM. You're slowing project sanctioning as you discussed last quarter, given the base business outlook is improving here. I'm curious about the free cash conversion of SPM when you're just spending a maintenance CapEx. CapEx, as a percent of sales, I imagine, is still above your base business, just given the nature of the business, how should we think about the free cash conversion out of net income for that business when you're just spending it in maintenance mode. Is it accretive to the conversion targets for the company or is it dilutive?","Paal Kibsgaard","Patrick, do you want to comment on that?","Patrick Schorn","Yeah. Maybe I think it's a little bit more general goal. I mean as you are well aware, I mean during the downturn, we've had a significant growth initiative around SPM. As far as this has been a growth avenue that allowed us to get the best returns on our technology. We also announced as we saw the cycle change that we were putting an end to our very strong countercyclical investment program. So with that becomes a very strong discipline around the new project that we are investing in and obviously also with the CapEx that we invest in the ongoing project. Now, this is always a bit of a balance that you're trying to strike between the IBP that you're generating today and the long term value that you're generating in these type of assets.","So what we're going to do going forward is that we maintain a very disciplined investment and that we're also looking at monetizing some of these assets and which obviously is one of the biggest ways to start making a significant dent in the cash flow of these assets. So we are looking today at monetizing some of our assets during the turn of 2018, but we want to make sure that we do this at the right time and the most opportune time is when we are having de-risk some of these projects and that we have sufficient value proven that we can obviously then also sell these on as we go along. So we are fully expecting to engage with interesting parties here over the next quarters and we actually are seeing the interest build in this type of transaction. And that is maybe the best that I can give a bit of color around the question that you're asking.","Scott Gruber","Got it. Patrick, maybe if you could update us on progress on Palliser and the projects in Nigeria and Argentina.","Patrick Schorn","Yes. I certainly can. So we started operation at the end of last year and we concluded a variety of operations, obviously the production operations, we started workover. So as far as drilling new wells, we've had up to four rigs drilling simultaneously up in Canada on the Torxen project. We have added around 56 wells to date. And I think that the key thing to remember is that our investment is fully focused on increasing the oil production from this asset. So we will continue to hook up and put on production these new wells in the months to come and once breakup finishes, we expect to start drilling again in the second half of this year. And quite frankly, we're quite pleased with the progress that the team has made in Canada in a very short time in turning this asset into a very focused organization on oil.","When it comes to Nigeria, there, we are going through a lot of fee type work. We're working closely with our partners and here, you would have to think about detailed design around FPSO conversions, the top sites that are needing to be prepared. Everything there is on track. And we're looking to do an FID date here later in the year. So from that, that gives you a bit of an idea of where we are in Nigeria.","And the last one, Argentina is doing well. We have drilled a number of wells, the ones that we have at this moment are producing very well, very close to our P10 type of expectation. So, things are looping up when it comes to the performance of the individual wells, but let's be very clear as well I mean, there is no field developed with one or two wells, but we need to make sure that we are drilling many, many very good wells. What we're seeing right now encourages us and that obviously also then helps when you're starting to think about monetization in the future.","Operator","And your next question here will come from Kurt Hallead with RBC.","Kurt Hallead","Hey, Paal. I was wondering if you, I guess I'm just still trying to grab my hands around some of the dynamics that are taking place in the US frac market. And you did a great job in trying to walk us through some of these things. I'm just not quite sure if I got a handle on it. So apologize if I'm asking the question that you may have already answered, I'm a little slow on the update. So you mentioned during the first quarter, you've had some challenges around the industry, bringing in some new capacity that led to some softer pricing. Then I heard Patrick talk about things kind of picking up as you go into the end of the first quarter. And then some positive dynamics for the second quarter, yet couched around the prospect for incremental capacity to still kind of creep into the system. So where do we stand? I mean is demand still exceeding available supply in the frac business or are we now at a point where we're kind of going to be stuck in neutral and companies are going to continue to put capacity into the market and print the pricing power as we get into the last three quarters of the year. So, just again if you can give a little more color around that, that would be helpful.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah. So what we said is, from a supply and demand standpoint of frac equipment in Q1, I think it's pretty clear that we had overcapacity as an industry based on the available stages during the first quarter. So we are more or less our capacity today. I think the market going forward when it comes to frac equipment I think is going to also label around being in balance. I think you will probably have local valuations in certain basins. You might have a temporary oversupply, undersupply based on where companies introduce new capacity. But I think the fact that we are now more or less at capacity and we need to accept that it will be in that situation for the duration of this year, I think is pretty clear.","And given the fact that the market has been growing steadily now for the second year in a row and also given the fact that we have a very agile service industry and manufacturing industry to support the service industry, it's not a huge surprise that in a fully commoditized market, that supply is going to match demand at some stage and I think we're basically there. So I think from a pricing standpoint, we don't expect any significant tailwinds of kind of net effective pricing. We do expect to continue to be able to pass on additional costs associated with people and supply chain inflation. But beyond that, I think operating margins and profitability is going to have to be driven by how you execute.","And from our standpoint, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there are four major drivers. One is the service quality and the business continuity that we are able to provide to our customers in any kind of market situation. We also have significant investments into technology that drives individual fleet operating efficiency. As we add another 1 million horse power over the course of 2018, that's going to give us a fairly significant scale advantage and then also what we see is increasing benefits from our vertical integration program, right? So, I think it's going to be a challenging market situation throughout 2018, but we have some levers that we are very much focused on, which makes me confident that we're going to be able to meet our return, I would say, expectations for the investments that we make into this.","Operator","The question here will come from the line of James Wicklund with Credit Suisse.","James Wicklund","International, I want to drill down a little bit if I could Paal on the performance based contracts. You guys have been pushing this for some time and I know everybody's been a little disappointed at the uptake. But you in your first lumpsum turnkey project in Saudi Arabia and more to come, do you finish your first well on a performance based contract with board drilling in Gabon. The market is concerned that lumpsum turnkey contracts get too competitive, you kind of addressed that, saying that, even though there are big competitive, you have the opportunity to outperform. Can you talk a little bit more about how you do that and is this just a matter of throwing your best technology that the companies, your client themselves might not hire on a regular service basis. Can you talk about how, especially with those two contracts and I realize they're different, how this is going to north of the next couple of years into a much wider performance based type business internationally?","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay. That's a good question, Jim. So the way we see this contract as you rightfully point out that they are competitively bid as with anything, but with the investments we are making from an R&D standpoint in particular in to our drilling portfolio and with the ultimate focus of creating one drill as a complete revolutionary total billing system, that's where our ability to execute and drive performance on any type of contract to a completely new level that even though we've been - we win the contract at a very competitive pricing, we can over the course of that contract generate very healthy returns to the company. So the way we do this is like I said by having firstly superior individual technology building blocks.","Then it's the ability to bring this together to a complete operating and planning software package with drill plan and drill ups is going to do and this is all sitting on our DELFI digital system, which allows every application to share all the data on the information. And then on top of this, it is the domain expertise that we have from the drilling and subsurface as well as our operational execution on the wells that I described. So I can't really point to one thing, but the key with any kind of lumpsum turnkey contract is that you improve the drilling performance over the course of the contract and generally well number ten is drilled significantly faster than wells number one.","The key with our system and the whole digital approach is that we ideally - we don't want to start off with the performance of the traditional well number one. We want to start off with well number one matching the traditional performance of well number 10. And if you can do that, you can move up the profitability and the gains you're making and drilling experience from the digital environment that you have deployed on all your operations around the world and this is a major differentiator going forward as to how we can start generating very good returns even in the first wells of the program rather than well 10 or 15 as you get into the second or third year of operation.","But this is how we want to set ourselves apart. This is how we are setting ourselves apart and obviously the rigs is going to play an increasingly important part of how we drive performance right and that's why we have a very strong position on rigs with the ADC in Saudi Arabia. This is again linked to our interest in EDC in Russia and then beyond that, we are now actively introducing our Rig of the Future into the US land market as well and these three markets are really the main land drilling markets around the world.","And lastly, I would say that this is also why we have made an investment to board drilling. We see performance based contract similar to what I described on land here also to now move in to shallow water and we are very happy and very excited about the partnership and investment we made in board drilling and we see significant opportunities on shallow water together with bore and potential other shallow water drillers to also introduce performance based contracts to this environment.","James Wicklund","My follow up if I could, a couple of years ago we were talking about a great deal about the transformational effort that Schlumberger was going through and on the staged basis and I know the downturn kind of interrupted some of the plans. Can you tell us is the transformational effort that was started a couple of years ago, is that done yet, are we getting closer or what phase are we in at this point.","Paal Kibsgaard","That's a very good question, James. I would say that the downturn in the past three years had an impact on the, what they're trying to mention has grown to our bottom line and it's mainly because it is very difficult to monetize efficiency in an environment where your business continues to shrink quarter after quarter. What we have done during this period of time is that we have ring-fenced the investment in the transformation program and we have continued to evolve it, we have continued to deploy it. We are in the middle of significant deployment as we seek around how we change our workflows, how we introduce new backlog of systems and how we basically conduct all our internal business processes.","So this is all progressing and I would say that going forward, the transformation is going to be a critical factor in our ability to generate the incremental margins that we have promised. And I think as soon as you see us now starting to generate a little bit of growth in the international market and we are finished with the pricing concession, that's when I think the impact of the transformation is going to start to become very visible again. We are maintaining, for instance, our CapEx, the investment levels around $2 billion this year, which is as low as it's been throughout the entire downturn and we're doing this because a significant part of the increased activity we are actually going to absorb through increased asset utilization, but this is one way that we are demonstrating what a confirmation can bring. So I would still say that we are in the mid-innings of what the impact of the transformation can bring, but we have continued to advance forward the investments and the deployment of this so that we are very optimistic of what it is going to bring us here as we go forward into 2018 and 2019.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of David Anderson with Barclays.","David Anderson","I just wanted to stick on the LSTK subject here. So Paal, with more of the tendering activity kind of moving towards lumpsum turnkey contracts, I was just wondering if you could just help us conceptually understand how you view the difference between SPM and LSTK, just in terms of say the upside versus the execution risk in both types of contracts. It feels like this is more execution with an LSTK. I was just wondering if you could kind of talk about that of how you look at the two types and whether or not you have a preference for either one of those type of contracts.","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay. So if you think there's more execution risk on LSTK, I can debunk that pretty firmly. That is obviously not the case. The highest risk profile of any contract type that we take on is on SPM. On LSTK, there is - the performance risk you basically take on there is that you stipulate a fixed price for a well profile that you have seen and as you can study upfront before you submit your bid, we analyze there is - in great detail the global database and experienced base to understand how we can drill these wells and how we can beat the curve basically. And the risk you take on is basically the time it takes to drill the well, because most of the drilling costs are time based. So the risk profile of LSTK is a small fraction of what the risk profile of a SPM project is.","And also from a cash standpoint, LSTK is fairly close in terms of payment terms to the base business. It's about - generally you get paid on completing complete wells and this is very close to the payment DSO levels that we're looking at for the base business. So cash exposure, profitability exposure is much more limited than what you see in SPM. And again the ability that I just outlined in the previous question there makes us extremely comfortable with taking on these type of contracts and I would say that generally for all the contracts that we take on, we typically beat the curve and our objective going forward is to continue to beat it by a wider margin.","David Anderson","So is it fair to say that if these contracts are bit fairly competitively that maybe the margins as these contracts start up and I guess in year one are going to, expectations that these are going to improve measurably by year three, is that sort of the idea we should be thinking about that as these come out, maybe a little bit lower profitably today, but the idea is once you start getting these costs and these startup costs all taken care of that the margins all start to uplift, is that sort of how we should be thinking about this.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah. Generally, LSTK contracts have improving profitability over the course of the contract and there are some mobilization prospects. They're not really significant unless they are huge contracts, like for instance the once we are currently mobilizing for in Saudi Arabia. But I would say that the profitability isn't necessarily linked to the mobilization. It's more linked to the fact that your drilling, I would say, curve improves as you build more wells and as I was saying in the earlier question, our goal and what our drilling system is going to enable us to is to basically fast forward on that experience curve. So our well number one isn't going to have the traditional performance level of a graphical well number one. We want to start way down the line, which means that profitability should be much higher in the early parts of these projects as we go forward compared to what they were in the past, but still be able to improve over the course of the project.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons.","Bill Herbert","Paal, I'm just curious, so the expectation for an increase in a 5% with regard international E&P capital spending, you should do a little bit better than that based upon market share. And against that backdrop, what do you think are reasonable expectations for international incremental margins off that mid to high single digit revenue growth for this year.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah. Bill, I think it's a bit too early to make a straight commitment on this, because there are still some forces playing in opposite directions, right, but there are some startup costs, there are some repositioning costs. We've got to work through some of the pricing concessions that we have been giving - given in recent quarters. So I still think it's too early to give you a straight commitment to what sort of sequential incremental margins are going to be in the coming couple of quarters.","We stand behind the 65% as we get into steady state growth in the international market. We're going to require some pricing tailwind to get there, but we stand behind that, but I think it's a bit too early to say what the incrementals are going to be, say, into Q2 and Q3. Other than that, they should steadily improve and we have very clear plans in place, enormously getting pricing traction, leveraging performance based contracts and then starting to fully capitalize on the sustained investments we've made in transformation program. So, I think we have all the ingredients there. It's ready to be, I would say, capitalized on, but I'm not going to give you a number say for Q2 and Q3 as of yet.","Bill Herbert","Okay. And can we speak about the second quarter expectation here, which seems to be a more tangible premise. The Street estimates of $0.48 or thereabouts, high $0.40. You delivered $0.38. Is that a tenable proposition with regard to the realization of that earnings per share?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. I think it is. There is a little bit of color on that. If you look at these, we see solid revenue growth in both drilling and pressure pumping. We're going to work through as usual the kind of a breakup in the second quarter. In the international market, we continue to see the trends that we saw in Q1, strong performance in Middle East, Russia, North Sea. Asia is basically joining that list now and it's slight upside in Asia. But then a bit more limited growth in Africa and Latin America, right. So assuming that the softer pricing and utilization in North America land pressure pumping doesn't really carry into Q2 and at this stage, we don't think it will, then I will say that the current EPS consensus is pretty much in line with how he see.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Byron Pope with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Byron Pope","Thanks. I just have one question. Paal, you framed some of the 2018 growth drivers for Schlumberger in terms of GeoMarkets. I was wondering at a high level, could you do the same in terms of which of the groups you think lead the growth. It seems certainly that protection group will be there, just given the frac fleet reactivations, but could you frame at a high level how you think about the growth drivers from a group perspective this year?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah. It's a bit easier to do it, down to the specifics when you look at geography, right. I would say, overall, I see very good growth potential from all four groups. You mentioned production, yes, absolutely. I think with the investments we made in frac capacity and vertical integration and the way we set up in North American land now, I expect that North America will be a strong driver for production group growth, but as well we have obviously a significant business globally as well, strong fracking activity in the Middle East and Argentina as well as other parts of the business that will contribute. Drilling as well, these lumpsum turnkey contracts, our key revenue and bottom line drivers. D&M is obviously the, drilling and measurement is the main driver of the performance of these projects, but all the other drilling segments have a role to play in it as well. So still a very good growth potential for drilling.","On the characterization side, our exit out of the Western GECO acquisition business will have an impact on top line progression this year, but from a bottom line side, this should actually be quite accretive to a characterization of operating margins and both wireline and testing is kind of still operating around the close to the bottom of their cycle, mainly because their exposure to the exploration market has not seen any recovery yet, but there are some small signs of improving exploration spend relating to building in 2018, which should enable them to I think to grow as well. And on the Cameron side, we're seeing strong performance from the short cycle businesses and I think we're getting close to the trough of both the booking revenue and margins for the long cycle business. So again, upside there as well. So I think it's a bit more general, what I can say on the technology side, but I would say very good growth potential in all the four groups.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you. So that was the last caller for today. Thank you very much for participating.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude the conference for today. Thanks for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Malcolm Theobald, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Malcolm Theobald","Thank you, Kathy. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Second Quarter 2012 Results Conference Call. Joining us on the call from Paris today are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer, and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results, and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.","However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request.","[Operator Instructions] And now, I'll turn the call over to Simon.","Simon Ayat","Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.05. This is an increase of $0.09 sequentially and $0.19 compared to the same quarter last year.","All prior period amounts have been restated, as the Distribution segment has been reclassified to discontinued operations following the sale of Wilson and the sale of our investment in CE Franklin.","Oilfield Services second quarter revenue of $10.4 billion increased 5.3% sequentially. Pretax income of $2.1 billion increased 8% sequentially, while pretax operating margins improved by 50 basis points.","Sequential revenue and pretax margin highlights by product group were as follows: Second quarter Reservoir Characterization Group revenue of $2.8 billion, increased 7.4% sequentially, and margins grew 223 basis points to 28.2%. These improvements were driven by a seasonal rebound in SIS, combined with strong performances in Testing Services and Wireline. In fact, every technology in the group experienced sequential revenue growth and margin expansion.","Drilling group second quarter revenue of $4 billion increased 5.7%, while margin improved 107 basis points to 18.4%. These increases were largely attributable to the Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO on robust international activity.","Second quarter Production Group revenue of $3.7 billion increased 5.6% sequentially, while pretax margin fell 117 basis points to 16.4%. The revenue growth was led by Artificial Lift, Completions and Schlumberger Production Management. The margin decline was largely attributable to our North America hydraulic fracturing business as a result of the spring break-up in Canada and continued cost inflation and pricing pressure in U.S. land.","Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 24% in the second quarter compared to 23.6% in the previous quarter. We continue to expect the effective tax rate for a full year of 2012 to be in the mid-20s. However, this can vary on a quarterly basis due to the geographic mix of business.","Net debt at the end of the quarter was $6.7 billion as compared to $5.8 billion at the end of Q1. This reflected an increase in working capital requirements to support the current and anticipated business growth.","Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.1 billion of CapEx, $681 million of acquisitions, $906 million of proceeds from the sale of the Wilson business and $499 million of stock repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased 7.52 million shares at an average price of $66.30. CapEx is still expected to be approximately $4.5 billion in 2012 as compared to the $4 billion we spent in 2011.","And now, I turn the conference over to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Simon. Second quarter results continue to strengthen, driven by a solid growth in activity and by consistent focus on the quality and efficiency of our execution.","In the international markets, overall revenue grew by 9% sequentially, while margins were up by 161 basis points. Activity showed strong sequential growth, both offshore and in key land markets, while service capacity tightened further, in particular, in the areas of seismic, wireline and drilling services. We continued to test pricing on smaller contracts during the second quarter with good success, and for some customers, we also secured work at pricing premiums due to the quality and consistency of our performance.","In Latin America, revenue grew by 5% sequentially, while margins were up by 79 basis points. We experienced strong growth in Mexico, driven by IPM activity on land and by our Wireline and Drilling product lines offshore.","During the quarter, the second round of production incentive contracts were awarded, where we, in partnership with Petrofrac, won the contract for the Panuco block, covering 4 oilfields in the north of Mexico. In Ecuador, equity -- activity was up significantly as we started operations on the production incentive contract for the Shushufindi field. The project mobilization has been flawless, and the work program is progressing on schedule.","In Brazil, activity remained flat during the quarter. However, a number of new rigs are being commissioned, and we are ready for activity to ramp up in the second half of the year as the rigs become operational. There are still a number of large bids outstanding, which will likely be awarded in the coming quarters.","In the Middle East and Asia, revenue grew by 7% sequentially, while margins were essentially flat. During the quarter, we saw further growth in rig and rig-less activity in Saudi Arabia, and we also saw a noticeable pickup in activity in the United Arab Emirates.","In Iraq, activity growth in the second quarter was limited as predicted, while we went through a very active bidding period. Building on the execution track record we have established in Iraq over the past 18 months, we secured most of the key new contracts awarded. Resources for the new contracts were successfully mobilized during the quarter, and we are positioned for good growth in Iraq in the second half of the year.","In Asia, China posted strong sequential growth on land, driven in part by seasonal pickup in activity. We are also seeing increased demand for our high-end services, as well as for IPM, as our Chinese customers embark on more complex land projects for both conventional and unconventional resources.","In Australia, we saw strong seasonal pickup in offshore activity in the second quarter. The offshore growth is set to continue in the second half of the year and be further complemented by additional land activity in Queensland and start-up of a new project in Papua New Guinea.","In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue grew by 14% sequentially, while margins were up 356 basis points, driven by strong activity and execution. The North Sea posted significant sequential growth, both on the U.K. and Norway side, with continued good exploration activity and strong growth in development.","In Libya, activity continued to ramp up as new rigs became available, and we returned to double-digit profitability during the quarter. Sub-Sahara Africa growth was driven by high exploration activity in Mozambique and Tanzania, as well as strong exploration and development work in Nigeria and the Gulf of Guinea.","In Angola, activity remained more or less flat this quarter, but we expect both exploration and development projects to continue to ramp up during the second half of the year.","In Russia, we saw seasonal pickup in activity, both in Sakhalin, the Caspian and Western Siberia. And based in the current outlook, Russia remains on track to be one of our fastest growing markets this year.","In North America, sequential revenue was down 2% and margins were down 208 basis points. The results were impacted by the Canadian break-up and the U.S. land hydraulic fracturing market, but were partly offset by our other U.S. land businesses and by our activity in the Gulf of Mexico.","In U.S. land, the overall rig count remained more or less flat, while rig moves from the gas basins to the liquids-rich basins continued. Pricing and activity for our Wireline, coiled tubing, and Drilling businesses in U.S. land remained stable. The impact of the Canadian break-up was in line with expectations, and the Canadian rig count was, at the end of the quarter, at the same level as last year.","In the Gulf of Mexico, deepwater activity grew in line with our outlook for the year and our operational performance remained strong and consistent, while multiclient sales were flat sequentially.","As we predicted, the downward pricing trend in the hydraulic fracturing market continued in the second quarter and also spread to other liquids basins. During the quarter, hydraulic fracturing margins declined further as a function of lower pricing and higher product costs.","Let me now turn to some of the technology highlights for the quarter. In the Reservoir Characterization Group, WesternGeco introduced the IsoMetrix technology, a new class of marine services that measures the wavefield in 4 components, using a new streamer called Nessie-6. The output data corresponds to towing conventional streamers less than 10 meters apart, turning a 12-streamer vessel into the equivalent of 144. The result is the industry's first real 3D seismic measurement, and the resolution of the data is like moving from a 2D X-ray to a 3D CAT scan. IsoMetrix will be able to extend the role of time-lapse 3D surveys, enable wider tow patterns that record superior data for exploration, as well as eliminating the need for dense streamer spreads.","This summer, we will also release the latest version of our new reservoir simulation software, INTERSECT. Schlumberger has collaborated with Chevron for over a decade to build, test and deploy INTERSECT, and Total has recently joined the collaboration as a full partner. INTERSECT represents significant advances in physics modeling and use of parallel computing to better represent complex subsurface structures. It also includes a more advanced and comprehensive field management framework.","In the Drilling Group, we introduced the NeoScope logging-while-drilling service, which eliminates the need for chemical sources by using pulsed neutron generator technology. The NeoScope service offers a full suite of sourceless formation evaluation measurements, as well as well placement and drilling measurements that help optimize the drilling process.","During the quarter, we also bought the remaining shares of the Russian company Radius Service, after having been a minority shareholder for the past 7 years. Radius Service is the market leader in engineering, manufacturing and service of downhole motors and drilling tools in the Russian land markets, employing around 1,000 people and operating in all major oil and gas producing regions of Russia.","In the Production Group, we introduced the Mangrove stimulation design software that enables better decision making for well completion and fracturing programs. The software helps optimize perforation and stage design for horizontal wells using reservoir measurements and also includes fracture network predictive models. Developed on the Petrel software platform, Mangrove users can access the shared earth model to facilitate program designs for all types of reservoirs, including unconventional resources.","During the quarter, Framo Engineering secured another major contract, this time for the Shell Draugen Field in the North Sea. As the clear leader in subsea boosting and metering, Framo now represents one of our fastest growing business units, with around 75% annual growth in 2012 and with a backlog at record levels.","Let's then turn to the macro-environment, where the continuing Eurozone crisis, coupled with the disappointing numbers from China and the U.S., has led to downward revisions of the outlook for GDP growth and oil demand. High production output from OPEC also led to a period of crude inventory buildup during the quarter, which, together with fares [ph] or lower demand, brought Brent crude prices briefly below $90 before recovering. At the same time, global spare capacity for oil is at the lowest level for 5 years and there continued to be risks of potential production disruption from geopolitical events.","The situation in the global economy remains unsettled, and it seems increasingly clear that the present macro uncertainties will remain for a considerable period of time. In this environment, we believe Brent crude prices, in general, will be supported around current levels, although they could be subject to periods of considerable volatility. Continued macro uncertainty coupled with price volatility could make customers more cautious in terms of future activity plans. However, in the international markets, we have seen no signs of this so far. We maintain, absent a future significant setback to the world economy, our stated view that international activity will grow in excess of 10% this year.","In North America land, liquids-based activity continues to grow, offsetting the drop in natural gas activity and keeping the overall U.S. land rig count more or less flat so far this year. However, a WTI oil price in the low 80s with continued market uncertainty could impact the rate of growth in liquids activity in the second half of the year, although we have not seen any signs of this so far. In terms of natural gas, we expect the U.S. dry gas rig count to level off around 500 rigs until the current production overcapacity is consumed.","In the midst of the uncertainty, we maintain our focus on what we control, which is the planning and execution of our work. To further extend our leadership in execution, we are currently undertaking a number of multiyear programs that cover a wide range of internal and external activities. These, together with our international strength and our balanced portfolio in North America, should enable strong relative performance going forward.","Thank you very much. I will now hand the call over to Malcolm for the Q&A session.","Malcolm Theobald","Thank you, Paal. And we'll now open the call for questions. Kathy?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So my question here really relates to very good sequential improvement in North America, despite the significant headwinds in the frac market as well as the seasonal downtick in Canada. Gulf of Mexico was flat. Seismic didn't really contribute much. So really, I was surprised by the strength of your other businesses in U.S. land. And given your outlook for the second half of the year, do you think it's reasonable, even in a flat rig-count environment, that Schlumberger can continue to show sequential improvement in the back half of the year, both in revenues and margins in U.S. land? And can you give us a little bit more color around what's really driving that improvement?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, just to clarify, the Q2 performance, we had very good performance in the Gulf of Mexico, the rig-related businesses, while the multiclient sales were more or less flat with Q1. So I would say that the Gulf of Mexico had a positive impact on the overall results, while multiclient sales were basically flat. Now we also had steady activity in pricing in the Wireline and Drilling businesses on U.S. land, while the Canada break-up impact came in as expected. So the main downwards pressure we saw in addition was the continued pricing and cost challenges in hydraulic fracturing. So whether the nonperformance from our side on U.S. land is sustainable, I think it's too early to say. I think it's going to be mainly a function around what the rig count is going to be. I think it's very clear that the hydraulic fracturing margins are going to continue down in Q3. We are still bidding lower in the liquids basins as of today. So if you look at it, both liquids and gas pricing is now about 20% down from the peak, and quite a few of these contracts have not yet been implemented. So I would say the liquid -- the margins in hydraulic fracturing is coming down. And to what extent we can offset that will obviously be a function of continued activity in the Gulf of Mexico, and we are heading into the hurricane season, which also brings some uncertainty. So we're obviously well positioned to offset the hydraulic fracturing, but to what extent we can do it is still a bit uncertain.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And you had some significant great performance in Europe, Russia and Africa. It seems like it was pretty evenly distributed. In the second half of the year, you've mentioned that Russia is going to be your fastest growing market. How would you characterize the North Sea and Africa relative to Russia as you head into the back half of the year?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I said that Russia -- as we indicated at the beginning of the year, we had identified Russia to be one of our fastest growing markets. What we said was that within ECA, sub-Sahara Africa offshore and the North Sea offshore would be significant growth drivers. We continue to see them as strong growth drivers in the second half of the year. And at the same time, in ECA, we had North Africa land and Russia land generally as strong growth drivers as well, and we maintain those views. Now all these growth outlooks and expectations, we have to tie in this whole, overall macro uncertainty, as I mentioned in my prepared notes. But overall, the market progressed in Q2 as we were expecting in the international market, and ECA, I think, did slightly better than what we were expecting.","Operator","Our next question comes from James West with Barclays.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, I wanted to ask you a question about one of the comments you made towards the end of your prepared statements. You were talking about, I guess, in the press release and your comments, about the solid execution for the quarter, which was pretty obvious in the numbers. And you highlighted additional actions to really extend this leadership position. You already have, of course, industry-leading margins in North America, it looks like now, and of course internationally. And I'd like, I guess, if you could perhaps elaborate on what these both internal and external actions may be, and if possible, what kind of additional leadership that could add to your margin profile.","Paal Kibsgaard","I'll give you a brief outline of what they are. So generally, they are focusing on both operational quality and operational efficiency. So I think we mentioned earlier that we've had a strong focus on the quality of operations now for a number of years. Actually, we started this Excellence in Execution initiative back in 2008, driving quality. And if you look at our nonproductive time in our worldwide operations at this stage, we are now about 50% down compared to where we were when we started off back in 2008. And this is driven by the engineering and manufacturing of our products and making these more reliable. It's also driven around the investment in training and competency management and also a very strong focus on project preparation and process discipline. What we have augmented this Excellence in Execution drive with recently, or more recently, is the initiatives around operational efficiency or cost management, right? So this revolves around global supply chain and category management. We have a significant part of our organization occupied with shared services and transactional activities, and also things around asset utilization and global distribution. So all these elements, given our size and our footprint and our reach, represent a significant part of our cost base. And by driving efficiency even in small percentages with such a sizable organization, has a direct -- quite a meaningful impact to the bottom line, right? So -- but I would say that most of these or all these projects are multiyear projects, and you will see gradual impact over time.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, okay, that's very helpful. And then just one follow-up on the pricing side. You elaborated on gaining some pricing traction in the market and getting a premium for some of your services. Did we see the benefits of that in the second quarter? Is that going to be second half and '13? So I guess what I'm asking is, is there more margin uplift from pricing coming?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, we saw some impact of, I would say, international pricing in the quarter, right? So I indicated in the Q1 call that we saw pricing sentiment starting to turn more positive. And I think that trend continued during the second quarter, also driven by strong growth in activity, which leads to further tightening of capacity. We continue to test pricing on these smaller contracts with actually quite good success rate during the second quarter. And also, we saw more technology sell-up within the existing contracts, which has a quick fall-through to the bottom line within the current quarter, right? I would say the other key thing that we observed during this quarter is that the high offshore rig rates and in projects with tight project schedules, we see our customers elevating their focus on operational excellence and willingness to actually pay for it, right? And this enabled us, in some cases, to win contracts at very good pricing premiums due to the quality of our performance. So Q2 was a step in the right direction, provided that the macro uncertainty doesn't have a negative impact going forward. I think it's reasonable to believe that this could continue into the second half of the year.","Operator","We'll go next to Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Paal, I have to just get a little bit more color on that very last thing you said there, win contracts with -- despite considerable pricing premium. Could you just elaborate a little bit? Is this -- how wide and what technologies? And where do you see this ability?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, in the contracts where we manage to secure a contract at pricing premiums, a lot of this has -- revolves around, I would say, Wireline and the Drilling segments. So this is -- in terms of the number of them, I mean, it's not prolific around the world yet. But at least we see a correlation between higher rig rates and more focus on operational excellence from our customers, where the actual pricing they pay for our services versus the negative impact of poor performance from the services they buy, they put a lot more focus on that.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Whereabouts -- any geographic nature to this? Any area where this is more common?","Paal Kibsgaard","Now, you would typically see this in highly complex offshore type of operations around the world...","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","[indiscernible] your competitors make some very aggressive claims with respect to market share gains, whatever. Are we seeing certain competitors not being able to perform? Is that it, people are out of capacity and not able to execute what they have taken? Or are there other reasons?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I don't know what the drivers behind their results, but I would just say that we continue to replace our competitors on key projects and on key rigs. So this whole focus around operational integrity and quality is, I would say, is now become quite a significant market share driver. So we've been quoting this D&M replacement ratio number over the past couple of quarters. And that number, again, this quarter, was 39 to 6. So we replaced our competitors 39 times. We were replaced 6 times. So that ratio is maintained. And I would say that the driver behind that is being able to perform within the contracts that you initially win. So the key is to win the contract on reasonable pricing to allow you to invest and perform. That's really the only way to maintain the contracts in the international market.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And you're doing that with incremental pricing power?","Paal Kibsgaard","Oh, yes, we are not going in to replace our competitors at their pricing or at the average pricing. We need a premium to do that.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just then to my real question, which was actually more about North America. Did you get helped sequentially by multiclient sales or any other kind of factor that artificially -- not artificially, but more one-off type kind of goosed up your North America margins?","Paal Kibsgaard","No, multiclient sales in North America were flat sequentially. So we had strong performance in the Gulf of Mexico in terms of the deepwater operations overall. And that obviously helped, but it wasn't -- there wasn't a significant boost. We were hoping to see a significant boost around the June lease sales. That did not really materialize. So multiclient sales were flat sequentially. So there weren't really anything exceptional in North America this quarter.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then finally on IsoMetrix, I mean, you're creating quite a stir in the industry now with this technology. Can you talk a little bit about the testing phase implementation of this technology adoption? I presume given this is, I think, the biggest R&D project in the history of Schlumberger, you want a big -- you want to be paid for it. So what do you think the customer willingness will be to pay up for something that is traditionally viewed as a commodity?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, it's a bit early to say what they're willing to pay for. You're right in saying that this is one of the biggest engineering projects we have undertaken as a company. And with those kinds of investments and with the value that this technology is going to bring, we obviously want to be paid a fair price for that in relation to what value it brings. So our plan for this year is that we are going to run one vessel with the IsoMetrix streamers on -- or the Nessie-6 streamers on, and then we will do a ramp-up next year. We haven't really finalized the plan for CapEx investment in this for next year, but I'm quite confident that we are going to be able to get a good pricing premium on this technology in the market.","Operator","Your next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons Company.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Continuing with the seismic theme, Paal, positive outlook extolled by everybody and yet the WesternGeco backlog was flat quarter-on-quarter. How do we reconcile those 2?","Paal Kibsgaard","I don't think our backlog was flat.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","It was flat to up. It wasn't up markedly, I don't think, I mean, perhaps -- yes.","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay. Well, I don't really have any specific comment on the backlog other than we maintain quite a positive view on the outlook for the market. If you look at the Q2 results, they were pretty much in line with what we were expecting. We took the opportunity to reposition some of our vessels and also to do some dry dock maintenance of them. But beyond that, utilization was quite good. Looking forward to Q3, we are now fully sold out, and we're actually also already 60% booked for Q4. So the main question mark this year has actually been, \"Are we going to avoid the seasonal lull that we typically get in Q4?\" And at this stage, I think we have a reasonable chance of avoiding that with being so much booked already.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. And then were -- was seismic, in the second quarter internationally, was it additive to margins, to overall international margins in Q2?","Paal Kibsgaard","We don't really give details of this, right? So I would just say that the -- there was a good progression of seismic performance between Q1 and Q2. But in terms of specifics on margin and percentages, we don't disclose that.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","But that should continue in the third quarter, especially with a strong North Sea season and also beginning to get traction on your P&L with regard to pricing. I mean, is that fair?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think that's fair, yes.","Operator","We now have a question from Jim Crandell with Dahlman Rose.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Paal, I'd like to ask a different question about the seismic business. Is -- how far out can you see now for tightness in marine seismic supply, demand? What is this meaning to pricing currently? And then -- so the last piece of that is, what are your plans in terms of adding new marine vessel capacity to the market?","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay. Well, if you look at our visibility in terms of bookings, beyond Q4 we don't really have any clear visibility on how the quarters are going to shape up. But I would say this year looks strong. If you look at the total market of high-capacity vessels today, total market is around 62, out of which WesternGeco has 16. So we are seeing that there is overall new-build from several of the players, of which we have 2 new-build vessels coming online in 2014. So our view on new-builds is twofold. We will add capacity if we can get the needed utilization. But we also have a vessel replacement program, which is basically retiring some of our older vessels and replacing them by new higher capacity ones, right? So depending on where we are in 2014, when the these new vessels are becoming available, we will make a call on actually whether we extend the life of the ones that we have or we actually retire them and maintain capacity flat. So it's all about ensuring utilization in marine seismic. And beyond that, we obviously want to make sure that we capture some of the upside of activity, if that was to materialize. But at this stage, I would say that we have a positive view on this year, and provided that there's no dramatic change to the overall market, that should spill into 2013 as well, most likely.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","How is pricing on new contracts, Paal, for -- that you've been able to sign for start-up in Q3 and Q4?","Paal Kibsgaard","Pricing is similar to what I said in the Q1 call. We are bidding more or less 10% up year-on-year. You will still find in Q3 that you'll have a mix of contracts bid last year and contracts bid this year, right? So you won't have that full 10% impact on the P&L, but overall again positive sentiments on seismic.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just my follow-up question, Paal, is you and particularly others have mentioned the price competitiveness of the deepwater LWD and Wireline markets. And, I mean, it's ironic to me, in a way, that the segment offering the highest technology should be among the most price competitive parts of the market. Can you see this changing over the second half of the year with even more new rigs starting up? Or do you think that this, I don't know, could be the new norm for the couple years, that this segment is just going to be highly price competitive because, maybe, of the desire of some of your competitors to maintain\/increase market share?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I wouldn't generalize competitive pricing in the overall deepwater market. If you look at our position in the deepwater market, whether it's for Drilling & Measurements or Wireline, this is where we have the highest pricing and the highest margins of these type of businesses. So in some of the large contracts revolving around this, there might be quite competitive bidding. But overall, our deepwater business for both of these segments is highly accretive to our margins.","Operator","We now have a question from Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil.","William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Paal, I just want to circle back again on the -- to see if you could put some context around the small contracts comment internationally, and maybe just, for us, what that means for Schlumberger as we think about these contracts kind of as a percentage of your revenue internationally, because I think the market really focuses a lot on the large competitive bid tenders. But my understanding for you is that, really, that's a relatively small part of kind of the international global picture, if you will, in terms of from a revenue contribution. So I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about the smaller contracts and how that affects your revenue stream. And also just talk about, within this pricing comment, do the contracts, typically on these smaller contracts -- are they shorter term in nature internationally than what is typically believed as being 2, 3-year type contract terms in the international market in general, so you get quicker terms on these smaller contracts as we think about pricing escalation opportunities in future quarters?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, if we start off with the first part of the question. The large contracts, as you say, or the ones that have been quoted in previous quarters, they make up, I would say, less than 20% of our overall contract volumes. So they are significant in terms of their size and duration, and they're often very strategic to secure. But as an overall part of the volume, it is not that big, so -- which means that it's the smaller contracts that make up more of a significant part of our international portfolio. The duration of these contracts vary a fair bit. It could be one well; it could be one project. So it's a bit difficult to quantify exactly what the average here is, right? But generally, they will be multiyear, typically, unless you're just bidding for one particular exploration well.","William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And I guess maybe this question is for Simon, just is a question on Geco. It's been for several quarters since you all have broken out what the revenue contribution is in absolute terms from Geco. I think the last time you guys were reporting on a quarterly basis, it was running on an annual basis somewhere in that $2-billion to $2.5-billion range. I mean, still given just the tailwinds in that business and the optimism around it, are you all able to size for us, Simon, where that revenue stream kind of stands right now for Schlumberger as a whole?","Simon Ayat","Well, you can assume that it is growing slightly. It is more or less what you mentioned, but the growth is reflective of the rest of the business, yes.","William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And you'd say it's probably growing at a higher rate -- a higher top line rate than maybe some of the other businesses.","Simon Ayat","It is higher than some of the other businesses, but overall, it's reflective of what we are experiencing with the Oilfield Services.","Operator","And we'll go next to Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And, Paal, I wanted to follow up on your -- you've mentioned uncertainty a few times with respect to outlook, and yet when I think about the volume of business in the second half and even into early '13 that's offshore, you've got pretty long-term commitments in terms of operator commitments to the rigs. Can you, perhaps, clarify what you mean by uncertainty? Are you really speaking to black swan event, something like we saw in '08, or something more -- a more marginal degradation?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think it's all relative, right? I would just say that the -- in the event there is a significant event in the global economy, whether that is linked to China or Europe or it could be geopolitical, that could have an impact on -- even on shorter term activity, if cash flow comes into question. But I agree with you. In international markets, a significant part of the contract base is longer term and generally should be robust. But we saw significant volatility in the second quarter in terms of the global markets. And that volatility could bring some more caution into some of the -- some of how the operators, how they plan to go forward with activity. Now we have not seen any signs of change or any difference in plans versus what we had a quarter ago. But I think there is significant market uncertainties in the global market, and I think it's just prudent to point that out.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And the Excellence in Execution, help me delineate down 3 tracks in terms of what you're doing on internal processes with respect to procurement and supply chain management. There's also the focus on field efficiencies through the asset-light model and even selling and leasing queue as opposed to using your own crews. And then the technology route, like the highway or if we go back in time, something more like Platform Express, where I'm going with this is perhaps if you could maybe allocate what you think in terms of contribution by each of those 3 buckets and give us a sense as to whether this is really something that can continue over time, or whether it's something that's going to be quite lumpy and dramatic in one period and then stabilize and stair-step.","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I would say all 3 elements, whether this is, like you say, technology -- I mean, technology has always been a key part of how we generate value and how we [indiscernible]. And the 2 other ones, which are more the shared services and supply chain part, as well as the field operation and utilization, the latter 2 has, I would say, still significant upside given the size of our global operations. So these multiyear programs I'm referring to, I believe they will be meaningful over time. But they're not going to have any dramatic quarter impact this quarter or next quarter or so forth, right? It's going to be part of a continuous improvement process where we put a lot more focus, and I would say scientific approaches, into some of the other parts of the company rather than just the technology that we develop and that we deploy for our customers. So there is significant upside in terms of how we run as a company for those internal aspects. And these are initiatives and programs that we are going to be carrying forward for the next 3, 4, 5 years, and they would have a gradual impact in terms of our results.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So it sounds pretty uniform across all 3, if I could sort of rephrase it. And the kind of trend that we've seen, which suggests 150 plus or minus basis points per annum, is reasonable to assume going forward.","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I'm not going to give you any margin other [ph] than [indiscernible]. You knew that, didn't you? But I would say that we are continuously focused on driving our margins up, whether that is pricing, technology or these other efficiency programs.","Operator","We have a question from David Anderson with JPMorgan.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A question on Latin America. Paal, you guys seem to be in a really great position relative to your competitors down there. Just hoping you could help me understand a little bit more about the growth opportunities you see evolving over the next 12 to 24 months. I guess, there's 3 areas in particular -- and correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like there's 3 main areas for you guys. First is production management contracts. You just announced another one starting up in Ecuador and the Mexico contract. Second would be Brazil, kind of how the pre-salt is evolving and all the contracts letting out. And the third would be Argentina. Obviously, what's going on with YPF and kind of the uncertainty around there. Could you just kind of address those 3 areas for us and how you see them evolving, please?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, sure. So I can take you quickly around the main countries there, right? So if you look at Mexico, I think Mexico has, so far this year, been one of the main drivers for Latin America for us. And going forward, we see further rig additions on land and shallow offshore in the second half of the year. Pemex is evaluating the Eagle Ford south extension as well and there are some both shale gas and shale oil pilots upcoming there, and we are engaged there with our shale workflow. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we also won the Panuco block, together with Petrofrac, in the second round of production incentive contracts. So overall, Mexico, with both the IPM activity, the individual products and services we do with Pemex, as well as these production incentive contracts, provides a very strong basis for growth and performance going forward. If we jump to Brazil, we see deepwater rig counts growing in the second half of the year. It's been relatively flat-ish in both Q1 and Q2, as a number of new rigs were arriving and being commissioned. So there's still, I would say, strong growth likely to take place in Brazil in the second part of the year. And a key, again, in Brazil is going to be linked to the outcome of these significant bids that are still under evaluation from Petrobras. In Argentina, we also maintain, I would say, a good activity outlook, driven by both the shale gas and shale oil, as well as on the conventional. There's some short-term uncertainty as the situation around YPF settles, but I would say that medium to longer term, our view on Argentina is still positive. And then the other one that we -- I think you referred to is Ecuador, where we are very pleased with how the start-up of the Shushufindi SPM project has progressed. And the activity in Ecuador, both on this project, Shushufindi, as well in the general market there, is going to continue to ramp up in the second half.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","If I could just go back to Brazil. Have you seen much of a change in how Petrobras is going about their business with a new CEO, Gra\u00e7as Foster, in place? I mean, is there a sense that pricing might be getting a little bit better? Is there a sense that maybe technology is going to be more of a focus? What are you seeing out of them, kind of late -- over the last 6 months or so?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I wouldn't say that there has been a significant change in how they go about doing their contracting. I would say that is generally because most of these bids have been in process throughout that period, right? So if there's going to be any change, I would expect that to maybe be in the next round of things, although they haven't really indicated anything. So I think the way they're going about their business in this bidding round is similar to what they've done in the past.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So really no change in pricing. Pricing still kind of challenged right now. You're hoping to get in there, show them -- show you can do the performance and hopefully the next round, you get better pricing. Is that the strategy?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, we always, in any bid that we submit, we will bid it at the level that we can make the contract into a productive contract for Schlumberger and our shareholders. So there's a plan of how we can perform within the contract in terms of execution. And also, we have a very rich technology portfolio in terms of what we will introduce over the next coming years. And some of these Petrobras contracts could be off to, what, 6 to 8 years, right? So there's a significant new technology component of these contracts as well going forward.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And these bids, you're expecting to be awarded -- is it third quarter time frame for some of these bids?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, Petrobras hasn't really given us any timeline, so we will await when they announce.","Operator","We now have a question from Nigel Browne with Macquarie.","Nigel Browne - Macquarie Research","I just had one question, more product related. I wanted to know in terms of North America and internationally how impactful was your Artificial Lift and rotary steerable product line? And then, following on that, what is your estimation about the penetration of rotary steerable drilling systems in North America versus some of the more conventional techniques?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, we don't really provide details of -- by segments. If you look at Artificial Lift, that is part of the Production Group. So really, the only detail I can refer you to is the Production Group results. And furthermore, we don't provide specific details around technologies as well, and rotary steerable being one of them. I would say, though, on rotary steerable in North America, our new PowerDrive Archer technology, which we have introduced recently, has been, I would say, tailor-made for the North America land market with the high build rate that it can provide. So I would say that the penetration of rotary steerable in the North America land market, at the back end of that technology, should go up from our side. But beyond that, I won't be able to provide you with any more details.","Nigel Browne - Macquarie Research","Okay. But even anecdotally, are you seeing any sort of leading indicators or queries around electric submersible pumps in North America at all?","Paal Kibsgaard","On land?","Nigel Browne - Macquarie Research","Yes, on land.","Paal Kibsgaard","On land, generally, there are other type of pumps employed in the North America land market, if you're referring to unconventional, not really ESPs.","Nigel Browne - Macquarie Research","Okay, so it's still a rodless market predominantly.","Paal Kibsgaard","Predominantly, yes.","Operator","We now have a question from Doug Becker with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Paul, you reiterated your expectation that international activity would grow in excess of 10%. If we take a look at the Baker Hughes rig count, it's implying a first half increase of around 5% year-over-year. Just trying to get a sense, is this consistent with a very aggressive ramp in the second half of the year? And is that Schlumberger's expectation? Or is there just a measurement difference in what you're looking at versus the Baker Hughes rig count?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think it might be a slight measurement difference. I think you'll see that the offshore rig rate will be, at least the way we see it, will be up more than what the land rig rate -- sorry, land rig count is, right? So you will have more growth in offshore versus land. And the impact of the offshore is, obviously, significantly higher to our -- both our revenue and our margins, right? So I think you need to break it down to offshore and land.","Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Makes sense. And since we have pretty good visibility into the offshore rigs, I mean, is there a potential that this significant ramp in the offshore rigs, we finally see the scales tipping in favor of the service companies for pricing power? Or is it because this growth is pretty well anticipated, still the slow grind higher?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, as I was referring to earlier, there is a tie between higher rig rates and more focus on operational excellence in the way our customers select their providers. So I would say that higher rig rates tied to utilization will potentially create more potential for us to raise prices and to get some of the value back for the strong performance that we deliver.","Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then switching to Europe, Africa, CIS. I just want to get some sense for the sustainability of revenue and margins there. A very strong quarter. I haven't heard anything that would suggest that we should see any type of pullback in the third quarter. I guess execution is always an issue. But is there anything that would suggest the second quarter revenue and margins aren't a good base to be thinking about going forward in Europe, Africa, CIS?","Paal Kibsgaard","No, I would just say, with the exception of the overall macro caveat that I've referred to a couple of times, there is nothing exceptional in the results of ECA this quarter. So if the activity remains on track the way we have predicted it during the year, this should potentially continue in the second half of the year.","Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Are there still synergies associated with the Eurasia, I guess I'll call swap? Or have those largely been realized at this point?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, the overall integration of what we received versus what we sold is more or less done, so that part of synergies and the transaction is done. The other part of this is that this has given us access to significantly more land rigs in Western Siberia, to the point that we are extremely busy on land in Western Siberia, and we are actually struggling at this stage to have enough capacity to serve all the rigs. So there is still, I would say, performance upside surrounding the transaction we did with Eurasia as we continue to ramp up to cover all of their rigs.","Operator","We have a question from Robin Shoemaker with Citi.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I want to ask about the investment you made recently in Anton Oilfield Services as a strategy for China. But more broadly, in what countries or markets you think that having stake in a local service company is the route that -- one of the major routes that you'll use to grow in that market?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, if I attack the second part of the question first. I think in the high-volume markets, the key high-volume markets around the world, there is often a benefit of owning or having interests in local companies, mainly because they know the local conditions, and in some cases they have technologies that are more custom made for the local environment, right? And we have some of these companies in North America. We got them with the Smith transaction. We have, over time, acquired a number of these types of companies in Russia. And we have now taken a stake in this company in China.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So let me just switch my other question back to North America. In terms of -- I think most of your fleets are -- your fracturing fleets are working in the term market as opposed to spot contracts. But is there a tendency over time for fewer term contracts to be signed, more fleets working in the spot market? And is there a level of pricing at which you would idle -- have -- prefer to have your fleets idle as opposed to working in -- at very low spot market rates?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, so today, we operate roughly around 80% in terms of term contracts. The remaining 20% will generally be fleets that are in between, I would say, in between work. So generally, at this stage, we'll be happy to go more or less to 100% term contracts the way it is set up. Is there a limit as to what pricing we would take on? I would say that we are not really in the business of taking on loss-making contracts. So that's where generally we would draw the line at this stage.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And do you have any idle fracturing fleets in North America now, or purposely or due to market conditions?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, if you look at what we've done in North America, we have completed the repositioning of our fleet and we have stopped further CapEx additions. And what we have done in addition to that, we have parked the excess pumps that we have at this stage. And the reason why we have excess pumps, we're not running fewer crews than what we did 3 or 6 months ago. But with the continued transition of activity from the dry gas basins to the liquids, the number of horsepower needed on a liquids job is significantly lower than what you need on a dry gas job. And that's why you -- while you run the same number of crews, you will have actually excess horsepower. And that's really what's driving the oversupply in the markets. So we have parked those pumps because we have no need for them.","Operator","And our final question will come from Michael Urban with Deutsche Bank.","Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","On the international side, good rundown of a lot of the markets, and it seems like most international markets are strong, if not accelerating. Are there any markets out there that are still weak or underperforming or maybe not where you'd like them to be?","Paal Kibsgaard","In the international market?","Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes.","Paal Kibsgaard","No, not really, nothing that stands out. I think we have -- we see good performance versus the overall plan that we put in for this year throughout, more or less. So no, there's nothing that really stands out.","Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then finally on Russia, specifically, you've highlighted it as a very good market for you, and it seems like you're continuing to invest in the market. Are you -- is that more a function of just the higher volumes and the higher activity levels you're seeing? Or are you beginning to see better technology uptake there? I kind of think of Russia as maybe a little bit more volume driven, lower technology, perhaps with exception of things like Sakhalin.","Paal Kibsgaard","I think, historically, you're right. And largely in the Western Siberia land market, it is relatively low technology or local technology still today. But there is -- I would say there is a continued drive to upgrade some of these land rigs to higher capacity. And this provides a lot more opportunity to deploy more high-end technology, right, so -- which for instance, the transaction with Eurasia, where we have significantly opened up the rig footprint that we have available to us, as the technology needs grows on these rigs that they over time get upgraded, that is again a significant opportunity for us to drive [indiscernible] deployment on the, I would say, the basic footprint of Russian technology that we have acquired over the past decade.","Malcolm Theobald","On behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I'd like to thank you for participating in today's call.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.","Simon Farrant","Good morning, good afternoon and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2017 earnings call. Today\u2019s call is being hosted from New York, following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Schorn, Executive Vice-President New Ventures. We will, as usual, first go through our prepared remarks, after which we will open up for questions. For today\u2019s agenda, Simon will first today comment on our third quarter financial performance before Patrick reviews our results by geography. Paul will close our remarks with the discussion of our technology portfolio and our updated view of the industry macro.","However, before we begin I would like to remind the participants that some of the statements we\u2019ll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements.","I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K fillings and other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our third quarter press release, which is on our website.","Finally, after our prepared remarks we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period, in order to allow more time for others who maybe in the queue.","Now, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Simon Ayat.","Simon Ayat","Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits was $0.42. This represents an increase of $0.07 sequentially and $0.17 when compared to the same quarter last year. ","During the quarter, we recorded a $0.03 of Cameron merger and integration charges. Our third quarter revenue of $7.9 billion increased 6% sequentially. Pre-tax operating margins increased 103 basis points to 9.2%. Highlights by product group were as follows: Third quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.8 billion increased 1% sequentially, while margin increased 56 basis points to 17.6%, primarily due to strong wireline activity, largely in Russia and Central Asia.","Drilling Group revenue of $2.1 billion increased by 1% sequentially, while margins of 14.2% were essentially flat as directional drilling activity on land in North America continue to improve. ","Production Group revenue of $2.9 billion increased 15% sequentially, while margin expanded by 62 basis points to 9.8%. These results were driven by strong pressure pumping activity in North America land.","Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion increased 3% sequentially, while margin increased 61 basis points to 13.8%. These results were largely driven by higher product sales in surface systems in North America.","One, Subsea margins exceeded 20% for the 5th straight quarter. The book-to-bill ratio for our long-cycle business was 0.8 in Q3. The effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 18.4% in the third quarter compared to 18.9% in the previous quarter. ","We generated $1.9 billion of cash flow from operations during the quarter. This included a federal tax refund in the U.S. working capital consume $134 million of cash, largely due to the increase in activity. Working capital also reflected the payment of $114 million in severance during the quarter.","We remain on track to achieve our cash flow generation target for the year. Our net debt improved by $385 million during the quarter to $12.2 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $5 billion. ","During the quarter, we spend $98 million to repurchase 1.5 million shares at an average price of $66.04. As we previously highlighted, we have reduced our buyback activity during the quarter in light of the pending OneStim and EDC transactions, as well as various SPM opportunity.","Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $600 million on CapEx and investments of approximately $165 million in SPM projects. During the quarter we also made $693 million of dividend payments. Full year 2017 CapEx excluding SPM and multiclient investments is now expected to be approximately $2.1 billion.","And now I would turn the conference over to Patrick. ","Patrick Schorn","Thank you, Simon and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results were solid, driven by the strength of the North America land market and by growth in key international markets, like Russia, the North Sea and Asia. Elsewhere activity was largely flat sequentially.","The quarter\u2019s performance was led by the Production Group, with strong revenue growth in North America, as hydraulic fracturing activity continue to increase. The Middle East also contributed to the growth of the group, through increased activity on unconventional resources development projects.","Reservoir Characterization Group results were higher on solid summer drilling campaigns in Russia and the North Sea. Although exploration related activity worldwide remained very weak. The Drilling Group also improved, driven by stronger directional drilling activity in North America, which more than offset the completion of integrated drilling services project in the Middle East and Mexico.","At Cameron, OneSubsea continue to deliver strong margins for the 5th straight quarter. At the same time, CAMShale fluid delivery and fracturing services are now deployed on about half of all Schlumberger fracturing job in North America realizing one of the targeted synergy benefits of the acquisition.","Looking at North America in detail, revenue grew 18% sequentially driven by continued growth for both our production and drilling related businesses, with our hydraulic fracturing revenue increasing 42% sequentially. Over the past two quarters, we have more than doubled the number of active frac fleets in the North America and we have at present deployed close to all of our idle capacity in preparation for the additional capacity that will become available after closing the OneStim transaction with Weatherford.","While the strength in our hydraulic fracturing activity combined with market share gains and continued pricing traction drove significant sequential revenue growth for the production group in North America land it also inevitably led to some transition related cost and inefficiencies resulting from the rapid ramp up in activity, which impacted incremental margins. However, this impact will abate in the coming quarters.","The Drilling Group product lines also benefited from the continued growth in North America land rig activity in the third quarter. Demands for our advanced road restorable systems remained at sold out levels as our customers continue to move towards longer laterals. Given the demand for our drilling technology offering, we have ramped up manufacturing capacity and will dedicate more CapEx towards the North America land drilling market in the coming years.","Before I comment on the international markets, I would like to update you on our SPM project in North America, where we continue to make in-roads in the third quarter. After one year of operations on the SM Energy project in the Powder River Basin, we are currently drilling and completing the 11th well. The production wells we have designed drilled and completed all produced in the top quartile of the field driven by optimized well placement and an engineered approach to completion and stimulation.","Based on the success of the partnership between SM Energy and SPM, we are making steps to develop the business model further in cooperation, alignment and scope. As announced at the end of the second quarter, we've also secured a new SPM project with Torxen in Western Canada where we started up operation in August with four wells drilled so far. Yesterday, we announced that we together with our partner Torxen also have acquired a neighboring Palliser Block making this project the largest in scope within our current portfolio.","The SM Energy and Torxen projects demonstrated the SPM opportunity set that is available to us in North America. These projects also show how we are effectively diversifying and building out our SPM portfolio from the initial start in Malaysia, Romania and Ecuador where we created the technical and commercial expertise that today serves as the foundation for this new and exciting part of our offering.","Internationally, revenue was up 2% sequentially excluding Cameron where the long cycle businesses as expected are still seeing noticeable sequential declines. Europe\/CIS\/Africa area revenue was 7% higher sequentially including Cameron due to strong summer activity in Russia and Central Asia, the United Kingdom and Continental Europe and in Norway and Denmark.","In Russia and Central Asia, land activity was very strong during the summer, driven by well construction services, wireline logging and artificial lift system sales. Russia is a strong market that steady adds reserves through the drill bits and our performance continues to benefit from the extensive investments we have made in the country in personnel, infrastructure, local manufacturing and support over the past 15 years.","Activity in West Africa remained stable in the third quarter with limited additions to the rig count. However, project planning and tendering reached a two year high with new offshore project start-ups anticipated in early 2018. These projects are clear opportunities for our integrated drilling service product line and we continue to see an increasing interest for performance based drilling contract in shallow water including the jackup rig market.","In North Africa activity remains low although we were able to return to drilling services and continue well intervention operations in Libya as security improved during the third quarter.","Middle East and Asia area revenue was up 1% sequentially excluding Cameron as strong production and drilling group activity in the Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, Far East and Australia and South and East Asia GeoMarkets was largely offset by the completion of integrated drilling services projects in Iraq.","Activity growth in Saudi Arabia was driven by improved productivity in our unconventional resources project, which enabled us to complete a higher stage count. However adverse weather which disrupted WesternGeco land seismic activity partially offset these gains. In Asia, activity strengthened in Indonesia on increasing rig count and market share, while Australia benefited from higher demand for hydraulic fracturing and drilling services.","China improved with increased production services and higher seasonal activity and new technology deployments for shale and tight gas development. Revenue in the Latin America area decreased 5% sequentially excluding Cameron mainly due to lower multiclient seismic sales and the completion of integrated drilling services projects in the Mexico and Central America GeoMarket.","Revenue in the North and South Latin America GeoMarkets was essentially flat with previous quarters with stable SPM project activity in Ecuador and as we prepared to start up our YPF SPM project towards the end of this year. As there has been a lot of attention around our SPM activity in Ecuador including recent reports with incorrect analysis and conclusions, let me close my remarks by clarifying where we currently stand.","During the third quarter, we reached an agreement with our partners Petroamazonas and the government of Ecuador to settle our overdue receivable balance in the country. With the first payment milestones related to these discussions already completed during the quarter. Based on a joint review of the future development and investment plan for the field we've also revised the tariff relating to the Shushufindi contract and added a future severance payment guarantee.","This was done to ensure that this long-term contract remains viable for both parties going forward. It is also important to point out that on a going forward basis the new terms of the Shushufindi contract still need our established investment criteria. At present, production from the Shushufindi field has been restored and is now in-line with the current reservoir performance potential.","I now hand the call back to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Patrick. Before I comment on the business outlook, I would like to talk about technology. And in particular how we continue to build out our offering to create an unmatched upstream technology platform where the individual products and services has the industry\u2019s lowest cost of ownership and where the collective offering is readymade for broad-based system integration.","This direction will first ensure that we become even more competitive in the markets where the prevailing business model is focused on lowest price for basic standalone products and services. And second, it will enable us to better serve the growing number of customers who favor integrated and performance based contracts, which is directionally where we see the industry heading.","This includes extending our ownership of hardware, software and domain expertise into new market segments. As well as teaming up with companies like Google and Microsoft to capitalize on the latest advances in digital technology enablement.","So what is the basis for our pursuit of technology system integration and why do we see hardware ownerships as a critical element of this strategy? Today the broad and complex EMP industry workflows are still predominantly enabled by discrete and fragmented products and services with the dividing lines between the various work packages defined by our customers contracting framework, which was established decades ago.","These artificial dividing lines make sense at the time of creation when the technology systems were made up of a limited number of isolated hardware building blocks and the value of software and data was still nascent.","With the complexity of today\u2019s oil field operations and the advances made in other industries in terms of total system performance, it is clear that replacing our industry\u2019s fragmented approach with a new focus on complete technology systems holds a massive performance upside.","In response to this we have over the past seven years continued to build out our technology offering in terms of hardware, software and domain expertise. Where we today have the ownership and technical capabilities to develop these complete technology systems, driven by the following key beliefs.","First, we believe that innovating across the artificial dividing lines of today\u2019s individual work packages to create hardware technology with a broader scope, a smaller footprint and fewer interfaces holds huge upside potential in terms of both hardware costs and performance. The way we are integrating and innovating around the drilling bottomhole assembly is an example of this. ","Second, we believe that the next step change in industry performance will come from developing complete technology systems based on streamline and redefine end-to-end workflows, which integrates all hardware and software components. What we are doing with the rig of the future is an example of this. And third we believe that in order to maximize the performance of the EMP industry workflows it is essential to leverage the latest advances in digital technologies. ","We achieve this by making these enabling technologies an integral part of the new hardware and software technology systems as opposed to attaching them on top of the outdated and fragmented technologies of yesterday. What we are doing with DELFI, which was introduced at the FAS Global Forum during the third quarter is an example of this. DELFI is our new cognitive E&P environment that leverages the latest advances in data security analytics, machines learning, high performance computing, as well as teamwork and collaboration to drive total system performance.","The DELFI environment provides a new way of working for the asset teams by strengthening the integration between the technical domains and by enabling our customers and software partners throughout their own intellectual property and workflows through the system. With the launch of DELFI we have also deployed an E&P data lake on the Google Cloud platform comprising more than 1000 3D seismic surveys, 5 million wells, 1 million well logs and 400 million production records from around the world demonstrating a step change in system scalability.","DELFI will ultimately cover all industry workflows however the initial focus is on drilling and well construction. In this respect the DrillPlan and DrillOps [ph] solutions will in the coming quarters be introduced to the market and this combined with our down hole hardware and the rig of the future will under the one drill offering create an unprecedented step change in drilling performance. ","So this summarizes the strategic rationale behind our pursuit of technology system integration and also explains why we see hardware ownership as a critical element of the strategy. Our commitment to technology leadership is stronger than ever as can be seen by how we have advanced our technology strategy during the downturn of the past three years. We are now ready to capitalize on these investments in close collaboration with our customers.","Let me next turn to the business environment where the reduction in global oil inventories in the third quarter clearly demonstrates that the oil market is now in balance, which is creating the required foundation for a further increase in the oil price and the inevitable growth in global E&P investments.","And while the timing and pace of the pending industry recovery is still not completely clear we now see a number of converging market factors that make us increasingly positive about the outlook for our global business. First and foremost the growth in oil demand continues to be very strong and importantly the upward growth revisions in 2017 were primarily seen in the OACD countries.","The demand growth outlook for 2018 is again expected to be north of 1.4 million barrels per day and is further supported by upward revisions in global GDP growth clearly suggesting that the demand side of the oil market equation is on a very solid footing.","Looking closer at the global oil inventory, we also believe that the current situation is more positive than what is reflected by the market. Today global inventory levels are down to 64 days of forward cover and the North American stocks are already down to 2014 levels.","Brent crude which is now in backwardation is seeing faster inventory draws and stocks are already approaching the five year average. In North America land where the E&P companies have added significant CapEx over the past year, the production growth is so far falling short of expectations, driven by supply chain inflation, operational inefficiencies and the need to step out from the Tier 1 acreage. This has led to a moderating investment appetite where the previous pursue to production growth is now being balanced out with an equal focus on generated solid financial returns and operating within cash flow.","This moderation can be seen in the flattening trend of the U.S. land rig count during the third quarter and it is also reflected in our customers\u2019 2018 activity outlook. The more tempered activity outlook for U.S. land combined with the short cycle nature of the business has an immediate impact on the outlook for production growth, which for 2017 and 2018 has been revised down by 100,000 and 500,000 barrels per day respectively. This clearly has a material impacts on the global supply and demand balance.","From the OPEC side compliance with the stated production cuts has been better than expected. At the same time comments from several of the key OPEC Gulf countries and from Russia suggest that an extension of the existing production cuts beyond the current agreement is a possibility although this may ultimately not be needed.","Looking at the ongoing activity and investment levels in the international markets outside OPEC Gulf and Russia, we have so far seen very limited growth since we reached bottom of the cycle in the first quarter of this year. However, we\u2019re seeing signs in many parts of the world of conventional land and offshore projects now being prepared for FID, and the total number of FIDs this year is double that of 2016.","It is also worth noting that our overall tendering activity in the international markets is also up by over 50% in 2017 compared to last year, measured in total contract value. And we expect these positive trends to strengthen further in the coming quarters. Based on the combination of all these factors, we\u2019re currently increasingly the positive on the overall outlook for our global business. It is still early to say what the specific impact on the 2018 E&P spend will be, as our customers are now in their planning process. But we do expect activity tailwinds in most part of the world in 2018.","In the meantime, we\u2019re fully focused on delivering industry leading products and services to our customers, and we also remain opportunistic with respect to making further strategic moves to position Schlumberger at the forefront of the industry as the global activity upturn slowly, but surely emerges.","Before we open up for questions, which will likely initially be focus on SPM, let me again reiterate the rationale and objectives behind our SPM investments, which has not changed over the past two years. SPM will not alter the phase of Schlumberger it will simply complement our core business where the objective is to grow SPM from the size of a product line today to the size of a group over the next five to seven years. Granted SPM has a different risk profile compared to our core business, but different does not mean higher.","The biggest risk to our full cycle returns in the core business is first the huge cost of scaling up and scaling down capacity in an increasingly volatile business environment. And second, failing to adjust our business approach in some of the large, but commoditized land markets around the world. Faced with these challenges, we\u2019ve concluded that a strategy of doing nothing new is simply not a strategy.","The SPM business model and contract duration significantly mitigates both of these core business risks, while in return we take on the reservoir risk and in certain cases higher counterparty risk. Our track record over the past 20 years of SPM activity shows that we\u2019re very good at managing the reservoir risk and we\u2019re also getting increasingly good at managing the counterparty party risk as demonstrated by how we have resolved the current and future payment situation in Ecuador.","So, in short, SPM helps mitigate some of the major risks in our core business. At the same time, we know very well how to manage the new risk we take on through the SPM model to the points where we see SPM in combination with our base business actually lowering our overall risk profile rather than increasing it.","In terms of returns, we have disclosed that over the past five years, the SPM business performance is highly accretive to both our operating margins and return on capital employed. So it should at least a crack at corresponding multiple to our core business. To realign our stated growth objects for SPM we are pursuing investments in new projects and the announcement made yesterday is in line with this strategy.","Lastly, let me also point out that SPM remains a small part of what we do as a company. And that the core of Schlumberger continues to be focused on our technology leadership where there are currently a lot of exiting things happening.","With that, lets open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","James West","Hey, good morning, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning, James.","James West","So, I'm going to skip SPM question, I\u2019ll let somebody else go after since I'm pretty comfortable there.","Paal Kibsgaard","Very good.","James West","I know it returns accretive. What I wanted to talk about and you highlighted a lot of this in your prepared commentary is international, Brent at you closing on 60 here all market fundamentals clearly better than there were a quarter or quarter two ago, which market I know you don't want to get into numbers yet because it's budgeting season et cetera which international markets that are at basically rock bottom right now, do you see probably turning the fact that as we go into \u201818 and maybe the back half of \u201918-19?","Paal Kibsgaard","Again, it's a bit difficult to say, but if we just go through the various parts of the international market, we were actually quite pleased with the activity we saw in Q3 in Europe, North Sea in particular as well as in Russia. The Gulf part of the Middle East remains also very solid. And then in addition to that you have Africa and Asia, where we saw basically flattish activity in Africa and we had some small encouraging signs of growth in Asia, while also Latin America was flattish.","So, I would say going forward I still think that the markets that would lead is slightly going to be Russia, Europe with the North Sea and the Middle East, but there are some emerging positive signs I would say in Asia. While Africa and Latin America is still looking flattish as of now. So, early to say, but for all markets I think we are at bottom and the encouraging signs as I mentioned in the prepaid remarks is that the number of FIDs overall this year is up by about 50%.","James West","Right.","Paal Kibsgaard","Lag on activity, but it's a positive sign as well as our tendering activity, which is also up in total contract value this year by over 50%. So, there are really encouraging signs to be seen.","James West","Okay, great. And then as we think about those markets that are now starting to show signs of life or will show signs of life here shortly is the pricing environment starting to finally stabilize out?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I mean as always every contract bid any part of the world is competitive. And there is still pricing pressure and pricing challenges for all the new contracts we bid, but I would say the downward trend of pricing is slowing significantly, which I think is in line with the fact that we see activity having bottomed and is probably starting to head in the opposite direction. So, pricing headwinds at this stage is not a huge issue for us in the international market.","James West","Great. Thanks, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, James.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead. ","Angie Sedita","Thanks, good morning guys.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Angie Sedita","So, maybe we could start with a lob for you and further a softball, thoughts on Q4, your comfort maybe around consensus or anything you talked about at a high level on the revenue or margin side?","Paal Kibsgaard","Right, so, for the Q4 outlook, we generally expect the continuation of the underline trends that we\u2019ve seen in the third quarter, moderated somewhat by seasonality. In North America land, we do expect to grow but I think the growth rate will slow, partly due to the flattening rig count, partly due to the fact that we have deployed most of our frac equipments and also the pending holiday season. So, I would say that some growth in North America land, but obviously not the same rate as what we've seen in previous quarters.","And the international market we expect some modest growth in both EMEA and Latin America, but due to the winter seasonality likely a decline in ECA. I think also year-end sales this year will be low there is no real indication of anything significant. So if you look at the Q4 consensus as it stands today, it is potentially on the high end, but I think is a good target to work towards.","Angie Sedita","Okay, appreciate that that is very helpful. And then great to hear the positive sentiment around the international outlook, clearly your tone has changed and you're seeing has changed, but maybe just to hear quickly on Ecuador and Shushufindi with the restructuring of the tariff the thoughts on what the impact could be going into 2018?","Paal Kibsgaard","Patrick do you want to handle that?","Patrick Schorn","Yes, so clearly we are very pleased that are in a more positive situation around the whole payment issue in Ecuador that has been largely resolved. Activity wise we expect to be fully focused again on maximizing production. And it is correct that we have had a change in the tariff, but it continues to be one of the heartlands of SPM that we have and where we have a business that we're very pleased.","So we continue to have all the technical resources focused on improving the production levels as much as we can and where we're quite pleased with the opportunity that we have both the renegotiations in Ecuador. ","Angie Sedita","Okay, great. Thanks guys, I'll turn it over. ","Patrick Schorn","Thank you, Angie. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Ole Slorer","Yes, thanks a lot. I have two questions for you Paal, one is around Borr Drilling and the change in contracting model there. And the second one is the similar question on Cameron. But starting with Borr and in context of your comments that you are now seeing an increasing number of customers that are seeking performance, some kind of performance based contracting model that sort of breaks a little bit with the history of procurement and couple that with your view that this is sort of 50% increase in bid value. ","Could you talk a little bit first maybe about how the reception has been from the drilling side of proposing performance based contracts? Is this something which is something that one or two your customers are now interested in or is it broader?","Paal Kibsgaard","Obviously performance based drilling contracts has been established on lands quite a long time. And we see that the next I would say area that this will start growing is in shallow water. If you want to drill performance based, you need to have a pretty good handle on the subsurface and the drilling rigs. And given the drilling activity that you had historically on shallow water, this is again why we see this as the next horizon that these contracts will take on.","So in terms of customers, we have a range of customers who are already pursuing performance drilling contracts offshore on shallow water. The main thing is that these contracts traditionally has not included the rig. So what we're seeing now is several customers are trying to bring the rig into play. And our rationale for investing in Borr is generally to get closer to one of the rig providers to try to drive this new behavior and establish performance contracts including the rig.","Now our relationship with Borr does not preclude us from having similar relationships with all the other jackup providers. And we have engagement and discussions with several of them to do exactly the same there. So I would say it's a growing interest from the customer base. We have a several key customers who are already well advanced in trying to establish this and the main thing is that we need the rational drilling company and all the other well construction related services on the rig together with the rig provider to come together and establish a contracting framework that is benefitting all parties involved. And I think that's what we are trying to drive to our initial investment in Borr.","Ole Slorer","And it does break with the traditional way of contracting, so very much so, so I was just kind of looking for to what extent customers are really opening up to that type of debate.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I think it\u2019s fair to say that several key customers, I think are happy to never see rig day rates again, if they can get the entire drilling package, including down hole and surface on to performance based, I think that would be a benefit both for the customer and for the service companies involved.","Ole Slorer","Second question on Cameron, I mean, I think it\u2019s clear to everybody now that when you bought Cameron back few years ago, a lot of eyebrows got raised, and looking at the results now it\u2019s clearly something that if you believe that, I think, Cameron could\u2019ve achieved on their own. So, you highlighted CAMShale as one of success, can you talk a little bit about other areas where give us some examples of areas where Cameron is now achieving a performance that they wouldn\u2019t have not been able to do on their own. ","I presume there are international markets that you\u2019ve opened up for valve for that type of thing on the subsea side where you continue to crank pretty hefty margins, we hearing about pricing pressure, but sometimes it\u2019s a little bit difficult to understand the difference between the pricing pressure and the lower cost solution. So, could you give us a few more data points around what you\u2019ve done with Cameron? And how far you\u2019ve come relative to what you had hoped for?","Paal Kibsgaard","First of all, Cameron was always a well-run company. And I think, what we\u2019ve done is, we\u2019ve brought in to our overall global organization and manage to take a well-run company, and together with what we can offer on this make one plus one equals three, that\u2019s the whole idea behind it.","So, if you look at the various product lines of Cameron, obviously OneSubsea we have been involved with for a number of years already, and the momentum of that part of the business was already quite strong, when we took full ownership of Cameron. I think you\u2019ve seen in terms of tender win rates and the margin performance that the whole thesis behind what we try to achieve with OneSubsea is really working.","On the drilling side, it\u2019s obviously a significant lull in the market, where Cameron drilling which was to a fair extent focused on the offshore market has seen a significant reduction in activity, but they\u2019ve done I\u2019d say an outstanding job in redirecting the portfolio and the capability set towards supporting our rig of the future efforts.","And they\u2019re in the process of finalizing all the surface rig equipment packages as well as being more focused on the BOP side for land rigs as well. So I think we\u2019re really working very well together with the Cameron drilling side and rig of the future project to drive performance there.","On the surface side, obviously the closer tied to our frac business, where we\u2019ve ramped up significantly in U.S. land over the past couple of quarters is a very good synergy and benefit. And I would say on surface international, there are some core very good markets for surface in the international market, but at the same time, there are number of countries and huge markets for the rest of Schlumberger, where there is very limited presence of surface and we\u2019re obviously attacking these as we speak.","And finally on valves and measurement as well, very good, I would say synergies and performance up towards what we\u2019re doing with the early production facilities and Cameron processing overall. So, I think, all of the product lines are performing very well. I\u2019m very pleased with the management capabilities of Cameron and also how they are very seamlessly integrating with the rest of the organization.","Ole Slorer","Congrats on that both. I hand it back.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Ole.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Citi. Please go ahead.","Scott Gruber","Yes, good morning. ","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Scott Gruber","Paal wanted to ask another question on SPM, with the growing book of business in North America, how critical are these projects to not only diversify the portfolio, but also showcase the various technologies and techniques that you can bring to the table to enhance production. During the prepared remarks Patrick mentioned the impressive results in the Powder River, are you at the point now where you can start the market results to other customers outside of the SPM initiative?","Paal Kibsgaard","To answer the last part of the question first, yes, within what is agreed with our customers, we can use this to market it. Again that\u2019s partly the background for Patrick\u2019s comments today and we\u2019re quite pleased with the performance of the project and the collaboration we have with SM Energy. So I would say that looking at the North America market SPM has an opportunity set in North America for sure.","And I think both SM Energy and the talks are clear examples of that. Now the benefits we have in the North America land markets that we might not see in other land based fairly commoditized market is that scale really matters. So while we obviously we will look at SPM opportunities in North America getting scale behind our activities whether this is on frocking or drilling is also something that will help us perform better in these markets. But we are pursuing SPM in the North America land market as we indicated in our conference call in July.","Scott Gruber","But do you think the production enhancement benefits that you're delivering in the Powder River and hopefully in Canada. Do you think that can drive the broader sales effort in North America around your technologies and capabilities?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes absolutely, because I think what we are doing in these projects we can provide to other companies whether that is all the way from standalone products and services, consulting services, it could be also integrate and drilling services all the way up to SPM. So the main thing is the methodology and the principles of how we go about developing these reservoirs. And we are happy to engage with our entire customer base in the range of business models that we offer. ","Scott Gruber","And how quickly do you think that that benefit can materialize? I ask because I often hear investors comment that the E&Ps particularly the larger E&Ps go around to the energy conferences and actually discuss how they're less reliant upon big service companies to execute in the shale plays. But if you can go out on these SPM projects and really showcase production enhancement it would seem a strong counter to this narrative.","Paal Kibsgaard","No that's fair. But I mean we are there to serve our customers. And if customers belief that they can do a better job without us then we will obviously try to engage with them and ensure them what we can do, but if their conclusion is that they can do it in a different way than we don't want to have an argument about that. I think there are plenty of customers who are open to kind of listen to what we do. ","Some of them might be doing similar things already, in which case they may not need us. But I think there is a still a significant part of the customer base in North America land where we can have an impact. And that's what we pursuing.","Scott Gruber","Got it. And just a quick question on U.S. frac, the impressive growth during the quarter was that primarily just riding the growth plans with customers. Would you feel like you are often displacing less efficient frac companies that maybe experiencing some execution issues given the growth in the frac count?","Paal Kibsgaard","Generally this quarter we have just continue to deploy along the frac calendar that we've already had established. Now there is as you continue to push pricing and as you know some companies perform better or worse, there is always a flux around what service company works for what customer. But generally we have been executing and implementing the targeted deployment plans that we already had established. So there hasn't been a huge move around replacing others as of this stage.","Scott Gruber","Got it, I'll turn it back. Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Scott. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Waqar Syed ","Thank you for taking my question. My question relates to the Weatherford deal, could you appraise us of what the timing is on that deal and I understand there is a true up component as well. And could you comment in which direction the valuation could move on that deal?","Paal Kibsgaard","I won't be able to go into the details of that other than the first priority that we have been working on is to obtain the U.S. Antitrust approval. And we work closely with the DOJ to get all the information to them that they require to make their decision. And we are optimistic that we will get the U.S. Antitrust approval during the fourth quarter.","And as you mentioned, there are some ancillary agreements that we still need to work through with Weatherford. These agreements were all identified and laid out as we initially sign the deal. And we hope to be in a position to finalize these discussions and basically get all the agreements done by the end of the year. So going into any details of what those agreements cover and what we're discussing, obviously I won\u2019t be able to do that.","Waqar Syed ","Okay. And then just question on SPM investments in \u201818 based on the projects that you\u2019ve already announced, what level of SPM investments do you expect in \u201818?","Paal Kibsgaard","Patrick.","Patrick Schorn","I mean obviously there is number of deals that we have announced depending on which particular project you look at whether there is production are not obviously the investment profile and whether or not that is generating cash from day one is quite different. Overall it is a business that we see growing and therefore we intend to continue to invest in it.","So you should see a -- still an increase in SPM spending and it's all going to be a question of how many deals we do. I think that is important to keep in mind that we've obviously seen quite a few SPM deals continue in the last few quarters, it is unrealistic to believe that we are going to keep at this very high rate of deals continuously going forward, it is not necessary. ","So, what you will see as well is that as time progresses more and more of the projects are actually going to be generating their own cash flow. So, that is really the way that we see it going forward, it is a growing business and we'll continue to invest, it really depends a little bit on what is the total makeup of projects that we have finally in \u201818 and we're still working on doing a few more before this year is over.","Waqar Syed ","So normally the run rate is around $150 million investments on a quarterly basis I guess that's the base level. So if for next year based on announcement should we assume more or like a $250 million kind of per quarter level, would that be reasonable?","Patrick Schorn","I think it is reasonable to expect that it is going to be somewhat higher. I don't want to give you a number right now.","Waqar Syed ","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead. ","Bill Herbert","Thanks, good morning. So another question on SPM, could you talk about Patrick the mix of business going for the mix of investments, the mix of projects that you expect to invest going forward on SPM?","Patrick Schorn","Yes, so there is wide variety of things that we look at when we are taking SPM projects on. It is clear that we have had traditionally a fairly strong concentration in Latin America, which we wanted to make sure that we get a more global coverage, more in line with the overall footprint that we ask and where we see the opportunities.","I think it is very clear that the way we invest in SPM is also related to where we have the strong footprint and where we have some excess capacity. Because one of the key things that we do in most of the projects that we take on is that we are investing in kind, meaning we are using our services to invest and get -- and earn a certain equity in the project.","The bigger of a footprint that we have in a certain place the better we can use that to at a very efficient rate invest through our own services. So going forward, you should see us to more of a coverage of SPM projects around the world that is in line with our overall footprint and where we have largest Schlumberger operations, it is likely to have SPM opportunities as well.","Now, going back to how we always have described SPM opportunities, it is the field that we are looking at where we are having an opportunity to do something different than what the current customer or owner of that field is doing. So, there is got to be a technical angle in which we see that we can improve what is currently being done. And we see opportunities today in just about every area, we see them in the Far East, we see them in the Middle East, we see them in North America.","So, there is plenty opportunities at this moment and I would say think about more of geographical match where the Schlumberger footprint see us go a bit more into gas and I think that is probably the best way of describing it.","Bill Herbert","Okay. And then with respect to just staying on the SPM theme, again an improving kind of macro outlook and firming oil prices, that should lead to less of a need on the part of resource holders and less of a need on the part of Schlumberger given the fact that your asset employment for your global franchise should be improving, is that correct or no?","Patrick Schorn","That's correct.","Bill Herbert","Okay. And then finally, you mentioned it in your upfront commentary Patrick that there was a lot of noise around Shushufindi and a lot of miss information, can you give us the magnitude of adjustment on the fee per barrel with regard to this project?","Patrick Schorn","So clearly, as I\u2019ve described that we\u2019re continue to be very happy with what we have and I think that maybe the most important to take out of the commentary and how we describe the impact is that the tariff that we\u2019re having on Shushufindi still fully makes the returns and margin that we expect from an SPM project. So, that is probably as close as I want to get in giving you a bit color around the reduction that we have seen there. It is a project that we\u2019re pleased with and it fits very well within our portfolio.","Bill Herbert","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Jim Wicklund","Good morning guys. Thanks for fitting me in. Paal, you were talking on Ole\u2019s question about performance based drilling and you do it now, but you haven\u2019t done it with the rig. Can you update us on Eurasia, because if I remember correctly one of the points of owning Eurasia was the prime contract on a lot of Russian situations as the rig owner rather than in the U.S. it\u2019s driven by completion, is that the case, is this a continuation of the trend and can you fetch us up where you\u2019re in Eurasia?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes the rationale behind the EDC transaction is exactly as we said or described it for Borr, this obviously happens to be on land in western sub-areas as oppose to shallow water, but it\u2019s exactly the same thing. It\u2019s about driving drilling performance through our down hole drilling technology through the rig technology, but also through the entire one drill system including DELFI as I described earlier in the prepared remarks. So, the rationale is exactly the same.","In terms of where we stand, we\u2019re currently working through the requirements from the various Russian regulatory authorities, providing them with the information that they need to assess the application that we have to get antitrust approval. And I think the process there is moving along. We remain optimistic that we will get the ultimate approval, but our job at this stage is to provide the authorities with information that they need so that they can make their determination and their final decision. But, we remain optimistic that we will get this closed.","Jim Wicklund","Okay. My follow-up, if I could, we\u2019ve been asked this by a couple of investors, does the latest Canadian SPM investment in terms of what you\u2019ve done and what you\u2019re talking about doing, does that diminish the likelihood or magnitude of buybacks or dividend increases going forward?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I will say on the way we\u2019ve always planned to use our cash, the priority is always being to reinvest into the business, into projects and activities that are driving earnings and that are accretive to our returns. Beyond that, we\u2019ve said that we\u2019ll review dividends on an annual basis, and the balancing factor will always be buybacks. Nothing has changed to this effect.","And we\u2019ll review dividends in January and we\u2019ll continue to be in the market to buy back stock, but we won\u2019t buy back stock at the expense of not being able to do what we think is right, in terms of driving the growth of the underlying business.","Jim Wicklund","Perfect. Thanks guys.","Simon Ayat","Let me add one thing about the Canadian project. The maximum cash exposure that we\u2019ve announced, which you see the basically the amount we\u2019re going to pay upon it is a maximum cash exposure, any future investment in the project will be mitigated by the cash flow that we will generate from the production of the projects itself. So, just to make it clear, the future investment in Torxen will be basically self-sufficient from the production that we\u2019re going to generate from the project itself.","Jim Wicklund","Okay, thanks guys it\u2019s helpful.","Paal Kibsgaard"," Thank you, Jim.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead","Hey, good morning.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Kurt Hallead","Question I had for you guys, you referenced the 50% increase in FIDs and tenders, so I think that\u2019s both in terms of number and then you mentioned contract value. I was wonder if you could give us some general size of that potential contract value and how you might assess your win rate on that contract value?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I don\u2019t want to go into what the exact volume is in terms of contract value, but if you look at our win rates, obviously all of these contracts are highly competitive, but I\u2019d say that I\u2019m at this stage satisfied with our win rate. Our win rate in 2017 is somewhat up from what it was in 2016, it continues to be competitive. But we\u2019re looking to balance out the pricing that we put into these contracts, which we will need to leverage for a number of years.","At the same time having I would say the contract base and the growth platform we require to be in an optimal position as the international upturn starts. So, overall we\u2019re spending a lot of time making sure that we treat every tendering opportunity with a maximum amount of attention and I think so far we\u2019ve been quite successful in doing so.","Kurt Hallead","Okay. And then your commentary around the tenders and the FIDs, you\u2019ve referenced both land and offshore, and then on the offshore front, you had some commentary about shallow water. I wonder if you give us some perspective on shallow water, deep water, what are you seeing between shallow and deep on the tenders and FIDs going into next year.","Paal Kibsgaard","I think it\u2019s pretty evident that the shallow water is going to come back a lot quicker compared to I would say an overall ramp in deep water activity. So this is again partly while we have our focus on shallow water both from a Schlumberger drilling services standpoint, but also teaming up with the jackup providers like Borr to make sure that we are in the forefront of securing the work on these rigs as they start to ramp up.","Kurt Hallead","Okay. And if I may squeeze one last one in here, so your referenced Paal a hardware ownership being critical to your strategy going forward, hardware is very generic term. So I was wondering if you could elaborate little bit more on hardware is it rigs, land rigs, offshore rigs, is it just equipment. So, just wondered if you could elaborate little bit more on that hardware element?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I agree hardware is a pretty generic term, but I would say that the current ownership that we have of hardware, I\u2019m pretty happy with it. So, we are not going in to take full ownership of jackup rigs or floaters, we are taking ownership of our own internally developed land rigs. But beyond that we want to have relationships with jackup providers and potentially floater providers. But our focus now is on the jackups, and we have no intentions what so ever of going back into full ownership of offshore rigs.","Kurt Hallead","Okay, great, excellent. Thank you so much, appreciate it.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your final question today comes from the line of Chase Mulvehill from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Chase Mulvehill","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I guess, first question, could you talk about the production margins in 3Q and the negative impact that you saw from the reactivations. Sounds like that some of that kind of comes out in 4Q, but maybe if you could kind of help us frame that a little bit.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, the production -- I mean, if you look at what is reported the main impact on the incremental margins sequentially for the production group is what we refer to North America land, where we have had a pretty significant ramp up, both in the second and the third quarter. And this creates inefficiencies internally in terms of how we deploy, how we hire and also how we optimize our distribution network for all the products that we need to get into these operations as well.","So, some bottlenecks were experienced in the third quarter, and we are basically working through this now and they should generally abate in the fourth quarter and for sure into the first quarter. So, we\u2019re working through these things and I\u2019m not overly worried about it, but there are some things to be sorted out, which we are actively working on as we speak.","Chase Mulvehill","Okay, thank you, Paal. One quick follow-up, I\u2019m just kind of following up on Bill and Scott\u2019s question around SPM, when we think about SPM kind of an U.S. onshore, are you trying to take advantage of excess service capacity or is it more about kind of better of penetration of technology. And if it\u2019s the latter, what technologies do you think you\u2019re able to exploit through SPM that are not through your traditional businesses?","Paal Kibsgaard","I would say in U.S. land it\u2019s generally looking to basically demonstrate what our technology and capability set can generate. So, this is all the way from well placement, drilling efficiency, frac placement and also overall how we complete these wells. So, it's most of these things we have generally talked to all our customers about already. ","The main thing is the ability to put this together into consistently delivering top quartile wells, which I think we\u2019ve demonstrated through the example that Patrick descried today with SM Energy. So we\u2019re just looking to be more of that and that could be in the form of SPM, but like I said earlier to be in any form of whatever contractual engagement our customers are looking for.","Chase Mulvehill","Great. Thank you, I'll turn it back over, thanks Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","All right, thank you very much. So, as usual I would like to close with a summary of the major points that we have discussed this morning. First, we have overall past few years created industry\u2019s broadest upstream technology portfolio. Through the Cameron transaction a series of acquisitions, joint venture and partnerships with smaller technology companies and our own research and development efforts we have created an unparalleled technology platform, which is now ready for broad based system integration.","Second, our long held views on the oil market are now being reinforced by data points that make us increasingly positive on the outlook and recovery for our global business. And last as the global E&P investments start to recover Schlumberger is uniquely positioned to outperform based on the strength of our technology portfolio, the capabilities of our global organization and the quality and the efficiency of the services we provide to our customers. That concludes our call for today. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"19227":["Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call April 18, 2019  8:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Simon Farrant - Vice President of Investor Relations","Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer","Olivier Le Peuch - Chief Operating Officer","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Conference Call Participants","James West - Evercore ISI","Angie Sedita - Goldman Sachs","Scott Gruber - Citigroup","Sean Meakim - J.P.

Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.","Simon Farrant","Good morning, good afternoon, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited first quarter 2019 earnings call. Today's call is being hosted from Quito, Ecuador, following the Schlumberger Limited Board Meeting. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Olivier Le Peuch, newly appointed Chief Operating Officer.","We will, as usual, first go through our prepared remarks, after which we'll open up for questions. For today's agenda, Simon will first present comments on our first quarter financial performance, before Olivier reviews our results by geography. Paal will close our remarks with a discussion of our technology portfolio and our updated view of the industry macro.","However, before we begin, I'd like to remind our participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore, refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings.","Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our fourth quarter press release, which is on our website. Finally, after our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourselves to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow more time for others who may be in the queue.","Now, I'll hand the call over to Simon Ayat.","Simon Ayat","Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share was $0.30, excluding charges and credits, this represents a decrease of $0.06 sequentially and $0.08 when compared to the same quarter last year. There were no charges or the credit recorded during this quarter. Our first quarter revenue of $7.9 billion decreased 4% sequentially, largely driven by seasonal declines. Pre-tax operating margin decreased by 30 basis points to 11.5%.","Highlights by broad product group were as follows: First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.5 billion decreased 7% sequentially, due to a seasonal decline in Wireline activities, primarily in Russia and lower SIS software and multiclient license sales, following their traditionally strong fourth quarter performance.","Margin decreased 308 basis points to 19%, due to the lower contribution from Wireline, SIS and multiclient. Drilling Group revenue of $2.4 billion decreased 3% sequentially, driven by seasonally lower drilling activity in the international area. Margins were essentially flat at 12.9%.","Production Group revenue of $2.9 billion, decreased 2% sequentially, due to a decline in OneStim revenue in North America land. Margins improved slightly by 76 basis points to 7.5%. Cameron Group revenue of $1.2 billion, decreased 7% sequentially, this decrease was primarily due to lower project volumes and reduced product sales of long cycle businesses of OneSubsea and Drilling Systems.","Lower Surface System revenue also contributed to the decline. Despite the revenue declines margin increase were 161 basis points to 11.6%, driven by improved profitability in Drilling Systems and Valves & Measurements. The book-to-bill ratio for Cameron long-cycle business was 1.5 in Q1. The OneSubsea backlog increased to $2.1 billion at the end of the first quarter.","Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 15.5% in the first quarter, this was essentially flat with the previous quarter. Our corporate and other expense line item increased sequentially by $35 million to $273 million in Q1. This increase was largely attributable to certain exceptional accounting for stock-based compensation costs in the quarter.","In the second quarter, we expect these costs to return to a level more in line with where we were in Q4. We just recently completed a very successful debt exchange offer. As a result, we issued $1.5 billion of notes due in 2028, that bear interest at 3.9%. These new notes were exchanged for a similar amount of notes that were scheduled to be repaid in 2022 and 2025. This debt exchange, combined with other refinancing activities, we completed during the quarter, serves to improve our debt maturity profile going forward.","As a result, the net interest expense at the corporate level is expected to increase by approximately $10 million to $15 million next quarter. We generated $326 million of cash flow from operations during the first quarter. This is despite the consumption of working capital that we typically experienced during the first quarter, which is driven by the annual payments associated with employee compensation. Our inventory levels also increased in anticipation of higher activity levels in the coming quarters.","Our net debt increased $1.1 billion during the quarter to $14.4 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investment of $2.2 billion. During the quarter, we spent $98 million to repurchase 2.3 million shares at an average price of $42.79. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included CapEx of approximately $413 million and capitalized costs relating to SPM projects of $151 million. During the quarter, we also made $692 million of dividend payment.","Full year 2019 CapEx excluding SPM and multiclient investments is still expected to be approximately $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion.","And now, I will turn the conference call over to Olivier.","Olivier Le Peuch","Thank you, Simon, and good morning everyone. I'm very pleased to be here today, mind you all to give you an update on our global operation. I would like to start with our international business, with Reservoir Characterization, Drilling and Production combining to deliver year-on-year revenue growth of 8% for the first quarter of 2019.","This year-over-year increase was led by Latin America, Africa and Asia where we continue to see a ramp-up in activity, supporting our expectations of high single-digit international revenue growth for the year. My comments on geographies will exclude Cameron, which I will discuss separately.","In Latin America, revenue increased 7% sequentially driven by strong growth in the Mexico & Central America GeoMarket, which posted nearly 50% year-over-year revenue growth. This was driven by high offshore exploration-related activity for the international operators, multiclient seismic sales and intensifying onshore IDS work for PEMEX.","In the Latin America and the offshore market, revenue increased from higher SPM activity together with increased production from the Shaya field in Ecuador where over the course of last year, we have ramped-up the water injection program. We're extremely pleased with the progress of this SPM project as it does position the Shaya field as a top oil-producing field in Ecuador.","In Argentina, revenue increased slightly from full efficiency of hydraulic fracturing and SPM activity. On the SPM shale oil pilot in Bandurria Sur block, the return has been reduced by 20% in the first year of activity, and four of our new wells ranked within the top 10 producer of oil wells drilled in Latin America. Impressive results much to the credit of the integrated approach and application of the reservoir domain knowledge and finally, the deployment of new technology.","Seasonal activity slowdowns in Europe, CIS and Africa decreased revenue 5% sequentially, primarily in Russia and Central Asia. Lower seasonal activity in the North Sea was compounded by weather and [bank notes] [ph] related delays. This was partially offset by the very successful start-up of an IBS project in Turkey and strong coiled tubing activity in Ukraine.","Revenue in Sub-Sahara Africa were slightly lower sequentially, due to reduced product sales in Mozambique and Angola. Despite this, the Sub-Sahara Africa GeoMarket increased revenue 30% year-over-year from increasing activity on exploration projects, [indiscernible] new technology uptake and multiclient seismic licensing.","The revenue in the Middle East & Asia decreased 4% sequentially; IBS project activity across the area continues to grow. LSTK projects in Saudi Arabia are progressing with the first full quarter of drilling from all the 25 rigs mobilized last year. During the quarter, we drilled no less than 30 wells equivalent to 1\/3 of the total number of wells drilled last year. These projects are moving up the revenue curve with improved efficiency and new technology deployments.","However, some are currently derivatives to our margins. The Saudi Arabia results were also affected by unusual flooding that delayed WesternGeco land seismic operations. In Southeast Asia GeoMarket, India revenue increased also on higher IDS activity. The Far East Asia experienced a sequential revenue decrease with activity slowdown in Australia due to cyclone season. This was offset partially by operation in China, which performed better than expected due to milder winter weather conditions. Overall, Far East Asia and Australia GeoMarket showed strong year-over-year revenue growth of 27%.","Now let us turn to North America. Our first quarter revenue in North America was 4% lower on the sequential basis, excluding Cameron, from the combination of lower overall activity and weaker pricing for both our hydraulic fracturing and drilling-related business while our artificial lift revenue was flat. Although hydraulic fracturing stage counts in North America land increased nearly 5% sequentially largely from the Western Canada retail rampart, such that pricing pushed overall revenue sequentially lower.","However, if we look closer into our OneStim operation, we can see that effective cost management and operational agility have supported productions margin. Late last year as the WTI oil price collapsed, we won stock half fleet and accelerated in Q4 tendering season to bridge the year-end activity decline. The ready program of these fleets under our new contracts during January combined with our vertically integrated supply chain, operational efficiency and cost control effectively protected margins. Pricing, however, remains depressed, we believe, that visibility into the second half of the year.","Our course for frac fleet deployment this year is operational flexibility focused on improving returns and cash generation. North America offshore revenue was flat sequentially with increased Wireline activity in the Gulf offset by lower multiclient seismic sales. As an example, I would like to highlight the deepwater project for our customer in the Gulf of Mexico where we have significantly reduced drilling and well construction time using new technology and a collaborative business model.","This project resulted in six of the most complex wells ever drilled in the reducing operational costs by over 40% and accelerating project execution by eight months. Hence, generating significant value for our customer. As the offshore development and exploration market gradually recover, we'll focus on deploying new technology that impact the operational performance for the benefit of our customers.","Finally, I would like to discuss the results of Cameron. Cameron revenue was down sequentially following the usual strong year-end sales. The sequential decline in revenue was 7%, most of which was in international markets, offset partially by a sequential increase in North America. With this backlog, we continue to see the trend of strong OneSubsea bookings that began in the second half of last year, tipping the book-to-bill ratio materially above one.","This bookings included one major multiphase boosting solution highlighting the success of this technology for short- cycle offshore projects, particularly with tiebacks. Together with our partner Subsea 7, we are also awarded two multiclient projects during last quarter. We are very pleased with the progress of the Subsea Integration Alliance and continue to receive excellent feedback from our customers on project under joint execution.","Cameron Surface Systems revenue declined in lower activity in Australia and Southeast Asia bookings were up slightly year-over-year. Short-term growth is currently driven by the uptake of wellhead technology and frac services for North America land and Argentina customers. Cameron Drilling Systems declined sequentially following strong product and sales delivery during the fourth quarter in North America.","By contrast, Wireline measurements revenue was up on strong demand from distributors, stocking inventory to support upcoming completion activity and the continued upstream infrastructure build-out of Permian takeaway capacity. The Cameron Group margins did increase sequentially in Q1 2019 to improve project execution and pull- through from the North America product sales.","We did comment earlier that the trough of the cycle for both Cameron revenue and margins will have ended in the first half of 2019. I believe that the current momentum in margin recovery and book-to-bill ratio will continue as well in the right path. To conclude, we have started the year on a very positive note with 10 of the 16 GeoMarkets showing double-digits year-on-year revenue growth. Some of these were GeoMarkets that had experienced the greatest revenue compression. They are now seeing stronger active trends that support our high single-digit revenue growth outlook for our international market this year.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Olivier. Following the review of the Cameron Group results, let me next comment on the first quarter performance of the Reservoir Characterization, Drilling and Production Groups. In Reservoir Characterization, our Wireline business recorded a year-over-year increase in exploration-related revenue of 17% in the first quarter. That's below the total of 105 offshore exploration wells, which is 40% higher than the first quarter of last year.","New technology sales in Wireline were also up significantly, reaching 31% of total revenue, driven by our newly introduced reservoir fluid sampling and pressure measurement services, which are essential to reservoir description in both exploration and development wells.","In other exploration- related activities, multiclient seismic sales remain solid in the first quarter, while they also showed solid year-over-year growth in Testing Services, and we expect our exploration-related product lines to continue to build momentum over the course of this year.","In the Drilling Group, new technology sales were again strong, driven by Drilling & Measurements where we, in the first quarter posted a 50% year-over-year increase in footage drilled for our latest generation or rotary steerable technologies. We also recorded 20% year-over-year growth in footage drilled for our total rotary steerable systems offering, which now comprises five customized technology solutions that effectively cover all our key markets around the world, with particular focus on the Middle East, the North Sea, the Permian and DJ basins in the U.S. land, and the Szechuan and Tarim basins in China.","Still the largest contributor to the 12% increase in year-over-year revenue growth for the Drilling Group was our integrated Drilling Services projects. At present, all the rigs we deployed in 2018 are now fully operational and steadily advancing of the learning and performance curve in our various projects.","In the first quarter, we saw a very strong performance improvements in our IDS projects in Latin America, while in the Middle East & Asia challenging drilling conditions on some projects partly offset solid efficiency improvements on others. Still we have clearly established technology and process improvement plans for all our integrated drilling projects, and we expect our IDS product to be accreted to Drilling Group margins, by the time we exit 2019.","In the Production Group, we have over the past four years significantly built out our technology offering and our presence in the global production market, and through that further expanded the growth platform for Schlumberger going forward. This includes our artificial lift and coiled tubing businesses, where we today are global market leaders, completion products where we, in addition to our leadership position in the high-end market, continued to build out our land offering through organic R&D investments; and hydraulic fracturing, where we are now have established the needed scale and execution expertise to effectively compete in the North America land market.","Our focus going forward for the Production Group is now to deliver improved financial returns in all parts of our global operations, after having completed our multiyear investment program. We will do that by reaping the benefits of our modernized operating platform and by deploying a rich set of new technologies that drive cost efficiency and quality for both our operations and for our customers.","In line with this focus, we are pleased with the first quarter sequential margin performance in the Production Group. And we expect to see continued progress in both operating margins and earnings contribution from our production-related businesses going forward. As we continue to build the top line growth momentum in our overall international business, we are not also actively deploying our well-defined playbook focused on increasing incremental margins.","Looking closer at our first quarter results. Around half of our international legacy revenue is already producing highly creative year-over-year incremental margins, driven by new technologies sales, solid contractual terms and conditions, higher volume of activity and the benefits from our internal modernization program, while still excluding any material price book increases.","Around 1\/3 of our international legacy revenue is dealing moderately accretive incremental margins, impacted by lower base pricing and so far less scale and efficiency benefits, while the last quarter of our international legacy revenue is at present highly dilutive to both current and incremental operating margins, due to low pricing on favorable contractual terms and lack of critical mass.","At present, this remains the most noticeable headwind to our international financial performance. Granted, we have over the past few years knowingly decided to enter into these contracts in order to protect our geographical footprints and provide future business opportunities and optionality. Still, most of these low return contracts are callout based, which means there is no firm scope offered from our customers, and we are, hence, free to respond to their callout requests, based on our available capacity, which today is already stretched.","As for capital deployment, we maintain our CapEx guidance of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion for 2019, with our CapEx deployment being entirely focused on the half of our international revenue that is already yielding the required incremental margins.","For the other half of our international business, our near-term priority is to engage with our customers to establish pricing, contractual terms and a work scope that will provide us with the opportunity to quickly establish the needed financial returns. As part of this process, we will look to high-grade our contract base as needed and potentially redeploy existing capacity to contracts and customers who offers higher profitability until operating and incremental margins also have reached the required levels. Only at that stage will we consider deploying fresh capital into this part of our international business.","Turning lastly to the industry macro where we continue to expect oil market sentiments to steadily improve over the course of 2019. Our view is backed by a solid demand outlook, the full effects of the OPEC and Russian production cuts, the slowing shale oil production growth in North America and the further weakening of the international production base as the impact of four years of underinvestment becomes increasingly evident.","The recent strength in the price of crude oil, with Brent again breaking through the $70 per barrel level, is supporting this outlook. We also see clear signs that E&P investment sentiments are starting to normalize as the industry heads towards a more sustainable financial stewardship of the global resource base.","Directionally, this means higher investments in the international markets simply to keep production flat, while North America land activity is set for lower investments with a likely downward adjustment to the current production growth outlook. In the international markets outside the Middle East and Russia, the inevitable production decline resulting from the record-low investment levels seen in the past four years is now becoming increasingly visible.","First quarter oil production in the international markets outside OPEC was down 400,000 barrels a day versus Q1 of 2018 and 900,000 barrels a day versus Q1 of 2017. While the underlying decline in the aging production base in key oil-producing countries such as Norway, UK, Brazil and Nigeria has so far been offset by new project start-ups, the need for a stronger supply side response is becoming increasingly evident.","Strong new investments are also needed in countries like Mexico, Angola, Indonesia and China where total production has been in noticeable decline for several years. Within this industry backdrop, we continue to execute our plans for 2019, targeting high single-digit international revenue growth with a business focus and capital deployment strategy as I have already outlined.","Looking at the first quarter, the growth in the international rig count, both on land and in particular offshore, the rise in the number of new project FIDs and Subsea 3 awards and a renewed interest in exploration is all supporting our outlook. Conversely, in North America land, the higher cost of capital, lower borrowing capacity and investors looking for increased returns suggest that future E&P investments will likely be at levels dictated by free cash flow.","We, therefore, see land E&P investment in North America down 10% in 2019. In addition to the lower investments, increasing technical challenges from well interference, step out from core acreage and limited further growth in lateral length and proppant per stage, points to a more moderate growth rate in the U.S. shale oil production in the coming years. The normalization of global E&P spending with increased international market investments and a reduction in North America land CapEx represents a positive market shift for Schlumberger and we welcome the return of a very familiar opportunity set given our unmatched global strength.","With the efforts in investments we have made in recent years to modernize our execution platform, expand our technology offering, drive digital and technology system innovation, evolve our business models and strengthen our global footprint, we are better positioned than ever to capitalize on the opportunity set we now have in front of us, which at present is the overriding goal of the entire Schlumberger organization.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you very much. We will now open up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","James West","Thanks. Good morning, Paal and Olivier.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning, James.","Olivier Le Peuch","Good morning.","James West","So Paal, it appears you've got the Board down in Latin America, in Quito right now. I'm curious similar to when you've held Board meetings in Saudi and Moscow and other places, there's usually a build up to the actual meeting, a lot of stuff that you guys do and see and talk about on the operational side. Could you maybe give us some color on what the Board saw, what you guys did this week in Quito or broader Latin America?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. Thanks James. So as you know, as you said, we always conduct our April Board meeting in one of our operating R&D locations. Last year, we were in Silicon Valley. And in previous years, as you referenced, we've been in Saudi and Moscow. So this year, we picked Ecuador mainly because we have a big operation here. We have three major SPM projects, which we review regularly with the Board.","So part of the objective of our meeting in Ecuador this week is for the Board to see the projects up close and also meet the great people we have on the ground here, both executing these projects and also supporting the rest of our operations in Ecuador and in Latin America North.","Now in addition to this, we also have an excellent working relationship with the Ecuadorian state oil company, Petro Amazonas, as well as the key ministries. So part of the purpose of this week's visit as well is to reinforce our commitment, strong ties to Ecuador and have the Board meet some of the key external stakeholders. So we are spending a couple of days in Quito concluding the Board meeting. Then we're also going to the field to give the Board a firsthand look at some of our operations. So this is in line with what we do in the April Board meeting.","James West","Got you. Okay, thanks. And then Paal, you talked about in the press release and in your prepared comments about higher returns. We did notice a change \u2013 some changes to the proxy as it came out. And how was Schlumberger \u2013 how are you guys thinking about focusing on driving higher returns as the industry gets back to more normalized spending patterns?","Paal Kibsgaard","So, I mean, if you look at the focus we have as a company, today, growing the top line is obviously the key to all that what we do. But beyond that, getting our return on capital employed and our operating margins back up to the levels we had in 2014 is a key objective. Higher revenue is going to be part of it.","But beyond that, it is being very prudent in how we deploy capital and also how we manage costs in the operation as we now start to grow. And beyond that, we will also need to get some of our pricing concessions back in order to drive profitability. So we have a very comprehensive playbook and focus on this to drive all these aspects of returns in addition to the cash flow, which we are in the midst of deploying and focusing on in 2019. It is reflected in the objectives of the senior management team and also in the day-to-day activity of what we do.","James West","Okay, perfect. Thanks Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thanks James.","Operator","Next we go to line of Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Angie Sedita","Good morning, guys.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning, Angie.","Olivier Le Peuch","Good morning.","Angie Sedita","Nice to see a solid quarter here. So maybe, Paal, we can go into your comments that you made on the international market as well as what was in the press release and give us a little bit of color and maybe specifics around your visibility for high single, double-digit revenue growth in international markets and maybe in the context of normalized spending, exploration spending and the technology take up.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, thanks Angie. So I would say high-level summary, the year has started off, internationally, pretty much in line with what we were expecting. So we have indicated high single-digit revenue growth for us internationally. And with the 8% we posted in Q1, I think we are pretty much in line with that outlook. The key driver for this year-over-year growth is offshore, in particular shallow water. We've seen about a 20% increase in shallow water rig count year-over-year Q1 to Q1, which is obviously very good for us.","We still have a very strong position in these markets. But in addition to this, we're also seeing a renewed focus on offshore exploration. I referenced some of the Wireline information that obviously is a key proxy for how we do in offshore exploration. So this is also very good news. Where we see the revenue growth coming, it is going to still be from the areas where we have had the highest revenue compression like Latin America, Africa and Asia. But also in the North Sea, Russia and the Middle East, we expect to see solid revenue growth off a large revenue base in these areas, right.","So what\u2019s going to drive the year is offshore and with some increased focus that we see on exploration as well. And what's driving the offshore, I think, is there's a rich opportunity set around short cycle projects. And we also see now that the number of FIDs is increasing fairly rapidly. There was about 50 offshore FIDs last year, and we see now, on the horizon, about 80 of this year.","And these are not only step outs and brownfield kind of upgrades. This is also greenfield activity. So I think we have a fairly reasonable visibility on the year. And so far, it shaped up pretty much in line with what we were expecting.","Angie Sedita","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And I guess as a follow-up, two items, is do you think that we're going to see a shift? You talked about shallow water 20% growth year-over-year. Do you think we're going to see a shift as we go into 2019 and 2020 to more deepwater? And then can you also touch on the confidence around pricing opportunities around the world, both land and offshore internationally?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I think it's a bit early to kind of make those, I would say, projections on deepwater. We are seeing some increase in deepwater exploration but I would say that the 2019 will be shallow water. And I think as that continues to mature, I expect that we will see more on deepwater in 2020 and beyond.","Operator","And we will move on to a question from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Scott Gruber","Yes, good morning.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Olivier Le Peuch","Good morning.","Scott Gruber","So I want to follow on Angie's question and stay on the international side, looking at the growth potential. I'm really curious about how you see long-term growth shaping up. So if we paint a scenario and take a look at the forward curve, and the crude stays around the $65 to $70 level on Brent how many years of reasonable growth, call it, mid single-digit can be reasonably expected as reinvestment rates normalize, and I'm assuming no major change in crude?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think if you look at where investment levels were back in the period, 2010 to 2014, obviously internationally now we are still almost around half of those investment levels. And if you were to say that the new normal is somewhere in between where we are and where we used to be, you still need multiple years of not even single-digit but probably double-digit growth in order to get back to the \u2013 even the halfway point between investment levels in 2014 and investment levels as of today.","So we still see a fairly decent runway for increased international investments. And you also see the need for this in the production declines that we are now seeing in the mature production base internationally.","Scott Gruber","Got it. And you guys did a great job on margin performance in the first quarter, and I appreciate all the color on margins and the drivers of margins going forward this year. Can you just provide some color on the impact on incrementals going forward? Consensus says sub-30% incrementals in 2Q, and then moving to the high 30% incrementals in the second half of the year. Is it reasonable to expect incremental improvement of that order of magnitude in the second half could be better on some of the job mix and exploration and some of the start-up costs fading? Could you actually see incrementals above 40% in the second half of the year?","Paal Kibsgaard","That\u2019s a good question. Olivier, you want to comment?","Olivier Le Peuch","Yes, thank you. So indeed, I think it's good to see that our top line sales is increasing in international market, and the mix is improving towards more offshore and more exploration. So that is certainly a play that is good and alarming for our strengths. This being said, I think the pricing environment internationally is still depressed compared to where we were and used to have in two or three or five years ago.","And as Paal did comment, about half of our revenue is, indeed, getting a pull-through that is accretive to our margin and certainly in the expected pull-through that we have anticipated. But we still have one quarter of revenue base that is changed based on contract condition, based on execution and based on pricing constraints that we have, highly competitive environments that is challenging us to add a full mix, that is accretive as we could hope.","So we are resolute to fix and to focus on this quarter revenue that is not building the right margins. And we are hoping that this mix, with the increase offshore, increased exploration will gradually improve our pull-through for the coming quarters, but I would not expect this to be a step change compared to what we have seen in the last two quarters.","Scott Gruber","Got it, appreciate the color.","Operator","Next we go to the line of Sean Meakim with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Sean Meakim","Thank you, good morning.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Olivier Le Peuch","Good morning.","Sean Meakim","I thought I'd ask a little more on Cameron. The business showed a really good order rate in the first quarter after a nice pickup in the second half of last year. I think it's maybe one of the best quarters for the industry in terms of awards that I can remember. Could you maybe give us a little more forward detail on the outlook for orders for the balance of the year, maybe a mix of small versus large opportunities and your confidence in a bottom here by the middle of the year in terms of the P&L?","Paal Kibsgaard","Olivier, you want to comment?","Olivier Le Peuch","Yes, thank you. Good question on Cameron. So as I did comment in my prepared remark, we do see, indeed, a gradual improvement of our book-to-bill ratio, the bookings parting subsea is supported by the shift to a more FID, offshore FID. The pipeline of offshore FID is increasing. As Paal did comment earlier from 50 last year, the pipeline is in excess of 80 this year. So we do expect that the Subsea 3 this year will be north of 300, similar to what we have last year.","So that will fall-through into a set of bookings for integrated project or nonintegrated. So we believe that the Subsea will maintain its book-to-bill full year ratio materially above one. This will include some step outs infield with existing customer, and this will include integrated new field \u2013 larger greenfield project like the two that we have won recently with Woodside, one of which for gas development in Senegal.","So we believe that the outlook is strong on the back of Subsea. With regards to drilling system, I think that this is a bit different as it is still a market where we benefited last year from quite a large set of land rig equipment and BOP take up, combined with mobilization and remobilization of deepwater rigs that we're preparing for the offshore companies. This will certainly change a bit going forward. But our land rig equipment will increase further as we step going forward.","So I believe that the outlook is strong. Book-to-bill ratio above one for the remainder of the year and aligned with the subsea offshore development and, to a lesser extent, with the further mobilization of rig and the land activity being steady.","Sean Meakim","Great, Olivier for all that detail. Thinking about also the cash flow in the quarter, some of it to rely on the detail and the working capital swing was as expected. But perhaps we could just come back to your confidence level in terms of free cash flow for the year at or above 2018 levels. I think that's been the expectation that you set out there. And looking beyond free cash, beyond the SPM divestitures that you're working towards, are there any other noncore asset sales that could be contemplated? I'm thinking of that \u2013 a little bit in the context of Sensia JV and the SPM process that you've laid out.","Paal Kibsgaard","Simon, you want to comment?","Simon Ayat","Sure. Look, in summary, if you look at the working capital deterioration beyond what we used to see in Q1, it's basically two things: pockets of delays in receivable collection, which is not very big, but it's already sorted out itself in the second quarter; and the other one is the build of inventory, which we experienced normally in Q1, and it was higher because what you heard about Cameron book-to-bill and the preparation for the projects to come.","So that's in summary, right. Normally, free cash flow in the first quarter, we struggle to keep it even because of the seasonality. Now as far as the total year is concerned, we're very confident on the free cash flow. We \u2013 as we already reported or declared that we will satisfy all our commitments from the cash that we will generate, and it's still the case. Actually, as I see it, is it's slightly improving as we go with our outlook.","Now you spoke about some divestitures. There are divestitures in the pipeline. We're working on them, but there is nothing concrete to tell you about the timing. But it is certainly, it will be a positive, and we're keeping this for \u2013 further the growth of the business or anything else. As far as Sensia is concerned, Sensia, we signed it. We will hopefully close before \u2013 by the latest by Q3, and there is about $250 million of this will be coming as part of the valuation and the split within the joint venture.","Sean Meakim","Great, thank you for that.","Operator","Next we will move on to the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead","Good morning, everyone.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Olivier Le Peuch","Good morning.","Kurt Hallead","So Paal, lot of emphasis rightly so on the international market. So I might want to maybe shift to Q&A and you mentioned what's going on in North America and activity level being down 10%. It sounds like that's maybe at the lower end of what you had previously discussed. So I was wondering if you could just give us some insights. Are you getting any better visibility now that oil prices have been higher than what these E&P companies had been budgeting for?","And can you give us an update? I think you idled a couple of frac crews during the course of the fourth quarter and whether or not there's been sufficient enough activity now to kind of bring those crews back in. And generally maybe just \u2013 you talked about potential for pricing improvement internationally, so could you give us similar kind of context around pricing dynamics in the North America market?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, okay. So I will say, first of all, we see a fairly consistent discipline from the customer base at this stage around living within or at least much closer to their free cash flow. This, I think, is partly driven by the management teams as well as from the investors side. So with that, that's really what's driving our prediction of about 10% down in the E&P investments in North America land.","As we go forward into the full year, visibility for the second half of the year is still fairly limited. For Q2, we are expecting the number of frac stages to go up, but a fair bit of that activity increase is going to be offset by the full impacts of the pricing concessions that we gave in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. We do expect hydraulic fracturing pricing to stabilize in terms of the bid pricing in the second quarter.","Now how this is going to evolve for the second half of the year, lack of visibility, I think, is still the case. I don't think though at this stage, that if we have a further run up of the oil price we're going to see the same, a rapid increase in spending as we've seen in previous years. There might be some increase but probably not as much as we saw, for instance, in 2018.","So I think that calls for another challenging year on hydraulic fracturing. Our focus here is just to continue to drive the efficiency of our operations and then focus on the commercial terms we have with our customers. And the focus here is not necessarily top line or market share. It's about margins, earnings contribution and cash. We have no CapEx plans to be deployed this year for fracking. We reactivated all the warm-stacked crews that we have set aside in Q4. They are now back up and running. And we still have another eight fleets that we can deploy without any CapEx requirements. So that's on the frac side.","On the drilling side, we saw the rig count come down a bit in Q1 as expected. It might slide a little bit further in Q2 as well. And for sure, we don't expect any major rebound in rig activity over the course of this year. So that will have some impact on our drilling business and mainly on the basic technologies. And we still see strong uptake on rotary steerable and still solid pricing and profitability on that. So it's a bit of a mixed outlook for U.S. land. I think it's going to be a challenging year.","The other thing we are focusing on is to continue to build our position in the technology dialogue with the IOCs that are ramping up both drilling and completions activities. So we're quite excited about the IOCs taking a bigger position in U.S. land. We work very well with them in the international markets. And I think that calls for a much more rich technology discussion going forward in U.S. land.","Kurt Hallead","All right, I appreciate that color. Maybe as an additional follow-up, the emphasis points here on offshore. I seem to recall that maybe in prior cycle periods, shallow water offshore could generate somewhere like 5x the revenue of maybe a U.S. \u2013 equivalent U.S. land rig, and deepwater could be something around 10x the revenue opportunity.","Given some of the changes that we've seen in the context of reservoir drilling complexity in the U.S. land business, wondering if kind of some of those ratios kind of still \u2013 kind of hold up. And as we're kind of hitting down that path, can you give us some insights to kind of differential growth Schlumberger may have relative to some of its peers.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. I can't confirm your numbers, although I will directionally say that the earnings, I would say potential we have internationally and whether that is on land or offshore, probably more so offshore, is obviously a lot higher than what it is in U.S. land down to the technology, down to the \u2013 just the complexity of the operating conditions.","And also if you were to kind of look at the E&P dollars spent by our customers, I would for sure say that our earnings potential internationally is about 2x \u2013 sorry, is 4x of what it is compared to our competitors mainly due to the fact that we have twice the market share and roughly twice the operating margins.","So the return of international growth and in particular, the return on offshore activity and exploration is what we have been waiting for. It's been quite a while of a wait here. Last year we had growth internationally was in 2014. So this is five years of waiting. So we are more than ready for this.","Kurt Hallead","Appreciate that color. Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Next is the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons. Please go ahead.","Bill Herbert","Good morning.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Bill Herbert","Yes. Hey, good morning. You mentioned in segmenting your international incrementals 1\/2 of legacy was highly accretive, 1\/4 was moderately accretive, 1\/4 was highly dilutive. Can you just segment that geographically for us. The half of the legacy international incrementals that are highly accretive, where is that being generated? Ditto for the quarter that's moderately accretive and ditto for the quarter that's highly dilutive on a regional basis.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thanks, Bill, for the question. So I was expecting that is to come, and we're not going to give more color on it. It has to do with how we handle this from a competitive standpoint, both what product lines, what geographies. So obviously we know what this is, and we have a very good handle on how we segment the international portfolio of contracts and operations. So I don't really want to go into the details of it. We have specific plans for the contracts that fall into this fourth quartile of our international business. But I don't really want to go into the details of what it is. That wouldn't be beneficial for our business.","Bill Herbert","Okay. And then similar segmentation question. Lower capital spending outlook 10%. Referenced from the late public E&Ps, the 40% to 45% rig count. With your discussion with KLO for profitabilities was just 40% to 45% [indiscernible] then there's 15% to 20% of rig count. And with the backdrop, oil prices up 40% to 45% year-to-date and markedly improved well economics, not only due to rising oil prices but also well cost inflations. I'm just curious as to whether you think that, that 60% of the rig count is going to be more responsive to cash flows in the second half of the year.","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, you're breaking off in part of the question. The way I would answer this is basically \u2013 we see the IOCs will increase their spend, which again I think is good for us. We are obviously quite active in working with them. But we also see the majority of the market, which is still the E&Ps and the smaller E&Ps, are going to stay much closer to cash flow this year, which is really what's driving the reduction in E&P spend. So our number of kind of plus\/minus down 10% is pretty much in line with some of the third-party surveys that you've seen as well.","With an increase in oil prices continuing over the course of this year, there could be some improvements to this. But I think directionally, I don't see the same significant increase that you might have seen in earlier years mainly because of this newfound discipline on staying much closer to the free cash flow.","Bill Herbert","Okay. And finally, do you have a comment with regard to the Q2 consensus estimate of $0.35? Do you feel comfortable with that?","Paal Kibsgaard","Olivier, you want to comment?","Olivier Le Peuch","Yes. So let me start by commenting on revenue outlook. So for Q2, we expect low- to mid-single digit sequential revenue growth in the international business. This is due to the seasonal rebound that we'll see in the North Sea and Russia in contrast with the first quarter. We expect steady growth in Middle East & Asia. And we expect a more nominal sequential growth in Africa and Latin America when we compare to what we have seen in previous quarter against the growth that we have seen.","In North America, I think you heard the comment before, we expect limited sequential growth firstly, because of the seasonal breakout in break-up in Canada. Next because the \u2013 if we see and have other fracturing activity up in stage counts, this will be largely offset by the impact of the lower pricing that was set during the key tendering and during Q1. So for Cameron \u2013 that is Cameron, I think it will be a smaller limited sequential growth on the back of strong OneSubsea, offset partially by drilling system and steady single-digit growth for both drilling and surface.","So that summarizes the increment of revenue from Q1 to Q2. So as it comes from the margin, we continue to improve our operational efficiency and our present contractual terms with customers, so impacting the international business as we discussed. And we hope to start to impact the most dilutive lower quartile for our revenue base. But based on all this, we expect this Q2 EPS revolving towards the current Street consensus. And we don't foresee no real room, at this point, to further improvement and upside revision for that.","Bill Herbert","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next we move on to the line of Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jud Bailey","Thanks. Good morning. Paal, I was wondering if I could get your thoughts on thinking about Reservoir Characterization margins in the path, kind of for this year. First quarter was a little lighter than we thought. But with all the commentary on exploration activity and offshore being so constructive, if you could help us think about the path for margins there. And I guess specifically, is it still feasible we see margins flat maybe year-on-year? Or is there potentially upside given kind of the work scope you're seeing on the exploration and offshore front?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. I would expect our Reservoir Characterization margins to continue to improve this year from what we saw last year. The characterization business should be and will be the business that is typically leading our incremental margin levels. So with the growth that we are foreshadowing, both in terms of offshore activity and even more so offshore exploration, this is all staying straight down the fairway for what we are excellent at doing in Reservoir Characterization. So I expect margins in 2019 for characterization to be up, and that they will be \u2013 being in the leadership of driving our incremental margins in 2019.","Jud Bailey","Okay, I appreciate that. And then if I could, my second \u2013 my follow-up is on CapEx. Question we get a lot is with the CapEx guidance this year. There have been concerns that you may be not investing enough in the business on a longer-term basis. Could you maybe give us your thoughts on how you're thinking about for capital spending and the sustainability of maintaining all your earnings power and investing as the cycle kind of continues to grow?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I\u2019ll comment on that. So first of all, what we've done through the modernization program is that we have opened up several new ways of driving effective capacity. In the past, typically, one unit of activity was served by one unit of additional CapEx. At this stage now, we have done three ways of serving our additional activity growth. One is through CapEx, but only a subset will be served by new CapEx. The other one is through the underlying efficiency improvements from the modernization program, and they will be much more visible when we start growing, which is the fact now.","And then the third thing that we are also getting much better at, and that is to drive capacity also through higher OpEx. That could be through running more maintenance shifts to improve our investments, operating investments in logistics to get higher returns and so forth. So first, we have a much more balanced view on how to drive full-cycle capacity. And obviously the advantage of efficiency improvements and OpEx-derived capacity is that you can manage that much better in the full cycle.","Now for 2019, what we try to do with breaking down the international revenue base, which is basically where we are deploying all our CapEx this year, it is to show that where we are growing at good incremental margins and good base returns, we are investing. And we are investing sufficiently, accompanied by the OpEx-derived capacity and the efficiency improvements. Where we are not going to deploy capital is in the part of the business which is not yielding the right returns.","And in that part, we will high-grade the contract base. We will potentially move capacity around to get better returns for what we have deployed. And we will not deploy new capital into that part of the business until the returns are adequate. That might create shortages here and there. But at this stage we are prepared to do that. And we will do that in very close dialogue and cooperation with our customers so they know what our position is. But we cannot, and will not, deploy capital into operations which are not yielding the right returns.","Jud Bailey","Okay, great. I appreciate the color, Paal. I\u2019ll turn it back.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, our last question comes from the line of Dave Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Dave Anderson","Thanks, good morning. So regarding the OneStim business in North America. As you mentioned, the IOCs, E&Ps private sale spend differently. So I'm just wondering when you think about deploying those eight remaining fleets or perhaps moving some of the others around, do you think about this purely from an equipment utilization pricing standpoint? Or is it important to pull in your sand mines or perhaps some of your other higher-margin businesses when you're looking at that \u2013 when you look at each one of those fleets?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, generally, we will look at the returns we are going to get for the frac fleets that we deploy. That's partly down to pricing, but it is also down to the operating efficiency and how well we work with the customers where we deploy this capacity, right? So some of these other considerations around the use of technology in frac obviously plays into it.","But I think the sand mines at this stage, this is what \u2013 we treat this as a separate business. A fair bit of the sand that we sell today is all the \u2013 independent of the frac operations. It's sold directly to either other frac companies or directly to our customers. So we obviously look at optimizing the whole situation here. But generally, when we deploy these eight additional fleets, it's going to be ensuring that we get the right returns on them by themselves where we deploy them.","Dave Anderson","Great, thanks, Paal. And then your Sensia JV you announced earlier this year, a really interesting business that seems to be kind of going after your sort of untapped market here. I was wondering if you could perhaps just give us a fair bit of an example of a target application? Conceptually, I get what you're talking about. Maybe if you can \u2013 like give us sort of field example of what you \u2013 kind of what Schlumberger and Rockwell each bring to the table.","I'm also curious as to the business model. Is the goal here to create a performance-based model? It would seem sort of ideally suited for something like that. Is that part of the pitch? Or maybe it's too early to ask these type of questions?","Paal Kibsgaard","Olivier, you want to comment?","Olivier Le Peuch","Yes. No. Thank you. So I think it's a fair question. It's a fair observation that some of the business could be and will be driven by performance model. So outside application first for this JV will be existing producing asset, brownfield assets where we believe in the land application, that the power of automation, data analytics and digital application will increase the efficiency, the amenability, and decrease the maintenance and increase the up line of those assets.","So example, I think actually is pump surveillance and optimization or at least as well, or existing process productivity where the surveillance and automation could be \u2013 help optimize some of the producing outputs of those operating assets. So we are getting excellent feedback from the joint engagement we have with some customers around the \u2013 what Sensia could bring to the market.","It's too early to say because the closing is still some time in the summer where this will start. But we expect the double-digit growth trajectory when we start this venture. And we will certainly get the benefit of the leadership, recognized leadership of Rockwell Automation, process control and having digital solution for the outfit. And we'll bring our domain \u2013 deep domain expertise, our measurement portfolio and obviously our digital capability with a debt-free solution.","So we believe it's a combination that is unique to the market, very well received and first application onto producing oilfield assets with, indeed, potential for a performance contract that will give us the upside on this automation opportunity.","Dave Anderson","Great, thank you.","Operator","And we'll turn the conference back to the host, right.","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay. So before we end, I would like to summarize the main points from today's call. Firstly, I'd like to clarify that we expect the Q2 EPS to be in line with the Street consensus of $0.35, and we don't, at this stage, see any upside to this number. Furthermore, global E&P spending is starting to normalize, which directionally means increased international investments to offset the accelerating production decline, while North America land investments are heading lower due to the E&P cash flow constraints leading to a likely downward adjustments to the current production growth outlook.","Second, in North America, where visibility into the second half of the year remains limited, we are fully focused on maintaining operational flexibility and improving financial returns and cash generation, leveraging the strong execution platforms we have built over the past years in hydraulic fracturing, drilling and artificial lift.","And third, we now see clear signs of a broad international activity upturn emerging both online and in particular offshore, seen by increases in rig count, new project FIDs and also renewed interest in exploration. All our 2019 CapEx will be deployed into the 50% of our international revenue base that is already producing highly accretive incremental margins. At the same time, we focus on securing improved commercial terms or return to the high-grading our contracts in the upper half of our international revenue base, which today is highly dilutive to our operating and incremental margins.","That concludes our remarks. Thank you for participating. We now conclude the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference is available for digitized replay after 9:45 AM Central Time today through May 18 at midnight.

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.","Simon Farrant","Good morning, good afternoon, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited second quarter 2019 earnings call. Today's call is being recorded from Paris, France following a Schlumberger Limited Board meeting.","Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Operating Officer. We will as usual first go through our prepared remarks, after which we'll open up for questions.","For today's agenda, Simon will first present comments on our second quarter financial performance before Olivier reviews our results by geography. Paal will close our remarks with a discussion of our technology portfolio and our updated view of the industry macro.","However, before we begin, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share was $0.35. Excluding charges and credits, this represents an increase of $0.05 sequentially and a decrease of $0.08 when compared to the same quarter last year. There were no charges or credits recorded during the quarter. Our second quarter revenue of $8.3 billion increased 5% sequentially, largely driven by our international operations. Pretax segment operating margins increased by 17 basis points to 11.7%.","Highlights by product group were as follows: Second quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.6 billion increased 7% sequentially due to activity increases beyond the normal seasonal improvements we typically experience in Q2. These increases were primarily driven by strong multiclient license sales and higher international Wireline activity. Margins increased 81 basis points to 19.8% due to the increased contributions from higher margin Wireline activity and multiclient.","Drilling revenue of $2.4 billion increased 1% as a stronger activity in the International Areas was partially offset by lower drilling activity in North America land. Margins decreased 45 basis points to 12.4%. Production revenue of $3.1 billion increased 6.5% sequentially, primarily driven by higher international activity across all the product lines.","Margins were essentially flat at 8% as the improvements in international margins from higher activity was offset by the effects of pricing pressure in North America land. Cameron revenue of $1.2 billion increased 5% sequentially. Margins increased 94 basis points to 12.6%. These increases were primarily driven by OneSubsea and Surface Systems. The book-to-bill ratio for the Cameron long-cycle businesses was 1.2 in the second quarter. The OneSubsea backlog increased to $2.2 billion at the end of the second quarter.","Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate was 16.7% in the second quarter compared to 15.5% in the previous quarter. This increase was a result of the geographic mix of earnings. In terms of cash flow, we generated $1.1 billion from operations leading to $459 million of free cash flow. Good performance for the second quarter despite the temporary delays in receivable collection that we experienced in certain regions.","Our net debt increased $335 million during the quarter to $14.7 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investment of $2.3 billion. During the quarter, we spent $101 million to repurchase 2.5 million shares at an average price of $40.12. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included CapEx of approximately $404 million and capitalized cost relating to SPM projects of $181 million. During the quarter, we also made $693 million of dividend payments. Full year 2019 CapEx, excluding SPM and multiclient investment, is still expected to be approximately $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion.","And now I will turn the conference call over to Olivier.","Olivier Le Peuch","Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter revenue increased 5% sequentially, driven by international activity. Our international business grew 8%, outperforming international rig count growth of 6%, while North America revenue grew 2% sequentially. I am pleased with the progress made and proud of our team performance, many of whom I met during the quarter on my visits to our global operations.","My comments today will include the Cameron business. I will start with our North America operation. In North America, consolidated revenue was 2% higher sequentially with land revenue growing marginally, while offshore grew 10%. Production revenue increased 3% due to higher cementing revenue and improved OneStim hydraulic fracturing fleet utilization in response to market demand.","These positive factors, however, were offset by the spring breakup in Canada and lower demand for drilling services as a result of the 5% decline in U.S. land rig count. North America land remains a challenging environment. Indeed, the E&P operator focus on cash flow has capped activity, and continued efficiency improvements have also reduced the number of active rigs and frac fleets, so far without major impact on oil production.","In response, we continue our returns-focused approach, deploying new technology and working closely with the major independents and IOCs that are initializing the development of unconventional shale resource at increasing scale. Our competitive advantage in North America land operation continues to build on our differentiation in technology and efficiency.","Surface efficiency is one area where we have made significant progress. One new technology is the MonoFlex, our new fracturing fluid delivery system, which significantly speeds up multiwell pad rig-up, and reduces nonproductive time and safety risk. Reservoir efficiency is another key issue for our customers.","We are seeing increasing take up of technologies that help customer design and deploy completion that mitigates or avoids parent-child well interference. Two such technologies are BroadBand Shield and Fulcrum cement. BroadBand Shield innovative fracture control technology limits the risk of communicating with or fracturing into nearby wells. By the end of June, BroadBand Shield services has been used on nearly double the number stage when compared to all of 2019.","Fulcrum cement improves stimulation efficiency by helping keep fracturing fluid in the target reservoir zone by improving the cement bond. In the second quarter, Fulcrum technology deployments tripled versus the previous quarter and double in the first half when compared to full year 2018.","In our other North America land businesses, Surface System grew 5% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. This was driven by the frac tree rental business, benefiting from MonoFlex technology and integration with OneStim. Artificial Lift was strong with sequential ESP sales growth of 5% from new technology and fit-for-purpose pump systems that outpaced low-flow service revenue.","Offshore North America, revenue increased 10% sequentially, primarily due to strong WesternGeco multiclient license sales. While offshore rig count has yet to increase significantly, customer interest is high, indicating stronger activity coming in the second half of the year. With the North America market remaining challenged in the coming months, we continue to protect our operating margin by focusing on our agile execution and operational efficiency.","In the international markets, we continue to witness broad-based activity growth. More than half of the international GeoMarket posted high single-digit revenue growth or better year-over-year. This was mainly driven by rig activity, but our performance was also enhanced by key GeoMarket activity exceeding normal seasonal rebounds.","The improving exploration trends of last quarter also continued. Wireline offshore exploration revenue grew by a third during the first half of the year with a sizable increase in new technology sales. As offshore momentum builds, shallow-water rig activity grew by 14% in the first half and deepwater activity is strengthening as new projects are sanctioned.","Cameron international revenue grew significantly over quarter-over-quarter, supported by leverage of the GeoMarket structure. This is the fifth consecutive quarter where the total Cameron book-to-bill ratio was greater than one. This was also the first quarter since we acquired Cameron, where all four product lines, both long and short cycle grew revenue sequentially.","Consolidated revenue in the Latin America area increased 12% sequentially from 21% revenue growth in Mexico & Central America GeoMarket. WesternGeco multi-client seismic sales had a strong quarter as exploration investment continued to gain strength offshore. In the Latin America North GeoMarket, revenue was driven by SPM activity in Ecuador, with the Shaya project continuing to improve from strong execution on waterflooding recovery.","Europe\/CIS\/Africa area consolidated revenue increased 11% over the previous quarter, on the back of seasonal activity recovery in the Northern Hemisphere and rig activity increase in Eastern Europe. In the U.K. & Continental Europe GeoMarket revenue exceeded expectation by growing 28% sequentially, with all product lines experiencing growth.","In the Russia & Central Asia GeoMarket, we experienced 12% revenue growth on seasonal recovery with the majority of product lines growing revenue high single-digits or better. Consolidated revenue in the Middle East & Asia area increased 5% sequentially with Far East Asia & Australia GeoMarket leading the way with 19% sequential revenue growth, mostly driven by offshore activity.","Elsewhere in the area, the seasonal activity recovery in China was partially offset by lower activity in Malaysia and India. Iraq was lower on completion of IDS project, and in Saudi Arabia, revenue increased on sales of intelligent completions. In the Middle East, the four Cameron product lines delivered double-digit revenue growth driven by increased activity and share gains across the portfolio.","As discussed in our last earnings call, we have initiated a systematic process to address underperforming business units and contract in the international markets. I'm pleased to say that more than two-third of our product line experienced sequential revenue growth in the international markets this quarter, and with each of them having expanded their margins. A few business units, however, continue to be highly dilutive to our international margins, and we are looking at their performance very closely.","We continue to work with our customers to resolve underperforming contracts, exploring ways to eliminate waste through joint planning or execution or improving terms and conditions to avoid unnecessary cost or excessive risk. Most customers are very receptive to this, as they see the benefit of increased operational performance and are increasingly concerned about securing supply of technology and resource for future activity uptake. These focused efforts are already producing visible improvement in our international margins.","As international activity increases, our deployment of CapEx is also prioritized towards business units with higher returns. This dynamic capital deployment is creating some tightness in the market, which is another catalyst for pricing improvements.","To conclude, we continue to see high single-digit revenue growth internationally, excluding Cameron consistent with previous guidance. At the close of the first half of 2019, international revenue has increased 8% year-over-year, while North America land revenue has declined 12% year-over-year. These results are in line for our view of the normalization in global E&P spending.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you Olivier and good morning everyone. I will start by adding a few comments to complement the geographical review of the quarter provided by Olivier and highlight how the current market developments are favorably impacting the opportunity set for Schlumberger.","Let me begin with the macro environment where the market sentiments remain balanced. On the demand side, the 2019 agency forecasts have been reduced slightly on global trade fears and current geopolitical tensions, but we do not anticipate any change to the structural demand outlook for the mid-term.","On the supply side, we continue to see U.S. shale oil as the only near to medium-term source of global production growth. However, the consolidation among North American E&P companies is further strengthening the shift away from growth focus towards financial discipline, while at the same time driving increased focus on HSE, technology adaptation, more collaborative business models, and it will also potentially dampen the large variations in investment levels throughout the cycle.","These effects combined with the recent decision by OPEC and Russia to extend production cuts through the first quarter of 2020, are likely to keep oil prices range bound around present levels. Although the markets are well supplied from projects sanctioned and partly funded prior to 2015, this source of supply additions will start to fade in 2020, thereby further exposing the accelerating decline rates from the mature production basins around the world.","In addition, while the number of new FID approvals in 2019 are likely to increase again for the fourth consecutive year; their size and number account for supply additions far below the required production replacement rates. We, therefore, maintain our view that international E&P investment will grow by 7% to 8% in 2019, a figure confirmed by the increasing international rig count and the growth seen in our international business in the first half of this year.","In contrast, the cash flow focus amongst the E&P operators confirms our expectations of a 10% decline in North America land investments in 2019. This means the welcome return of a familiar opportunity set for Schlumberger. For the first time since 2012 and 2013, we see high and single-digit growth in the international markets, signaling the start of an overdue and much needed multi-year international growth cycle. This growth is taking place in our backyard, where our technology performance and longstanding presence is highly valued and where our market share and profitability gives us an earnings potential up to four times that of our closest competitor.","Our leading international market position is built on our scale, footprint, and extensive technology portfolio, and further strengthened by the significant efforts we have made to evolve the company over the past five years along the following three directions.","The first is our internal transformation program that has modernized our workflows and our organizational structure, by creating stronger and more professional support functions with cutting-edge planning, execution, and collaboration tools. This has allowed us to significantly improve the utilization of our asset base and reduce our operating costs through improved planning, distribution, and maintenance.","At the same time, we have been able to deploy our people and expertise more effectively. All of this has created structurally lower capital intensity of our traditional product lines and lower working capital throughout our technology offering. This will together improve our ability to generate incremental margins and free cash flow as international activity continues to increase and pricing headwinds gradually become tailwinds.","The second major direction we have been pursuing is our digital strategy, which is built on the pillars of a cloud- based applications platform, an open data ecosystem, and a broad range of edge architecture solutions. Altogether, this represents a complete platform ready to support our customers in accelerating the digital transformation of our industry.","After years of R&D investments in line with this strategy, we are now introducing several applications to the market, with more to follow in the coming years. Within Reservoir Characterization, we recently introduced the GAIA platform at the EAGE conference in London. GAIA uses the power of DELFI to enable explorationists to discover, visualize, and interact with all available data in a basin without compromising resolution or scale.","In Drilling, our OneDrill platform is the first digital drilling system that is fully designed for integration and automation. It spans our drilling software applications, the automation-ready Rig of the Future, and a range of new downhole hardware that together will redefine the efficiency of land drilling operations.","And spanning Production and Cameron, our recently announced Sensia joint venture with Rockwell will, upon closure, be the first fully integrated oilfield automation provider focused on production measurement solutions, domain expertise, and automation.","The third of our focus areas in recent years has been to reduce the capital intensity of our business after we invested actively to build out the company in the early part of this extended downturn. Our efforts to reduce capital intensity began with our decision to exit the marine seismic business in late 2017, after our advanced geophysical measurement technology failed to deliver the needed financial returns over a number of business cycles and with no improvements in sight.","Another recent example is the divestiture of our land drilling rig business in Kuwait, Oman, Iraq, and Pakistan to the Arabian Drilling Company, a minority joint venture we have had with our Saudi Arabian partner TAQA for more than 50 years. Through this transaction, we will eliminate the need for capital investments into this rig fleet, while maintaining access to the rigs for our integrated drilling operations in the Middle East.","We will also follow a similar capital structure, but with other partners, for the deployment of the Rig of the Future, where we now have introduced the first rigs into U.S. land. We have also announced our plans to exit the businesses related to Fishing & Remedial services, DRILCO, and Thomas Tools that came with the Smith acquisition in 2010, as these business lines are capital intensive, generate a lower return on capital, and are not core to our drilling operations.","Beyond our recently announced transactions, which will produce approximately $1 billion of gross proceeds in 2019, we have also stated our intentions to monetize partly or fully our two SPM projects in Argentina and Canada, to demonstrate our ability to generate value from the assets we take under management.","And while we have decided not to undertake new SPM projects that involves any period of negative cash flow, we still see a significant opportunity to deploy the technical and commercial expertise we have developed within SPM through less capital-intensive contractual models.","On this basis, we have signed an MOU to work on a large integrated project in the OML 11 block offshore Nigeria, where we will act as the technical and project execution partner, with funding provided by a third party. This SPM-lite project, which involves no Schlumberger capital investment, is our preferred SPM business model going forward. We have also recently entered into a similar SPM-lite project to manage the Awali Field in Bahrain.","In addition to the divestitures and the new SPM-lite model, we have also structurally lowered the capital intensity of our core business over the past five years, where we today run our operations with a CapEx requirement of around 5% of revenue compared to historic levels of 10% to 15%.","In addition to the major directions I've just described, our day-to-day execution focus continues to be on further improving the quality of service we provide to our customers, optimizing the deployment of our resources, as we start to see shortages in several basins, and to address our underperforming contracts and business units around the world. Altogether, this should enable us to restore profitability to our target levels and also to drive incremental margins and free cash flow going forward.","Let me conclude my remarks with a few comments as we transition to a new Chairman and new CEO of Schlumberger. Earlier today, we announced the appointment of Mark Papa as our new Chairman and Olivier Le Peuch as our new CEO. I have spent the past decade as COO, CEO, and more recently as Chairman of Schlumberger, and while it has not necessarily been the friendliest of decades in terms of the business environment, it has been a fantastic journey and a great honor to be trusted with the responsibility to lead this amazing company, which is made up of the best people in our industry.","One of the most important duties of a sitting Chairman and CEO is to ensure an orderly succession process to the next leader, which in my mind involves several key responsibilities. The first of these is to pick the right time to step down. After a decade at the top of the company, with the deepest and most challenging downturn in our history behind us, and with the international upturn starting to take shape, I therefore asked our Board to start the succession process exactly 12 months ago.","The second responsibility is to fully support the Board as they run the search and selection process for the leadership succession. In this respect, I have provided input to the board on a broad range of topics, including candidate assessments.","The third is to support and guide the incoming CEO, as he or she gradually takes over as the new leader of the company, and it has been a pleasure managing side-by-side with Olivier over the past six months.","And the last responsibility is, in my mind, to walk off the stage as soon as the successor is ready to take over. This provides the needed freedom and space for the new CEO to drive the changes he or she sees fit, which is the overarching goal of any change in leadership. This is why I recommended to the Board that I do not stay on as Chairman. I will still be attached to the company for a period, ready to be an advisor to Mark and Olivier as required, but beyond that I will step completely into the background.","In closing, I would like to thank the entire investment community for the enjoyable and constructive working relationship we have had over the past decade. I would also like to thank my management team you are all amazing and also the Board of Directors, our entire organization, our customers, and our partners for their support. I will in many ways miss being a part of all of this, but it is now time to move on to the next chapter.","Thank you, we will now open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","James West","Hey, good morning, guys.","Olivier Le Peuch","Good morning, James.","James West","And Paal congratulations on a 22-year run at Schlumberger including 10 years at the top and the modernization and the transformation of the company, well done, and Olivier congratulations on your appointment as CEO.","Olivier Le Peuch","Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","James West","So Olivier, I guess you're up now. So as you take over here from Paal \u2013 and Paal I wanted to remember the initiatives that have been underway over his tenure and specifically the last several years during the downturn. Could you perhaps give us somewhat of an outlook or some guidance on how you see your strategy unfolding over the next several years, what are the kind of key points or at least some preview of your strategy? I know you're going to outline that more detail later on this year, but if we can get a preview that'd be great?","Olivier Le Peuch","James, I think you'll understand that my short-term project is clearly to complete first the transition with Paal, and to focus on execution during the upcoming weeks and months as we want to freely reach the opportunity set that this new market outlook presents to us. I will gradually indeed communicate the level of the strategy, during the next few months and quarters as we mature and deploy initially with the leadership team going into 2020. I don't think it's appropriate for me to deploy until at least \u2013 prefer to postpone that in a setting and a setup that would be more appropriate. So that could develop and then expose all of you to the right priority range going forward.","James West","Okay. Understood. And then maybe a follow-up, a lot of the recent adjustments within Schlumberger have been to move to a more capital-light structure to drive returns higher. I know Paal outlined several of these recent transactions. Should we expect more of this in the future? Or has the asset base with the business mix and portfolio been cold enough at this point? Or is there more to come?","Olivier Le Peuch","I think for the first I think this is nothing really new. We have started that two or three years ago, and I think we initiated this in larger scale with the WesternGeco transaction about a year or year and half ago. I think we had as part of the management team agreed that we need to look critically at every business we own and look at the return on assets and return on capital and then use a productive approach to anticipate and use every opportunity that exist in the market to either separate or do and run it differently. And I would associate it very closely to two of them the rig deal with ADC in Middle East and \u2013 and Sensia as I believe that here it was not necessarily for the asset, but it was more for creating the unique joint venture that would change the market. Why won't we start there? I think it will depend upon the market condition for one; and two, upon the results of some amount of the strategy. But clearly, we will continue to look at every way we can improve our return on the capital return on equity, and improve ROIC for the company. So that's trust \u2013 trust me and trust us on this for the future.","James West","Very good. Thanks Olivier.","Operator","And next we go to the line of Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Angie Sedita","Good morning, good afternoon, guys.","Olivier Le Peuch","Good morning, Angie.","Angie Sedita","Hi. So I echo James' remarks certainly. Congratulations Paal on entering the next chapter of your career and we really enjoyed very much working with you. And your willingness to meet with investors in the Street regularly is appreciated.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Angie.","Angie Sedita","So I think the first question for me is to Olivier or Paal or either one of you both is I think it's really interesting to see that the announcement with Mark Papa as Chairman of the Board. I'm not sure, but is this the first time that a non-exec has been named Chairman for Schlumberger? And it would be helpful to hear the rationale around the decision. Is it corporate governance? Is it a focus on U.S. land markets or the general strength of Papa? And is this a long-term position? Or is this an interim position?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I wouldn't read too much into the details of this. I think the Board is following pretty much the same recipe as when I took over. There was a split of the office Chairman and CEO also when I took over. My predecessor as CEO stayed on a bit longer, but also we had another Nonexecutive Chairman, Tony Isaac staying on for a couple of years after that as the Chairman as well. So the selection is basically down to what the Board has decided. And the split of the office at this stage is the same as what we did when I took over. And what the Board decides to do going forward, I think will be up to the Board.","Angie Sedita","Okay, okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe for Simon, there's been a lot of discussion on free cash flow and the dividend. I'm sure you heard this as well. Maybe you can give us color around the outlook for free cash flow into the second half of 2019. Is it reasonable to think that it could be similar to 2018 levels in the second half or $2.5 billion $2.9 billion I think it was last year and in that context the importance of the dividend and the dividend coverage which is roughly 1.25 time?","Simon Ayat","Okay. Thanks, Angie. Let me just elaborate a bit on the cash. As you noticed in the second quarter, we performed better than last year. We \u2013 although, we expected better actually, we were some delays in collection in certain geographical regions. But that put us at six months level at better than last year. We expect the second half to even be better than last year as well. As you know, we always perform during the second \u2013 we consume liquidity during the first half, because of working capital, and we improve it during H2 of every year. This year is not going to be an exception. We will continue the trend and you will see that this thing we're very confident on it. Our plans shows that the cash flow in the second half will be quite healthy.","And this takes me to this issue of the dividend coverage and return of capital. We obviously -- we haven't been producing enough cash to cover the return on capital but we know that this is a priority. This is an objective and we're comfortable that this level of cash flow free cash flow we will be reached and we will be able to cover our commitment to the return of capital to the shareholders.","Angie Sedita","Okay. And then if I could slip one more in. I mean with Paal's announcement on his resignation it's only natural to think about the CFO succession. While we clearly love you Simon we'd love to hear if there's any background on a heir apparent and just general timing.","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I would make the bold statement and say that Simon and I will most likely retire at some stage. A date hasn't been set yet and I think the date will be set in between Olivier, Simon, and the Board. And the succession will be carefully planned and we will inform the market when we are ready.","Angie Sedita","Great. Thanks. I'll turn it over.","Operator","And next we go to a question from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Scott Gruber","Yes, good afternoon to you and I'll reiterate the dual congrats to both of you Paal and to you Olivier.","Olivier Le Peuch","Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Scott.","Scott Gruber","And Olivier I realize its early days but just following up on James' strategy question a question we often get from investors is on OneStim. Is this considered a core for Schlumberger? And how do you think about that business going forward within the portfolio within the context of trying to reduce the capital intensity of the overall portfolio?","Olivier Le Peuch","Yes, good question Scott. I think first and foremost I think -- to participate into the North America land market is too big to ignore and I believe that our ability to extract value more for our customers to beat a technical challenge and create efficiency for the industry is critical. So that's the reason why I think we have stayed in the market invested in technology takes high value and meet our customer expectation there.","Going forward we will reduce the -- look at the way we run this business and look at the optionality going forward of doing it differently. But for now, I think we are in this business to make it the fittest.","We have made improvement on efficiency. We are working more across the international operator that are going in the basin also with some large independents. And they are acknowledging our efficiency and the impact we can provide.","Now, the future is the future and we will determine on the outlook of the market what is our position and be smart about what we take as a decision and manage the capital allocation accordingly.","Scott Gruber","Got it. And a follow-up on IDS, I was a bit surprised to hear some weakness in the IDS portfolio during the quarter. Can you just discuss what happened in the segment during the quarter? Was this just a speed bump? Is there something more to be concerned about here?","And then given the outlook for IDS in the second half how do we think about the outlook for the drilling segment in the second half of the year? I think the original expectation was for overall revenue growth in drilling for the year of around 10% and incrementals of 20% to 25%. How should we think about those two items for the rest of the year?","Olivier Le Peuch","Yes. Let me first come back onto the Q2 drilling performance as I think two or three things played at the same time. Actually internationally actually LSTK contract with IDS the product line performed very well and had growth internationally and improved their margin.","Unfortunately this was offset by the significant activity drop in North America both coming from the breakup and coming from lower rig activity by 5% into the land. Combined with this indeed the total IDS second show was actually lower than in Q1 and this is due to three things; first, Iraq we completed a project. Next, India has an activity that is linked to the project. And last, we had only a flat revenue or flat activity quarter-on-quarter in Saudi. So, Saudi is I think four LSTK contract and we are not necessarily pleased where we are on the performance.","But as any project we are focusing on improving quarter-on-quarter performance picking on earnings and trying to improve from this to accelerate the learning curve. This particular commission in Saudi we had geological well condition and operational issue that both combine to create the setback for execution.","But I spend quite some time within the team. I've been with the team on the ground and I'm pretty confident that actually the team has understood the gaps both technology and operational execution and that we'll gradually see improvement of our performance in the LSTK contract in Saudi. And in fact converge into the ambition we had which is to reach and be accretive from this execution to the Drilling Group margins.","Scott Gruber","Do you think that margin convergence can happen by the end of the year?","Olivier Le Peuch","I think we will review the progress during the third quarter. I'm planning to stand back and be with the team some time later this quarter to review progress. And then we'll at that time review which or action we take if we are short.","Scott Gruber","Got it. Appreciate the color. Thank you and congrats again.","Olivier Le Peuch","Thank you.","Operator","Next we go to the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead","Hi good afternoon in Paris and Paal I'll go the same path. I really appreciate your accessibility. I know you've done the absolute best you could in a very, very difficult environment. So, kudos to you and look forward to what your next gig is going to be. And Olivier welcome aboard and I look forward to get to know you and work with you. So, kudos on both fronts.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Kurt Hallead","Yes. So, I guess my line of questioning here would maybe focus on some of the operational dynamics. And I was wondering whether Paal or Olivier either one can you speak to the progress that you've made so far on improving the margins on the underperforming international contracts?","Olivier Le Peuch","So, as I've shared during my prepared remarks I think we initiated some key initiatives on the earlier this year to focus on both the contract and the very specific underperforming business unit and not only doing reviews, but also making actions to change the contracts and\/or to work with the customer to improve those.","So, yes, we have made progress. I think a few business units or contracts that were particularly dilutive have transferred into neutral or accretive during the quarter. And this is visible. As I said, more than two-third of our product line have experienced growth during -- internationally during the quarter and all of them experiencing growth and actually experienced improved margins quarter-on-quarter, which I believe is the first for quite a few quarters. And I think it's due to some of these heightened focus on to these underperforming business units.","So now it's not over. We still have a few business units or contracts or execution area where we are not satisfied and I think we have acknowledged this. We have all eyes on this issue and we're working with the team to improve those casually with customers, so that we improve our performance. And continually, we'll gradually improve our margins going forward.","Kurt Hallead","Okay. Appreciate that color. Thank you for that. And then my follow-up question would be, can you give us some general insights on what you see in terms of pricing trends for your drilling-related business lines and frac business lines in the U.S. as well as what you've been experiencing lately for pricing outside North America?","Olivier Le Peuch","So first, starting with North America, I think the pricing is still a little bit depressed environment, both due to the rig activity decline that we have experienced for the last few months combined with the excess capacity that still sits into the North America business. Now this being said, with the right technology, with the right value creation, with the right efficiency, we are capturing either to performance or to technology setup the pricing mix that I think is favorable and we have seen that in our RSS technology in the North America. We have seen that as a motion in Surface MonoFlex. We have seen this into some very specific dedicated fleet contract that we have with OneStim and this help us mitigate the exposure to the spot price market that keeps going down in the market.","Now by contrast internationally, while the market is not uplifting the price on the large tender for sure and we still see very much, very highly competitive environment across the globe, we see that in some spot geography with offshore or with in more remote geography with the right technology, be it in exploration or be it in drilling for difficult wells and difficult condition, we are starting to obtain updates and upgrades on our pricing commission or simply getting the mix that is more favorable to our margins. And as such, as I've commented before, several product lines internationally have had a quite robust pull-through in the last quarter.","Kurt Hallead","Thank you. Appreciate that.","Operator","Next we go to the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons. Please go ahead.","Bill Herbert","Good morning. You expressed basically that you expect the market to remain balanced. When one can make a case, which is shared by I think both EIA and OPEC that non-OPEC supply in certainly 2020 is going to significantly outpace global demand growth. Call on OPEC is going lower and the only thing keeping oil prices where they are is the combination of rational guardianship on the part of Saudi and GCC on the one hand and embargo and quarantined oil in the form of Iran and Venezuela. So walk me through your thesis as to why you think the market stays balanced?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, let me take on that one. So overall, what we're saying is that the balance between demand and supply as we see it today, we don't see it changing dramatically as we go into 2020. The main issue I think around the oil price today is the negative overhang around trade and what the implications of that is going to be for the medium to long-term. So I think in our assumptions, we expect that there will be some type of resolution to this that it's not going to go on for a long time. And that -- with that, we will not have a structural change to the global demand outlook.","On the supply side, as I said in my prepared remarks, we see a gradual fall off of the supply additions from the projects that were sanctioned and largely funded prior to 2015 and this will further expose the accelerating decline that we see in the more mature production base. You can look at Norway, U.K., Nigeria, Indonesia, Mexico and so forth and you will see there that even the non-presalt in Brazil, you will see that there is significant declines taking place there.","And I think with that, we don't see a major tailwind on non-OPEC production outside the U.S. in 2020. And with also the lower investment that was in the U.S. there will be growth in 2020 in the U.S., but I think it's going to show a decelerating pace. And that's why when you combine all of these things, we believe that the current situation is roughly where we will find ourselves also in 2020.","Bill Herbert","Okay. Well time will tell and I hope you're right. And the second question is with regard to views on the third quarter, if you could talk about that your comfort level with Street estimates et cetera? Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard","Olivier?","Olivier Le Peuch","Yes. I think just to give a little bit of light on this. So we do anticipate a similar earnings step up sequentially during the third quarter. And as such, we believe that the current Street estimates are achievable, however with no visible upside. Indeed, we expect the momentum in international growth and relative margin expansion to continue. That's what we have seen. And we do anticipate also the North America outlook to remain actually challenging as a result of again the sustained pricing pressure and limited or no activity increase partially for drilling. So that in all will result into the guidance I shared.","Bill Herbert","Okay. Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sean Meakim","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good afternoon.","Sean Meakim","I wanted to circle back to the dividend. This is something that we discussed when you were at our conference in New York last month, but it seems worth addressing here in this forum, as it's a common investor question. So Olivier, could you maybe speak to your commitment to the dividend as you step into this seat? And Simon, if we could maybe look beyond 2019, could you walk through the levers that are at your disposal to cover the $2 dividend with earnings and cash flow, if we end up in a lower-for-longer scenario in terms of how the macro unfolds?","Olivier Le Peuch","So let me first reiterate what I said indeed to the investor community back in New York is that we are committed and I'm personally committed to dividends. And I will not be the first CEO to step back on this commitment. So count on me and count on the team and the commitment we have into the operating margin improvement and working capital improvement to make it steady and a reality going forward.","Simon Ayat","Okay, let me just repeat a little bit what I said about the cash. Here with the performance that we have achieved the first six months and what we anticipate in the following six months, helped a bit by the divestitures that we have announced we're going to cover everything and overall reduce our net debt slightly but we will, which in other words we will reduce our net debt, which is borrowing and we will be able to cover all the commitment, the dividend and the continued buyback that we are performing on a quarterly basis to avoid the increase in the share count as a result of the stock-based compensation.","Now I'm going to go and confirm on our expectations for next year. Next year 2020, our forecast today that the dividend will be covered through the generation of cash from operation. And we will be able to cover the again the dividend and we will continue with this small buy back.","So the commitment to dividend as Olivier mentioned and historically there is no question about us maintaining the dividend. And I think given our forecast and what we see the way we're going to conduct the working capital and the investment in the projects we will have ample cash to cover it.","Sean Meakim","Very good. Thank you for that. I think\u2026","Simon Ayat","And on the divestiture, let me finish on the divestiture.","Sean Meakim","Sure.","Simon Ayat","You have three divestitures, which are close to $1 billion. And what we anticipate, what we included in our scenario for this half is at least two of them will be completed in the second half.","Sean Meakim","Thank you for that. I think that will be well received. We haven't spoken on Cameron yet. And so I was hoping to get a little more of the outlook there maybe a confirmation from your perspective that we've hit a trough in the margin in the first half of the year perhaps in the first quarter. In the release there were some nice contract wins with Chevron and Shell I noticed. How do you view -- how do you market share in subsea and perhaps in pricing as well as integrated projects are becoming a bigger part of the demand mix there?","Olivier Le Peuch","Good question. Thanks. I see first that Cameron Group continued to perform very well. I think I've seen that the long-cycle business continued to increase backlog. Now, we're in excess of $2.7 billion, mostly from subsea. And the short cycle as well is continuing to maintain share in North America and gaining share internationally. So you're seeing that mix including share internationally for the short cycle and maintaining share and rebounding from the activity. Long-cycle rebound is combining to help us with not only growth but also with margin improvement over the period.","So I think the margin, yes, I think we have made that comment that we believe the margin trough is behind us, and I believe that this is roughly the case. And I think we are -- we see going forward steady growth build on the backlog that the long cycle have accumulated and build on the further gain on the international growth.","As you have seen international growth was across the core product line in Q2 sequentially. We expect this to continue in the second half and this is built on the leverage of the GeoMarkets contracts that have started to take place and is giving a tailwind to the Cameron organization.","Now more specific to subsea, I'm very pleased with the engagement and the relationship and the alliance we have with Subsea 7. We have actually in connection with this, we have received the required anti-trust clearance and as such we have accelerated elevating alliance to now having a dedicated management -- joint management structure that oversees not only the engineering, but also the pursuit of new opportunity and integrated project and the execution of project during integration.","The result, of which I think you, may have seen it. We are quite successful in the last few quarter to gain against competition integrated joint project and I think the feedback that I've received personally from the customer and that Jean Cahuzac and his team have received from the customer is excellent both from the execution, but also as we presented one team to the customer we also offer them the optionality to choose us independently and go with either self-package or the SVF package.","So I am confident that this integration will continue to be a success for both company and I'm very confident that with regards to OneSubsea, the leadership there on the tieback compression and execution target goal they have they are the execution company in subsea to what I've seen. They have technology edge on subsea processing including compression. And you have seen the recent award from Shell, Ormen Lange in Norway, again a major award that cements our leadership into subsea processing system that have the reliability and deliver the recovery that the customer wants. So very well aligned and I'm confident.","Sean Meakim","Very interesting. Thanks, Olivier.","Operator","And our next question is from Dave Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Dave Anderson","Hi, good morning Olivier. Just a question on the offshore side. I think you had said in your remarks that your shallow water business was up 40% on the first half of the year, year-over-year. I was also really more curious with the deepwater side. Floating rig count is up 20 rigs or so this -- beginning of this year, see more FID exploration activity. Is this lining up for an inflection in the deepwater part of the market, which is so important to the Schlumberger business? Is that a 2020 event? Is it too early to tell? Can you just help us understand how the deepwater market is framing up for you?","Olivier Le Peuch","Yeah, thank you first for correcting the number. Maybe I misspelled it, but it was 14% -- one-four -- percent shallow water rig activity that is continued growth. The deepwater is seeing less growth of rig activity at the moment more single digit, yet we are seeing FID -- there is color on FID that are lining up in the third and fourth quarter of this year that would translate in further growth and acceleration of deepwater as we expect into next year.","Now the offshore activity at large I think is very solid on shallow both in Middle East and in Asia. And deepwater is seeing the rebound of activity in the West Africa at large. So I feel a combination of this is very favorable. As I did comment in my prepared remark, the offshore exploration is up more than 30% year-over-year year-to-date and this benefits very much Wireline. So the deepwater activity is more later-cycle increase that we'll see from the second half and into next year.","Dave Anderson","Great, thank you. A completely different subject. North America I'm sure you're getting bombarded with the talk of E&P capital discipline like everybody else is. What -- and I know you don't know exactly how the year is going to play out but fourth quarter activity looks like it could happen similar to last year. Is that how you're preparing your business right now for sort of the cadence of spending in North America to look similar to last year? And if so, what does that mean? Does that mean that you're prepared to stack more equipment? How do you prepare your business for that type of market, which could potentially fall from the back part of the year?","Olivier Le Peuch","No, you are correct. That's the assumption that we're also taking. I think, we do expect and anticipate that the combination of seasonal slowdown and budget exhaustion will create a trough in the fourth quarter as we have experienced last year, but will be followed most likely by our strengthening and rebound activity in Q1 across the area. So, we are prepared for this. We have done it last year. We'll be agile. We'll be certainly stacking some equipment. We'll be going and doing what is necessary to withstand this trough, but we are ready for it. I think agility is, one of the focus of the team, both in organization and into responding to the market trough and peak. So, we will do that again this year.","Dave Anderson","Great. Thank you, Olivier. We look forward to hearing from you later this year on your broader strategy. Thank you.","Olivier Le Peuch","Thank you.","Operator","And next, we'll go to a question from Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. This is our last question. Please go ahead.","Jud Bailey","All right. Thanks and good afternoon to you guys. First of all Paal, it has been good working with you over the years and good luck on the next chapter for you. And Olivier, I'll tell you also congratulations to you as well.","Olivier Le Peuch","Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Jud Bailey","Yes. My question I guess Olivier, just thinking a little bit bigger picture on North America, kind of given the outlook that looks like the U.S. market definitely needed to grow for maybe the next couple of years. How are you thinking about getting margins higher in that business? You kind of talked a little bit about OneStim a little while ago, but what about just North America more broadly? How do you drive better margins in that business and in this market where year-over-year you're maybe flat, but you're also having to navigate through pretty severe seasonal swings as well quarter-to-quarter?","Olivier Le Peuch","No, that's a challenge that we all face and I think the way, we are addressing this is twofold. First, focus on our own quality control which is our own efficiencies and our own productivity. And I think, we have deployed several parts of business system deep-hole tools and technology that improve our own surface efficiency that improve the way we operate, deploy equipment and run remote operation in the North American basin. And that has over time proven to be following through and helping to protect our margins.","Now, the second aspect is, reservoir efficiency for addressing the gap of technology that the customer looking for to address some technical challenge and the specifics of parent-child interference and all the specific performance contract that some of the major are ready to engage with us with. So, playing on both, continuing our execution on productivity, efficiency and modernization, which has already gained a lot of pull-through and aligning more with some critical customers partly around the technical challenge or around when we can, like we did with Oxy and Aventine, New Mexico around performance-based contracts and then using -- leveraging our system performance to extract the margin. Both these will be played one to protect our cost structure and to be more productive and the other one to uplift and capture some of the value we focus on that. So this will protect and increase our margin going forward.","Jud Bailey","Okay. All right. I appreciate that. My follow-up is on the third quarter commentary. I think, I believe you said you're comfortable with where consensus is and I wonder just to understand a little bit better, does that envision like a recovery or a little bit better margin trajectory from the drilling business which stepped down this quarter, took the hit to third quarter consensus? Do you envision that your drilling margins are probably more in line with where you would've expected earlier in the year? Just help us think about margin progression and how you're feeling about that and the various segments?","Olivier Le Peuch","Yes absolutely. I think the mix will be a little bit different, albeit similar trajectory for international. I will expect that some of the setback we had in the second quarter will resolve themselves and the activity mix will present itself opportunity for drilling to perform slightly better next quarter.","Jud Bailey","Okay. Great. Thanks. I'll go back.","Olivier Le Peuch","So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. So before we end today's call, I would like to do first few closing comments. Firstly, I want to reiterate my word of appreciation to all the Schlumberger employees, who did contribute to last quarter's success. Our performance -- second quarter performance was both solid on earnings and cash flow generation on the back of a broad international and offshore market recovery, partially offset by the persistent challenge in North America land market.","We did respond very well to this familiar setting, leveraging our international footprint, our technological strength and our efficiency and performance execution with most of product lines and geography posting material revenue growth quarter-on-quarter. Our elevated focus on service quality and low performing business units and strict prioritization of capital allocation have also resulted in margins improvement internationally.","Additionally, we are working closely with our customers to extract more performance on single contract and we are jointly planning the mobilization of the upcoming activities in response to the increased concern about future supply of resource and technology.","Looking forward, despite the fears of global trade and geopolitical tensions, the current activity trends looks set to continue with -- into the second half of the year with the next quarter driven by strengthening activity and increasing international spend, whereas we anticipate the North America land market to provide no relief from pricing pressure and little or no income or productivity.","We believe that this market conditions continue to align very well with our positional strength, particularly on our ability to generate much differentiated earning potential and we expect that the momentum initiated during the second quarter to continue during the remainder of the year.","Finally, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Paal for his support and guidance during the past six months, while recognizing the contribution he has made to the company for the last decade. I had the privilege to work side by side with Paal during most of the last 10 years and I've been very impressed by his unique leadership skills and his ability to steadily transform the company in a very difficult period and propel Schlumberger for future success at the lead of a new growth cycle internationally.","I believe in particular that the modernization platform and the digital technology leadership developed during the last few years will represent a winning foundation upon which we will develop our next chapter with an increased focus on cash and returns. I look forward to continuing the engagement with the investor community during the quarter and look forward to see many of you during the energy conference early September.","Thank you for your attention and participation to this call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Simon Farrant, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Simon Farrant","Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening. And welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2019 earnings call. Today\u2019s call is being hosted from New York City, following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting held here this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer.","Our earnings call will take a slightly different format. We have shortened our prepared remarks in order to leave more time for your questions. Olivier will start the call with his prospective on the quarter, after which Simon Ayat will give more details on the financial results. Then we will open up for your questions. ","As always, before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind the participants that some of the statem",".ents we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I, therefore, refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings.","Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our third quarter press release, which is on our website.","Now, I will turn the call over to Olivier.","Olivier Le Peuch","Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. I would like to ask through the earnings release my comments on the quarter before covering some of the points critical to understand.","First of all, as you have seen in our release this morning, we have taken enough of the non-cash $12.7 billion charge. This charge reflects the impact of market conditions have had on the valuation of our goodwill intangibles and fixed assets. None of these changes our ability to generate strong cash flow as these quarters has once again demonstrated, leaving us flexibility to navigate a more uncertain market landscape. Simon Ayat will discuss the charge during his remarks.","I will now comment on our Q3 operational performance followed by the short-term outlook and conclude with a brief update on our strategy implementation. Our third quarter results were very positive in a mixed market environment, driven by strong international performance. The international margins improved and we delivered more than $1 billion in free cash flow.","Additionally, we recorded the best ever quarterly safety performance for the company, an outstanding achievement setting new safety performance benchmarks for our industry. All-in-all, very solid quarter aligned with our performance vision and our focus on returns. I am very pleased with the results and I am proud of the Schlumberger team that delivered this performance.","The financial results this quarter were driven by the strength of activity in the key international markets. Some activity picked in Russia, the CIS and the North Sea, the Far East and Asia regions also saw strong growth and new projects began in sub-Sahara and North Africa. Only Latin America revenue was lower on reduced activity in Mexico and Argentina.","In North America, we experienced strong offshore sales offset by minimal growth on land. OneStim activity was modestly higher, recovering from the spring break up in Canada during Q2. Towards the end of the quarter, however, we saw lower pricing and increased gaps in the frac calendar, customer award programs were constrained by cash flow.","North America land drilling revenue was essentially flat, despite rig count reductions as our fit-for-basin technology access approach equipped -- on equipment sales and leasing as offset decline. Cameron results closed in line with expectations. This included robust operating margins, building on sequential growth in most international regions, which were offset partially by declining activity in North America at the end of the quarter.","Our international performance this quarter was very solid, with the high double-digit basis points improvement in our margin on the back of 3% sequential revenue growth. More than two-third of our product lines and GeoMarkets posted both sequential revenue growth and margin expansion. Leveraging [indiscernible], offshore and exploration activity mix, and the deployment of new technology.","At the closing of this quarter, half of our international GeoMarkets have posted year-to-date double-digit revenue growth. This improvement in international margins was achieved, despite the lingering and sustained effect of a handful of contract that are highly dilutive.","Without the effect of these underperforming business units, our growth in international margins would have been even greater. We are making progress engaging with our customers on those contracts, working collaboratively to improve terms and condition and to enlist their support to improve our operations.","As part of this plan, I have been taking personal actions during the last few weeks and anticipate visible progress during the coming months and quarters. Margin improvement and change on capital deployments are both part of our increasingly retail focused approach under the new capital stewardship element of the strategy.","As international activity increases, our deployment of CapEx will be further prioritized towards the business units with higher returns. This action together with increasing activity is starting to create some tightness in the market which is a catalyst for pricing improvements.","Now, I will move on to the short-term outlook for our business. Based on our Q3 year-to-date results and our outlook for Q4, we still expect full year high single-digit international revenue growth excluding [Cameron].","Sequentially, however, Q4 will include the seasonal activity decline in the Northern hemisphere and we anticipate only muted year-end sales. We are also closely monitoring the situation in the Ecuador following the recent events and are preparing for further decline in Argentina.","In addition, we expect seasonal weakness in North America as the fourth quarter develops. We are anticipating a year end slowdown in North America similar to last year due to operator budget constraints. However, this year the activity reduction has started earlier than last and we anticipate the second should decline in Q4 to be more pronounced than last year.","Moving on to the macro and medium-term view, the macro environment remains challenged with limited visibility, particularly in view of the global trade concerns that are challenging both economic growth and the rate of oil demand growth.","At the same time, the U.S. production growth rate has declined for the last eight months and it is expected to drop further in 2020 as a result of the reduced activity this year. Therefore, and that\u2019s sort of a recession, the prospects for international activity growth remain firmly in place.","In this market context, our approach in North America land is under evaluation, for both the medium- and the long-term. We are already scaling to fit the OneStim business and we will be starting fleet as the market contracts during the fourth quarter.","At the same time, the strategic review of this market is well underway and will be completed during the fourth quarter for execution early next year. This gives me the opportunity to update you on our strategy execution.","Last month, we presented four key elements of that strategy that included leading and driving digital transformation in our industry, developing fit-for-basin solutions, capturing value from the performance impact for our customers and fostering capital stewardship. Performance is at the heart of this new strategic direction.","We are already off to an excellent start on digital. We presented our vision of the E&P industry to 800 customers and technology partners at the global SIS Forum in September. There, we demonstrated our firm commitment to an open digital environment that we believe can unlock further customer performance.","This Forum marks a new chapter for the digital future of our industry. The intellects from our customers and digital partners was far beyond our expectations and is already translated into sizable opportunities. The central JV is also an important part of our digital strategy and the announcement of its closing reinforces our leadership of, and commitments to the industry digital transformation.","We are also making progress with our new fit-for-basin strategic approach. In the release today, there are multiple examples of fit-for-basin technology, all of which drive our customer performance, such as NeoSteer at-bit steerable system and Aegis drillbit technology.","In addition, in North America, I am pleased to report early success of the technology access strategy, we have said and leasing of rotary steerable tools. This is a new channel that access to new markets where our participation was previously minimal.","Also in North America, our flagship project with Oxy in the Aventine Basin is now operating at scale. We have continuously improved operational efficiency, setting new frac goals in the Delaware. The value being created is shared through underlined commercial model and is a good example of our new strategy performance model approach.","Finally, as another base to our SPM strategy, we have big progress in our divestiture of Argentina assets as we have few offers in hand that we are altering with the anticipation to finalize with the other party during the upcoming months.","Since taking the role as CEO for Schlumberger, I have made the point of visiting many of our customers, our people and our locations. The reception by our customers bode for engagements and strategic direction has been very positive. The enthusiasm of our people has been highly motivating and their commitment is evident. The industry is acknowledging the need for higher performance in the New York.","All-in-all, I am very pleased with the initial steps of our strategic execution and we have internal and external alignments with our vision to become the performance partner of choice in our industry.","I will now pass the call over to Simon.","Simon Ayat","Thank you, Olivier. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share was $0.43 excluding charges and credits. This represents an increase of $0.08 sequentially and a decrease of $0.03 when compared to the same quarter last year.","During the quarter we recorded $12.7 billion of pretax charges driven by market conditions. These charges primarily relate to goodwill, intangible assets and fixed asset impairments. As such this charge is almost entirely non-cash. Details of the component of this charge can be found in the FAQs, at the end of our earnings press release.","These impairments were calculated as of August 31, 2019. Accordingly, the third quarters\u2019 results benefited from a $27 million reduction in depreciation and amortization expense. Approximately $21 million of this $27 million monthly reduction relates to the production group. The remaining $6 million is reflected in our corporate and other line item. The after-tax impact of this one-month reduction is approximately $0.015 in terms of EPS.","Our third quarter revenue of $8.5 billion increased 3% sequentially, largely driven by our international operations. Pretax segment operating margin increased by 113 basis points to 12.8%.","Highlights by product group were as follows. Third quarter reservoir characterization revenue of $1.7 billion increased 6% sequentially. While margins increased 149 basis points to 21.8%. These increases were primarily driven by strong international wireline activity and higher WesternGeco multi-client license sales in North America.","Drilling revenue of $2.5 billion increased 2% driven by stronger drilling activity in Russia, China and Australia. However, this was partially offset by lower revenue in North America land and Saudi Arabia. Margins were flat at 12.4%.","Production revenue of $3.2 billion increased 2% sequentially, primarily driven by strong international completions activity. Margin increased 148 basis points to 9.1%, primarily driven by improved international margins from higher activity. The reduction in depreciation and amortization expense as a result of the third quarter impairment charge accounted for just under half of the margin improvement.","Cameron revenue of $1.4 billion increased 3% sequentially primarily driven by OneSubsea margins increased 29 basis points to 12.7%. The book-to-bill ratio for the Cameron long-cycle business was 0.8 in Q3. The OneSubsea backlog increased -- decreased to $1.8 billion at the end of the third quarter. This decrease reflects a cancelled project in the North Sea.","Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 16% in the third quarter, as compared to 16.7% in the previous quarter. We generated $1.7 billion of cash flow from operations during the third quarter.","Our net debt improved by $347 million during the quarter to $14.4 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $2.3 billion. We received $250 million in cash and just after the quarter as a result of the closing of the Sensia joint venture.","During the third quarter, we issued the three tranches of EUR500 million notes each. The first is due in 2024 at 0%, the second due in 2027 at 0.25% and third due in 2031 at 0.5%. These notes were subsequently swapped into U.S. dollars with the weighted average interest rate of 2.5%.","During the quarter, we also repurchased $783 million of our outstanding 3% notes due in 2020 and $321 million of our outstanding 3.625% notes due in 2022. These actions have served to improve the company\u2019s capital structure.","During the quarter, we spent $79 million to repurchase 2.2 million shares at an average price of $36.64. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included, CapEx of $415 million and capitalized costs relating to SPM projects of $194 million. During the quarter, we also made $692 million of dividend payments. Full year 2019 CapEx, excluding SPM and market client is expected to be between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion.","And now, I will turn the conference over to operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First we go to the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","James West","Hey. Good morning, Olivier.","Olivier Le Peuch","Good morning, James.","James West","So, Olivier, as you exited the third quarter, could you describe what the market conditions were, how we should think about the fourth quarter? It sounds like sequentially down. And then also, how is 2020, in your view, starting to shape up?","Olivier Le Peuch","Yeah. No. Let me comment on this, James. So I will separate my comments between international and North America land, specifically. So first on the international side, I think, similar to what we see every year, there is a seasonal effect in the Northern Hemisphere due to the winter season that affects primarily Russia, it affects then China and the North Sea.","And we see and affect every year on the rig activity and our revenue that we collect from those regions. So this is not unusual. We don\u2019t expect any minimal impact than we have every other year, but I think this is something to account for.","We typically on year-ends also have year-end sales of product equipment and we believe this could happen, but this will be as we have seen the last two years or three years, fairly muted annual sales as the operator will remain cautious on their budget in preparation for 2020.","On the flip side, on the North America land, as I did comment in my introduction remarks, I believe that the rate of decline will be at a risk to be higher than last year as for two reasons. The usual holiday season break in the winter, I think, is looming. But also we have seen that the [inaudible] absorption and discipline on operating within cash flow has led operator to cease operation earlier than they did last year.","We have started to give notice of operation gap from September and the rate of the decision has been accelerating. So we expect as a consequence that the rate of decline quarter-on-quarter in North America might be higher than last year sequential delcine.","Now turning to next year, I think, at some of -- a major, as I commented, a major recession or major event geopolitical or economic events. We foresee that international growth will remain in place, albeit possibly at a different lower rate possibly. But we believe that the strength of offshore activity deepwater or shallow will not cease overnight and we continue to support 2020 international growth.","When it comes to North America, it\u2019s too early to call. I believe that the market is still lacks stability and we can only comment on the rebounds in Q1 that is usual rebounds from the holiday season that we foresee happening, the strengthening of activity from January, possibly strengthening of pricing, but this is too early to call.","James West","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful, Olivier. Thank you. And then with respect to the charges that were taken during the quarter, understanding they only helped EPS by about $0.015 here. What drove the timing here of taking these charges especially kind of midyear, why not end of last year?","Simon Ayat","James, Simon here. I will take this.","James West","Hey, Simon.","Simon Ayat","Basically -- hi. During -- there are two events that took place in the third quarter that made us look at closely at the carrying value of our assets. One is the new strategy by Olivier, which has been publicly announced and discussed, and we continue to develop it as we go forward. The other one is the market valuation that we have seen. Although, we have touched lower points before, I will take the second reason first and then discuss the first one.","James West","Sure.","Simon Ayat","Although, we are -- we have see lower valuations before, but during the third quarter were more consistent and frankly very low point, unfortunately. That forced us to look at our goodwill and intangible carrying value.","As you are aware, most of the goodwill and intangible comes from two major acquisitions. In 2010, we did the Smith acquisition, which was almost 100% paid by stock. We issued 138 million shares at that time, and then, Cameron in 2016, where we paid almost 78% in stock. The book value of those two acquisitions were booked for Smith at $56 per share, for Cameron at $72 per share.","As such, our carrying value of the goodwill and intangible it\u2019s inflated, given where our valuation is. And this has taken very long analysis, pretty scientific actually and we reached this number.","Why it is in Q3? Because it is a Q3 event. We record things as they happen. We don\u2019t -- we are not influenced by timing. Yes, normally at the end of the year you do a more thorough review. But given the changes we have seen in Q3 we did this thorough review in Q3.","The other items that you have seen, which is mainly increased asset impairment and mainly in OneStim North America, is a reflection of our actions toward this activity. As Olivier mentioned, we are looking at this activity. We have excess capacity there. And we have taken the decision that this is unfair. We don\u2019t see it as reactivated in the near future and we took the decision to write it off.","So I covered the reasons behind it. I know I answered more than what you asked, but I wanted to make sure that everybody understands our approach and why it is a Q3. It\u2019s not just because we had a change of mind. It is a reflection of real issues that took place in the third quarter.","James West","Got it. Thanks, gentlemen.","Simon Ayat","Sure.","Olivier Le Peuch","Thank you.","Operator","Next we go to Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Angie Sedita","Good morning, Olivier.","Olivier Le Peuch","Good morning, Angie.","Angie Sedita","So I appreciate the color on the international markets and a little bit of a follow-up there on pace of growth for 2020. I know it\u2019s early, but do you still feel comfortable with mid single-digit revenue growth in 2020 or is it still a bit early to tell for sure? And then also, I guess, I would add to that, the asset sales that occurred in 2019, the impact on both revenues and margins?","Olivier Le Peuch","Yeah. Let me take that first and then I will address the second one. So, it\u2019s -- I think to be clear as mid single-digit rather than low or high. I think it\u2019s too early to pull and call at this point. Not that we don\u2019t have good visibility. But I think the customer are still in the process of setting their vision for 2020 and are serving the macroeconomic factor that you all know about and I think we have to be cautious here.","We believe that the continuum of offshore activity and the momentum that the industry has set there is not here to stop, particularly on the deepwater side. But I think some other region and some other basin would be more at risk of a decline in activity or decline in reject for next year. So it\u2019s too early to call, but clearly, we see growth in international next year.","So when it comes to the impact of the announcement -- announced divestiture, so we have three divestitures underway. One is already closed, the Sensia. That has been closed two weeks ago. The second one relates to the divestiture of asset to the JV that we own with EDC. And the third one relates to drilling and tubular accessories tubes to shape that we are divesting.","So when you look at the impact of these three on a yearly basis, the revenue will be short 2% of global revenue. The impact when you combine the three, when the three will be completely closed and completed and the impact on the earnings will be $0.01 to $0.02 for the year. So, Simon, may want to add more, but that\u2019s the impact on a full year basis.","Simon Ayat","I just want to explain that two of the transactions or the divestitures are basically creating JVs or one is creating the JV of Sensia, the other one enhancing the JV of EDC Drilling in the Middle East. So we are losing the revenue and the reason we are not losing as much in earnings is because we will have a higher pickup of our equity participation in the two JVs.","And the third one has a really minimal impact on the profitability. And therefore, as Olivier mentioned, it\u2019s $0.01 to $0.02 per year impact on margin. However, the revenue is a larger impact, less than 2% of the total.","Angie Sedita","Okay. Perfect. That\u2019s very, very helpful. I appreciate the color. And then, I guess, a little bit further on the international side, thoughts around the pace of margin growth for 2020, given your initiatives on the transformation, digital, and obviously, these asset sales as well? But -- and then these contracts that you are trying to address in the Middle East, so just talk about margins for next year on international and the pace?","Olivier Le Peuch","So I will not comment on the target -- the target\u2019s not set. But the ambition we have is to continue to grow and expand our margin internationally and we have seen that we have the high double-digit basis point improvement during the quarter. I will continue to look and work using the strategy to execute to a part of margin expansion for the year.","So if you look at it from a very high level, there are three buckets what -- that we see. The first one relates to our ability to resolve some of the underperforming business units, the highly dilutive contracts that are lingering and impacting our results.","We have made some progress, not to the pace I would have expected necessarily on being very ambitious this year, but I think, I am confident that we have a path to improve this that will impact the results next year.","Similarly, in the first bucket I would put continuing to execute using our new modernized platform of operating system. And I think we are setting a two years rollout to complete our transformation internationally and I look forward to have also some pull-through on that operating model with efficiency of self-help, as we call it, impact on our margins.","And next bucket is, obviously, I will call it the digital and all the technology, trying to replicate some of the success we have seen in North America oversees in technology access to third-party regional players who are accessing our technology and using it in lieu of CapEx in terms of the markets.","And digital where we expect that the outcome of what we have just done last months and the momentum that we have gained in the industry will give us an increased share of the digital market and as such will be contributing to the margin.","So last would be further long-term outlook and the performance model and other horizon of growth that we will disclose later. But I believe these two buckets will clearly impact the next two years or three years, but it\u2019s difficult to say at this moment. But our ambition is to grow the international margin next year, indeed.","Angie Sedita","Thanks. I will turn it over, guys.","Simon Ayat","Thank you.","Olivier Le Peuch","Thank you.","Operator","Next we go to David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Anderson","Hi. Good morning, Olivier. So on your fit-for-basin strategy, obviously, you are focused on the North American business right now and after writing down assets during the quarter, you talked about more of a strategic review in the fourth quarter. We are talking about 2020 numbers, but it\u2019s kind of hard to get there with all these changes happening in North America. I was wondering if you could just kind of lay out a little bit of kind of what you guys are looking at, like, what parts of the North America business are under the strategic review and should we expect broader retrenchments in certain parts of the U.S. land business next year?","Olivier Le Peuch","No. A very good question, David. So as we have explained during the strategy presentation back a month-and-a-half ago, we are doing a deep review of the entire business we are operating on North America land and this is not only OneStim but every part of our business there.","And the first thing we are doing is we are doing a scale-to-fit approach to the market view, meaning that we are not doing up to scale. We are doing up to scale where we believe it fits for every business in every basin.","So this is what we are in the middle of doing as we speak for OneStim in each of the basins where we operate and for each of the product lines where we are currently operating in the North America land.","So that is the scale-to-fit approach to our strategy to review the outlook, to review our market position, to review our strengths, anticipate the technology and opportunity with customers, and making a decision at that point on how to treat this portfolio and move forward with a reduced portfolio more fit to one or multiple basin as opposed to all basins or make a decision to change the business model to grow for technology access, setting up our technology as opposed to operating our technology. So that\u2019s the approach we are taking.","As we speak, we are complement this by recognizing that there are some technologies that we have developed that are highly successful and we continue to feed our technology team with what we need to differentiate in basin to create the performance impact.","We have seen some of the release of the -- and the success we have had have helped us actually maintain is not last quarter, slightly improve our margin, excluding the term of effect in North America land due to the effect of this technology success. So we will continue to bring us technology and we are looking at our portfolio of business in North America and making a decision to exit or continue and expand or move to a new business model. So to early to say, but yes, all option on the table, partly for the OneStim, as it is certainly as you know, they are dilutive business to our all business in North America.","David Anderson","Thank you. Kind of a slightly different question on North America, you highlighted some offshore strength which was a bit of a surprise and granted there\u2019s some seismic here. But you made a few comments about offshore being a support for the market next year. You actually highlighted international there. But I am just wondering if this is a harbinger of things to come for offshore in general and just trying to tie that into the lower subsea Cameron orders this quarter. How do you see that trending over the next two quarters, because it sounds like you are somewhat optimistic on offshore, but I don\u2019t want to put words into your mouth there?","Olivier Le Peuch","No. Let me comments on this. So the view I have is that the offshore market is a market that doesn\u2019t compact and expand on a monthly or on a quarterly basis. It\u2019s more steady and it is more longer -- long cycle and that\u2019s partially true for deepwater.","So we have seen growth because we slow recovery of deepwater for the last 18 months. We have seen faster recovery of the shale in the last 12 months. So we believe that some of these fundamentals will stay in place. Not necessarily long-term, it\u2019s too early to call, but to the medium-term it is the case. So I believe that the momentum that this market has is here to stay for the foreseeable six months to nine months, beyond that is too early to say.","The FID and the rate of FID for subsea have not necessarily slowed down. I think some of them have been delayed for technical reasons. But we expect some of the key FID to be approved later part of this year, early next year.","The subsea or OneSubsea, looking this quarter, I think, is a matter of scheduling of how and when this booking comes in seconds. We are still having a book-to-bill ratio year-to-date largely above 1 for OneSubsea. So as you can see that the subsea recovery is in place and we continue to unfold.","David Anderson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next we go to the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Scott Gruber","Yeah. Good morning.","Olivier Le Peuch","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Gruber","Can you provide some color around the outlook for improvement under the new strategy? In EBITDA dollars, in free cash dollars, since assets are being removed from the portfolio to optimize around the core, margins will obviously improve. But could you provide some color around your ability to grow cash flow and free cash flow dollars, assuming limited market assistance?","Olivier Le Peuch","I think the first and foremost ability that we have to grow cash flow is to improve margins, clearly, and that\u2019s the first foremost. The next one for cash flow is ability to improve our working capital efficiency, both of which we have demonstrated this quarter.","Long-term, obviously, it depends on the mix and where we have seen growth in margin improvement. So I still believe that fundamental international growth that we is still in place where we have a premium on margin compared to North America.","The effects and execution of our strategy, scale to fit to fix North America and to enhance our net margin in dollar, as well as in percentage were both combined to improve our margins. We believe that the asset efficiency that we have improved over the last couple of years due to our transformation, combined with modernization of our working platform to -- will continue to have positive effect on working capital efficiencies. So you combine all this, I still believe that the ability to deliver cash will only improve and the total cash conserving, absent of a recession will improve going forward. You want to add anything, Simon?","Simon Ayat","You said most of the things. The issue of the cash flow definitely it is earnings first and then the management of our capital structure and the working capital. We normally do very well in the second half, as you have seen. Third quarter was $1.1 billion and we anticipate the fourth quarter to be even better than this performance.","In terms of next year, we have a plan to continue to be very cautious in our capital deployment, and this will help the free cash flow and continue the performance on our working capital. Our working capital is normally subject of receivables inventories.","We know where we stand. We always have our pockets of collections here and there and we intend to soften them. And we feel comfortable between our generation of cash from operations and the -- some of the divestitures that are coming will be more than sufficient to meet all our commitments, including the dividend.","One more thing to add about next year, you don\u2019t see lower SPM investments because of what we already announced that we are going to divest and we are going to -- it doesn\u2019t require as much as we have done in the current year.","Scott Gruber","Got it. And at this point are you comfortable with the mentioning of the drop in SPM CapEx?","Olivier Le Peuch","I am sorry?","Scott Gruber","Are you willing to mention where SPM CapEx is going next year?","Olivier Le Peuch","Well, SPM CapEx this year is around 750. And we anticipate that this will be much lower next year. I mean, when -- I don\u2019t know exactly where, we have not finalized all the plans, but start of 500, 400, probably.","Scott Gruber","Got it. And then one additional question, one tweak to the strategy seems to be a willingness to selectively sell or lease technologies in various markets to third parties, which will then provide the service of wellsite deployment. Can you provide some color on this tweak to the strategy and what is the breadth of this strategy by-product line? Which geographies are you looking at deploying the new strategy? And importantly, how do you get comfortable around not creating additional competition in these various markets?","Olivier Le Peuch","Yeah. Scott, this strategy, we call technology access subset of fit-for-basin, where we believe that in target basins, particularly the hybrid basin, the capital intensity that is required to fulfill and prosper in the basin and the high competitiveness by local players is out there in both condition that is capping our market access.","So we have realized and we have tested this in North America and we are accelerating the opportunity to lease or sell selective technology that we believe can help us access markets that we were not accessing before.","So these are two consequences. Our first is new business model that is attributive to our goals and our returns. And, secondly, is to lower our capital intensity, as we typically sell these assets. So we don\u2019t require CapEx to expand in this marketplace.","So where do we do this? Typically, where there is a set of local competitors, for one, which is highly located in North America, where if you were to take the drilling space, there more than 50 local competitors are competing in drilling services. We expect this to be the case in Middle East where there are regional players and other parts of the world where there hybrid basin.","But when it comes to product line, the drilling is one, obviously, this is where we started. But we will not stop there. We are doing it for some of our perforating equipment in Wireline and continue to expand and we are currently accessing a part of the strategy for every product line. The portfolio that we are waiting to sell was specifically designed to sell and or lease to third-party.","This tool capacity we have as well helps because we provide detailed services and retooling of this equipment, so to assure that the performance of this technology is up on par with the capability of this technology.","So am I comfortable? Yes. When we put the right term and condition with those third-party company to operate in a different scope with the different set of customer. We are clear and we are becoming increasingly comfortable, as well as they are, as they are successful in deploying our technology and we are successful in supporting them and then expanding our market access.","Scott Gruber","Got it. Appreciate the color. Thank you.","Olivier Le Peuch","Thank you. Welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Next we go to Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Connor Lynagh","Thank you. Good morning","Olivier Le Peuch","Good morning.","Connor Lynagh","I wanted to stick with the CapEx team here. In the core oil services business, how would you think about how much you can take out in 2020 spending, obviously with production group activity coming down, I would think there would be a decent amount of sustaining CapEx reduction there, but any thoughts around that.","Olivier Le Peuch","I think it\u2019s too early to be specific and got it down to the production group at this stage. We are pretty advanced on that. We execute the strategy in North America where there are similar volumes of production group operating there and this is too early as some of the activity level is not set yet for North America and popular.","Globally speaking, as announced that we shared before has been 5% to 7% we believe. We believe with the mix of the product line that we have, the recent divestiture of some asset, heavy product line, combined with what we anticipated in North America. I would say almost independently of the strategic execution, we mean that we will stay within the guidance.","Connor Lynagh","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. I guess a broader question here, you have continue to highlight your digital strategy. I think many investors have a hard time thinking through the addressable market or how big a business this could be for you? How do you think about what the opportunity set is in a multiyear view for that business?","Olivier Le Peuch","Actually, it\u2019s a very big market. I think, you said, long-term for the oil and gas industry is one of the biggest market that will grow over the next five years to 10 years. I believe if I had to judge by the response from oil customers, the desire they have work with us first and the alignment from oil partners industry, a leader in the diesel technology or cost of industry, which are all aligning to our business. So the price is big.","Now the challenge is to monetize. So as we said, there are three factor and three direction there. One is the -- one is -- what revenue in the Sensia has established a leadership into digital workflows, and we believe they will only expand the adoption of DELFI by other customer today is only about a growth and this expansion remain accelerating the rate of growth of a side as a segment in our portfolio and it comes at margin that are credit to our business everywhere. So I believe this will only continue and accelerate.","WesternGeco is the data digital -- data digital branch of our -- first line of our business and I think we are termed and transformed with success, WesternGeco from an asset heavy into an asset light product line last year and we have technologies with an aggressive detailed strategy where we have established data platform GAIA that we have released, that will become the industry reference by exchanging and monetizing data as you have seen with the announcement of IHS Markit joining us on this platform.","And finally, we will continue to deploy digital at the edge in operation. The sense that -- of this ambition for the production space and you have seen that we are expanding deal production into the ring, you will see that will continue to make announcement in that space this operation.","And Ora, the Wireline, latest generation of fleet sampling characterization is becoming full digital and is success and expansion will become a key factor of this success. So this multi-dimension is large and its long-term and we are leading in this space.","Connor Lynagh","Thank you very much.","Operator","Next we go to Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead","Good morning.","Olivier Le Peuch","Good morning. Good morning, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead","Thank you. Thank you for all the great color here this morning. I -- follow-up question I had kind of does sales back to the strategy presentation from a month and a half ago. And in that presentation, you -- Olivier you clearly stated, the intention to increase international North American margins by at least 500 basis points. And to my curiosity that in the context of that 500 basis point improvement how much of that can be attributed to the improvement in the current contractual dynamics vis-\u00e0-vis the execution of the strategy you outlined, specifically the digital, the fit-for-basin and the performance models, if you could provide some additional color on how you see that kind of mapping through that be great?","Olivier Le Peuch","No. Kurt, I think, as I did comment to Angie before, I see that the expansion of the performance EPS would gone for two or three buckets. And one of them is short-term and is the one addressing is more personal and contractual, is the one addressing underperforming business unit and is our ability to operate at the benchmark being performance and that\u2019s the performance transformation we are doing internally that\u2019s the self help if you want.","So that is the target of our -- all of our team and the focus is very high on this and our personal overview on each of these every quarter. For the next, you mentioned, the next bucket, and I think the one that will certainly have the most impact the next three years to five years will be the mix of digital, fit-for-basin and technology assets internationally.","We have technology assets in Middle East, we will have digital everywhere and we will have some fit-for-basin from Russia to Latin America from China to Mexico. So that\u2019s what we expect to and I am confident that as we deploy this over the next few years. These three fit-for-basin, performance model and digital will contribute on this.","Kurt Hallead","Right. I appreciate that. And then a follow-up I had was on the, you gave some broad general guidance in terms of business direction. So I am just kind of curious, when you look at the lower depreciation, it was about a $0.015 impact for the core for the quarter that I guess was only one month. So if you annualize you should get a positive $0.18 per share benefit from lower depreciation. I don\u2019t know it seems to me like the headwinds on the market potentially offset that benefit as you head out into 2020. Do you have any kind of initial perspectives on that? Do you think, my assumption is kind of my gut instinct is correct on that?","Olivier Le Peuch","So, first, I think your maths are correct. I think the annualizing this $0.015 will generate more or less the $0.18 net impact in same scope. Now would it be offsetting to the decline. I think it\u2019s early too early to say.","I think again we are looking at the outlook. As I commented before the outlook in international remain likely positive on both. The outlook on that is too early to call at this point that we reached the bottom in that and we expecting to expect 2020 platform, 2019 or with the regional outlook on in 2020 too early to say. So I will remain cautious about calling this at this point, but I think your assumption quite strong for the impact in this.","Kurt Hallead","Okay. Great. And then one -- maybe one last one, I noticed in the press release you mentioned that there was a project cancellation in subsea, was that a project that came through earlier in the year or was it kind of a dynamic?","Olivier Le Peuch","No.","Kurt Hallead","Yeah.","Olivier Le Peuch","No. Actually no. It\u2019s an order booking that was awarded to OneSubsea sometime ago and more than one year or two years ago. That was put on the back burner from future FID and this asset said was actually subsequently sold from one operator to the next and the next and the next operator, other than the gain on -- decided to cancel and rethink its option for the FID and as such we have to remove the booking from the backlog. That\u2019s as simple as that.","Kurt Hallead","Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you so much for that. Appreciate it.","Operator","Next, we go to Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sean Meakim","Thanks. Good morning.","Olivier Le Peuch","Good morning, Sean.","Sean Meakim","So Olivier to follow up on SPM, it\u2019s been a challenging few months in terms of the macro and Argentina and Ecuador, based on your comments of lower CapEx spend next year, does that suggest you are still confident and affecting the asset sale in Argentina in the near-term? And then also just you wrote some smaller SPM assets, can you maybe elaborate on their impact in terms of CapEx and just -- are we still confident that cash flow for SPM as a whole is exiting 2019 positively, now we have some impact on production in Ecuador?","Olivier Le Peuch","Yeah. So let me comment one by one. So first, the process of the asset divestiture in -- for Bandurria Sur in Argentina is progressing. We have completed the first phase, where we received actually offer and we have offers few others in hand that we are looking as we speak. So we still do anticipate and we work every step to get signing and closing in the following months. So, yes, we account for this as an impact for 2020.","We are not making a decision at this point to divest any other assets. The Ecuador, the Torxen will be the main asset that remained on the SPM portfolio. The other asset that we are working with to -- in the interim are much smaller, we are initiated a few years back are not meaningful in terms of the impact on CapEx nor in term of production revenue for SPM.","So, in term of cash flow, yes, our commitment is to operate within cash flow and the cash flow will be positive and improving next year compared to this year considering the divestiture we are making. And we are committed to continue to keep it is, so we will be lower CapEx and increased cash flow from the SPM contribution.","Sean Meakim","Thank you for that. That\u2019s very helpful. And then, just given the growing importance of digital in your go-forward strategy are you able to quantify the baseline of digital contribution today. I know some parts would be difficult to quantify, but in reference point of the common investor question. And with respect to the margin impact, is it mostly accretion from software, just higher margin product or their internal OpEx benefit you can get as well.","Olivier Le Peuch","No. Sean, I think, we look at it from a digital as a business that has two characteristics. First, it is something that is transformative for the industry and is something that is having high price for all operator. So we need to be in this business and we believe the rate of growth of digital is here to stay on the accelerator. So it will be part of that and that\u2019s really the one -- the most important factor.","The other characteristic is that when we operated well and we have the right IP and operating model there, we have been able to be generating margin that are highly accretive, which has been the case for the last 10 years to 15 years with the size.","So it will continue to increase, its contribution going forward, but I cannot come out at this point, until we see the 2020 plan and we see that the outcome of all leads and opportunity that we have reached during the last months following the SI score.","Sean Meakim","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, our final question will come from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Chase Mulvehill","Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess the first one, I will start on 4Q. I am just trying to think about the outlook for fourth quarter. I guess 3Q you have $0.43 if we kind of gross it up for the $0.03 of the lower D&A for the full quarter. That\u2019s a $0.46 number and it sounded like North America will be significantly down in the fourth quarter, and I wasn\u2019t sure about international if it will be up or not from your commentary. But can you maybe help us kind of bridge the gap from that $0.46 number and how much EPS could potentially be down?","Olivier Le Peuch","I would comment on the activity, I will not give quantitative guidance on the EPS at this point and I will repeat what I shared during my introduction remarks. The -- what we see on international is sequentially, we see an anticipated activity decline in rigs and activity can large will be down due to seasonal effect, winter season in Northern Hemisphere that is here to stay up once every year.","The magnitude of it will depend in Russia, particularly in the North Sea, Russia and China to this extent have this effect. We don\u2019t anticipate to see a tangible, if any year end sales that could offset this partially or fully and we have some exposure as mentioned as counted before in Argentina. That could also further decline due to the investment climate that has moved there.","And finally, you heard about the Ecuador. Ecuador civil unrest that happened week and a half ago, which have some consequence on our operation for about a week, a bit less than a week, where we restored production at this stage. But -- so this is a combination of impact that we foresee for international. That means not activity increase for sure.","Now, in the North America, I think, it\u2019s more difficult to exactly point -- pin point where the market will end up internal activity, but the rate of decline on the permits, the rate of decline on the risk that has accelerated from July to September. The rate of decision in the last few days and weeks on the pulling pipe commitment for the following three months has accelerated. And as such, we anticipate that the year-on-year the sequential decline from Q3 to Q4 in North America will be greater than it was last year.","Chase Mulvehill","Okay. All right. Understood. Got all that. And then just coming back to Sean\u2019s question on the digital side, it sounds like that you have got a lot of revenue opportunity on the digital side as we kind of move forward over the medium to longer term. Could you talk about which businesses, you see the most opportunity to leverage digital and then ultimately how meaningful of a revenue opportunity do you think this could be for Schlumberger?","Olivier Le Peuch","The one first and foremost the business line that will benefit is the SIS and then WesternGeco, which are already fully invested into the digital workflow and digital data marketplace. So that will continue to expand, relative growth I think needs to be to be seen, but the momentum is there and the early success -- early indications are quite encouraging.","The next one, I would say, is Drilling. We happen to have a platform including the -- in the future and some software including the Hilox [ph] and drill plan that we announced commercial during this assessment. That when combined give the opportunity to create a digital automation at the scale of a week, full operation, but the scale of self process in drilling rig and this can be productized and applied to platform offshore to platform and the rig in hand. And we are working with operator as we see speak to accelerate this productization and to make it a meaningful impact of the drilling.","And finally, production will be building on the success we are willing to create with JV -- Sensia JV and working very closely with Rockwell Automation. I will be speaking to the Automation Fair in a month in Chicago and meeting their Board to make sure that we are fully aligned to build the support to this Sensia JV.","Chase Mulvehill","Got it. Understood. All right. I will turn it back over. Thanks.","Olivier Le Peuch","Thank you very much. So before we conclude the call today, I would like to reiterate three key points. First, our Q3 performance was very solid. We expect international margins, while mitigating the North America land activity headwind. We delivered strong free cash flow and recall safety performance.","Second, the new company vision is gaining industry wide acceptance and the initial progress on the strategic execution is very encouraging.","Third, we have adopted capital strategy as an operational mindset to deliver increase the terms, to investment discipline, optimization of working capital and overall margin expansion.","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your participation today. Lya, you may now conclude the call.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"19022":["Schlumberger N.V.

Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.","Simon Farrant - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Greg. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited second quarter 2014 results conference call. Today\u2019s call is being hosted from Paris, where the Schlumberger Limited board meeting took place yesterday. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.","However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I\u2019d like to remind the participants that some of the information in today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the earnings press release on our website. We welcome your questions after our prepared statements.","I will now turn the call over to Simon.","Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits was $1.37. This is an increase of $0.16 sequentially and is $0.22 higher when compared to the same quarter last year, represents increases of 13% and 19% respectively.","During the quarter, we recorded $205 million charge in discontinued operations relating to the potential resolution with the governmental authorities concerning historical matter. Please refer to the supplement information contained in our earnings press release for further details. Second quarter revenue of $12.1 billion increased 7.3% sequentially. Pre-tax operating income increased 10.7% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins improved 67 basis points to 21.7%.","Sequential highlights by product group were as follows. Reservoir characterization revenue of $3.1 billion increased 8.5% and pre-tax income grew by almost 18%. This resulted in margins improving by 233 basis points to 29.7%. This growth was driven by a very strong performance in wireline, improved WesternGeco marine utilization, and an increase in SIS software sales.","Drilling group revenue of $4.7 billion increased 7.4% and margin improved by 74 basis points to 21.1%. These increases were largely attributable to robust international activity in M-I SWACO and strong drilling and measurement activity in North America and Russia.","Production group revenue of $4.3 billion increased 5.5%. This growth was led by well services as a strong performance internationally and in U.S. land more than compensated for the impact of the spring breakup in Canada. Margins declined by 123 basis points to 16.7% primarily as a result of pressure pumping commodity inflation combined with the impact of the Canadian spring breakup.","Now, turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 21.7% in the second quarter compared to 22.6% in the previous quarter. We expect the effective tax rate for the full year of 2014 to be in the low to mid 20s. However, this can vary on a quarterly basis due to the geographic mix of business. During the quarter, we generated $2.4 billion of cash flow from operations. For the first six months of this year, we have generated $4.2 billion of cash flow from operations. This compares to $3.8 billion for the first six months of 2013.","As we have mentioned at our Investors Day, our investment in SPM business have now reached a point that\u2019s starting this year. We have begun to report them separately in our cash flow statement, similar to the way we report CapEx and multi-client. While this change has no impact on our free cash flow, it does result in an increase in the amount of cash flow from operations that we report.","Net debt increased $1 billion during the quarter to $6.1 billion. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.2 billion of stock repurchases, $522 million of dividend payments, and $922 million of CapEx, excluding multi-client and SPM. During the quarter, we repurchased 11.5 million shares at an average price of $101.85. CapEx, including multi-client and SPM, is still expected to be approximately $3.8 billion in 2014 as compared to the $3.9 billion we spent in 2013.","And now, I will turn the conference over to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Simon. Our second quarter results were strong and fully in line with our expectations as international activity rebounded in Russia, Norway and Australia and North American activity grew in both offshore in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and on land in spite of the Canadian spring breakup.","As a result, second quarter revenue grew 7% sequentially and 8% year-on-year while pre-tax operating income increased by 11% sequentially and 15% year-on-year. Year-to-date, we continued to show solid growth in all our main financial indicators compared to last year, with revenue and operating income growing by 7% and 18% respectively, pre-tax margins expanding by 191 basis points, earnings per share increasing by 22% and the incremental margins at a solid 48%. Several factors are contributing to the strength of this performance. These include additional market share gains at the back of new technology sales and operational efficiency as well as further support from strong quality cost and resource management throughout our global operations.","Our overall financial results continued to demonstrate our leadership in technology, reliability, efficiency and integration, which formed the four components of our engine of outperformance that we detailed at our June investor conference in New York and which will continue to drive our corporate performance in the years to come. In the second quarter, we generated more than $1.2 billion of free cash flow bringing the year-to-date number to $1.9 billion, which is 35% higher than for the same period last year. The strength of our cash flow reinforces the confidence we have in the financial targets we laid out at our June conference and will also enable us to further invest in the business while increasing the cash we returned to our shareholders.","Our international business continued to perform well in the second quarter with seasonal rebound of activity coupled with growth in key markets leading to an 8% sequential increase in revenue, while pre-tax operating margin expanded by 122 basis points to reach 24%, a level not seen since the pre-financial crisis peak of 2008. Compared to the second quarter of last year, international revenue was up 7% when adjusting for Framo on the back of strong growth in the Middle East in Asia and in Europe, Africa.","In terms of pricing, the international market remains highly competitive and we have still not seen any signs of a general pricing inflection. However, our latest technology and our best-in-class service quality continue to carry a premium, which together with the growth in integration related activity is reflected in our strong top line and margin performance. The premium in effective pricing together with our ongoing transformation programs focused on reliability and efficiency puts us in a very competitive position in the international markets which we are using to drive both market share gains and further expand margins.","In Latin America, revenue was up 5% sequentially while margins were essentially flat with the previous quarter at 21.2%. Compared to the second quarter last year Latin America revenue was down 3% driven by Brazil and Mexico where the impact of lower activity on pricing were only partly offset by the strong activity in Argentina, Ecuador and Venezuela. Pretax operating margins however, was up 62 basis points due to careful cost and resource management as well as our broad and diverse business portfolio in the region. The stronger sequential revenue growth was recorded in Venezuela where we also renewed our payment agreement with PdVSA during the second quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year our revenues in Venezuela this quarter was up significantly while we at the same time have reduced both DSO and the absolute value of our receivables.","In Argentina the strong sequential growth was driven by rig-based activity in the Vaca Muerta shale where we are now seeing encouraging results from the application of new technology and work flows and where a continued focus on the well cost reduction is also improving performance.","In Ecuador we continued to progress on the Shushufindi SPM project. And during the quarter we also signed a letter of intent for Group 1 of the mature field tender with contract signature and ramp up of operations expected in the second half of this year.","In Mexico revenue fell sequentially and year-over-year due to lower overall rig count in the county, continued budget restrictions in Pemex and as several of our IPM rigs in the south were shutdown for the entire quarter due to local social issues that are outside of our control. However, the activity outlook for the second half of the year is stronger as we continued to ramp up activity on the new mega tender contract where we have gained significant market share and as Pemex and the local government resolved the social issues impacting our IPM projects in the South.","Middle East and Asia revenue increased 4% sequentially while margins grew by 161 basis points to 27.8%. The year-over-year revenues increased by 12% and margins were up by 323 basis points. In the Middle East sequential revenue growth was again driven by Saudi Arabia, where new well activity continues to expand supported by steady growth in the rig count and where rig less activity is also increasing in a number of fields. We continued to add resources and invest in additional infrastructure in the Kingdom to keep pace with the additional growth we are taking on and with the capacity and capabilities we now have on the ground our Saudi operations is quickly becoming one of the largest and most advanced setups in our global portfolio. Growth was also driven by the United Arab Emirates as activity continues to ramp up on our existing contracts together with additional seismic and completion technology deployments.","In Southern Iraq activity was as expected down both sequentially and year-over-year as commercial discussions between the government and the international oil companies continue and where the situation was further complicated by mounting civil unrest during the quarter. The worsening security situation led us to take additional measures to protect our people and assets in the country, but beyond the additional costs and lower efficiency there has been no impact on our ongoing operational capabilities. However, safety remains our top priority and we continued to monitor the situation closely together with our security advisors and we are ready to take the appropriate actions should the situation worsen further. Activity in Northern Iraq on the other hand was strong in the second driven exploration drilling and we expect growth in this part of the country in the second half of the year to offset the activity drop we are seeing in the South.","Turning to Asia we saw strong year-over-year growth in several geomarkets driven by higher customer activity as well as market share gains. The strongest growth was seen in Australia from continued land activity in Queensland, successful completion of the first isometric seismic survey in the Great Australian Bight and strong new technology sales for both wireline and drilling and measurements on exploration projects. In China revenue was up sequentially driven by strong offshore activity, seasonal recovery on land and our tight gas SPM project in the Ordos Basin for Yanchang Petroleum. Still year-over-year revenue was down in the second quarter due to slowdown in activity in several land basins as customers continue to review budgets and internal processes.","Looking at the second half of the year, offshore activity looks strong and land activity including the shale gas developments is set to pickup from current levels. However, we expect growth rates to be somewhat tempered until our customers complete their internal reviews and spending plans are clarified.","In Europe, C.I.S. and Africa, revenue grew 13% sequentially with margins improving by 180 basis points to 22.1% as activity rebounded from the first quarter seasonal lows. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue grew by 4% and margins were up by 158 basis points. Sequential revenue growth was driven by Russia, where we saw strong recovery in activity after a harsh winter. The underlying activity outlook both offshore and online in Russia continues to look solid and with recent contract awards in Sakhalin, we expect to finish the year on a strong note.","Activity also increased strongly in the North Sea driven by seismic and core rig-related services in Norway for a number of customers. In Africa, sub-Saharan activity was solid in particular in Chad and Mozambique, while in North Africa activity rebounded sequentially with growth in both Algeria and Tunisia, but was partly offset by Libya, where activity remained subdued.","In North America, our revenue grew 6% sequentially in spite of the Canadian spring breakup and 16% year-over-year as we continue to grow our market share online in hydraulic fracturing, artificial lift and drilling services. As we actively expand our land business, we are currently seeing some impact on our pre-tax operating margins, which were down 53 basis points sequentially and 170 basis points year-over-year driven by additional costs related to supply chain and transportation and on-boarding of several new companies. However, these effects should be short-lived as we continue to implement our strategic plan for our North America land business and in the process established a broad and unique platform for profitable technology-driven growth in the coming years.","In our hydraulic fracturing business, we posted strong year-over-year revenue growth driven by market share gains, further improvements in operational efficiency as well as introduction of new technologies, which altogether more than offset the effects of the spring breakup in Canada. In terms of basic pressure pumping pricing, we saw some improvement in the second quarter, but this was contained to newer basins with lack of service capacity and to customers, where we still operate at very low margins. Still the pricing traction was partly offset by continued cost inflation for labor side and transportation and pricing discussions with our customers therefore continues to have a strong focus on cost recovery at this stage.","In the second quarter, we also saw further improvement in our land drilling product lines, where the combination of new technology introductions, new business models and new alliances are driving both market share gains and higher operating margins. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, deepwater drilling activity was up sequentially due to the expected rebound from the operational delays that impacted the first quarter. In the second half of the year, the drilling rig count growth will flatten somewhat as some rig shift to completions related work although we still expect to see revenue growth through market share gains in several product lines.","The highlight of the quarter was undoubtedly last month investor conference in New York, where we set out clear goals for continued strong growth and financial outperformance over the coming years. Our plans are built on the four key themes of technology, reliability, efficiency and integration, with technology and integration driving superior growth and reliability and efficiency improving financial performance. In terms of technology, we showed how our R&E transformation that started six years ago has led to a step change in operational performance of our products and how we continue to accelerate the pace of new technology introduction with flattening R&E investments.","During the investor conference, we also laid out full details of our reliability and efficiency transformation programs and how this will change the way we manage our people, our assets and our inventory as we look to further improve our financial performance. Based on a set of realistic assumptions covering the global economy, the oil and gas markets and industry investment levels, we are confident in our ability to continue our run of financial outperformance and to deliver on the earnings per share, return on capital employed and free cash flow targets that we laid out during the conference.","Turning our focus back to the remaining part of 2014, we continue to see a relatively constant mix of headwinds and tailwinds in the global economy and in our industry, which leads us to maintain our already established outlook for the year. The slow and steady recovery in the global economy is continuing and the global oil market remains relatively tight with a solid demand outlook, continued supply uncertainty related to geopolitics and with Brent prices holding steady above $100 per barrel, which should encourage oil directed investments in both the North American and international markets.","The North America natural gas market appears more comfortably supplied as U.S. production continues to grow and storage levels gradually reconnect with historical averages, while the market balances in the international natural gas markets remain more or less unchanged. We continued to expect well related EMP investment levels to grow north of 6%, driven more by development and production focused activities while exploration spend will likely be flattish in 2014 driven by lower seismic spend at the IOC\u2019s focus on free cash flow generation.","Within this scenario the growth and performance drivers that we outlined in late June amplified by our broad geographical footprint, our balanced technology portfolio and our agile organization will enable us to outperform in almost any market whether in North America or anywhere else in the world. We therefore remain positive and optimistic with respect to 2014 outlook as we continued aim for solid double-digit growth in earnings per share viewing this quarter\u2019s results as merely a steppingstone on the way to delivering the commitments we made in New York.","Thank you. We will now open up for Q&A.","Simon Farrant - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Paal. Greg we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley","Thank you very much. And Paal I wonder whether you could just shed a little bit more light about what your comments on the cost structure in North America, we are seeing very large volumes of sand for example, this can hardly carry the same margin as your technology offering, so how does this impact and how did it impact the margins in the quarter and how do you see that impacting margins in the quarter and how do you see that impacting margins in North America going forward when it comes to the relative pricing power and ability to take a markup on sand costs and logistics?","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay. Thank you, Ole. So there is \u2013 as I said there is a lot of moving parts for us in North America at the moment. So maybe I can just take you through the picture the way I see it. So we have been focusing lately on revenue and expanding our revenue base in North America land. At $3.9 billion in the quarter, revenue was up 6% sequentially and 16% year-on-year which is a record for North America in spite of the Canadian breakup. Now the growth came from both efficiency and share, including pressure pumping, artificial lift and drilling services. In pressure pumping, we added one more fleet during the quarter and that takes the total of eight additional fleets in the past year, so we have clearly gained share in pressure pumping.","So the key here is like I said expand the revenue and share base in North America land to further broaden our platform for technology driven growth in the coming years. Now with that we see some temporary impact on margins as we take on a higher proportion of somewhat lower margin businesses, but we plan to drive margins up in the coming quarters in these businesses through integration, scale and new technology introduction. And like you said as well, there were also some short-term additional costs related to supply-chain. For instance on sand where we took some higher costs because there were some significant changes in sand price and volume for several of our customers and also transportation had some higher costs due to the fact that we had a very high growth rate and transportation availability become quite tight. In addition to that you have the Canada breakup and you also have somewhat lower multi-client sales. So all in all, that drove the 53 basis points reduction, but our focus going forward again is to drive the margins back up, but on a much broader platform for revenue growth.","Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley","Thank you very much, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thanks, Ole.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Crandell from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Jim Crandell - Cowen","Good morning. Paal, could you address the potential for sanctions impacting Schlumberger\u2019s business in Russia?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, as of now nothing has really changed for our position in Russia. Sanctions were implemented earlier in the year. There were some new sanctions coming out this year. So far, that has no real impact on our business. So, as of now it\u2019s business as usual for us. In Russia, so far this year, activity has been as planned or even slightly stronger. The only change from the plan we laid out in the \u2013 at the beginning of the year was the impact of the ruble, which had a fairly significant impact in Q1, but the ruble rebound somewhat in Q2. So, that\u2019s really only the main change from the plan that we have seen so far in Russia. So, as of now, no impact on sanctions and whether there will be impact in the future is a bit difficult to comment on, but as of now, we continue business as usual.","Jim Crandell - Cowen","Okay. And one follow-up Paal, could you talk just a little bit about the recent announcement of the deal with Precision Drilling and how quickly you think the U.S. can move to incentive pricing or some kind of integrated model? And I guess would this in that sense be shared with Precision or would this be \u2013 would Precision be working for you or are there a number of different scenarios as you look forward?","Paal Kibsgaard","So, part of the reason for doing this alliance with Precision Drilling is that both ourselves and Precision Drilling believe that over time the North America land drilling market will move towards a general contractor model, towards more of a construction turnkey type of market. And in that setup, we have now established this alliance where Precision Drilling will be the general contractor and we will rent them our downhole technologies. In addition, we will train their people to run it. And obviously, we will own the equipment and we will maintain the equipment for Precision Drilling. So, we see this as an avenue to establish further penetration for our unique technologies in the North America land drilling market and hence it\u2019s another good growth opportunity for us.","Jim Crandell - Cowen","Okay, thank you very much.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you. Next question? Please check the line.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","David Anderson - JPMorgan","Thanks. Good morning. Paal, I just wanted you kind of expand a little bit about the cost pressures on your supply chain. I guess, my first question is are you able to pass through most of those costs right now you had said kind of near-term pressures, I am just wondering is that because you are expecting to get those pass-through or is it also partly because the kind of the way your transformation is setup, it just takes a little while to kind of absorb those and you start to see kind of better margins as we start to progress?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. David, I think in general, we are able to pass through those costs. What happened towards the end of Q1 and also into Q2, there were some significant changes in the way some of our customers operated in terms of sand prices, in terms of volumes and these were basically somewhat unannounced and something we have to respond to relatively quickly. We manage to continue to support our customers and support our operations, but we took some additional costs in order to do that. And over time, we are able to pass these on and lower than we manage to pass on towards the second part of this quarter, but there were some short-term changes that resulted in additional cost for us that we decided to absorb.","David Anderson - JPMorgan","Alright. And then I guess my other question around that was on your logistics obviously we are very big logistics operations. As we start \u2013 as we see our North America progress over the next several years and in some of the cases we are seeing doubling of the amount of sand in wells, do you need to build that out more, are your sales I guess I am asking are you satisfied with the logistics footprint or is this an area where we need to build up a little bit better?","Paal Kibsgaard","This is all part of the entire story that I am talking about as well. We are gradually expanding that to make sure that we can meet changes to how our customers want to operate, but also continuous expansion of our business, right. So we continued to invest in that. And given the fact that we have grown so much over the past years, I mentioned eight traditional fleets in the past four quarters, we are at the point that now that we are upgrading some of this as well and that is resulting in some additional costs in this quarter.","David Anderson - JPMorgan","Okay, thank you. Just a real quick question, Simon, could you just tell me where the share count was at the end of the quarter, if you don\u2019t mind?","Simon Ayat","Okay. Well, the average for the quarter was 1.315 billion, and this is a result of what we purchased during this quarter, which is 11.5 million shares. So your question about the end of the\u2026","David Anderson - JPMorgan","Yes, before the end of the quarter, just help me understand that?","Simon Ayat","I think towards the end of the quarter I have to confirm this figure for you will be about 1.38 billion.","David Anderson - JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Simon Ayat","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.","Angie Sedita - UBS","","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Simon Ayat","Good morning.","Angie Sedita \u2013 UBS","","So Paal, on the Analyst Day it certainly was clear that Schlumberger has decided that land rigs are important to furthering your technology and you just discussed the Precision deal, but you acquired earlier in the year the Saxon, 100% of Saxon, so can you talk about how that differs and the thoughts there in being able to integrate the rig with the bottom hole assembly and the timelines actually develop a newly designed rig and how many rigs that you actually put into the market over the next three years?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, if I first address the alliance with Precision versus the acquisition of Saxon, so Saxon is generally focused on the international market. And that\u2019s the mean that we are going to use to pursue the international well construction market. As of now, we have decided to pursue the North America well construction market, more through alliances, and that\u2019s where the Precision Drilling alliance comes into play. So in terms of our investment into new rig technologies, that is something we are just starting, so that\u2019s going to obviously take a little bit of time before we have something to put into the market. So I can\u2019t give you a specific number of how many rigs we will put in to the market, but that will be when the rig is ready. And we will then just gradually add capacity as we have viable work for these type of rigs going forward. So we have two different strategies, one is for North America through the Precision Drilling type of an alliance and through our own rigs in the international market.","Angie Sedita - UBS","That\u2019s quite fair enough. And then on China, you hit on it on your opening comments, but clearly things have changed here with the recent events, with the corruption of CNBC and a slowdown of PetroChina, so has that just changed your near-term outlook for China or your long-term outlook as well. And now do you believe it could be difficult for the independent Chinese oil service companies to succeed in the region?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well I can\u2019t really comment on how it\u2019s going to be for the independent Chinese companies, but I would say that the main thing that is changing for us is the short-term. We are still very bullish on the medium to long-term growth prospects in China. We are very well setup in China to be part of that through our technology and integration capabilities. So as these processes continue and hopefully draw to a conclusion over the next couple of quarters, we see growth being tempered but beyond that I am very bullish on China going forward.","Angie Sedita - UBS","Okay. Thanks. I will turn it over.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim","Thanks. Good morning guys. Paal if I could return to the Precision in North America strategy question a little bit and maybe ask you to address it within the context of the joint venture that you did last year with Forest in the Eagle Ford, my understanding of that venture was that it was really about establishing a business model in the U.S. of integrated services and control of project, can you contrast that versus what we are seeing now in the Precision arrangement which looks more like Schlumberger as a supplier or vendor to general contractor?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think these are two different things. So, within IPM, we have two different business models, one is well construction and one is production management. And the Forest deal we did is a production management type of deal where we are paid on a feet per barrel, while the alliance with Precision is more along the well construction lines, right. So, in some cases, we end up being the general contractor and we either own the rig or rent the rig and deploy our services through that or in the case with Precision Drilling, we will be renting them our downhole equipment while they are the general contractor. So, these are different permutations of the well construction model.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim","Thank you for the clarification. That helps. Simon, if I could ask a quick one for you on Venezuela and the Bolivar exposure. Paal in his prepared comments talked about the good performance even on DSOs. Can you talk about what the currency impacts are there and what they might be here in the third quarter?","Simon Ayat","So, in the third quarter, we don\u2019t \u2013 I mean in the third quarter, our assumption that the exchange rate for the Bolivar will continue at the same rate that we are using today. And this is 6.3 Bolivar is to a dollar. Some of our revenues are in Bolivars and obviously the receivables, some of the outstanding receivables are also in Bolivars. If the exchange rate will change, will definitely impact us, I don\u2019t know to what extent the exchange rate will change. We know about the different exchange rates that are being used and we simulate our results on the various exchange rates, but for the time being, our Q3 assumption that there will be no change.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim","No change, okay. Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Good morning guys. If we could shift to Latin America, Mexico first if I could, revenues were down. We all know what\u2019s kind of going on in Mexico, you have won some projects, you mentioned you had some rigs down in the IPM project in the south. Can you kind of walk us through the next 18 months of what you expect to see happen in Mexico?","Paal Kibsgaard","18 months is a long time, Jim. But let\u2019s start off with H2, so we see activity picking up in the second half of the year and that\u2019s going to be primarily in marine, but also in the north. We have had in addition to the mega-tender also several service contract wins in marine and in the south, which is going to give us further market share gains. So, this year is still impacted by the budget constraints of Pemex. So as we work through that, we still see growth in the second half of the year, but I believe most of these budget constraints as well as the rig shutdowns will be sorted out over the next one to two quarters. So, while I expect growth in the second half of the year, I am still a lot more optimistic about 2015 and hope that we can get back on track to have a really good year, next year in Mexico.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Through 2015 covers my 18 months, I appreciate that. Now, can you do the same thing for me for Brazil considering the drilling contractors now being re-tendered, do we expect that really to switch over at the end of the year? And what\u2019s the implication for your idle equipment in Brazil if that happens?","Paal Kibsgaard","First of all, we don\u2019t have any idle equipment in Brazil. We don\u2019t hold idle equipment around in various countries. If it is idle, we put it into the pool and put it to use. But in Brazil, this year is obviously significantly down both due to pricing and significantly lower activity. There might be some uptick in 2015, but I am not as optimistic on the improvement in 2015 in Brazil as I am in Mexico. I think we will see improvements in activity partly due to the drilling activity surrounding around 11 exploration awards, which is going to start for some of the IOCs in 2015. And there could also be a chance that Petrobras will increase some of their activity, but I am a bit more guarded on how great 2015 will be in Brazil until these two contracts that are now tendered, I expect them to be quite competitive to bid again, I don\u2019t think there is going to be any dramatic change to that now. We will see what happens.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Okay, thank you very much.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Becker from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. I want to circle back on North America, first quarter was impacted by weather, we saw second quarter impacted by some of the supply chain sand labor issues. Just any quantification in terms of what type of impact we have here that would be outside the norm?","Paal Kibsgaard","I can\u2019t give you that like I reviewed in the \u2013 I think the first question from Ole, there is a lot of moving parts from our supply chain, has some impact, but there is a lot of other moving parts that I just reviewed. So, I can\u2019t break it down for you, but with all the moving parts, 53 basis points down isn\u2019t dramatic. And we are quite confident that we can improve margins going forward from this point.","Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. Maybe just order of impact between supply chain sand labor, just\u2026.","Paal Kibsgaard","I am not going to break it down any further.","Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just circling back on Latin America, just an update on the mobilization for the mega-tenders, is that on pace to be complete this year or do we actually maybe see some margin improvement in the fourth quarter as that winds down?","Paal Kibsgaard","No, we are on track with mobilization for that. So, a fair bit of the equipment that we needed for those contracts we already had in country. So, at this stage, we are operating 10 rigs across three projects for the mega-tenders. This was probably gradual increase in the second half of the year, but I don\u2019t expect any significant negative margin impact for the mobilization. So, we should see progress from this point.","Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Thank you. Good morning.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Question with regard to international revenue outlook for the second half of the year, first half broadly speaking, we were up about 5% year-over-year, what do you think would be a reasonable expectation for second half on a year-over-year basis?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, if you correct for Framo, which was counted as revenue in H1 of last year and obviously now as the minority interest in OneSubsea this year, our international revenue was up 7% in H1.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Okay.","Paal Kibsgaard","And we expect that at least to continue in the second half of the year.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Okay. And a similar question, incremental margins were about 75% year-over-year, I mean, stunningly strong, I expect in the moderate for the second half of the year, but I guess the question is I know your target for 2017 on a consolidated basis is 40%, but it just seems to be that the execution is generating considerably stronger incrementals than frankly most seasoned observers have been expecting.","Simon Ayat","Well, was there a question or?","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","I guess the observation and the question is the sustainability, what we are seeing in the first half I mean I am modeling a considerable moderation and that\u2019s what the Street estimates convey and yet you continue to outperform markedly on that front?","Paal Kibsgaard","Fair enough, so H1 like you said I think we are about 65% incremental. So I can give say \u2013 it\u2019s fair to say that there might be some moderation in there in the second half of the year. Now we are working very hard on keeping these incrementals up and the strength of our position internationally should allow us to have higher incremental margin spend and obviously what we see in North America. Whether it\u2019s going to go down from the 65%, potentially it should, but we are going to do our best to keep it as high as possible.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Tillery from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Hi, good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on North Americas and outside of the supply chain side you mentioned on-boarding on some of the acquired companies, so if you can just talk about artificial lift business in aggregate I mean a dozen different companies in rod lift, I mean where are you in the continuing of kind of bringing everything to some sort of standardization or giving your manufacturing and operational efficiency where you want to be and what sort of timeline would you think that occurs on?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, it\u2019s a good question. So we are in the early phases of bringing everything together. So we are not looking to integrate each of these 12, 13 companies into one, one completely unified entity, they are working in different basins. They all have their individual setups. But we are looking to consolidate supply chain as much as possible and also take the best practices from the individual companies and try to populate them across all the different companies. So this is going to be done gradually and I still think it\u2019s going to take us probably a good 12 to 18 months to get everything setup exactly the way we want. But these companies are well run. It is a different business that what we have been in the past and we are also partly learning some of these things as we go into it. But I would say it probably will take us at least another 12 months to get this setup up exactly the way we wanted.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","And then you had referred on the last conference call to I mean you have to be in the game in order to change it from a technology standpoint, is there \u2013 how should we think about that timeline for introducing new technology in that business, that occurred \u2013 does that come post that 12 months period or should we look for some markers here interim?","Paal Kibsgaard","Now what we are gradually doing now is to bring our ESP business closer together to these rod pump companies because we still believe that there is a period of utilization for different type of lift solutions throughout the life of the well. So by having a very good footprint when it comes to rod pump market share, it should be easier for us to penetrate this market in the early phase of the wells before you put the rod pump on the well with our ESP. So the first step in getting more technology into this is to increase the penetration of ESPs on that rod pump footprint.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Thank you very much, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Paal maybe in some comments out of some major operators in the Norwegian area about maybe relooking at their capital spending what\u2019s your outlook for Norway for the second half and maybe more also in the \u201815 \u2013 into the \u201915?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, if you focus on H2, I mean for the summer months we expect a normal impact from the rig maintenance both in the UK and Norway. But as of now we have a solid activity outlook for the remaining part of the year in Norway. We have some good contract wins recently. There is some other work that is out for bid that will probably be awarded relatively soon. Some of these contracts are key for us. So we are hopeful that we will be successful in winning them. So I think overall, I am positive on the activity outlook for Norway for the second half of the year.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then I am curious there are some important drilling going on, are there any discussions going on regarding anything follow-up beyond the first well right now or is it too early to have that till we see the results from the first well?","Paal Kibsgaard","You are talking about Russia?","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","Yes, that\u2019s right.","Paal Kibsgaard","I don\u2019t know the detail of the specific value you are referring to, but I am aware that there is good activity in the Arctic in the second half of this year. Going into 2015, I don\u2019t have any detailed visibility yet, but there is strong focus on advancing both these exploration and development programs in the Arctic in Russia and we are actively participating in that.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","Thank you very much. That\u2019s all I have.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brad Handler from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Brad Handler - Jefferies","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Brad Handler - Jefferies","Couple of questions related to seismic please. Obviously, you have laid out your macro view and that\u2019s very helpful, but noted that multi-client sales in the second quarter were particularly soft, I guess, they haven\u2019t been this soft in a few years and I am curious if you can put that into some greater context for us and give us a sense of if that has implications for reviews on the fourth quarter, which is obviously where it\u2019s seasonally strongest generally? And then secondly just perhaps overall for the year, I think you signaled that you expect that seismic to be down for the industry, but I am not as clear if that\u2019s what you expect for yourselves as well or are some things like isometrics and other factors helping you out on a relative basis?","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay. If we start with multi-client like you said, multi-client revenue in Q2 was weak than we expected at $133 million. This is down 47% year-on-year, which is quite significant. It is not surprising that multi-client revenue falls when there is basically added scrutiny on exploration and seismic spend, but we are now at the lowest level that we have seen since 2009 just following the financial crisis, right, but we manage to absorb that reduction in the second quarter and still deliver on the quarter, which I am pleased with.","In terms of the rest of the year, I expect Q3 to be fairly similar to Q2 I don\u2019t expect any significant improvement. There should be a year end effect. It might not be as high as what we saw in 2013, but I still expect there to be a surge towards toward year end, but potentially lower. In terms of the overall outlook for seismic for us, we also expected to be down in terms of overall revenue for this year and is driven then partly by multi-client and also through marine, where we at this stage have gone from 15 vessels at the beginning of the year, down to 13 vessels at the end of Q2. And we plan to reduce also down to 12 vessels in Q4. So, we are doing this to maintain profitability and utilization and we will continue to look at further vessels tax if it\u2019s necessary.","Brad Handler - Jefferies","Got it. Thank you very much. Very helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil","Thanks. Good morning.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil","Paal, I wanted to ask you just quickly on your offshore revenue growth outlook here, I mean clearly the offshore revenue component is very important for Schlumberger, just how are you seeing the unfold here versus maybe where you were at the beginning of the year given the fact that we have certainly seen some utilization challenges on the floater side as new capacity has come into the market and certainly you mentioned again the demand waning here on the IOC side. Has there been any material changes as you think about revenue growth here for you, what should the market externally look at, I mean because clearly we see the utilization numbers and we are able to track that, we know day rates have come down significantly. We know you have got share opportunities here that you are gaining, I mean, how do we think about the offshore revenue stream for Schlumberger?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, if you look at the international market, so far this year we have seen about 6% growth in rig count on land as well as 6% growth in rig count for the conventional offshore. Deepwater is basically two stories. You have Brazil, which is down about 27% year-to-date, while the rest of the world is also up about 6%, which is similar to the conventionally offshore. So, there is really no change to what we expected going into the year. We had factored into our deepwater plans, some lower utilizations as we were expecting these commercial discussions on rig rates to lead to lower utilization. Some of these discussions have concluded actually quicker than what we thought. Then I think that has the positive impact on the utilization versus what we assumed, but really nothing dramatic. We expected Brazil to be down significantly and the rest of offshore to continue to grow at the solid pace and 6% is we consider that quite good.","Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil","Okay. So the rate of growth really nothing has changed.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes.","Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil","Okay. I appreciate the time. I will turn it back.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim","Yes. Just a quick follow-up. Simon, can you give us a breakdown of how much of the 16% growth year-on-year North America was organic versus the acquired companies?","Simon Ayat","Well, Michael, we obviously have these numbers, but we are not going to disclose all of these details.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim","Okay, thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thanks.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of Rob MacKenzie from IBERIA Capital. Please go ahead.","Rob MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital","Hey, guys. I guess I got a little bit of a different question for you on the lift business than what you had so far. My question is centered around your view of where that business develops over time, because clearly obviously buying rod lift companies and the dumb iron if you will associated with that is not something that is \u2013 something Schlumberger has typically been interested in the past? Is there another angle here we should be looking at namely perhaps making it more of a service delivery business through the life of the field versus just a pure equipment sale business? What\u2019s your vision for where that segment goes?","Paal Kibsgaard","It\u2019s a very good question. So I think there are two things to be said about that. Firstly, I think over time there are things that could be done to advance the technology that is used. Now, I think you will be needing a range of technologies, because the flow rates of these wells, they vary gradually with time. So \u2013 but I think there are things that could be done both on the ESP side and on the PCP rod lift side, which we are working on. So, that\u2019s on the technology itself. But the other part is the business model like you allude to. And our view of this for the future would be that we potentially ultimately can sell lift. So, we will take on the well and we will basically have a business model, where we are paid on production for off time and our ability to maximize production through the optimal lift solution for the well. So, that is our view on the future. That\u2019s why we are getting into this. And again changing, changing the game will have to be done from within. Rod pumps are going to be key in this based on the installed base in North America land, but I think there is opportunity to optimize the technology and there is also a very good opportunity to potentially change the business model over time. ","Rob MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital","Great. How would you help us thinking about how that trajectory looks, how long it takes, pace of adoption and so on an so forth?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, it\u2019s a bit difficult to predict on that, Rob. What we are focusing on now is to basically consolidate all these companies that we have both, gain a further understanding of the market and get closer to this part of our customer base, which we haven\u2019t worked on \u2013 worked with closely in the past. And I think as we do that and establish ourselves as a credible player in this market, which I think we can do relatively quickly, I think our chances of starting to change this business model say over the next one to two years should be there.","Rob MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital","Great, thank you very much.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. That\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. Now, on behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I would like to thank you for participating in today\u2019s call.

Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.","Simon Farrant","Good morning, good afternoon, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Today\u2019s call is being hosted in Houston, following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting.","Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Schorn, Executive Vice President, New Ventures.","We will, as usual, first go through our prepared remarks, after which, we will open up for questions. For today\u2019s agenda, Simon will first present comments on our fourth quarter financial performance before Patrick reviews our results by geography. Paal will close our remarks with a discussion of our technology portfolio and our updated view of the industry macro.","However, before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind the participants that some of the statements we\u2019ll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I, therefore, refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings.","Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our full and fourth quarter press release, which is on our website.","Finally after our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A in order to allow more time for others who may be in the queue.","Now, I hand the call over to Simon Ayat.","Simon Ayat","Thank you, Simon.","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.48. This represents an increase of $0.06 sequentially and $0.21 when compared to the same quarter of last year.","During the quarter, we recorded $2.01 of impairment and restructuring charges and $0.05 of Cameron and OneStim merger and integration charges. We also recorded a $0.05 charge relating to the enactment of U.S. tax reform.","Of the $3 billion of pre-tax charges, approximately two-third relating to our exit from the seismic acquisition business and the write-down of our investment in Venezuela. Paal will discuss the background and rationale behind the exit of seismic acquisition business.","As a result of the recent political and economic events in Venezuela, we wrote down our investment in Venezuela. Importantly, we will continue to maintain our presence in Venezuela, and we will continue to work to collect all amounts owed to us. However, from an accounting standpoint, we believe taking the write-down at this time is the right thing to do.","As it relates to merger and integration charges, this will be the last quarter we call out this item separately. Further details regarding all of the Q4 charges can be found in the FAQ at the back of our earnings press release.","Our fourth quarter revenue of $8.2 billion increased 3.5% sequentially. Pre-tax operating margins increased 99 basis points to 10.2%. Highlights by product group were as follows: Fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 7.5% sequentially as a result of a change in estimate on a long-term project accounted for under the percentage of completion, offset in part by higher software and multi-client sales.","Margins expanded 441 basis points to 22%, primarily due to increased contribution from software and multi-client sales as well as the impact of the accounting from the previously mentioned project.","Drilling Group revenue of $2.2 billion increased by 3% sequentially, while margin increased 43 basis points to 14.6% due to strong M-I SWACO sales in Mexico and North America land.","Production Group revenue of $3.1 billion increased 7% sequentially, while margin increased 39 basis points to 10.2%. These results were driven by strong pressure pumping activity in North America land and internationally in Russia, Saudi Arabia and Argentina.","Cameron Group revenue of $1.4 billion increased 9% sequentially, driven by growth in all product lines, particularly OneSubsea. Although margins for the group decreased by 58 basis points OneSubsea margins exceeded 20% for the sixth consecutive quarters. However, due to a decline in backlog, the OneSubsea margins are expected to be below 20% next quarter.","The book-to-bill ratio for our long cycle business was 0.6 in Q4. The effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 19% in the fourth quarter compared to 18.4% in the previous quarter.","Let me now provide you some color on the impact of U. S. tax reform on Schlumberger. As a non-U.S. company, our tax results is in us largely paying taxes where we work and earn profits without having to incur additional layer of taxes. Given the structure, the primary impact of U.S. reform on Schlumberger is that the lower federal tax rate of 20% will be applied to income earned by our U.S. business.","Absent the impact of U.S. tax reform, our ETR likely would increase by approximately 2 to 3 percentage points in 2018 as compared to our Q4 ETR due to the higher profitability we expect in North America in 2018. However, the impact of U.S. tax reform is expected to largely offset this increase. As a result, we expect Schlumberger's full year 2019 ETR will be more or less in line with Q4 2017 ETR.","During 2017, we returned $3.7 billion of tax to our shareholders through dividends and share buyback. As you know, our policy is to review dividend with our Board every January. Based on this review, we have decided to maintain our dividend at $0.50 per quarter. Paal will elaborate on this.","We generated $5.7 billion of cash flow from operations for the full year 2017 and $2.3 billion during the fourth quarter. As a result, we achieved our cash flow generation target for the year. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $455 million during 2017 and $108 million during the fourth quarter.","I'm pleased to report that cash collection in Ecuador during the quarter were very strong. As a result, our receivable balance in the country at the end of 2017 was significantly lower than it was at this time last year.","Our net debt increased by $900 million during the quarter to $13.1 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investment of $5.1 billion. During the quarter, we spent $101 million to increase - to repurchase 1.6 million shares at an average price of $64.82. For the full year 2017, we spent $969 million to repurchase 13.2 million shares at an average price of $73.11.","And now, I will turn the conference call over to Patrick.","Patrick Schorn","Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone.","Let me walk you through our geographical performance of the fourth quarter. Looking at North America, revenue grew 8% sequentially, driven by a further increase in land activity as well as improved pricing. This despite a 1% decrease in the frac market stage count. The Production Group OneStim hydraulic fracturing operations benefited from a full quarter of activity for the fleets we activated in the third quarter as well as additional fleets redeployments in the fourth.","Profitability also improved as pricing increased. Vertical integration continued to reduce supply chain costs and the impact of transitory and reactivation costs abated. The Drilling Group sales of directional drilling technologies and M-I SWACO products and services increased sequentially as customer demand for longer laterals remain strong. Cameron Surface and Drilling Systems products and services were also in higher demand throughout the quarter.","At the end of December, we concluded the transaction with Weatherford, most as a joint venture, as originally envisaged, but as a straight purchase of 1 million hydraulic horsepower. This deal will further enable margin expansion of the Schlumberger OneStim business in North America, a business we started over 12 months ago focused on providing an integrated completion of fracturing offering in young conventional market.","The acquisition of these assets broadens and strengthens the OneStim footprint in the U.S., and we see outside ownership as a positive, not only through the flexibility and independence it offers, but also the seamless integration opportunities it brings with other products of our offering such as coil tubing and the Cameron service and frac flow businesses.","The progress of the OneStim business over the past year is married by the success of new contract awards. For example, we have just signed an MOU with Oxy for a five year service partnership in the Aventine project in New Mexico's Delaware basin. Our joint objective is to reduce the cost per barrel in the safest and most efficient way possible.","Pending final contract negotiation, the agreement includes a minimum scope of 700 wells, exclusivity of services and construction of a Schlumberger facility within the Oxy acreage. Offshore revenue in North America also increased as year-end sales of WesternGeco multi-client seismic licenses was stronger-than-expected.","Activity in the U. S. Gulf of Mexico shifted to work over during the fourth quarter and will return to drilling in the first quarter of 2018, which includes activity on the Mad Dog 2 awards from BP for five to eight wells that we highlighted in this quarter's release. This award is in addition to the earlier awards to OneSubsea for the corresponding subsea installations.","Internationally, fourth quarter revenue grew 2%. This was driven by strong growth in the Latin America area and a sustained growth in the Middle East and Asia area. These positive effects were partially offset by seasonal weakness in the Europe, CIS and Africa Area.","In 2018, the international market will return to growth for the first time since 2014 and the projected activity growth is now leading us to start the reactivation of equipments to meet new contract start-ups. In addition to this, we're also starting to reposition equipment in the International Areas in general and to Russia in the Middle East, in particular, where activity is strongest and where we can secure the best returns. Both the reactivation and repositioning will result in increased short-term costs, which we except to absorb in the first quarter of this year.","In Latin America, revenue increased 9% sequentially, driven by Argentina and Colombia. In Argentina, the growth was driven by Production Group activity for unconventional resource development with increased stage count and profit sales.","In addition, we also began the first well on the YPF Bandurria Sur project. Drilling & Measurements in Colombia benefited from stronger activity for Ecopetrol. Revenue in Mexico and Central America was lower despite the growth in land development drilling works for both PEMEX and a number of local operators due to the absence of the strong multi-client seismic license sales seen in the third quarter.","SPM project revenue was essentially flat in Ecuador, where we collected the further payment during the quarter, bringing the total receipt to $720 million, inclusive of the $300 million in bonds received from Petroamazonas that we monetized in December. We expect further payments early in 2019.","In the Middle East and Asia area, revenue increased 2% sequentially on strong IPS project work in Saudi Arabia. Much of this was the result of improved efficiency and unconventional research developments but performance also increased on conventional loan security projects.","Looking forward a little, we were awarded two new lump-sum contracts for drilling, rigs and services covering up to 146 gas wells and up to 128 oil wells. Project mobilization and start-up will begin in the first quarter.","Elsewhere in the Middle East, activity was higher for Drilling & Measurements in Qatar and Kuwait, where IDS efficiency delivered additional wells. Also, as already mentioned, RCT revenue declined from a long-term construction projects in the region. In Iraq, signs of increased activity are emerging in the north with at least one major IOC expected to resume activity during the first quarter.","In the south of the country, we have made further market share gains with additional awards of IDS contracts. With the onset of winter, activity was lower in the Europe, CIS and Africa with revenue declining a modest 2%. Seasonal effects were mainly seen in China, the North Sea GeoMarket and in Continental Europe, although these were partially offset by stronger SIS software sales and increased product sales from the drilling and production groups.","Sub-Saharan Africa revenue declined with lower activity in Congo while in Libya, onshore drilling activity resumed us the security situation continues to improve. Weather in Russia and Central Asia region mainly affected wireline, although this was partially offset by record highway stimulation operations as well as sales of SAS software and Artificial Lift products.","Secondly, it was also lower as the summer campaign ended, but completions high-end products sales mitigated this effect. The Caspian and Kazakhstan declined, although new contracts begin early in the first quarter were awarded for operations in both Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.","Looking ahead, in other parts of the area, there have been a number of acreage acquisitions by international operators in Sub-Saharan and Africa on the back of record low reserve additions with development acreage changing hands. This will translate to new activity in 2018, particularly in Tanzania and Gabon.","Some of these new projects have already less the new project awards that favor our integrated service capability. For example, we have just been awarded a services contract for an offshore project in Gabon to oversee well construction services. At the same time, Borr Drilling has been awarded the rig contract.","We see alignment of this type as being one of the next steps in being able to provide more efficient drilling operations.","And with that, I pass the call to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Patrick.","2017 marked the beginning of the oil market recovery with supply and demand moving into balance and oil prices steadily increasing over the course of the year. Our revenue grew 9% and ended up just north of $30 billion, driven by strengthening land activity in North America and by the Cameron acquisition, where we exceeded the synergy target start at the close of the transaction in 2016.","Our approach through the past three years of unprecedented downturn has been to careful navigate the difficult commercial landscape, seizing strategic M&A opportunities, continuing the commitment to our transformation program and further broadening our extensive technology portfolio through organic R&D investments. Throughout this challenging period, we have continued to evaluate the effectiveness and competitiveness of all parts of the company and proactively restructure the elements we deemed necessary.","In line with this, we took a further charge in the fourth quarter amounting to $3 billion and I would now like to give you the rationale behind the largest element of this, which is our decision to exit the seismic acquisition business.","Given our history and market position, this has not been an easy decision to make. But following a careful evaluation of the current market trends, our customers buying habits and other current and projected financial returns, it is unfortunately and inevitable outcome.","Geophysical measurements serve design and seismic operations have been an essential part of Schlumberger and our R&D efforts for more than 30 years. And today, we remain the industry seismic technology leader with a unique position in terms of intellectual property as well as engineering and manufacturing capabilities.","Our IsoMetrix Marine acquisition system remains unrivaled and represents one of the biggest engineering achievements in the history of our company. Still has a downturn in the seismic data acquisition business now enters its sixth year.","The present outlook provides no line of sight to a market recovery. It has also become clear to us that our customers are unwilling to pay a premium for our differentiated seismic measurement and surveys, and they clearly believe that generic technology and performance is sufficient. In general, this approach commoditize the seismic data acquisition business and creates a very low technical barrier to entry for smaller players, who steadily adds vessels and keep the market in a chronic state of overcapacity.","We are therefore reached the conclusion that the seismic acquisition business cannot provide the full-cycle returns we require in terms of operating margins, free cash flow generation and return on capital employed nor can it compete for our internal allocation of R&E funding for capital investments.","This challenging commercial environment is today clearly reflected in the financial statements of all the standalone seismic acquisition players, who are either at\/or close to bankruptcy, heavily burned by weak cash flow and high debt.","And while standalone seismic acquisition players have no other choice than to stay in and fight on to avoid bankruptcy while hoping for a better future, we, at Schlumberger, do have a choice, and we choose to exit the commoditized land and Marine acquisition business.","Meanwhile, rapid advances and high-performance computing data analytics and machine learning have enhanced the value of seismic, imaging and visualization, enabling us to extract significantly higher value from our previous acquired data.","Going forward, WesternGeco therefore adopts an asset-light model built on our strong multi-client, data processing and interpretation businesses, and further supported by our close partnerships with a leading company in cloud and high-performance computing. As a result, our reconstituted seismic business will going forward require half the capital investments and yield twice the free cash flow conversion and making it accretive to the cash returns of the company.","In the coming quarters, we will, of course, honor all our existing land and Marine acquisition contract and customer commitment, but we have already stopped our participation in new bids. We are currently evaluating options for divesting our acquisition business and as we go through this process, we will call back our equipment as we complete our ongoing contractual commitments.","Given the week financial state of the other seismic acquisition players and the absence of a clear line of sight to a recovery in the seismic market, we are prepared for the divestiture process to take some time and that we may end up selling our acquisition business to a new market entrant.","Next, let's turn to the oil market, where demand amount outlook continues to be strong fueled by robust economic growth with the latest forecast showing upward GDP revisions in both the U.S. and Europe and with India continuing to surprise to the upside.","On the supply side, the OPEC and Russian land production cuts were extended to the end of 2018 and more importantly, compliance remains at\/or above 100%. This is translating into higher-than-expected inventory growth with U.S. stocks quickly approaching the five-year average and brent related inventories already well below. At the same time, floating storage has been more or less eliminated.","All of this means that after a full year of waiting, the oil market is now substantially rebalanced. This is also reflected in the oil market sentiment, but we currently are witnessing a gradual shift from an oversupply discount towards the restoration of a market tightness premium with any geopolitical or operational disruption creating further upward movement in the oil price.","In North America, shale oil production has responded as expected in 2017, with strong growth seen in the fourth quarter following the ramp up of drilling and completion activity earlier in the year. Looking forward to 2018, some of the U.S. E&Ps are still indicating that they will invest within cash flow in coming year.","However, with a positive oil market sentiments and the increased availability of cash, we expect another year of robust growth in North America shale oil production, which will be required to maintain the balance in the global oil market.","The reason for this is that the aging production base in Latin America, Africa and Asia continues to show underlying production decline after three years of unprecedented underinvestment.","In 2018, this trend will again be marked by close to 2 million barrels of loan cycle production additions from investments made in the previous up cycle. These production tailwinds are expected to drop by around 1 million barrels per day in 2019, which means that the affected decline in the rest of the growth significant acceleration in 2019 and beyond even if investment levels start increasing in 2018.","These positive oil market sentiments are also reflected in the E&P outlook, where the third-party surveys predict another 15% to 20% increase in North America investments in 2018 while the international market is poised for growth for the first time in four years with a forecast of 5% increase in E&P spend.","From the Schlumberger side, we expect 2018 to be another year of strong growth in North America land, driven by further market share gains in both hydraulic fracturing and drilling as we deploy another 1 million horsepower and continue the capacity ramp up of our currently sold out rotary steerables and drillbit technologies.","In the international market, we expect growth in all regions in 2018 for the first time since 2014. Spearheaded by solid underlying activity increases and market share gains in the Middle East, Russia, Asia and the North Sea while we expect more nominal growth rates in Latin America and Africa.","The return to broad-based growth in international market represents a significant boost to our earnings power due to our unrivaled leadership position in all parts of this market in terms of both market share and profitability.","The significance of it is best illustrated by the fact that we generate four to five times higher earnings for each incremental customer that was spent in the international market compared to the incremental customer dollars spent in North America. So after three very tough years, it is now clear that the tide is clearly turning in favor of Schlumberger.","Moving closer at the first quarter, this will be a transitory quarter for us, where we expect the sequential decline in EPS to be $0.02 to $0.03 more than the normal seasonal growth. This is driven by the increased relative signs of our businesses in Russia and the North Sea, the need to absorb exceptional cost-related through reactivation of idle capacity due to recent contract wins as well as noticeable equipment repositioning cost as we shift more of our international capacity towards the Middle East and Russia.","We expect to absorb the majority of these exceptional costs in the first quarter, and we are already seeing a strong acceleration in operating income growth in the second quarter.","Turning next the capital allocations. We plan to tackle the 2018 activity growth without an increase in CapEx from the $2 billion levels seen in 2016 and 2017 as we again start to benefit from improved asset utilization on the back of our transformation program. These investments will be lower in 2018 as we focus on monetizing the strong library we have already bid.","And for SPM, we have reached the end of our counter cyclical business development program and are now shifting our full attention towards project execution. This means that capital investment levels will be down in 2018 and that our SPM business will generate positive free cash flow in the coming year.","In terms of capital allocations over its M&A activity, the only major transaction we are currently pursuing is depending EDC transaction and Russia, We remain optimistic that we will ultimately receive the needed regulatory approvals.","As for dividends, we decided based on the current payout ratio to maintain our dividend at the current level for another year and instead return excess cash to our shareholders in the coming year through our existing buyback program.","As we eagerly enter the first year of growth in all parts of our global operations since 2014, our entire organization remains committed to delivering market-leading products and services to our customers and superior returns to our investors, driven by our ability to win our customers work and deliver strong incremental margins and free cash flow.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","James West","Hi. Good morning, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning, James.","James West","Great to hear your confidence about the international recovery and that getting underway. It looks we've already seen a little bit of that so far. I know Patrick outlined just a slew of contract wins that have already happened and I know that there's a lot of tenders out there, more are coming. It seems to be a global in nature.","And you highlighted some transitory parts of 1Q, but how should we think about the rollout of international revenue or the contracts coming in and starting up as we go through 2018 and 2019? And kind of where do we see the inflection [hire] [ph] for international?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think if you look at the progression of 2019, I think I'll limit my comments to that. Like I said, the first quarter will be \u2013 we will see a lot of the start-up of these new contract wins. So in terms of revenue, we will have an impact of seasonality given the relative higher share of Northern Hemisphere business at this stage. And then it will be start-up cost and mobilizations that we're going to focus on in the coming quarters.","So in terms of revenue progression, I think you will see the first quarter of significant acceleration in revenue in the second quarter followed again by a very strong growth also into the third quarter. So the year will have a somewhat slow start with seasonality with start-up costs and mobilizations in the first and then followed by strong growth in the subsequent quarters.","James West","Okay. That's very helpful. And then with respect to the first quarter, normally, there's about 10% decline or so for Schlumberger's earnings, yet that's in the normalized year-over-year, you have a lot of back and forth quarter sales and see the drop-off there. Should we think about something in that range? Or will it be maybe more of a pronounced decline at 1Q and then more of a jump in 2Q because of these staging and the preparation? ","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah, I think from an overall activity standpoint, I mean, we \u2013 I think about 10% reduction in EPS is a good benchmark for that. On top of that, we will have, I would say, two three additional sense of one-time costs lead to the reactivation as well as repositioning of equipment. But I think the 10% number is a good guide for the traditional seasonality with a couple of extra cents on additional costs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.","Angie Sedita","Thanks. Good morning, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning, Angie.","Angie Sedita","So a little bit of color may be on the evolution of OneStim in regards to Completions and started up how you'd like to build that business out over time, have a vertically-integrated business. What product lines are you missing? And what's the timeframe do you think you could see for that business to be built out to way that you would like it to well-rounded full product suite, et cetera?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. So for the multi-stage completion business for U.S. land, we do have a more or less complete offering. There's a few small pieces that we're missing that we have. We're working on organically. But in terms of overall, we have the products that we need in the market. We have a presence in the market, although it is not very high.","So what we are in full swing of doing now is to step up both supply chain and manufacturing as well as sales of this offering. And we will now tie it very closely to the deployment of additional horsepower. We obviously have ramped up significantly already in 2017.","So we have a very aggressive growth plan for the multi-stage completion offering that we already have in-house, and we will look to penetrate significantly into the OneStim frac fleet that we already have in operation as well as the additional fleets that we will put into play in 2018.","Angie Sedita","Okay, okay, fair enough. And then the reference to SPM being potentially done. I mean, previously, you were commenting there could be as many as two to four project announced in the next one to two quarters. Now the oil prices have moved higher, transaction costs have like also moved higher. Do you still expect two to four more projects to be announced or are you done at least for 2018?","Paal Kibsgaard","Patrick, you want to comment on that?","Patrick Schorn","Yes. So I think in general, Angie, SPM continues to be a growth engine for the company in the coming years. But at this stage, we have reached the end of what we call our countercyclical business development program, and we are really shifting our attention to project execution.","Going forward, SPM will generate positive cash flow, and therefore, we'll be able to fund future investments and potential expansion. So I would really characterize this as a very disciplined growth going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Scott Gruber","Good morning.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Scott Gruber","Paal, with SPM being deemphasized to a degree with higher crude prices and you guys have made very good progress on the transformation, we started to receive a few questions from investors regarding what is Schlumberger's main growth strategy from here, what are the main initiatives to execute on that growth strategy?","I have an answer, but given rising investor interest in Schlumberger and probably more people tuning into this call, I think it would be useful to if you just for a minute or two, from a higher level, if you could briefly discuss the overarching strategy of the company going forward and the key initiatives to execute on that strategy.","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I would say that, if you look at what we've done over the past three years in the down cycle, we have two acquisitions, in particular, Cameron and through the combined I would say a number of small acquisitions within land drilling and organic investments, we have increased our addressable market with around 50%.","So we have now a very complete portfolio within rest of our characterization, within all aspects of drilling, within all aspects of production, with an increased presence and U.S. land as well, and we\u2019ve added Cameron to the lineup in 2016.","So our strategy going forward is very clearly that we want to now increase our market share, increase our participation in all aspects of the global business. We have a fantastic presence in the international market, which are now just returning to growth. And as I indicated in my prepared remarks, our earnings power internationally is four to five times higher than what it is in the North America land.","So our strategy is very clear, it hasn't changed. We will continue to participate in all the major markets around the world. And we are very excited about the growth opportunities now that international is providing us. And again, the earnings power we have in these markets.","Scott Gruber","Got it. That's helpful. And then just with regard to the 5% market growth rate expectation in 2018, given the past investments in the SPM projects coming online, how do you think your international revenues trend relative to that market growth rate?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think, overall, our objective is to outgrow the overall market in any part of the growth, right? So I would say that if the international E&P spend growth ends up being 5%, our goal is to outperform it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","James Wicklund","Good morning guys. Paal, it's all positive in terms of the outlook. We all know that you guys and everybody else has said that international drilling activity had kind of bottomed mid-last year, but we're warned that pricing pressure continued. Has the pricing pressure abated any? And where is pricing today versus 2014 broadly in the international sector? And I guess, it matters most in Russia, Saudi and the North Sea. Can you talk about pricing internationally since spending is going to up in the rig count bottom that seems to be the most critical issue right now?","Paal Kibsgaard","It's a fair question, Jim. Obviously, we have a very clear view on pricing, and we have a very good handle on pricing. At this stage, I don't really want to go into what we think about pricing or how we're going to play pricing. This is very sensitive and very close to how we are running the business. So I'd rather keep those views to myself. Other than that, we have a very clear view on what they are doing w e are going to do going forward.","James Wicklund","Has it quick going down at least generally per industry?","Paal Kibsgaard","I'm going not to stick to what is said. I think the overall in any part of the world remain competitive really at any stage of the cycle. The question is are you pushing pricing up, are you looking for market share? I'm not saying that we are doing either of those two things other than what we have a very good handle on what to do with pricing, and we view this as a competitive advantage through how we are going to perform in the market going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons. Please go ahead.","Bill Herbert","Good morning. Paal, if you could speak to the expected cadence of deployment and reactivation of the Weatherford frac fleet over the 2018 timeframe and then more over, if you could also speak to what you expect the total reactivation cost of the fleet to be as well and whether you expect all 20 of these fleets to be working by the culmination at the end of this year?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. If you look at what we did in 2017, we basically reactivated around 1 million-horsepower or slightly north of 20 fleets in 2017 of our own capacity. We are now more or less fully deployed, and we had challenges early on with the reactivation and getting everything out. There is a lot of hiring, there's a lot of new things to take on as to massively ramp up as we did. But at least, we have gotten the hang of it.","So our plan is to do exactly the same in 2018. So we would be deploying the additional 1 million-horsepower over the course of 2018 and although it's not going to be a completely straight line, I think fairly close to a straight line over the course of the year, I think is a good assumption.","Bill Herbert","Got it. And do you have sort of gas I mean, I'm sure you've done work, but do you want to reveal it in terms of what you expect the reactivation cost to be?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. So for the horsepower that we bought from Weatherford, we expect the total reactivation cost to be in the range of $100 million, which is factored into our CapEx guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead","Hi, good morning. Thank you for all that color.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Kurt Hallead","Interesting stuff going on here especially on the international front for sure. So Paal, a lot of focus and attentions on a very near-term numbers on the quarter I don't want to read too much into your commentary, but it sounds to me like the benefit you're going to get from the start ups post first quarter should more than offset the greater than seasonal drop in the first quarter.","So on a full year basis, I'd have to assume that the street consensus numbers look pretty solid where they are right now. Can you provide some commentary on that?","Paal Kibsgaard","We generally don't give annual guidance, so I'm not going to step into that. I would just reiterate my commentary that Q1 is transitory. We are not suggesting anything else than that. We have normal seasonal decline, we have some additional costs related to repositioning and reactivation, and we expect very strong growth in earnings, both in the Q2 and Q3 coming after.","Kurt Hallead","Okay, that's fair enough. I appreciate that. So on the international front, you're mentioning that the earnings contribute 4 to 5x more than that in North America. Is that a true cycle number, Paal? Or you kind of comparing what was transpiring during the kind of peak activity levels for international in North America?","Paal Kibsgaard","No, this is the full cycle comparison of our North American operations versus our international operations, full cycle.","Kurt Hallead","Okay, great, awesome. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Anderson","Hi, good morning. Paal, so you said in the past that doing nothing is not a strategy with the write-down in marine and seismic acquisition. So another move where you address your strategy on the business not meet acceptable returns SPM is the other obvious example. I was wondering if you could just kind of help us understand kind of bigger picture where you think Schlumberger's normalized returns should end up say compared to last cycle?","Kind of excluding a big ramp up in pricing with your new kind of more asset-light model, can you get back to those levels? Are you targeting it back to kind of high teens returns maybe just kind of talk about just in general how you're thinking about that?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah, we are for sure targeting that. I think our goal is to beat the margins we had in the previous cycle and obviously peak higher and then whenever the inevitable next cycle starts, that we also profiler. So we have very clear plans in place for how we're going to do that both when it comes operating margins, when it comes to free cash flow generation as well as a return on capital employed.","David Anderson","And then one other thing if I could just go back to another comment you made in the past about not getting paid for technology in certain markets and therefore you pulled back until those customers come back to you. Has your mindsets changed at all on that? Have you seen shift from customers on how they're viewing technology today?","I'm just kind of wondering how you\u2019re thinking about R&D spending over next few years. Obviously, came down quite a bit this year. How should we think about where that number goes for the next few years?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, we haven\u2019t changed our position in terms of wanting to get paid for our technology and in the markets where we are not going to get paid for our differentiated technology, we will provide market performance in those markets. Right? But I would say that the conversation is starting to shift in many of the markets around the world now towards technology, towards differentiated technologies and towards overall service and product performance.","And this is, obviously, something that favors us. I think even in North America land, as we go into 2019, there is a growing focus from the customer base on both drilling and hydraulic fracturing efficiencies. So we want basically more well spots per rigs per year, and we want more stages per fleet per month, right?","So all of these elements favors differentiated technologies, individuals technologies as well as our integrated offering, both when it comes to drilling and stimulation.","So in terms of R&D spend, we have taken the R&D spend down gradually over the course of this downturn. We don't have plans for 2018 to increase it significantly, but we have plans in place in the following years as to what we would direct the spend towards when the market permits those to increase spend.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Igor Levi from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Igor Levi","Good morning.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Igor Levi","So I remember early in the downturn when you were first giving international price concessions, you had mentioned that these concessions have mechanism of reversing when oil price trigger points were hit. And I know you don't want to provide details on pricing itself, but could we assume that with oil in the high 60s that some of those mechanisms are being triggered?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah. I think generally for those mechanisms, if you look at the bidding activity that we've gone through say over the past year and are still ongoing at this stage most of the contracts that those mechanisms were tagged on to are now being replaced by new bids.","So I don't expect there to be a significant number of contracts where we still have those mechanisms in place that generally replaced by new contracts that have been competitively bid over the past year and it's still being awarded as we speak.","Igor Levi","Great. And how should we think about modeling the impact of your exit from the seismic acquisition business on 2018 results relative to what that business earned in 2017?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think if you look at the impact in Q4, there is some D&A impact. And beyond that, I think, obviously, it will be less capital intensive going towards. I would say lower CapEx, higher free cash conversion and some positive impact from D&A. Beyond that, that's it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Waqar Syed","Thank you. Paal, my question is regarding the OneSubsea segments. One of the \u2013 your competitors have come up with more compact systems that can way sharply reduce customer cost. What's the Schlumberger's answer to this new introduction of new systems into the subsea?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, from the OneSubsea side, we have, over the past three years, done a lot on reducing the overall cost space and the capital intensity, the size on the equipment that we provide. So I mean this is nothing new for us, we've already made significant investments into this. We are quite competitive when it comes to all aspect of this, right? So this is already being going on within OneSubsea for a number of years.","And if you look at some of the awards we've had in the past 12 months that's coming out as a direct consequence of being very competitive when it comes to cost and also standardization of the equipment that we're providing our solutions to our customers. So there's nothing new for us, we've already being working on this, and continue to work on it.","Waqar Syed","And what's your view on the outlook for offshore project FIDs with regards to primarily subsea orders, inventories or other subsea spending?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I don't have a specific number to give you on the number of projected fee awards other than that it set to be up in 2018. I think overall number of FIDs offshore as well is on the positive trend. So we are optimistic and excited about the offshore market as well as overall, the international market going into 2018.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jud Bailey","Thanks. Good morning.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Jud Bailey","Good morning. A question on margins, Paal. With revenue growth probably old markets looks like they're going to be probably in the right direction next year. In the past, you've talked about generating \u2013 getting back to generating very high incremental margins in the 60-plus percent range.","With revenue growth starting to turn the corner in most of your markets, is that still a reasonable expectation at some point in the future? And just in general, how should we think about incremental margins this year with the revenue growth probably going to happen from the spending that we see in your piece this year?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah. So for 2019, we target to increasing incremental margins in all aspects of our business around the world. I'm not sure that 65% incrementals in 2018 is that realistic because we will require a fair bit of pricing to reach those levels, but I've always said that 65% is achievable, good pricing.","So we will have to see how the market pans out in terms of pricing. But absent pricing, I think it's going to be tough to get the 65%, but we for sure going to improve over the incremental margins that we delivered in 2017.","Jud Bailey","Is that still a reasonable goal if we continue to see growth in 2019, I guess? And I know you don't want to give guidance out that far, but just trying to get a sense that you'd still be once things are on we can get pass some activation cost and some of the transitory issues that the high incremental are something that you'd still be comfortable with a longer-term basis.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, absolutely. We are for sure targeting the 65% incrementals when we got into steady growth, when we get a bit of pricing tailwind. That ambition have not changed, and we are going to work towards achieving. Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Timna Tanners","Hey, good morning all. Wanted to ask if you could follow-up a little bit, please, on the SPM strategy. I appreciate that you're moving into harvest mode that makes a lot of sense. But can you help us with characterizing perhaps what might be the right investments were redeploying any of that cash and how we would look at those opportunities going forward?","Patrick Schorn","Yeah, it's maybe a little bit the same as what you already said. I think that we still believe that SPM is going to bed significant portion of our growth strategy going forward. But at the end, we want to make sure that we are very opportunistic in the deals that we bake. And at this stage, we have really reached the end of our countercyclical business development program.","And going forward, we will be growing in a very disciplined manner. What that means is that we want SPM to be generating its cash that can use for future investment and potential expansion and that's \u2013 that is going to be the way on how we are going to be looking at project going forward. So SPM is key to what we do, and we have a very strong view on how we want to be investing our capital going forward.","Timna Tanners","Okay. I guess, you don't want to show your hands there too much. I'll shift to asking that question more to Simon about given the commentary about returning value to shareholders and buybacks and so on, can your mind as maybe some of your targets in terms of debt metrics and or cash on the balance sheet? Thanks.","Simon Ayat","So I think I won't \u2013 but no stopping \u2013 but you mentioned something about the cash on the balance sheet? This is Simon Ayat, by the way. Can you repeat your question, please?","Timna Tanners","So in light of the focus now on returning cash to shareholders and growth beyond the dividend, wanted to see if you could please remind us what your targets might be a regarding appropriate level of cash on the balance sheet and what your target debt metrics are? Thanks.","Simon Ayat","So you know our policy is to return capital through dividend and buy back. And we are in the market continuously on the buyback. From the remarks that I made, we spent almost $1 billion, we bought 13.2 million shares during 2017 and this has far exceeds the amount of shares we issued for the stock-based compensation.","So our policy at the minimum, we will continue to buy back shares that we issue for the stock for the base compensation and any excess cash, and we will return it to our shareholders through buyback. The dividend policy is reviewed every year. As we said this January, we decided to stay at the same level and when the visibility is going to improve, we will certainly go back to increasing it. So our policy at the minimum is to return the shareholder any stock we issue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Michael LaMotte","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hey, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Michael LaMotte","When the OneStim was talked about as a joint venture, at one point you talked about operating fracs fleet as essentially two frac fleets or Schlumberger high tech and Weatherford base more conventional fleet vehicle, and I'm wondering now that you own 100% of it, these 20-plus incremental fleets this year, are they going to be more conventional spreads? Or are they going to have elements of the integrated field systems that you've been moving towards with OneStim?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I'm saying that for the underlying frac spread technology, we haven\u2019t talked about any kind of differentiation in that. I think the equipment that we bought from Weatherford versus the equipment that we generally have ourselves is more or less the same. I think it's much more down to water pumping, the fluid systems, diversion and potentially going more to an integrated model.","But I would say today, we operate with basically generic fluid systems, and we have more or less the standard business model that the industry uses for us. So there's really no difference in the way we are operating any of the frac spreads within OneStim today and that's going to change from a take onboard the additional 1 million horsepower from Weatherford, right?","So we are happy to provide more of an integrated package including both pump down perforating and multi-stage completions, and that's what we are going to be promoting in our contract with our customers, right? But for the ones that want to buy the individual pieces, we would continue to do that and that is still a lion's share of how we operate today.","Michael LaMotte","Okay. And then do you mind addressing some of the bottlenecks that you're seeing in the U.S. land market today? Obviously, labor is one that we hear a lot about, but I'm thinking more on the logistic side, in particular?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. I think where the substantial growth that the industry has seen, and obviously, we have seen it and more so in the past year, and that's going to continue into 2018.","There are bottlenecks in many parts of the value chain, right? But through diverse integration program, we have now been able to streamline a lot of the aspects all the way from the sand mind, to the railcars, to the transload and even then at the last mile through owning of fair bit of our own last mile trucking.","So that's getting ironed out and I think the other aspect of challenges as well as that while the service industries has to ramp up their capacity and readiness, the same has gone for the customers. And I would say that there hasn\u2019t always been perfect synchronization in between our operations and customers where you get inefficiencies from waiting on water, waiting for the valve to be ready and so forth.","So I think there's also a significant part of how we are going to be looking to try to streamline operations, to drive efficiency and further drive profitability in the year to come. But all of these things are in the works. We know where the bottlenecks are, and we have I would say active programs to address all of these in the coming year.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of Sean Meakim from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sean Meakim","Thank you. Good morning. So Paal with international activities set to improve you are losing some markets and you highlighted your core CapEx becoming flat again therefore still well below your core D&A. I'm just curious if you could expand on how much your efficiency efforts can continue to drive that lower spend? And what would it take for you in terms of the environment in order to really step it up meaningfully?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I mean, we're basically saying that we can keep our CapEx for field equipment flat in 2018 versus 2017. And it's began driven by the fact that we have in our view significant upside potential when it comes to the utilization of the existing asset base. So I don't see this as a one year benefit. We have this program going on, which I think will benefit those for a number of years going forward.","So while I'm not going to make any prediction to field equipment CapEx for 2019 already at this stage, but for growth rate that are in the range of what we're seeing now, we can continue to do this for a number of years going forward.","So we have significant capacity upside from the existing asset base, and we are going to try to drive utilization up and have a significant tailwind to our current capital employed by not having to spend a lot of CapEx on replenishing the field operation.","Sean Meakim","Okay. Thank you. That's helpful feedback. And just thinking about North American onshore beyond pressure pumping some of the other completion and production service lines, how do you see the supply and demand and ultimately pricing for those other related product lines, cementing, core tubing even more pressure flow back break it here in your commentary there?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I think as activity will continue to increase, we expect to see growth and pricing opportunities for all the surrounding activities around fracking as well as on all aspects of drilling as well, right? And the last part, which we don't talk a lot about on these calls, is the Artificial Lift business, but we also have a very strong presence both when it comes to DSPs and price right? So for all aspect of our business in U.S. and going forward, we are very positive on both activity and pricing opportunity.","Simon Ayat","So thank you for that final question. I would now like to summarize the three most important points we have discussed this morning. First, the oil market is now balanced as a result of continued strong demand growth and the supply side characterized by production cuts, led by OPEC in Russia and the weakening global production base.","So even the robust growth from North America shale oil production in 2019, global supply responses will be increasingly needed to balance the market going forward, which, again, means the return to growth for all parts of our business.","Second, the positive sentiment in the oil market are already reflected in that 2019 E&P spend forecast where the third-party surveys indicate growth of 15% to 20% in North America and 5% internationally. This is highly favorable to Schlumberger as our international earnings power is four to five times higher than what we see in North America.","Last, our approach the past three years has been to broaden our technology portfolio, leverage our transformation program and restructure our organization to be ready for the inevitable market recovery. We are excited about the outlook, and we are ready to deliver the best products and services to our customers and superior returns to our shareholders.","Thank you very much for participating in the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.","Simon Farrant","Good morning. Good afternoon and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2018 earnings call. Today\u2019s call is being hosted from New York following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting.","Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Schorn, Executive Vice President, Wells. We will as usual first go through our prepared remarks, after which we will open up for questions.","For today\u2019s agenda, Simon will present comments on our third quarter financial performance before Patrick reviews our results by geography. Paal will close our remarks with a discussion of our technology portfolio and our updated view of the industry macro. However, before we begin, I would like to remind our participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings.","Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details on reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our third quarter press release, which is on our website. Finally, after our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow more time for others who maybe in the queue.","Now, I hand the call over to Simon Ayat.","Simon Ayat","Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share was $0.46. Excluding charges and credits this represents an increase of $0.03 sequentially and an increase of $0.04 when compared to the same quarter last year. There were no charges or credits recorded in the current quarter. Our third quarter revenue of $8.5 billion increased 2% sequentially primarily driven by strong international drilling activities. Pre-tax operating margins increased by 36 basis points to 13.5%.","Highlights by product group were as follows. Third quarter reservoir characterization revenue of $1.7 billion increased 2% sequentially primarily due to higher wireline and integrated services management activity in the international markets. This was partially offset by the completion of the first phase of an integrated production system project. Margin increased 88 basis points to 22.3% primarily driven by the increase in higher margin wireline activity. Drilling revenue of $2.4 billion increased 9% sequentially. This increase was driven by strong international growth and benefited in integrated drilling services. Drilling and measurements and MIs were core activities.","Margins increased 103 basis points to 14% as profitability improved in certain IBS projects that started in the prior quarter. The overall increase in drilling activity also contributed to the margin improvement. Production revenue of $3.3 billion and margins of 9.8% were essentially flat. Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion was also flat sequentially. Increased sales in surface systems and drilling systems were offset by lower revenue in OneSubsea and valve and measurements. Margins declined 140 basis points to 11.4% primarily driven by the lower OneSubsea revenue. The book-to-bill ratio for the Cameron long-cycle business was at 1.","Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 16.4% in the first quarter compared to 17.2% in the previous quarter. We generated $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations during the quarter. Our net debt slightly decreased during the quarter to $14.5 billion. We ended the quarter with total tax and investments of $2.9 billion. During the quarter we spent $100 million to repurchase 1.5 million shares at an average price of $64.98. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included CapEx of approximately $565 million and capitalized cost relating to SPM projects of $285 million. During the quarter we also made $692 million of dividend payments. Full year 2018 CapEx excluding SPM and multi-client investments are still expected to be approximately $2 billion.","And now I will turn the conference call over to Patrick.","Patrick Schorn","Thank you, Simon and good morning everyone. Schlumberger revenue in the third quarter of 2018 increased 2% sequentially with pretax operating income increasing 5%. In North America while we continue to gain market share in artificial lift and drilling, takeaway constraints in the Permian led to lower activity for our OneStim hydraulic fracturing business. Internationally, we continued to benefit from the broad based recovery that began in the second quarter seeing solid growth in all operating regions, driving international sequential revenue growth ahead of sequential growth in North America for the first time since the second quarter of 2014. As usual I will first discuss the revenue growth by geography without Cameron before concluding with a few remarks on Cameron\u2019s third quarter performance.","In North America revenue of $2.6 billion increased 1% sequentially, on land drilling revenue grew 5% sequentially to outperform the 3% increase in the land rig count. Rotary steerable systems were again in demand to meet customer needs for longer laterals required in shale oil development for optimum well performance. Higher product sales for artificial lift systems which grew by 10% also contributed to third quarter performance. These positive results however were largely offset by the weakness in the hydraulic fracturing market that developed during the quarter. While the quarter began by leveraging second quarter fleet additions, customer activity weakened during the third quarter as takeaway constraints in the Permian limited production growth. The resulting excess hydraulic horsepower in the market led to softer pricing and as a consequence of this we did not add more of our spare fleet capacity during the quarter.","The rapid changing in the dynamics of the hydraulic fracturing market again highlighted the operational agility and execution needed to efficiently manage resources and to effectively control supply chain costs. The robust performance of vertically integrated sand mining and delivery business is one of the key elements of this where we in addition to supplying our OneStim operations with sand now also are successfully completing in the third-party sand market as an integrated hydraulic fracturing company. The multistage stimulation business for completion in North America land saw a record number of stages installed in Q3. Broadband precision technology has seen steady uptake throughout the year from multiple customers in Canada and the Permian. The reliability of this technology allows not only efficient fracking of wells with 20 stages per day, but also selective sleeve closing and reopening to better manage water and sand production as the well cleans up.","We also continued to see solid new technology sales in the U.S. land market. The growth of our drilling business has been underpinned by technologies such as PowerDrive rotary steerable systems and AxeBlade drill bits, which have become the key enablers for drilling longer lateral sections. One new bit technology introduced during the quarter was the HyperBlade hyperbolic diamond element bit, a development of our market leading StingBlade and AxeBlade bits. HyperBlade bits lowered drilling costs by improving the rate of penetration while maintaining steering response and directional tracking in the soft and plastic rock formation that make up many of the unconventional reservoirs. At the same time the emergence of well and reservoir performance issues are leading to new focused cementing technologies, such as the CemFIT Shield mud-sealing cement system that provides the industry\u2019s first zonal isolation technology, specifically designed to improve isolation between hydraulic fracturing stages in long horizontal wells. On the major SPM Palliser asset in Canada, drilling continued with 4 rigs. Drilling efficiency and advanced drilling systems continued to drive performance. So far, 93 wells have been drilled and a further 30 are expected by year end.","On the completion side, OneStim has enabled higher efficiency and reduced cycle time between drilling and flowback, accelerating production of new oil. Overall, well production has met or exceeded type curve expectations and total oil production is up 54% year-to-date. Offshore in North America, revenues decreased 4% sequentially as drilling activity was impacted by scheduled platform maintenance. At the same time, activity also shifted to work-over operations and the combination of these changes led to a less favorable activity mix for us.","Turning now to the international areas, third quarter revenue, excluding Cameron, increased 4% sequentially as the broad-based international recovery continues across all regions. Our sequential performance was led by growth in Latin America and the Middle East due to higher activity for both national oil companies and independent operators, while Europe, CIS and Africa saw solid growth boosted by strong activity in Russia. The ramp up of our international IDS activity continued with an additional 19 rigs being mobilized in the quarter and revenue climbing on the back of the previous quarter\u2019s mobilizations. We expect our excess international equipment capacity to be fully absorbed by year end after which we see increasing opportunities for pricing leverage as customers seek to secure services for new projects.","Excluding Cameron, revenue in Latin America increased 7% sequentially driven by strong performance in the Mexico and Central America geomarket from increased drilling and reservoir characterization activity. Revenue in the Latin America North geomarket was also up from higher activity on SPM projects in Ecuador. In Shushufindi, we reached a resolution of legacy payment issues and we amended commercial terms to establish a solid and stable operating framework that will enable future investments for further increasing production. Elsewhere in Latin America North, strong activity growth in Colombia as operating capacity tightened further created opportunities for increased pricing. We also saw progress in Latin America South, where increased activity in Brazil was fueled by international oil company intervention and exploration work, while in Argentina higher operational efficiency drove increased fracturing activity. Also in Argentina, results from the first two wells on the YPS SPM project exceeded expectations and can be considered among the best producers in the Vaca Muerta formation to-date.","Revenue in Europe, CIS, Africa, excluding Cameron increased 4% as strong activity in Russia and sub-Saharan Africa more than offset the impact of labor disputes and scheduled summer maintenance in the North Sea. The activity growth in Russia and Central Asia was driven by summer campaigns in Russia land, Sakhalin and Kazakhstan. Wireline, drilling and measurements and testing services were the main beneficiaries of this growth. Eastern Europe also saw stronger activity. Revenue in the sub-Saharan Africa geomarket increased with the start of new projects in Ghana and Mozambique, stronger drilling activity in Central and West Africa, and higher product and equipment sales in Nigeria, Angola, and Namibia. Customers are returning to exploration activity in the region and consequently, we are beginning to see demand return for higher technology services. The offshore market strengthened further during the quarter, including demand for a stimulation vessel fleet, where available capacity in West Africa is nearly sold out ahead of the 2019 ramp up. This is paving the way for market share gains and improved pricing. The North Africa geomarket benefited from solid activity in Libya despite the volatile security environment and from strong operational execution in Chad on integrated services management contracts.","Middle East and Asia revenue, excluding Cameron, increased 3%, led by the continued ramp up of lump-sum turnkey projects in Saudi Arabia and by strong IDS activity in Iraq and United Arab Emirates. We added additional rigs during the quarter in Saudi Arabia, keeping us on track to have mobilized 25 rigs by the end of the year. These positive effects however were partially offset by lower hydraulic fracturing activity as a major contract was completed and demobilized in Saudi Arabia. In Asia, the South and East Asia geomarkets posted sequential growth on increasing IDS work in India and on new ISM projects that mobilized in Malaysia. In the Far East Asia and Australia geomarkets, revenue was driven by increased drilling activity offshore Indonesia and by a return to exploration work in Australia.","Turning now to Cameron, revenue was largely unchanged from the previous quarter. Increased sales for service systems in North America and service activity for drilling systems in Europe, together with increased pressure control system sales in the Middle East were offset by lower revenue and backlog from OneSubsea. Looking at the Cameron backlog for drilling systems however, the total figure added at the end of the third quarter in 2018 was already significantly higher than that added for the whole of 2017. This is a further indication of the moves being made by offshore drilling contractors as they prepare for increased activity.","And with that, let me pass the call over to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Patrick and good morning everyone. In the third quarter, the broad-based international recovery continued, while the business environment in U.S. land hydraulic fracturing changed rapidly with both activity and pricing softening more than expected over the course of the quarter. In parallel with this, the global supply and demand balance tightened further with another draw in global oil inventories and a $10 increase in oil prices during the quarter.","Based on this industry backdrop, I would like to address three key questions that are central to our business outlook. First, why is there a strong need for a significant multi-year increase in global E&P investments? Second, why is Schlumberger best positioned to capitalize on these growth opportunities? And third, why will Schlumberger generate the best operating profits and cash flow in the coming up-cycle? The international production base still accounts for around 80% of global supply and its critical to the stability of the oil market as a mere 1% net decline would represent around 800,000 barrels per day of lower production. Production growth from the international market has, since 2013, been driven by Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran and Russia, which combined have added 3.7 million barrels per day, while the rest of the international production base is down by 1.5 million barrels per day over the same period. Since 2014, many of the international operators have focused on maximizing cash flow by producing their fields harder and by prioritizing short-term actions at the expense of the required full cycle investments. This short-term investment focus offers a finite set of opportunities over a limited period of time and this period is now clearly coming to an end as seen by accelerating decline rates in many countries around the world.","In addition, reduced production tailwind from new projects that were sanctioned and largely funded prior to 2014, are now uncovering the underlying weakness in the international production base. Furthermore, additional investments will also be required to replace the Venezuelan and Iranian barrels that are now rapidly disappearing from the market. So, in our view, after 4 years of low activity, the international production base now needs significant growth in investments for the foreseeable future simply to maintain production flat at current levels.","The North American production base, which makes up the remaining 20% of global supply, has absorbed close to 70% of the demand growth since 2010 initially supported by the Eagle Ford and Bakken and more recently by the Permian basin. However, the well-established market consensus that the Permian can continue to provide 1.5 million barrels per day of annual production growth for the foreseeable future is starting to be called into question. In this respect, we do not believe that the temporary off-day constraints are the main issue as this will largely be addressed within the next 12 to 18 months. Instead, we believe the main challenge in the Permian going forward is more likely to be reservoir and well performance as the rate of infield drilling continues to accelerate.","At present, our industry has yet to understand how reservoir conditions and well productivity change as we continue to pump billions of gallons of water and billions of pounds of sand into the ground each year. However, what is already clear to us is that unit well performance normalized for lateral length and pounds of proppant pumped is dropping in the Eagle Ford as the percentage of child wells continues to increase. Today, the percentage of child wells drilled in the Eagle Ford has already reached 70% and in the 3-year period since this percentage broke the 50% level, we have seen a steady reduction in unit well productivity.","In the Permian, the percentage of child wells in the Midland Wolfcamp basin has just reached 50% and we are already starting to see a similar reduction in unit well productivity to that already seen in the Eagle Ford suggesting that the Permian growth potential could be lower than earlier expected. Therefore, assuming that oil demand will remain robust despite the trade war worries and market concerns around economic weakness in the emerging markets, we believe that the level of E&P investment must increase both internationally and in North America first of all to counter the multiyear drop in investments and second to develop and deploy the new technologies needed to overcome the emerging shale oil production challenges.","So, with this market outlook, why is Schlumberger best positioned to capitalize on these growth opportunities? First, we have an unmatched global footprint that enables us to cost effectively pursue growth opportunities in every corner of the world. In the majority of the 120 countries where we generate revenue, we have a rich history, deep industry relations, unmatched operating infrastructure and detailed knowledge of local business conditions. Second, we have the broadest technology portfolio in the industry, where our market leadership positions enable us to compete for growth opportunities in all parts of the E&P value chain. Over the past 8 years, we have actively expanded our technology portfolio through targeted M&A activity and organic R&E investments. In the past 3 years alone, we have increased our total addressable market by 50% and we today hold market leading positions in 17 of the 20 product lines we currently operate.","Third, we mastered the widest range of business models, which allows us to partner with our customers in their preferred way and this provides us with multiple avenues to increase our participation and share in markets all around the world. These models, which we have evolved over the past decade, now include equipment sales and rentals, traditional provision of standalone products and services, project coordination and bundled services, lump-sum turnkey contracts, and lastly, full field production management through our SPM models. And fourth, we lead industry in designing and engineering new high-performing technology systems spanning our entire data, software and hardware capabilities and fully leveraging the latest advantage in collaborative and digital technologies. To enable this, we last year reorganized our entire R&D effort into several distinct technology platforms, directly supporting our stated goals of pursuing the highest level of technology system performance for the benefit of our shareholders as well as for our customers.","So, with our differentiated growth potential, how will Schlumberger generate the best operating and cash returns in the coming up-cycle? We already consistently deliver superior full cycle EBITDA margins and cash flow from operations compared to our competitors, and in particular in the part of the cycle where the international markets are growing. In 2014, which was the last year of growth for our international business, we generated 69% incremental margins on only 4% revenue growth with no support from pricing. In the same year, we generated $6.2 billion of free cash flow, which represented a conversion rate of 83% of net income from continuing operations. This performance was driven by solid execution from our global organization and the early benefits from our transformation program. By advancing our transformation program further over the past 4 years, we have completely modernized our internal workflows and organizational structure and created stronger and more professional support functions with cutting-edge planning, execution and collaboration tools. This allows us to significantly improve the utilization and reduce the operating cost of our asset base through improved planning, distribution and maintenance. At the same time, we continue to deploy our people and expertise more effectively by applying multi-scaling and remote operations, which will allow us to reduce our annual recruiting numbers by at least 1,500 to 2,000 people in each of the coming years. These operational efficiency improvements all support our goals of delivering superior incremental margins in the coming up-cycle and at the same time lowering our need for capacity-related CapEx investments compared to previous cycles.","Based on our market outlook and strengthened execution capabilities we have defined the following set of performance targets for the coming cycle. We will outgrow the market in terms of top line through our unmatched global footprint, our industry leading technology offering, a broad range of business models and the investments we are currently making into our next generation technology platforms. We will deliver 65% incremental margins driven by our modernized operating platform and the recovery of the pricing concessions we have made over the past 4 years.","Our SPM business will at least be cash flow neutral in 2018 and 2019 after which we will see a significant free cash flow tailwind as our recent project additions reached their planned production rates. The CapEx requirements from our seismic business after adopting the asset-light model will be limited to specific multiclient projects, where each project we undertake continued to require a significant level of customer pre-commitment. At this stage we are not planning any M&A transactions that would involve significant cash outlay other than the pending Eurasia drilling needs, where we now have met and accepted all the requirements deflated by the Russian authorities and await their decision. These targets mean that we should meet or exceed our stated goal of converting more than 75% of our net income into pretax growth and generate an increasing amount of excess cash which we intend to return to our shareholders in the form of increased dividend and stock buyback.","At present the entire Schlumberger team of 110,000 women and men are ready and primed to outperform in the market upturn that we are now entering. And through the hard work we have collectively undertaken over the past 4 years to expand our external offering and modernize our internal execution platform, we have never been better positioned to outscore the market in the coming up-cycle and to generate superior operating margins and cash returns to the benefit of our shareholders.","Thank you. We will now open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning James.","Operator","His line has accidentally disconnected. We will go to the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Scott Gruber","Good morning.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning Scott.","Scott Gruber","Paal, good to hear some additional color on the transformation this morning, now your peers have programs as well, one I actually recall there is the transformation program, now when we look at peers they are reducing costs through internal programs and also through some merger synergies, but overall are you surprised by the level of cost reductions at peers? It doesn\u2019t sound like what peers are doing changes your view on eventually achieving the very robust incrementals that you originally laid out with the transformation plan, but is it delaying the ramp in incrementals, the timing of seeing those robust incrementals via the pricing dynamics in the marketplace there?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I mean I can focus my comments on what we do. I am not really into the details of what our competitors are doing, our peers are doing internally. But we have been working on our transformation on modernization program since 2012. And it\u2019s being a very meticulous and systematic approach to understanding what part of our operations or what in our operations can we improve in terms of both quality and efficiency. It takes time to change these type of things in a big organization that is actually functioning quite well from the get-go, but our job is to make sure that we pursue the upside potential and that\u2019s what we have been doing. So this will translate and be a significant part of how we drive incremental margins in the coming up-cycle. Now the incremental margins are still a function of a couple of other things in addition to the transformation and one is we need growth. And secondly we have also been very clear that we need some tailwind from pricing. And if you look at this year, we have internationally very low growth, quite nominal. And at the same time we are working through some let me say crosscurrents in pricing. We are still absorbing new contracts, the pricing is actually diluted to the base price that we have through the bidding we have done over the past year. But then that was all normalized and we get a bit more consistent sequential and annual growth with a bit of help from pricing and the modernization program is going to be the real driver for us delivering on the promise of the 65% incrementals. And this is something that will evolve I would say over the coming 1 to 2 years.","Scott Gruber","Got it. What aspects of the transformation program do you think were most profound, what aspects will peers struggle to replicate that you think really gives you an edge into the next cycle?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, let me again focus on us. I mean, the most profound part of what we have done has been firstly to update the entire blueprints of all the activities we do as a company and put that together into one companywide map. When you have done that, you can start breaking down these things and streamline them in terms of how each part of the company comes together in a huge element of teamwork to drive again both the quality and efficiency of what we do. So, having a deep understanding of how everything is interconnected, you can also then start to professionalize more the individual parts \u2013 things like procurements, sourcing, transportation, these are all actually huge aspects of what drives that performance. And when you are as big as we are, I think it\u2019s very, very smart to actually address these things with a lot more professionalism than what we have done in the past. I wouldn\u2019t say that we have done a bad job at it, it\u2019s just that when you are as big as we are, then there is huge opportunities to drive efficiencies and quality by further professionalizing these type of functions.","Scott Gruber","Got it. I appreciate the additional color. Thanks.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead","Hey, good morning, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Kurt Hallead","I was just kind of curious, thanks for that color on the incremental margins and what\u2019s going to be necessary to get there. On the interim basis, right, can you give us your perspective on how you see the North American frac market mapping out over the course of the next year or so? And then given some of the challenges, can you kind of give us some insights as to how you are kind of managing the cost dynamic and how you are trying to maximize your margins through this interim lull?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I will. So, let me focus on the next quarter and maybe the quarter after that. The North America land market is changing pretty rapidly. So how this will play up over the full course of 2019, I think it\u2019s still a bit early to say, but let\u2019s talk first about Q4. So, it is evident that the rapid softening we have seen both in frac activity and pricing over the I would say second half of the third quarter is continuing more or less with the same pace in Q4 and this is obviously representing challenges in terms of white spaces in the frac calendar. In addition to this which sort of further aggravates the situation is that several of our key customers have decided that they are going to lay down all their frac fleets from about middle of November and up until middle of January, which again is a fairly significant challenge in terms of how do you approach the cost base at that stage. So, what we have decided for the course of Q4 is to actively try to reduce the variable part of our cost base, but we aren\u2019t going to do any significant adjustments to the structure, because what we see in the outlook for hydraulic fracs is that there is going to be a couple of quarters where there will be lower activity, but this is more of a pause than I would say a long-term structural issue. Whether this is Q4, Q1 or it lingers into Q2 I think is to be seen, but we will do what we can to manage the variable cost, but we aren\u2019t going to take any significant actions or charges or anything like that when it comes to our structural setup in the market. We are committed to this market and we have a very good position, both in the frac services and also, as Patrick alluded to, on the vertical integration through the entire sand value chain. So, you are going to have to absorb some of the headwinds from the costs that we choose not to do anything with in the next couple of quarters, but beyond that, we are going to continue to leverage our strong position in the market following that.","Kurt Hallead","That\u2019s great. And then I have a follow-up for you then in that context. Do you think that over the course of the next few quarters that the momentum that you have in the international market will be enough to offset the weakness in North America?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, let\u2019s be specific on Q4 to take that first. I mean, if you look at international markets in Q4, we expect flattish revenues. There is a few moving parts on that, that leads to it. There is no change to our outlook on the international market and the momentum we have seen in the past couple of quarters we expect to continue into 2019 and we are still very confident about the north of 10% revenue growth for our business internationally in 2019. But for Q4, we do see sequential growth in EMEA, but this is going to be offset by the normal winter slowdown in Russia and the North Sea and Latin America is going to be flat and we don\u2019t see any significant year end sales this year, mainly because I don\u2019t think our customers have budgeted for that. So, international, both on revenue and earnings, we see as relatively flat with Q3. Now, based on what I just said on North America land, our earnings from North America land and our revenue will be down in Q4, so EPS sequentially is going to come down, I think how much, I am not going to give a specific number; I think it\u2019s going to be a function of how severe the shutdowns are going to be in November and December, but in a normalized kind of outlook for going into next year, I would still believe that the strength of the international going forward beyond Q4 should outweigh any further challenges that we have in North America land.","Kurt Hallead","That\u2019s great color. Thanks, Paal. Appreciate it.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we will go to the line of Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jud Bailey","Thank you. Good morning.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Jud Bailey","Paal, I wonder if I could just follow-up on one of your comments from the prior question on international growth for next year, still confident in 10% plus growth. Could you maybe give us some insight as to what you are seeing maybe the difference in what you are seeing from your IOC customers versus NOCs and maybe from a regional standpoint, how you kind of see any difference in growth between kind of those customers and market segments?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. So like I said, we are still very much committed and clear on double-digit revenue growth internationally for us next year. Looking at it from a customer base standpoint, the growth will be driven by the NOCs and the international independents and I would say less so at least from where we stand and what we can see today from the IOCs. I do expect at some stage that the IOCs will potentially open up a bit more in terms of their investment levels as well, but at present, next year\u2019s growth, the way we have it on the board is going to be driven more by the NOCs and the international independents. And if I look at where the growth will come from percentage wise, we still see the areas that have been the most compressed since 2014 that is going to have the highest percentage growth and that\u2019s still Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, still expect to see solid growth in the other areas, but North Sea, Russia and the Middle East will probably be lower in percentage growth, but overall, double-digit revenue growth for us. We are still quite confident with it.","Jud Bailey","Okay, great. Thank you for that. And my follow-up is, is maybe if you could give us a little more color on your thoughts on the offshore market kind of broadly. You mentioned in your comments and Patrick did as well on some of the positive things we are seeing offshore both with Cameron and other parts of the business. Maybe if you can maybe talk a little bit about what you are seeing in terms of maybe deepwater versus shallow and just some more general market color there would be great?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. So, if you look at the offshore market, I think what\u2019s going to come back first is still going to be shallow. And I think we are starting to see movement on shallow water both drilling activity as well as on rig rates, and obviously, rig rates for us are key, because our differentiated technology increases in value proportionally to the increases in the drilling rates, right. So, this is a very good indicator for us both in terms of effective pricing as well as activities. But as Patrick alluded to offshore, we see starting good signs of higher drilling activity in particular on shallow water, but it\u2019s actually there is a little bit of movement on deepwater as well. We expect in 2018 deepwater drilling activity to be up about 8% versus 2017 obviously from a low base, but I think it\u2019s moving in the right direction and we expect this trend to continue into 2019. So, drilling, we are already starting to see some movement and from the subsea or SPF standpoint also increasing amounts of tiebacks and more activity coming into the subsea arena. So, we are quite focused and we are quite upbeat about what\u2019s happening in subsea at this stage.","Jud Bailey","Okay, great. I appreciate the color. Thanks, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sean Meakim","Thank you. Good morning.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Sean Meakim","So, on the international cycle, just we talk a lot about capacity getting tight here by year end and thinking about a little more elaboration around which product service lines and\/or geomarkets are already fairly tight and which do you think you will still have some more slack into next year, just thinking about that progression and the consistency which you think you will see pricing power come to fruition next year?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. In terms of product lines, I would say where we are. We don\u2019t have a lot of spare capacity in any of them, but it won\u2019t that we will I think be out of capacity first, it\u2019s going to be everything related to drilling and broadening that, the other product lines that we have as part of our lump-sum turnkey projects as well, so that includes part of our services, part of wireline, part of testing, which are all contributing to these type of projects. So, a pretty broad-based drive on our capacity we have seen in the past couple of quarters and that\u2019s why there is no one I would say product line that stands out, maybe drilling and measurements and their high-end technologies given the fact that we have a strong pull on that internationally, but also in North America land. So if anything, I would say high-end technologies from drilling and measurements is probably the one that is in the highest demand, but I would say it has been a pretty good pull on our broad-based capacity for most of the product lines related to well site activity. As to where the growth is coming from, it\u2019s back to what I said earlier. The highest percentage growth we have seen in the most compressed area, Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia, we have over the past 12 months or so, steadily redeployed capacity to make sure we have an ideal setup of capacity where the growth is going to come, but in terms of pricing, it is probably likely to say that Latin America, sub-Sahara and Asia is where we would get pricing maybe stronger than in the other regions given the stability of activity we have had over the past couple of years.","Sean Meakim","Got it. Thank you for that. That\u2019s very helpful. And then on Cameron, I was curious if we could get a little more update on how the customer uptake has been to the enhanced JV with Subsea 7? I am just curious if the Katmai award from Fieldwood, if that was at all influenced by some of the changes there or maybe that project was already a bit far along. I was looking to see your thoughts on how that enhanced relationship is progressing with customers?","Paal Kibsgaard","Patrick, you want to take that?","Patrick Schorn","Yes, just I will make some general comments around the JV, but also around Cameron. Clearly, with the majority of the work that we do today around feed and the comment that Paal was making that quite a bit of it is actually related to tiebacks, there is a tremendous amount of engineering work being done that benefits from the cooperation that we have in the JV. So, there is clearly value there that we are very pleased to see. I will refrain from making specific comments on whatever contracts they are working on, but we are quite happy with the type of cooperation and the action that we are seeing in that relationship. Just to give you maybe a bit of an idea of what\u2019s happening with the rest of Cameron, so the book-to-bill ratio was over 1 for the full Cameron in Q3 and actually, it was well over 1 for service drilling and V&M for the fourth consecutive quarter. Of course, booking orders for OneSubsea were flat and the total revenue of OneSubsea is actually down 3% year-on-year. Total Cameron revenue flat sequentially and flat year-on-year, but clearly, the long-cycle businesses are down 5%, but seeing what the short-cycle businesses are doing, it\u2019s up 12% and this is mainly driven by North America land. On the margin side, Cameron is down 140 basis points sequentially and down 350 basis points year-on-year, but noteworthy is that Q3 short-cycle business margins are greater than the long-cycle business margins for the first time in this cycle. So clearly, there are some good things happening there, maybe not in the traditional part of the OneSubsea yet, but clearly the other businesses are picking up as we go. I will leave it at that.","Sean Meakim","Fair enough. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Next, we have a question from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons. Please go ahead.","Bill Herbert","Good morning. Paal, thanks for the color on Q4. I am just curious with regard to Q1, can you comment, I mean typically we see sequential weakness and seasonally less internationally, do you think that\u2019s inline with historical norms at this stage or is it a little bit less threatening given the absence of product sales for Q4?","Paal Kibsgaard","To be honest with you Bill, we don\u2019t \u2013 you don\u2019t have a lot of visibility as of yet on Q1 in terms of those type of details. But I would agree with your kind of high level analysis that with less, yes year on product sales, the sequential impact Q4 to Q1 should be somewhat bumping. That I would agree with. But we have \u2013 we always had a view on next year, we have high level view of how the market is shaping up. We have been run into kind of the detail analysis of Q4 \u2013 sorry Q1. We will do that during the course of the coming quarter. But I agree with you that the absence of year-end sales should ideally dampen some of the sequential drops that we typically see in Q1.","Bill Herbert","Okay. And Simon a question for you with regard to cash flow and cash balances. Cash flow was much incurred in Q3 with your cash balances, keep leaning lower and so I guess the question is the required amount of cash on hand to run the business and what do you expect the cash outflow to be for Eurasia when that happens?","Simon Ayat","So as you know that Q3 was the pretty good performance cash wise. We typically see that kind of a performance during the second half that should continue into Q4 actually. The cash outflow for Eurasia we already as you know this has been long presence, so this plant that Eurasia is going to come with it\u2019s own cash flow and it\u2019s on strong EBITDA actually. So we are \u2013 we will fund this through additional borrowing. The cash on hand we have today is still 0.9 and we continued to be at base level and this was the comfort level I like to keep or we like to keep for the company. So as I said before for Eurasia we will fund it when it gets approved through more borrowing and we will see how the final transaction format and structure will be at that time. But just worth noting that the cash generation in the second half will be like every year, stronger than the first half and we should be back on target by the end of the year.","Bill Herbert","Alright. So you want to quantify it\u2019s going markedly lower from current levels?","Paal Kibsgaard","Sorry, it\u2019s a bit difficult to hear you, can you repeat question?","Bill Herbert","Sorry you don\u2019t see cash balances going markedly lower from current levels?","Simon Ayat","Well, I am not ready. I mean our Q4 cash outlays are already planned and the cash generation, we don\u2019t see a drop right now.","Bill Herbert","Okay. Thanks very much.","Simon Ayat","Thank you.","Operator","Next we have a question from James Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","James Wicklund","Good morning guys. Labor, I noticed that your severance charges this quarter were up from Q2 and Q1 and so I am curious to know where those severance charges here are and in contrast of against what we are hearing about the tightness of labor onshore U.S. was some people expecting labor inflation of 10% to 15% in 2019, can you talk a little bit about your workforce and your personnel where these severance charges are, why they keep ramping up, when do they peak and what do you say for in U.S. labor inflation?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, alright. So the outlay we had on severance in Q2 is basically the implementation of the reductions we did earlier this year associated with the lost step and the change of the organization. So this is not something new. In certain jurisdictions, there is a bit of time needed from the notification of the individuals we have to let go and feel that is implemented. And just reflecting the cash payments or that charge that we took earlier this year associated with that organization. So, beyond that, there is no continuous charges or outlays we have on severance, it is all linked to that one bigger thing we did earlier this year with a bit of lingering in the implementation due to local labor laws.","James Wicklund","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And onshore U.S. expectations?","Paal Kibsgaard","Onshore U.S., it is a tight market obviously for the coming quarter or two. On the frac side, there is lower activity in which case some of the crews that we have operating today we will need to temporarily lay down and the way we do that, we look at these things individually whether we have to lay people off or we can try to furlough or try to bridge it in other ways with respect to the other businesses we have in U.S. land. So, this is what our operating people are looking at on a daily basis to try to minimize the impact on our individual employees. And at the same time, I would say maximizing our ability to ramp back up quickly again both in time and in terms of quality. So, it\u2019s a balancing act and this is just the nature of the very dynamic U.S. land market and that\u2019s something we are used to dealing with and we are dealing with as best we can. But, you are right directionally, that it\u2019s a tight labor market in U.S. land and actually the only thing that\u2019s impacted really in terms of both activity and pricing at this stage is frac. The drilling business and our lift business is more or less unaffected by the softening or these off-take constraints. It\u2019s the frac that is the main driver. So, we are going to be managing this, Jim, as best we can and it\u2019s just another curveball that we need to deal with and that\u2019s what we do for a living.","James Wicklund","My follow-up if I could, you noticed Latin America was up well in Q3 and then you commented that it will probably be flat in Q4. On Q2, you talked about how Latin America and other places would have to recover in \u201819 to get the total global international growth we expect. Can you talk about your expectations for Latin America in \u201819 as we sit here today? And before we get cutoff, I want to thank you for helping reestablish, resetting the bar for expectations going forward, so investors can have a better idea of what we can earn in this business if the world in, so, thank you on that. But, Latin America, what\u2019s your outlook for \u201819?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, thanks for that, Jim. Latin America for next year will be solid. I think like I said earlier, Latin America, sub-Sahara and Asia are the ones that we still have seen the largest revenue compression. There has actually been a couple of quarters now with quite decent sequential growth in Latin America. Due to mix and just various ways things are panning out, it\u2019s going to be flattish in Q4, but it doesn\u2019t change our view for \u201819. I think we are looking at solid year-over-year growth again in Latin America in 2019.","James Wicklund","Excellent. Thank you guys very much.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Chase Mulvehill","Hey, good morning. Paal, I guess a question about your U.S. customers and their outlook for 2019, have you had any discussions about 2019 yet with the U.S. customers? And I realized in the near-term, you have got the Permian bottlenecks, but are you starting to see kind of accelerated activity in other basins outside the Permian yet?","Paal Kibsgaard","No, we have not seen any major shift in the activity projections for the other basins. So, I think that\u2019s going to be continuing along the path that we already had established whether this is the Northeast Bakken, Haynesville or Eagle Ford. So, no real change to that. And I think the interactions we have with customers around the Permian is that there is still a very positive outlook. The growth we have seen production wise over the past couple of years was almost bound at some stage to kind of hit the infrastructure constraints and I think the industry there is very active in de-bottlenecking both the infrastructure when it comes to pricing, but it\u2019s a lot of other challenges that we have as an industry in the Permian region from all sorts of infrastructure, which we are obviously participating in those discussions. So, although there is going to be a couple of quarters with the challenges there, I think the overall customer sentiment on the Permian is quite upbeat and we are also committed to them and to the activity in the region, right. But we are just going to have to manage now the next couple of quarters. And I think there are three dimensions of infrastructure challenges. It\u2019s oil or crude, which I think will be addressed the first, but there is also challenges around gas off-take and NGLs, which also is going to have to be addressed right and the industry is working on all three aspects.","Chase Mulvehill","That\u2019s very helpful. Appreciate the color. The follow-up, you talked about U.S. shale production and the challenges around that that you are starting to see. These challenges \u2013 is this something that can be solved through technology or is this just reservoir challenges that we have to deal with?","Paal Kibsgaard","No. I think it can absolutely be solved through technology. A lot of this has to do with the conformity of the frac to make sure that we frac every cluster that we perforate and we have diverse technologies that we have been promoting to the market for several years with some off-take, but I think this is likely to accelerate and it\u2019s also about how you ensure that your frac stays within the allocated rough volume that you have for the well, which is more of a far-field conformance that you are looking for and we have technologies in terms of how we design the frac fluid to address that too. So, all of these things I believe are addressable, but it requires a bit more of a reservoir focus on how the wells are drilled, how the wells are fracked, and we need a little bit more data to make sure that we do the right things here. But the measurements are available, the analysis and interpretation of the measurements are available and the remedies that we need to do to the frac fluids are also available. It\u2019s just a matter of adopting these technologies. We have them all ready to go.","Chase Mulvehill","Awesome. I will turn it back over. Thanks, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","And our last question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Anderson","Hey, good morning. Paal, I was wondering if you can just kind of walk us through some of the LSTK projects and how they are ramping up in the Middle East. Do you think by the year end of this year that you will get all of those costs absorbed \u2013 all startup costs absorbed and as we progress kind of the next couple of years of these projects, how should we think about kind of revenue and margin? Should revenue be largely flattish the next few years with margins continuing to pickup? I was just wondering if you just kind of help us walk through how to think about these projects as they move through?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. I mean, we have integrated drilling projects, of which LSTK is one of the business models of it. We have project of this ramping up in many parts of the world. You rightfully allude to the Middle East, where a lot of them are happening. We have these types of projects in Saudi Arabia, in the Emirates, Iraq, India we will be probably starting up soon in Kuwait. So, there is a lot of activity along this business model, which we like, because we are entirely in charge of our own destiny. So if we drill better, if we outperform what the norm is in the market, we benefit our customer and at the same time, we are able to drive our margins up. So, to your questions about the ramp, it\u2019s been a big ramp for us this year, which we are happy to take going one way, because it means we won a lot of work, but at the same time, it impacts the incremental margins and the cost base, but I would say that by the end of this year, these projects should be fully mobilized, the cost should be absorbed and we should have a very, very good platform for growth in all these areas as we go into 2019. So, I would expect 2019 for sure to be up in terms of IDS or integrated drilling services revenues and the margins should start to come up as well. We have both the benefit of less mobilization cost, but also as we get quickly off the learning curve on these projects, that again is going to further give us tailwinds on margins. So, I think you will see very strong growth for our integrated drilling business in 2019 and we expect that to continue into 2020 with a steady improvement in margins as we go along.","David Anderson","Paal kind of a separate subject turning gears to the North America, I was wondering if you could just talk, expand a little bit more about your strategy regarding sand and proppant in the U.S. land market. My understanding is you acquired another Permian sand mine during the quarter? And then you talked about third-party sales during the quarter. Can you just kind of talk about, I mean, I would assume a big part of this is to ensure your supply chain for kind of maximizing utilization on your pressure pumping, but what else is this for? Is this also a strategy to kind of add more revenue in from North America markets? Can you just kind of expand a little bit on kind of how last mile solutions might fit into this? I know you have some of that, but is that something you think you need to expand out as well just kind of your overall strategy regarding sand in North America, please?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s a good question, Dave. So, we started on this about 3 years ago in terms of investments. And our view at the time was that to further improve full cycle returns in this market, we wanted to have part of our sand value chain internally sourced. The main reason for that is that in the up-cycle, there is always a massive inflation in both the sand cost at the gates of the mine, rail, transloading, and trucking. So we decided at the starting point that we wanted to internalize part of this, because that would significantly reduce our cost base in the upturn and these things are easily mothballed in the downturn as well. So, if we chose to actually buy it off the market entirely in the downturn, where certain players are willing to sell it probably below cost, that would be one contributor to driving full cycle margins. Now, since then we have seen an emerging trend from our customers, who have also seen that there is a lot of inflation in this part of the value chain to the point that are starting to break at the way they bid the frac work up into individual products as well as services. This has always been integrated in the past, where the frac company is the one that basically handles the supply chain for sand. But at an increasing pace, we see a separation of sand and service in terms of how the work is bid out. So, in this process, we have stepped up a bit further, our investments into the value chain to the point that we are now pretty much self-sufficient. On sand, we have a pretty good fleet when it comes to last mile and we have also bought mines which are fairly closely associated with where we do most of our activity. So, we have a couple of mines in West Texas, in particular, which is very, very key for our operations there. So, what started off to kind of drive full cycle margin has now kind of played into our favor into a major industry trend, which is the separation of sand and services in the frac market. So, we have done this through organic investments. I think we have made some very good deals in the process. We don\u2019t have anymore sand mines that we are looking to buy at this stage. We are where we need to be. So the vertical integration is done and we see now the opportunity, like I said, obviously, first of all to supply our OneStim frac business with very competitive costs for sand, but at the same time, there is now a flurry of individual sand bids which we can also participate in using the investments and the capacity that we have already sunk in. But we have no plans on investing further into this. We have done the investments. We have done them I think at the right time. And we kind of saw that industry trend coming and that\u2019s what we are now benefiting from.","David Anderson","Great. Thanks, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you very much.

Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2016 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from New York following the Schlumberger Limited Board Meeting.","Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Rowe, President, Cameron Group. Scott will join the earnings call through the fourth quarter of this year to provide an update on the Cameron Group business, integration and synergies.","Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon, Scott and Paal.

We welcome your questions after the prepared statements.","I'll now turn the call over to Simon.","Simon Ayat","Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call.","Third quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.25. This represents an increase of $0.02 sequentially and a decrease of $0.53 when compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter we recorded $237 million of pretax merger and integration charges, associated with the acquisition of Cameron. This consisted of $149 million non-cash inventory purchase accounting item that will not recur. The balance relates to transaction costs as well as a dedicated integration team and other costs to achieve synergies.","We will continue to incur merger and integration charges for the rest of 2016 and into 2017. Our third quarter revenue of $7 billion decreased 2% sequentially. This decrease was entirely driven by reduced activity in the Cameron Group due to its declining backlog. Excluding the impact of Cameron Group, third quarter revenue actually increased 1% sequentially.","Pretax operating margins increased 119 basis points sequentially to 11.6%. Margins increased sequentially in each group except for Cameron. These increases reflect the benefits from cost reduction initiatives as well as the effects of last quarter's itemized asset write-downs, which contributed to approximately 50% of the reduction in depreciation.","Operational highlights by product group were as follows; third quarter reservoir characterization revenue of $1.7 billion increased 5% sequentially, while margin increased 292 basis points to 19.1%. The revenue growth was primarily driven by increased testing services and WesternGeco activities.","Margins improved sequentially across all reservoir characterization technologies, but most noticeably in wireline and testing services. Drilling group revenue of $2 billion was essentially flat sequentially, while margins increased by 241 basis points.","The margin expansion was largely due to the benefit of cost initiatives and reduced losses in Venezuela due to further alignment of our resources in the market to match the reduced level of activity.","Production group revenue of $2.1 billion was also essentially flat sequentially while margin improved 41 basis points, largely due to strong SPM activity. Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 12% sequentially. Despite the 12% reduction in revenue, pretax operating margin only declined 34 basis points to 16%.","The revenue decline was driven by the decrease in backlog that has significantly impacted the drilling group line. However, strong project execution and OneSubsea combined was cost control initiatives across the Group limited the margin decline.","Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 16% in the third quarter, essentially the same as Q2. Gounf forward, our tax rate will be driven by the overall geographic mix of earnings.","During the third quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of cash flow from operations. During the first three quarters of 2016, we have generated $4.2 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $117 million during the third quarter and paying $800 million of severance and one one-off Cameron related transaction payments during the first nine months of the year.","Our net debt increased $122 million during the quarter to $10.2 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $11.1 billion. During the quarter we spend $156 million to repurchase two million shares at an average price of $77. On a year-to-date basis, we had spend $662 million to repurchase 9.5 million shares at an average price of $69.64 per share.","Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included approximately $400 million on CapEx, $140 million on SPM investments, $160 million of multi-client and $700 million of dividend payments.","Our CapEx on a year-to-date basis was $1.4 billion, which includes two quarter of Cameron. CapEx for the full year of 2016 is now expected to be approximately $2 billion. These amounts do not include SPM or multi-client.","And now I'll turn the conference call over to Scott.","Robert Scott Rowe","Hello everyone. I am pleased to provide an update on the progress of the Cameron Group, now they were six months into the combination with Schlumberger. Cameron continued to have good operating results in the third quarter, despite the challenges in the global marketplace and the contraction of our backlog driven by this prolonged downturn.","In Q3, our revenue reduced by 12% sequentially to $1.3 billion. Despite this drop, we were able to successfully hold operating margins at 16% which is 19% decremental of a nearly all time high margin performance in the second quarter of this year.","The higher margins are a result of relentless cost reductions combined with excellent project execution in our longer cycle businesses. We've now experienced seven straight quarters of reduced activity and pricing pressure in the marketplace and Cameron shorter cycle service and balance of measurement businesses have experienced a full effect of reduced activity, spending cuts and pricing pressure, but are now positioned to rebound with any incremental activity.","Despite the duration of the downturn, these two businesses continue to be profitable and have strong cash flow as we've managed our cost structure and working capital well throughout the cycle. Typical lead times in these businesses range from three weeks to nine months and we expect to see revenue flattening future quarters and begin to grow again in mid 2017 as onshore activity picks up around the world.","In our longer cycle businesses, OneSubsea Drilling Systems, we've been extremely successful in expanding margins throughout the cycle. OneSubsea and drilling remain accretive to the overall margins of the Cameron Group. In fact OneSubsea had record profitability at 23.5% this quarter. The profitability improvements and the market share gains over the last two years validate the vision we had when we created OneSubsea.","The drilling at OneSubsea teams have done an excellent job improving our project delivery processes, driving cost out of projects and products and capitalizing on our installed base by expanding our service and aftermarket offering. Going forward these improvements will be partly offset by extremely competitive pricing and lower volumes.","These two businesses are now entering a period of revenue decline as our backlog has fallen for seven straight quarters. We are now entering the base of the downturn that the other Schlumberger businesses have experienced over the past 18 months.","On a brighter note, our book-to-bill ratio for these two businesses was 0.8 in the third quarter, which was highest ratio we have seen since the downturn began. This gives us visibility to revenue growth in 2018. The drilling systems business will contract the most as new equipment orders for floating and jack-up rates are nearly non-existent and our focus has now shifted to land rigs and capitalizing on our market-leading installed base of pressure control equipment.","Before I transition to the integration, I want to spend a minute on how we're positioning OneSubsea. We now have eight paid studies and we're working on 30 customer engagements on our OneSubsea and Subsea 7 alliance. I fully expect to win a small award that utilizes OneSubsea's equipment and Subsea 7 installation capability before the year is over.","We see the market as an area of growth in the deepwater sector. Operators are looking to spend significantly less and drive higher returns by capitalizing on existing host facilities. OneSubsea is uniquely positioned with our standardized Subsea Tree, our single well boosting system, our unified control system and our partnership with Subsea 7 to capitalize on this growth opportunity.","We also have the capability to integrate this further with the deepwater drilling and production teams at Schlumberger to provide further turnkey solutions to operators who are looking to tie back these assets.","The success of the integration of Cameron into Schlumberger continues to exceed our expectations. I would like to confirm that the transaction is again accretive in the third quarter as well as confirm that we will achieve the $300 million synergy target in the first year of the combination.","In the third quarter we booked $139 million of synergy-related work, which landed in every business segment in the Cameron Group. One notable award in the quarter was an integrated project for Chevron in Thailand that consisted of surface wellheads and trees, wireline logging services, M-I SWACO drilling fluids and services as well as the supply of barite.","This is a great example of subsurface and service integration across three different Schlumberger groups. While there is still more cost savings to be had, our integration will shift focus to driving revenue synergies and capitalizing on the vast geographic network of Schlumberger.","We see significant growth opportunities for Cameron in the Middle East, Russia, Latin America and India where Cameron can leverage the substantial presence and relationships that Schlumberger has in these geographies.","In summary, I could not be more pleased with how our group is performing in the down cycle and how we're capitalizing on the opportunities that the combination of Schlumberger and Cameron has created. I'll now turn it over to Bob.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Scott and good morning, everyone. After seven quarters of unprecedented activity decline, the business environment stabilized as expected in the third quarter, confirming that we have indeed reached the bottom of the cycle.","Our third-quarter revenue still decreased 2% sequentially, but this was largely driven by the anticipated reduction in activity at Cameron, as the product backlog continued to decline. Excluding Cameron, revenue increased 1% sequentially, driven by higher activity in North America land, Middle East, Russia and Australia.","Since the start of this downturn and added deepening to uncharted territory, our entire management team has worked relentlessly to protect the financial strength of the company. This includes carefully navigating the commercial landscape by balancing pricing concessions and market share and also by proactively removing a staggering $6 billion of quarterly costs through headcount reductions internal efficiency improvements and strong supply chain management.","This has enabled us to deliver unmatched financial results by maintaining pretax operating margins well above 10% and delivering sufficient free cash flow to cover a range of strategic CapEx investments as well as our ongoing dividend commitments.","We continue to carry forward a strong financial focus as seen in our third quarter results where we delivered 19% decremental margins in the Cameron Group and incremental margins north of 65% for the other three groups combined, excluding any tailwind from previous impairment charges.","These results which represents a small step on our path towards first restoring and subsequently exceeding our pre-downturn earnings per share and financial returns are mostly driven by internal cost and efficiency improvements, with so far only a minor impact from price increases and high grading of our contract portfolio.","Going forward is critical for us to recover the large pricing concessions we have made over the past two years to allow us to restore investment levels in technology innovation, system integration and operational quality and efficiency, which are all key enablers of our customer's project performance.","As indicated in July, we have during this quarter started pricing recovery discussions with a large part of our global customer base, while there is a general understanding from our customers that pricing will have to increase, there were no material movements during the quarter, but with the recent increase in oil prices, the basis for these discussions has now strengthened.","Looking forward to the activity recovery phase, we will only allocate investments, operating capacity and expertise to contracts and basins that meet our financial return expectations, in the same way our customers allocate capital to projects in their portfolios.","Currently a noticeable part of our contracts do not meet these financial return criteria and this is our starting point for reestablishing sustainable customer relationships that will warrant allocation of our capital capacity and expertise.","In addition to our focus on pricing recovery, we will in the coming quarters also aim to restore proper payment schedules from our customers in line with the terms and conditions in our contracts to address the payment delays we today are seeing from many customers around the world.","Still in spite of these payment delays, free cash flow generation in the third quarter remained solid at $700 million as inventory and CapEx investments was again tightly managed. Next I'll review the third quarter trends from our geographical operations and I will focus my comments on the Characterization Drilling $ Production Groups as Scott has already covered the performance of the Cameron Group.","In North America, revenue for the Characterization Drilling & Production Groups increased 3% sequentially as solid growth on land was largely offset by a further revenue reduction in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and Eastern Canada impacting all product groups. The strong growth on land was driven by the U.S. with acute rig count increased significantly and with more than half of the rigs being added in the Permian Basin.","The increased drilling activity is reflected in our drilling and measurements pipeline, which posted 31% revenue growth in U.S. land compared to the second quarter. At this stage we're seeing a growing trend in U.S. land to what's even longer horizontal laterals or super laterals aiming at further increasing reservoir contacts.","One example of this is a well we drilled for Eclipse Resources with a because purchase resources with a record lateral length of 18,500 feet using our industry-leading PowerDrive vorteX rotary steerable system. This emerging trend has already created a significant increase in the uptake of our high-end drilling technologies and has also provided our drilling group with a clear path towards profitability on land.","We've therefore shifted focus from maintaining presence to now gaining market share for our drilling business in North America land.","In the hydraulic fracturing market, the stage count increased by 17% sequentially, driven by higher activity and also by customers now actively depleting their duct well inventory. Still the fracturing market continues to be completely commoditized and significantly oversupplied with a large number of very hungry players.","In addition, the significant increase in sand volume pumper stage is already starting to create inflation on both product and distribution costs, which will further obstruct and delay the hydraulic fracturing industry's path towards restoring profitability.","Today the North America fracturing business continues to be highly dilutive to our financial performance and this combined with a short term market outlook means that we have not yet shifted focus towards gaining market share. Instead we continue to maintain our market presence while further concentrating activity around our core operating areas.","Still we continue to monitor the fracturing market closely and we're ready to deploy our significant stacked capacity on short notice, but only when the market environment can support positive contributions.","While this trend is very encouraging, I would like to stress that these new contract models are only an addition to our offering and that we will continue to actively pursue traditional models for customers who prefers this type of engagement. As we now look to further capitalize on these emerging trends in the international market, we have two major advantages.","First, our unmatched scale in terms of people, equipment and infrastructure, which allow us to quickly adjust to the increasing technical complexity and additional demand from our customers, while ensuring safe and consistent quality in our operations and second by having been present in all parts of the world for the past 80 to 90 years, we have established deep industry relationships and unprecedented local credibility, which makes us an natural partner to explore new contract models and translate these into successful business relationships.","With that, let's take a closer look at the trends we're seeing in the three international operating areas. In Latin America, the combined revenue for the Characterization Drilling & Production Groups declined by 5% sequentially due to continued reductions in EMP spend and activity throughout the regions.","However the two year activity slide was clearly slowing during the quarter and we believe we have now reached the bottom of the cycle also in Latin America. The sequential revenue drop came entirely from the drilling and production groups while the Characterization group posted a 2% increase, driven by solid multi-client seismic sales in Mexico.","Here WesternGeco our 80,000 square kilometers of marine surveys in the prime deep water acreage that will be included in the upcoming bid rounds was the first taking place December 5 of this year. In Mexico, our drilling activity is also expected to pick up in early parts of 2017, driven by both PAMAX and the successful players from the shallow water big grounds that has already taken place.","In Ecuador, activity remained solid driven by our SPM projects and we continue to progress in line with our fee development plans, both with respect to work scope and production levels.","As for in the regions, activity remained subdued due to severe budget constraints for most customers, however we are seeing early signs of recovery in several countries. In Argentina there is clear optimism amongst the industry players that the new government will take the required steps to further encourage E&P investment in the country as they seek to reduce the oil import dependency, which should have a positive impact on E&P investments in 2017.","In Brazil, Petrobras continues to focus on arresting the decline in the mature Campos Basin and is considering opening up for a new and more commercially aligned business models with the service industry which could include feet per barrel contract.","In Venezuela our operations remained largely shut down on site work we do for the IOC JVs in the Faja. However, we are in discussions with PDVSA on a new contract model, which will include a payment assurance mechanism and we are optimistic that this contract will be finalized in the coming months and that operations could start in Q1.","And in Columbia, with oil prices around $50, activity is expected to increase in the coming quarters at Ecopetrol and several other players are preparing for offshore drilling campaigns in 2017.","Revenue in Europe, CIS, and Africa declined 3% sequentially excluding the Cameron Group while strong sequential growth in Russia and flat activity in the North Sea and North Africa was more than offset by a further reduction in activity throughout sub-Sahara Africa.","The drop in revenue was driven by the drilling and production groups, while the characterization group posted solid sequential growth. A large part of the growth in the characterization group came from Russia as summer season activity peaked both on land and offshore and with revenue growth further supported by a stronger Ruble.","Looking forward to Q4, we expect to see the normal seasonal slowdown in Russia due to winter weather while the outlook for 2017 activity continues to be strong. The North Sea posted sharp sequential revenue following a solid summer season where activity in Norway was particularly strong.","Looking forward to Q4, we expect to see the normal decline in activity as summer projects conclude and winter weather sets in. Still expiration success in Norway and several large project startups indicate stronger 2017 activity in the North Sea.","Revenue in continental Europe was up 19% sequentially on strong integrated project performance and deep water exploration activity in Bulgaria. Higher oil prices will lead to increased production-related activity in this region with a 5% rig count increase expected in Q4, further supported by the restart of offshore activity in the East and Med in the early parts of 2017.","North Africa activity remained stable with strong revenue sequentially, while we expect moderate growth in activity in Q4 partly supported by increased market share from recent tender wins for tracks. The market challenges in sub-Sahara and Africa continued in Q3 with yet another significant drop in activity and with the rig count now down by 75% compared to Q4 2014.","However with this latest drop, we do believe we have reached the bottom of the cycle also in this region and expect modest activity increases in most countries in Q4 with the exception of Angola.","In the Middle East and Asia, Characterization, Drilling and Production Group revenue grew 2% sequentially as strength in the Middle East and Australia was partly offset by continued weakness in Asia. Both the Characterization and Drilling groups posted grow in the third quarter, while production group revenue was slightly down due to a temporary reduction in fracturing activity in the Middle East.","In the GCC, the underlying, drilling and rig-less activity remained strong with solid revenues reported in all countries. In addition to this, we continue to progress on our early production facility project in Kuwait which represents another exciting growth opportunity for us.","In Australia, our revenue increased in the third quarter after seven quarters of decline driven by additional land activity for the drilling group as well as higher offshore exploration activity for the Characterization Group.","While in China, Indonesia and the rest of Southeast Asia, the revenue decline continued in the third quarter and at present, there are no signs of any imminent activity recovery in this region.","Turning now to the oil macro, the supply and demand of crude is now more or less in balance as seen by the flattening global petroleum inventories and the start of consistent growth towards the end of the quarter in particular in North America. In addition, oil demand was again revised upwards in September and is now forecasted to be around 1.2 million barrels per day for both 2016 and 2017.","At the same time global supply is plateauing as non-OPEC production continues to experience significant declines and even offsetting record production levels from OPEC in September. Based on current investment levels, we believe that 2017 non-OPEC production will at best be flat and any production outside from the U.S., Canada and Brazil will be offset by further declines in the rest of the global production base.","Given the projected demand growth, this means that the call on OPEC will increase from the current record production levels, suggesting that the production outside from Nigeria, Libya and Iran may be needed to keep the markets in balance.","All of this means that the period of oversupply and inventory build is over and that market segments should soon change, paving the way for an increase in oil prices and subsequently E&P investments. There is also a case to be made for a more rapid role on the global oil inventories and a more bullish outlook for the oil price in the event of a lower production upside from Libya, Nigeria and Iran OPEC and Russia implementation of production cuts for a steeper decline in non-OPEC production.","In terms of the 2017 E&P investments, details are still limited. However we maintain that a V-shaped recovery is unlikely given the fragile financial state of the industry. Still we do see upsides in 2017 in North America land, the Middle East and Russia and we are making sure, we are optimally placed to capture a large share of this upside and importantly turn this additional activity into positive earnings contributions.","With the unparalleled cost and cash discipline we have established, we are confident in our ability to deliver incremental margins North of 65% and a free cash flow conversion rate above 75%, which going forward will give a significant flexibility to both reinvest in our business as well as thoroughly return cash to our shareholders.","Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","James West","Hey, good morning, Paal. ","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning, James.","James West","Paal, you talked a lot in recent quarters about the need for increased industry collaboration and it looked to me going through the press release that you cited a number of examples, of course ISM projects, but also projects that looked to me that signal more collaboration, is that catching on, on a global basis.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I think we are seeing a growing interest in this. It varies a little bit amongst the different customer groups. But I would say overall, there is a growing trend of a desire to collaborate closer and also to implement more commercially aligned business models, which I alluded to in my prepared remarks. This goes all the way from the basic models linked to either time of production for a well, all the way up to fulfill management around the SPM concept. ","James West","Got you. And then one market where we haven't seen a lot of collaboration historically has been the U.S. land market, but you highlighted I think three or four different, different wins there. Could you talk, I know you talked a little bit about the evolving, super laterals in North America, but could you talk about the collaboration in North America, what you're seeing there and what the next steps are if that collaboration could lead to more technology improvements, technology advancements and use in North America.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes we cited a few of these examples in the press release. So we are seeing -- we are seeing signs of that taking place in North America land as well, but I would say on a percentage basis is obviously a lot lower returns than what we have internationally, but it\u2019s still encouraging to see stronger collaboration, both on the drilling side linked to drilling more complex wells at the super laterals.","As well as on the production and completion side around how we optimize completions using information evaluation and a bit more sophisticated approach to fracing. So we are seeing it happening, but still in fairness it's a fairly small part of the business volume, but these technology opportunities both in the drilling side and on the completion side is really why we are in this market.","We're not in it for the commodity side of it. We believe that ultimately technology will play an even larger role in the North America land markets and we continue to promote these capabilities and this part of our offering because we ultimately believe it's going to bring a lot more value for our customers.","James West","Yes. Thanks Paal.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS. Please go ahead.","Angie Sedita","Thanks. Good morning, guys. ","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Angie Sedita","So Paal as a follow-up to James' question, so the SPM certainly are growing market and important Schlumberger overall. So could you talk a little bit about where you're seeing the investment opportunities and the pipeline of opportunities over the next one to two years? I assume that's growing and are you seeing an increasing number of IOCs that want to partner up with Schlumberger on some of these projects?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, for SPM we are seeing I would say a significantly growing interest across all customer groups. So far in terms of the discussions that are most advanced I would say are generally with the -- with the NOCs and the independence and even start-up companies, but we have -- we've had -- we have had discussions with IOCs on this contract model as well.","But in terms of the opportunity set it is, it is growing and it's very significant. And as I quoted in my prepared remarks, we are today engaged in various stages of discussions in 20 countries around the world covering all the four operating areas.","So while this used to be -- this model used to be contained to a handful of countries, we today see a rapid expansion of the interest and we have obviously staffed up significantly in our SPM product line to make sure that we can pursue all these opportunities, turn them into projects and subsequently execute the projects in line with our plans, but it's a significant growth opportunity and something that we are actively pursuing in all four operating areas.","Angie Sedita","All right, all right, fair enough. And then on the international side, you talked about the price concessions and some of them are oil-based triggers and some time based and so does it happen as you hear a certain oil price or there is time bound concession that initially it moves into play or you have a conversation first with these NOCs and how much of this do you think will actually be returned to demand?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, the whole discussion around pricing, first of all is going to take a little bit of time. We indicated in July that we are firmly putting this on the agenda and we have done so in the third quarter. We've had engagement and discussions with most customers around the world.","I think there is -- there is a general acceptance from the customer base that ultimately prices are going to have to come up. Not a lot of movement as we expected in the third quarter, but I would say, given the increase we've seen in oil prices over the past month or so and the potential trajectory, we could see going forward, I think there is much stronger basis for having these discussions at this stage.","And then we will discussions individually with our customers depending on the contract, the model and the contract situation we have with them. It could be at some states that some of these contracts will be -- will be rebid and if that's so, then we will obviously participate in that.","But I think in many cases there is room to negotiate within the existing contract framework to come into I would say mutually agreeable solution, which will be acceptable both for us and for our customers.","Angie Sedita","All right. Thanks. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thanks Angie.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Please go ahead. ","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning, Ole.","Ole Slorer","Yes morning, morning. So let\u2019s get back to West Texas again, you highlighted that you see growth in Middle East, in Russia and in North America land, Middle East and Russia, you clearly very well associated to that, maybe North America land, not so much.","So you talked about -- so how do you first of all see your positioning and you talked about mobilizing equipment in big ability to drill longer laterals, can you talk a little bit about pricing and tightness and how you get paid for this mobilization.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, what we're mobilizing are drilling tools, which isn't excessively expensive right. So we do that and we also will take some for manufacturing and this is all manufactured in the -- or partly manufactured in the U.S. as well.","So in terms of the reason for mobilizing more equipment into the drilling side is clearly that we have a clear path towards profitability. So given the unique technology offering we have and the technical challenges of drilling these very, very long horizontals we are able to get pricing which is going to give us I think ultimately the returns that we're looking for.","And this is why we are prepared to put more capacity into play on the drilling side or what's going on in West Texas. As I said on the fracturing side, still there is no clear path towards profitability and this is why we are still maintaining presence and basically holding the fort until we believe we can justify putting more capacity into play going forward.","Ole Slorer","Thanks for that. And if we look at 2017, when you've heard out of oil in London companies like Total talked very aggressively about stepping up activity next year, taking advantage of low oilfield services costs others like BP have been very vocal also of getting going, yet you highlight Russia and Middle East areas where these companies I think all these type of companies are typically not all that active.","So does this mean that you have a different view or you don't believe that's kind of the type of IOC will step it up or is that they're coming from a very low base at the end of the year and sequentially will be improving from here but year-over-year be kind of flat. Could you help us a little bit with making sense of some of those statements?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, as I was trying to cover in the fairly detailed description I gave of the international markets, we believe that there is early signs of recovery in most places around the world. If you look at next year for international, we expect solid growth year-over-year in the Middle East and Russia on a full year basis.","But we also see, I would say an uptick in investment and activity in Latin America and in Europe, Africa. The only place where we don't see any signs of recovery at this stage is in Asia. But I would say the uptick in Latin America and Europe, Africa, is more going to be from current Q3 activity levels. It might not be a significant increase on a full-year basis, but I think we have reached bottom in both of those regions, which would warrant higher activity.","So I'm not contradicting what the IOCs are saying and we welcome obviously more activity and higher investments from them. It's just that the main very clear investment increases we are seeing are still going to be in Russia and the Middle East, but our early signs of things picking up from bottom also in the rest of the world excluding Asia.","Ole Slorer","Okay. Thanks for clarifying Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thanks Ole.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Good","Scott Gruber","Yes. Good morning.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Scott Gruber","Question for Scott, you highlighted the Point 8 book to bill, which I believe was for OneSubsea that this foreshadowed growth into 2018. The shorter cycle businesses though at Cameron should be expanding at this point as well at least that forecast.","However, when I look back at a recent investor presentation, case for Cameron revenue in 2018 is actually flat and the midpoint looks like it was down a bit. Has the outlook for Cameron now improved, is there a line of sight to growth in 2018 assuming the short cycle businesses came over the course of 2017.","Robert Scott Rowe","Yes, thanks for the question on Cameron. Just to clarify right, we are in the earnings press release, we're giving the OneSubsea and the drilling bookings and backlog and what you can see there is on the book to bill, the point 8 was meant to be for both drilling systems and OneSubsea. So actually OneSubsea is higher than that and we're just below one on the OneSubsea side.","But on 2018 general guidance for revenue and growth for the Cameron Group it really depends on those short cycle businesses and win activity returns and so there is a path for growth in '18, but it depends on that land business in Vietnam and in the services segment.","We're highly focused on growing in the Middle East. We\u2019re highly focused are growing in Midcontinent there in the United States and if we can see continued rig count increase, then we do have a path for growth.","Now obviously, the drilling business with the backlog numbers there will continue to decline and OneSubsea quite frankly has been relatively flat since the beginning of the deepwater downturn, which started in 2014, and so we will lose a lot of revenue traction on OneSubsea. It will really come from drilling and then the offset is the shorter cycle business growth on the land markets.","Scott Gruber","Got it. And an unrelated follow-up on the expanding opportunity in SPM. There's been a willingness to take on some oil price risk in SPM and link at least certain number of payments to oil price. Paal, can you shed some color on just what percentage of the SPM portfolio as in oil price linkage now and where you would be comfortable taking that percentage over time.","Paal Kibsgaard","Well if you look in our contract structure today, I would say the lion's share of this is basically a fee per barrel, which is obviously the project has a link to the oil price, but our compensation is generally linked to the incremental production times of 60 per barrel.","Now at this stage at the bottom of the cycle, we are in some cases considering a share production times the oil price rather than the fee per barrel the times the entire incremental production. But as based on individual projects, but I would say the portfolio as it stands today is generally fee per barrel not directly exposed oil price, but we are considering some of the -- in some of the cases today to take a bit more oil price risk. If we can make the project work at current oil prices, we are fairly comfortable opening up and balancing the portfolio a bit with a bit more oil price risk.","Scott Gruber","Will it always remain a minority of the book?","Paal Kibsgaard","I would say generally that would be the philosophy, yes.","Scott Gruber","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons. Please go ahead","Bill Herbert","Thank you. Good morning.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning, Bill. ","Bill Herbert","Yes. So SPM, back to SPM, sorry Paal at this stage, do you think SPM investments in 2017 are going to be up over 2016 which has been a fairly big year? ","Paal Kibsgaard","Sorry, I couldn't hear what was going to be up? ","Bill Herbert","SPM, the question is whether your capital investment in SPM in 2017 is going to be up over 2016 which is thus far been a pretty big year?","Paal Kibsgaard","I think it is too early to say. I would say as a starting point, I would say probably not maybe, maybe somewhat in line, but I think it's going to depend on the opportunities that we have in front of us. Obviously there is a broad range of discussions. I think for the right opportunities I'm prepared to invest more into it, but I think we will have to do that on a case by case basis.","Bill Herbert","Okay. And then secondly, at this stage given your outlook for global E&P CapEx, which frankly sales more constructive than I was expecting, which is good, do you think that Schlumberger's revenues in 2017 overall are going to be up?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, it's a bit early to say. We're still in Q3. The absolute E&P investment numbers for next year, I think it's still early to comment on absolute numbers.","Bill Herbert","Yes.","Paal Kibsgaard","I can give you some direction and I think in terms of revenue, see the trends going and what the absolute number is going to be, is going to be more a function of how the numeric of these trends play out, but we do expect on a full year basis, solid year-over-year growth in North America land, Russia and the Middle East. These are fairly predictable plans that we have in place. ","We also expect to see modest growth from the current levels, not necessarily on a full-year basis, but from current levels in Europe, Africa and Latin America and the reason for this is that there are many significant oil producing countries in these two regions, which have a record low investment levels at this stage and we see signs that at least we're going to come off the bottom here. Whether that's going to translate into year-over-year growth, it's too early to say, but at least an increase from where we are today.","And really the only place where we don't see any of these recovery signs as of yet is in Asia. So, all depending on what the various numbers on these three main trends pan out to be. There is a chance that revenue could be up. Obviously, that's what we are hoping for and that's what we're going to work towards and obviously market share and some of the other things that we are working on specifically are on the land rig introduction, around SPM and some of the early production facility work that we do.","We have opportunities I would say to come in with higher revenue in 2017, but I'm not going to commit to this as of yet. I think we need to work out the details of the plans over the coming two, three months and we can give you a further update in January.","Bill Herbert","Okay. Thank you very much.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thanks Bill.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Anderson","Thanks. Hey Paal in your remarks you commented that you have two rigs of the future in the fourth quarter in the U.S. That seems well ahead of schedule, most of its surprised is to be deployed in the U.S. So, here is two question, are you in fact ahead of schedule on this technology and two, can you talk about kind of where what types of feel this is going into, I am a little surprised it was going to be in the U.S. ","Paal Kibsgaard","Well so I would say that generally we are on track with the -- with both the engineering and the manufacturing of the rig of the future. So these two rigs are I would call them pilot versions. They don\u2019t have all the features of the rig of the future, but they have a significant part of it and we are also going to be operating them around the overall software platform of how we want to do rig of the future going forward.","So, they are manufactured in the U.S. and that's why we would like to basically put them out in operation close to home at this stage to make sure that we can get all the support and all the feedback from their operational performance and feed out into both the engineering and manufacturing work that is going on for the I would say the complete version of the rig, which is going to be rolled out and a number of them in 2017, that's already in the plans for them both the CapEx and the manufacturing for next year.","David Anderson","Okay. And then also in your release you talked about the continued free cash flow conversion and your ability to reinvest in the business. Can you expand a bit of what that means? Obviously you're reinvesting here -- you're putting money into the rig of the future. But is there other areas that you're kind of focused on to reinvest here? Is it a product? Is it a geography or is it something else you're talking about?","Paal Kibsgaard","Simon you want to comment.","Simon Ayat","Okay. I \u2018m going to take this question. As we always said that the utilization of cash, the priority would be for the good of the business. As you know we are -- we ended the quarter with about $11 billion of cash on the balance sheet. And today we are very -- our growth of opportunities compared to return of capital to shareholders by given through buybacks.","Our investments, the three elements of the CapEx, which remain to be very well tightly controlled, we are investing today almost 50% what we used to be at the height of the business and SPM and multi-client. So there is no other opportunities other than our inorganic growth it proves to be a viable proposition economically and the future of the business, but right now our priority is the growth of the business and other than that we would return it to shareholders.","David Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead","Great. Hey, good morning. ","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead","Hey, Paal your commentary here in the press release and the results seem to be incrementally positive at least on the reservoir front driven by multi-client, it appears. I know in your prior commentary on the cycle recovery, the reservoir piece of the business would probably lag in growth. Is there a shift underway subtle or otherwise in seismic activity that might push reservoir up a little bit further on the recovery curve?","Paal Kibsgaard","So, I don\u2019t think there is yet a big turnaround I would say in the exploration market or in the seismic market. But I think we have positioned ourselves very well in both of those markets. Whatever work there is I think we are able to generally pick up on the exploration side and I think on seismic, as I again said in July, the performance of WesternGeco in a very, very tough market is quite commendable.","We do quite well on both marine and land and we have been quite opportunistic on the multi-client side to make a significant investment in several basins around the world in particular Mexico, but also Gulf of Mexico and the U.S. part as well as overseas and obviously at this stage, we are able to generate revenue and profits from these investments, which you see very clearly in our results.","So there is no I would say significant market turnaround, but I think it's a strong performance from the exploration related businesses that we have, including seismic and also within the testing services product line, which fits in reservoir characterization, we have won a series of early production facility projects where we have combined the capabilities that we had within the testing services prior with the processing capabilities that Cameron had.","And this is again really strengthening the offering we have in this market and we see that also as a significant growth opportunity within characterization.","Kurt Hallead","That\u2019s great. My follow-up is you said earlier about if I understood it correctly that you were in a position to potentially go over some market share in North America. I wasn't quite clear on the perspective on the international front. So I was just wondering if you just might be able to go through the thought process on the market share dynamics and how you see that opportunity vis-\u00e0-vis pricing and profitability?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I would say in international market we have, I would say actively pursued market share for the past for the past, I would say 12 to 18 months, I think with reasonable success. I think if you look at Characterization Drilling & Production combined, takeaway Cameron, we have pretty solid revenue evolution in all three international operating areas in the third quarter.","And I\u2019m quite pleased to see the progress we have made there. Whenever you start aiming to increase your tend to win rate which we now have been focusing on for a good 18 months or so, it takes a bit of time before that translates into actual revenue, but you're starting to see some impact of that.","Kurt Hallead","The main -- so there is really no main shift internationally. The main thing I was pointing out for North America is that -- on the drilling side, we now have a clear path in U.S. land towards profitability, based on the technology off-take we're seeing linked to these super laterals and as soon as we can turn a profit we are very keen to grow market share and we've basically shifted the playbook from holding the fort to going for market share in drilling in U.S. land, but we have not yet done that for fracing because at this stage it is highly dilutive to our earnings and at this stage also we are see a clear path towards profitability.","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay, that's great clarification. Thanks Paal.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","James Wicklund","Good morning, guys. ","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning Jim.","James Wicklund","Mexico, you've been shooting seismic there coming into this downturn make a change to constitution more quickly than a lot of us have expected, they've been several different grounds and now you talk about there may be some light at the end of that tunnel in '17 that was always a market of fabulous potential in their budget at rival Petrobras is in the past. Can you talk about how you see Mexico evolving over the next year or two please?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yeah I think, I share your view of the potential of the market. And I also think we are pretty much close to the bottom of it right. We have had -- we\u2019ve seen a significant reduction in PEMEX activity over the past couple of years. And while this whole, industry reform has been taking place that reduction has not been I would say compensated by additional investments from the emerging international players.","But as these bid rounds for acreage now has progressed and with the deepwater around coming up, the first deepwater coming up now in December, we see drilling activity picking up in 2017. Again, it might not be a dramatic comeback and we won\u2019t be back to, I would say 2013 levels or 2014 levels anytime soon.","But I think there is a momentum shift coming in Mexico. It is partly linked to the seismic work that we're doing and the related exploration activity with that, but I think also activity linked to the previous rounds that we've seen both in shallow water and on land as well as the basic PEMEX activity should pick up in 2017.","James Wicklund","So more enduring recovery. Okay. Thank you. A follow-up if I could, one of the first comment you made on the call Paal was you're not allocating assets to work that doesn't meet your return hurdles and you said the process has started.","We've seen a number of companies decide not to participate in markets or product lines or with customers where they don't generate an adequate return. Can you talk about a little bit level down in granularity what exactly that means and what we should expect to see in that?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, so first of all, when you're in a cyclical business, you will have to be pragmatic when you are near or at bottom of the cycle. So, which we are and we are basically maintaining our presence, pretty much everywhere in the world at this stage even at bottom and even though we have a number of contracts, which at this stage does not our meet our medium to long-term return criteria.","But what we are saying though is that as we now are starting to come off bottom as oil prices are starting to move upwards, then we will need to have these discussions with the customers, where we have these type of contracts and try to find a way where we can get pricing and terms and conditions and a work scope that will enable us to meet those financial return criteria at the same time, as our customers can also meet theirs.","So I think these are the discussions that now are taking place. This won't be resolved over night, but we are very clear on the fact that if we have to deploy capacity investments and expertise, there has to be return in it and at the bottom, we are willing to compromise. But as we come off bottom, we need to basically restore the return expectations that we have as a company and as our shareholders have in order to drive the business forward.","James Wicklund","Okay. Thank you very much guys.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thanks.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of Sean Meakim from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sean Meakim","Hi, good morning.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Sean Meakim","Thinking about OneSubsea how are you seeing opportunities for larger projects shaping up for next year or do you see it as mostly a Brownfield tieback boosting type of market for 2017?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, let me -- it\u2019s a good question and it's a market that's in a state of change right now, but let me just talk about deepwater in general. It's continued to be challenged and in this quarter we saw five additional rigs get stacked. They are in Q3 and deepwater rig utilization dropped to 55% in the month of September. So you expect 2016 deepwater drilling activity as a whole to be down 33%.","And when you think about that for OneSubsea and Project as we go forward we think this year tree award is significantly under a 100 and when we look at our project list, we're tracking between anywhere between five and eight awards that could happened in 2017 and those would be the larger style awards that we've seen traditionally.","But our focus really now has shifted to the tieback market and we do see a lot of opportunities on that. I mentioned our eight paid studies with Subsea 7 where we're doing a lot of work on the tieback side and what we think there is that, with a standardized Subsea Tree, which is a at a significantly reduced cost a single well boosting system, which we're the only ones right now that have that single well boosting system.","Combined that now with our Unified Control System and the installation from Subsea 7, we think we've got a very economical package to tie back one and two wells in the existing host facility.","So we had a lot of discussions around that and we really it's almost creating a market right now and so we hope that we can give some more excitement and more awards around that as we transition into '17 and then as these big projects kind of progress and move forward, we're offsetting that with this expanded tieback market.","Sean Meakim","Got it. Thank you. I appreciate that. And then just thinking about capital deployment going forward, and the free cash flow profile of the business, is it fair to say that following transformation of the cost reduction, the capital intensity of the core services business should remain below historical levels, you just think about, how you think about the capital deployed for that part of the business stay below D&A next year as well.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, so I think, based on what we are focusing on from the transformation standpoint, we still have a long runway to go in terms of driving asset utilization for the existing asset base and also what we have going in our engineering programs as well to also engineer and manufacture less expensive assets is also a key part of it.","So both utilization and the cost per asset, I think should lead to a light or capital intensity of our business going forward. I think you've seen the signs of it in the past two, three years and we are going to continue to work very hard on further improving on that. ","Sean Meakim","Great, thanks Paal. ","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference.

Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.","Simon Farrant","Thank you. Hello, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited First Quarter 2017 Results Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being hosted from Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting. Joining us on the call today are Paal Kibsgaard, Simon Ayat and Patrick Schorn. We will, as usual, first go through our prepared remarks, after which we\u2019ll open up for questions. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I\u2019d like to remind the participants that some of the statements we\u2019ll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements.","I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our first quarter press release, which is on our website.","With that, I hand the call over to Simon Ayat, who will present the first quarter corporate results and also review the results by group.","Simon Ayat","Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.25. This represent a decrease of $0.02 sequentially and $0.15 when compared to the same quarter last year. During the current quarter, we recorded $0.05 of Cameron merger and integration charges. Our first quarter revenue of $6.9 billion decreased 3% sequentially, largely driven by the Cameron Group as a result of project completions and reduced product sales.","Pretax operating margin only decreased by 42 basis points to 11%. Highlights by product group were as follows. First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 3% sequentially, primarily due to project completions in Testing & Process systems and seasonally lower SIS software and multiclient license sales. These decreases were offset in part by progress on early production facility projects in the Middle East and the improved Wireline revenue in North America.","Margin decreased 170 basis points to 17%, driven by the lower contribution from SIS software and multiclient sales. Drilling Group revenue of $2 billion decreased 1% sequentially, while margins were sequentially flat at 11.5%. Strong activity in North America was offset by lower activity and pricing pressure internationally across the group. Production Group revenue of $2.2 billion decreased 1% sequentially, and margins fell by 78 basis points to 5%. These results were primarily driven by strong pressure pumping activity and the pricing recovery in North America land, which was offset by seasonally lower completion product sales and lower SPM revenue.","The Cameron Group revenue of $1.2 billion decreased 9% sequentially. This decrease was largely driven by OneSubsea as a result of declining project volumes. Reduced product sales in Surface System and the further drop in Drilling System also contributed to the decline. Margins decreased 80 basis points to 13%. Despite the revenue decline, OneSubsea margins still exceeded 20% for the third straight quarter as a result of strong project execution. While the drilling backlog was essentially flat, the OneSubsea backlog increase largely reflected the Mad Dog 2 award. The book-to-bill ratio for our long-cycle businesses increased to 1.1 in the first quarter. This marks the first time these businesses have been above 1 since the fourth quarter of 2013.","Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 15.3% in the first quarter compared to 15.8% in the previous quarter. Looking forward, the ETR will be very sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings between North America and the rest of the world. With the continued recovery in North America, we anticipate that the ETR will increase next quarter and over the course of the year. We generated $656 million of cash flow from operations. This is despite the consumption of working capital that we typically experience during Q1, which is driven by the annual payments associated with employee compensation as well as the payment of $140 million in severance during the quarter. We also continue to experience payment delays from certain customers, primarily in North \u2013 in Latin America.","Our net debt increased $1.3 billion during the quarter to $11.4 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $7.6 billion. During the quarter, we spend $372 million to repurchase 4.7 million shares at an average price of $78.97. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included roughly $380 million on CapEx and the investments of approximately $145 million in SPM projects and $115 million in multiclient. During the quarter, we also made $696 million of dividend payments and $221 million in Borr Drilling. Full year 2017 CapEx, excluding SPM and multiclient investments, is still expected to be approximately $2.2 billion.","And now I will turn the conference over to Patrick.","Patrick Schorn","Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Starting off with North America. Our first quarter revenue increased 6% sequentially as growth in U.S. land and Western Canada was partially offset by further activity reductions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Eastern Canada. As expected, the North America land market continued to strengthen during the first quarter in terms of both activity and pricing, leading us to start full-scale deployment of idle capacity for most product lines.","Revenue growth was led by hydraulic fracturing and drilling services, but also increasingly supported by Artificial Lift, Surface Systems and Valves & Measurements. In spite of our capacity reactivation being heavily back-end loaded as we continue to adhere to our profitable growth strategy, we still generated 16% sequential revenue growth in our hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling services in U.S. land. And even more importantly, we delivered incremental margins of 66% for these services combined in U.S. land, driven by productive customer engagements around pricing recovery and operational efficiency, together with timely resource additions, new technology sales and proactive supply chain management.","In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the first quarter revenue declined again sequentially as the deepwater rig count dropped 15 at the end of March, which represents a reduction of 74% compared to the peak activity level of 2014. In addition to the low drilling activity, we also saw a further sequential drop in seismic multiclient sales, leaving offshore revenues at unprecedented low levels. In parallel with these record low level activity, product and services pricing, as in several recent cases, fall into levels that make it impossible for us to uphold our operating standards and, at the same time, turn a profit in this extremely challenging operating environment. We are therefore in the process of redeploying both service capacity and technical support resources from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to other more viable markets.","Internationally, the first quarter revenue fell 7% sequentially, driven by stronger-than-expected seasonal decline in activity and product sales in particularly in the North Sea, Russia land and China and also by lower sequential activity in key parts of the Middle East. On a positive note, revenues in Latin America were flat sequentially, confirming that this region has indeed reached the bottom of the cycle. The results were driven by solid activity in Brazil, further supported by multiclient seismic sales and strong OneSubsea and Cameron Drilling Systems activity. This was offset by a range of activity challenges impacting our hydraulic fracturing operations in Argentina, which has now been resolved, as well as production constraints imposed on our Shushufindi SPM project in Ecuador.","Revenue in Europe, CIS and Africa decreased 10% sequentially, driven primarily by the completion of a large OneSubsea project, lower Cameron Surface Systems sales, reduced SIS software license sales and a more severe seasonal reduction in drilling-related activity throughout Russia, Kazakhstan and the North Sea. Still, the activity in the Northern parts of ECA is expected to recover in the second quarter, and we maintain a constructive outlook for the year for both Russia and the North Sea. In Africa, revenue was flat sequentially, which clearly indicates that this region has also reached the bottom of the cycle. In North Africa, activity remained stable in Algeria during the first quarter, and we also started preparations for reentering Libya and expect to start a small-scale land operation in the second quarter after having been shut down on land for the past 3 years.","Sub-Sahara Africa revenue was also flat sequentially as early termination of ongoing drilling activity in Angola and Gabon was offset by the start-up of 2 new deepwater projects in Congo and Senegal as well as by strong growth in land activity in Chad, Congo and Ethiopia. In the Middle East and Asia, revenue decreased 7% sequentially, driven by lower product sales from the Cameron Surface and Drilling Systems product lines and also by lower activity and service pricing pressures throughout the Middle East, particularly impacting the Production Group.","In Asia, revenues in China and Australia were lower sequentially due to lower offshore drilling activity and by severe seasonal weather impacting our land operation in both countries. And finally, the first quarter revenue in Malaysia and Indonesia, flat sequentially, confirming that we have reached the bottom of the cycle also here but with no clear signs yet of any significant activity recovery in this region.","With that, I will hand the call over to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Patrick. Following the review of our first quarter results from Simon and Patrick, I will next provide you with an updated business outlook. But before I do that, I would like to say a few words about the Cameron Group as we just passed the 1-year mark since the closing of the transaction. Over the past 12 months, we have successfully implemented the first phase of our integration plan, which included 3 main themes: first, the colocation of 1,700 employees into joint facilities around the world; second, combining Schlumberger and Cameron businesses to deliver enhanced offerings to our customers, such as our new Testing & Process systems product line; and third, bringing together Cameron and Schlumberger technologies, for instance, in hydraulic fracturing and in OneDrill and by launching as many as 32 integrated R&D projects to further expand our integrated technology offering. At the same time, OneSubsea, which is now in its fifth year of existence, has firmly established a leadership position in the subsea market through the pore-to-pipeline approach, as seen by the higher rate of project awards in recent quarters as well as their industry-leading operating margins.","Overall, the entire Cameron integration program has exceeded the ambitious first year of synergy target we set and delivered approximately $400 million in operating income synergies as well as $600 million in new orders. The first quarter results from the Cameron Group were, again, very solid. And I would like to complement the entire Cameron organization and the integration team on a job well done, where they have jointly ensured that the largest transaction Schlumberger has done to date has turned out to be a great success.","Turning next to the business outlook. We maintain our constructive view of the oil market, and we made further inventory growth in the second quarter, driven by the OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts put in place in January.","At present, the region in the world showing clear signs of increased E&P investments in 2017 is North America land, although investment levels in the Middle East and Russia are also expected to remain resilient this year. However, for the rest of the world, which still make up more than 50 million barrels per day of oil production, we are heading towards a third year of significant underinvestment, which increases the likelihood of a medium-term supply deficit as produced reserves are not replaced in sufficient volume.","In particular, the market continues to focus on headline decline numbers that suggest that production is holding up well, while a closer examination of the underlying data clearly shows that the rate of depletion of proved undeveloped reserves is rapidly accelerating in several key non-OPEC countries.","The current level of underinvestments is most visible in exploration, where the record-low investments, including both drilling and seismic, led to a total amount of industry discoveries of less than 5 billion barrels in 2016 versus a produced volume of over 30 billion barrels, dropping the industry-wide reserves-to-replacement ratio to 32%.","Still at present, there is no clear sign of any general increase in exploration spend, with the one exception being Mexico, where we are seeing an increasing interest in the offshore multiclient surveys we have acquired over the past two years.","Looking next at our business outlook by region. The recovery will clearly be led by North America land, where investment levels are expected to increase by 50% in 2017, leading to a strong increase in activity and an overdue correction to service and product pricing.","Through the organic and inorganic investments we had made in our North America land business in recent years, we are very well set up to take a leading position in serving our customers in the coming growth cycle.","In drilling, we have built a market-leading position by expanding our offering through the Smith and M-I SWACO acquisitions and through a broad organic R&D program targeting the North America land market. As drilling complexity continues to increase with even longer laterals, our purpose design technologies are starting to have a significant impact on our customers\u2019 drilling performance. One example of this is the strong uptake of our AxeBlade drillbit, which by itself has demonstrated a record 35% increase in rate of penetration for Matador in the Permian.","Furthermore, our PowerDrive Orbit rotary steerable technology continues to be sold out for a third successive quarter and in an 80-well campaign for Parsley Energy in the Midland and Delaware basins. This technology contributed to a 17% reduction in the average drilling time per well and a 30% reduction in the drilling cost per lateral foot.","Both of these examples show the performance potential new technologies hold in the North America land market and demonstrate the growth opportunities for our drilling offering as we continue to prepare for the introduction of our OneDrill platform in the second half of this year. We are also starting to see strong growth momentum in North America land for our market-leading Artificial Lift offering, where we recently also acquired a 49.9% stake in the HEAL technology from Production Plus Energy Services based in Calgary.","HEAL, which can be used in wells together with our ESP plunger lift and rod lift offering, reduces fluid slugging, depresses form generation, contains solid and separates gas, which altogether improves production and reduces the need for workovers. We are presently at the introduction stage of this exciting new technology, which, over the first 140 installations, have delivered an average production increase of 45%.","Within our hydraulic fracturing and completions offering, we have also made significant investments in recent years, including the development of a fully automated surface delivery system and also by acquiring our own sand mines and the associated vertically integrated distribution system, which will greatly improve our full-cycle returns.","In terms of well productivity, the market offtake of our geoengineered completions continues to grow, and the offering is delivering significant value for our customers, as seen by the 18-well program we recently completed for Lonestar Resources in the Eagle Ford Shale.","Here, we optimize drilling, stimulation and completion plans across the long laterals, supported by our drillbit formation BroadBand Sequence diversion technology. As a result, the wells produced up to 86% more hydrocarbon per 1,000 feet of lateral compared to offset wells in two other fields.","With proppant prices and distribution costs now starting to rapidly increase, we are also expecting to see a recovery in the use of our HiWAY technology, which reduces proppant use by 40% and water use by 25%.","Building on this broad technology platform, the pending OneStim JV with Weatherford will give us the required scale in terms of both hydraulic horsepower and multistage completions technologies to drive efficiency and market penetration in all the unconventional basins in North America land.","At this stage, the regulatory filings have been completed. And as we await the required approvals to close the OneStim transaction, the integration teams are making all the necessary preparations for a successful day 1 of the new company.","Looking next at Latin America. The flat sequential revenue in the first quarter was a long-awaited positive confirmation that this market has indeed reached the bottom of the cycle. Going forward, there are emerging positive signs for our business in the region, including opportunities for new commercial models in Brazil as Petrobras continues its assets divestment program and as a new focus is brought to mature land basins.","In Argentina, new plans to bring stability to natural gas prices should lead to higher investment levels. And we are also excited about our recent agreement with YPF for a joint development in the Vaca Muerta Shale.","In Europe, CIS and Africa, we see strengthening activity in the North Sea, Russia and the Caspian region in the coming quarters as the winter season ends and new projects start up. In Africa, we expect some activity improvement in the North as we start up a small-scale land operation in Libya after being shut down for the past three years. While we see a slow but steady improvement in Sub-Saharan Africa over the coming quarters, driven by a mix of land activity in Chad, Congo and Ethiopia and a limited number of deepwater start-ups in Congo, Guinea and the Ivory Coast.","In the Middle East, activity will continue to be driven by the GCC countries. However, we do not expect significant sequential growth from this region over the coming quarters. While in Asia, we will see the normal seasonal recovery in China. Overall, it\u2019s clear that activity in the international market has reached bottom in all regions. But even though we see positive signs in many countries, we expect only moderate sequential activity growth in the coming quarters.","This slower recovery, lingering pricing pressure, means that we will likely face another challenging year in the international markets while we expect an acceleration of the activity growth towards the back end of 2017 and into 2018.","With this market backdrop, we continue to actively position Schlumberger at the forefront of an industry that needs to evolve. We do this by proactively managing our base business and responding to ongoing pressures of commoditization by tailoring our offering, resources and service performance to changing market conditions.","In parallel, we constantly look to expand our opportunity set in a period where the industry, in many ways, lacks overall direction. This includes driving a broad and very active M&A program, engaging with existing and new customers to establish closer collaboration and more aligned business models and also expanding our offering from technical support to now also taking a financial position alongside our customers in applicable projects, all with the aim of generating more activity for our 19 product lines.","As we continue to carefully navigate the current industry landscape, we remain confident and optimistic about the future of Schlumberger, knowing very well that beyond the current market challenges lies a wealth of opportunity for the industry players that are ready and able to think new and to act new.","Thank you. With that, we will open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","James West","Hey good afternoon, Paal","Paal Kibsgaard","Good afternoon. So given that you guys are holding your call from the Kingdom, the board meeting was held in the Kingdom as well, I\u2019d love to hear kind of what \u2013 as you and the board talk about strategic focus over the next several quarters but also several years and talk about the implementation of those strategies, what are the key kind of top 1, 2, 3 items that you or that Schlumberger is most focused on in the near-term and especially given your broad international focus? And I think we understand where you stand in North America.","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, if you are asking about in particular in Saudi Arabia, let me first say that the board has spent actually a full week in Saudi Arabia, in between Jeddah, Riyadh, Shaybah and Dhahran. We have visited the KAUST University, a range of government institutions focused on science, technology and innovation. And of course, we spent a lot of time with our largest customer, Saudi Aramco, both at their headquarters in Dhahran and then in their field operations in the South in Shaybah.","Now the board had a particular interest in broadening its understanding of both the Vision 2030 for the country as well as the In-Kingdom Total Value Add program, which is also very important, and in particular, how Schlumberger continues to actively support these programs and also how we further strengthen our position in the kingdom. Now as part of our visit, we also have the privilege of meeting His Excellency, Khalid Al-Falih, to discuss the state of the oil market, which was also very useful for our board to do.","Now everywhere we went, we had been met by exceptional hospitality, and the board was actually very impressed with everything that we saw and everything that is going on in the kingdom. So this has really served as a further extension of our understanding of all the details that was going on in the country, and that is helping both the board and the senior management team, which was also here to further adjust and, I would say, accelerate our plans of investment in the country.","James West","Okay, that\u2019s great. It\u2019s very helpful, Paal. And maybe just a quick follow-up for me. You recently announced the new special venture fund, and you made some very quick moves there with that fund. Could you perhaps elaborate a little bit on the mandate here for the fund and what you see as the opportunity set?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. So just to be clear on what the fund is, so this is a new avenue for project investments alongside our customers. And this is basically to enable closer collaboration and alignment with our customers. It is also there to facilitate and support additional E&P investments and also for us, very importantly, to secure preferred supplier agreements for our products and services for whatever these investments that we facilitate. So this is the overall driver behind it.","Now we understand that many of our customers do not see a need for this, but some customers do, and the key principle for us that this fund and these investment opportunities is open to all customers. So the basic thing here is that it\u2019s simply aiming to enable growth and in the base business.","Now the scope of the fund, again, is relatively open. We will evaluate each project based on its stand-alone merits. We haven\u2019t, at this stage, set the limits for the size of the fund. But I think importantly as well, they are also open to possibly co-invest with third parties. And obviously, the fund will be subject to the same, I would say, governance and risk management processes that we have for the base business, and ultimately, all the investment decisions will be approved by our CFO. So it\u2019s something that is in place to facilitate further growth for the base business. I think that\u2019s the best summary of it.","James West","Okay, great. Thanks, Paul.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, James.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.","Angie Sedita","Thanks. Good morning. Good afternoon, guys as well.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning.","Angie Sedita","So Paal, so could we go back to the U.S. a little bit? And obviously, the OneStim is a surprising JV and interesting to see. So can you talk a little bit about your strategy there as far as redeploying the frac fleet into the U.S. market and if you could even have a target horsepower as you exit 2017 and maybe a little bit about the logistics of the JV?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. I think we need to separate the JV from our current hydraulic fracturing business in North America land. The JV will obviously include all that business when it\u2019s closed. But as of now, we continue to manage our business in a stand-alone fashion while we are preparing obviously to close the JV as soon as possible.","So I will comment briefly on our plans for activation of capacity for the base business today, and I\u2019ll have Patrick give a few comments around the OneStim JV and the plans post-closure. So if you look at the situation today on our fracking business, we\u2019ve always said that as soon as we have a clear pathway towards profitability, we will start actively reactivating our idle capacity.","This point in time \u2013 actually past in the first quarter, so towards the back end of the first quarter, we actually started actively reactivating our idle capacity. And this process is going to accelerate in the second quarter and also going into H2. So based on the current plan we have at this stage, we plan to have our entire idle capacity from the Schlumberger side deployed during the fourth quarter of this year.","So this is the current plan of reactivation. We are getting, I would say, significant traction on pricing. We are actively hiring people both for the wellsite operations and for the vertical integration part, including the transportation side of things as well. And I think the balance we have between the insourcing of our vertical supply chain, together with still a very close working relationship with our suppliers \u2013 and just to be clear, we are not looking to fully vertically integrate. We will have a certain amount of our capacity vertically integrated, and we will continue also to work closely with our suppliers, both on the sand mine side as well as transportation and distribution.","So we will continue now in the coming quarters to actively redeploy. And obviously, when we close the OneStim JV, these resources and these businesses will all be combined in OneStim, which will then just continue on the same process. So Patrick, you want to say a few words about where we stand on OneStim and plans?","Patrick Schorn","Sure. Regarding the OneStim joint venture, which is a 70-30 joint venture with Weatherford for North America land for hydraulic fracturing and completion, it really creates a new industry leader in terms of hydraulic horsepower and multistage completions. Through its scale, it will offer a cost-effective and competitive service delivery platform, which is clearly positioned to provide customers with leading operational efficiency and best-in-class hydraulic fracturing and completion technologies.","Importantly, reliable equipment availability for our customers, and it will also improve significantly the full-cycle shareholder returns from this particular market. So in this case, Weatherford is contributing its leading multistage completions portfolio, around 1 million horsepower in pumping equipment and the pump down perforating business. And what we will end up with is a very capital-efficient structure, pulling the hydraulic horsepower to gain economies of scale, which clearly is very much from the current market recovery. I\u2019ll leave it with that.","Angie Sedita","Okay, thank you. That\u2019s very helpful color. So as a unrelated follow-up. Maybe you can give a little bit of color on Cameron and what your outlook is for subsea overall as far as large projects and pricing and even the rig of the future, any update there.","Paal Kibsgaard","Patrick, do you want to cover that?","Patrick Schorn","Sure. So firstly, we exceeded our first year synergy targets, and we realized approximately $400 million in savings there. And we already secured around $600 million in new synergy orders. So from that perspective, the transaction is working well, and the integration is going extremely well. So what we are focused on in Cameron is really creating a fully integrated drilling and production system, combining our leading well and subsurface offering with Cameron\u2019s leading service technology, further leveraging instrumentation and software control and optimization capabilities.","During Q1, overall the revenue was seasonally down, driven mainly by OneSubsea and Surface Systems as Surface and V&M posted double [indiscernible] in U.S. land and a step change in bookings. And that is maybe the most important, as was already mentioned by Simon as well, where we are starting to see that the book to bill is starting to go over 1. The margin decline somewhat, but through strong execution and cost control, we limited the margin decline to approximately 88 basis points.","Paal Kibsgaard","All right. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ole Slorer","Thank you very much. I\u2019m wondering, Paal or Simon, whether you could elaborate a little bit on the increased participation in customer projects under SPM. You highlighted in the prepared remarks that payments from certain Latin American customers have slowed down. And \u2013 how do you see the evolution, the impact on return on capital, how big really the committed capital become? I think that\u2019s a line of questioning I think, I guess, in every single investor meeting when the topic of Schlumberger comes up.","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, I\u2019ll say, going back to what I mentioned about the fund, Ole, the fund itself is there to facilitate growth in the base business. So the way we look at the fund is that if we do make investments alongside our customers, these investments will need to meet the return criteria that we have overall as a company and also the base business that we get associated with the project. Through preferred supplier agreements, we\u2019d also obviously need to meet the same return criteria.","So I think the way to look at the fund is that we have a strong balance sheet. We have strong cash flow, and we have a fair bit of cash on hand. And what we are doing on a selective basis is looking for investment opportunities to facilitate more base business for the company. Our revenues are still at around 50% of what they were eight, nine quarters ago. And we are trying very actively to make sure that we can get baseline growth not just in North America land, but also globally.","And given the capability set we have as a company, in particular around subsurface understanding and drilling and completions, we see this as a very good way of a thing to drive, I would say, short and medium-term activity. But very importantly, these contracts that we enter into here could have durations of 10 to 15 to 20 years, which will also provide us with a very good baseline of activity and earnings throughout the coming cycles as well.","So I don\u2019t think there should be a huge reason for concern around the capital intensity. We have capital available to invest, and we are trying to invest this wisely into projects that have good returns stand-alone but also that facilitates growth opportunities for the base business.","Ole Slorer","Okay, thank you. And on the revenue synergies with Cameron, $600 million, it\u2019s very difficult for us to see what would that come to with or without the joint venture. So can you elaborate a little bit about what type of business is it that you\u2019ve signed up that you don\u2019t think either Schlumberger or Cameron would have achieved on a stand-alone basis? And maybe the context of that, also comment a little bit on your rationale between \u2013 by investing in \u2013 it will have in Borr?","Paal Kibsgaard","Patrick, why don\u2019t you talk about Cameron? I\u2019ll cover Borr when you\u2019re done with that.","Patrick Schorn","All right. So talking about some of the examples of revenue synergies, I think one of the \u2013 your previous one is clearly the expanding of Cameron\u2019s geographical reach and using as such the Schlumberger existing footprint to reach a far larger customer base. What it also helps with is accelerating the implementation of the OneSubsea vision and plans as the cooperation between the companies is much closer today.","And the \u2013 one of the first points we had brought up when we started talking about the opportunities was addressing the significant industry NPT issues related to BOPs. And here, you have to really think about monitoring and how we could optimize the use in that side. And then where we really focus, and this might link into what you \u2013 what we have discussed in the past when it comes to issues like rig of the future is creating a integrated drilling system, which would include all the service and service components that we offer, and obviously then optimize the drilling process to such an extent that neither one of the single companies could achieve. That is really the main examples of revenue synergies.","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay. Thanks, Patrick. So Ole, let me just comment quickly on Borr then. So \u2013 and as you\u2019ve seen, we made a $221 million investment to take a 20% stake in this new company. There are several drivers behind the investment, but the main driver is really to create a platform where we can collaborate closely with Borr to offer performance drilling offshore in shallow water. We see this as, I think, a significant opportunity for Schlumberger and also for Borr to offer this new type of contract model, which is now heavily used on land but also now to be used in shallow water. Just for the record, we are also open to work with other and offer drillers on the similar type of performance contracts.","Now back to Borr, Borr also represents a significant potential market for Cameron drilling, both in terms of BOP, sand and drilling packages. And I would say lastly, looking at the company and the plans going forward, we also expect this to be a very good financial investment. So this is the main rationale behind investment.","Ole Slorer","Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Ole.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons. Please go ahead.","Bill Herbert","Thanks. Good morning. A question with regard to the incrementals that you generated in Lower 48 for frac and directional 66%, I think, for Q1. Patrick and Paal, just given the reactivation slate that you have in front of you, which is \u2013 seems to be pretty large, do you expect to generate either that level of profit improvement over the course of this year or something within that neighborhood as you reactivate assets? The rest of the industry seems to have difficulty with regard to revenue growth and converging that with profit improvement that hasn\u2019t happened. But in your case, it looks like the profit improvement was actually fairly considerable. And I\u2019m just curious as to the relationship between reactivation growth and margin improvement in light of that.","Paal Kibsgaard","That\u2019s a good question. So I would kind of split it into 2. When it comes to the onetime cost of reactivating, yes, we will have some impact of that in the coming quarters. I would say the \u2013 but the underlying incrementals that we\u2019re aiming for is going to be around this level. But we will be subject to some additional activation costs, I would say in the \u2013 probably in the second and the third quarter, which might, for those 2 quarters, basically deliver slightly lower incrementals overall. But the underlying, I would say, drive we have between getting customer price increases and driving efficiency through scale as we reactivate and also managing our supply chain, underlying, we are aiming for those type of incrementals, which we have talked about for the company for the past couple of years. We will have some headwinds around onetime reactivation costs in the coming quarters. But beyond that, we are looking to manage at this level.","Bill Herbert","Oka, thank you. And then secondly, with regard to Shushufindi and I guess the challenges that were reported in the media in recent weeks with regard to Ecuador, can you update us with regard to what the forward path on that project looks like?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, I can. And first of all, let me just clarify that we have several SPM projects in Ecuador.","Bill Herbert","Yes.","Paal Kibsgaard","And the issues we are discussing are only pertaining to Shushufindi, right?","Bill Herbert","Okay.","Paal Kibsgaard","Now just to give you some background on Shushufindi, we are now in the fifth successful year of operations there. And in between the Shushufindi Consortium, which we lead, and Petroamazonas, the state oil company, we have a very solid governance model, and we have annual budgets and annual production targets, which are set and agreed. And if you go back for these 5 years, we have exceeded all these production targets. But what has happened is that with the lower oil price, this has led to cash flow challenges for Petroamazonas. And they are also selling the oil that we produce from the Shushufindi field. So they are basically then falling behind on our payments, and this is really the key issue.","So the proposal they have made to address the payment issues is not acceptable, and the situation over the first quarter has been further aggravated by the fact that they have imposed also production constraints on the outputs from the Shushufindi field. So bottom line, we find this treatment of a partner, who has made significant investments in the country, somewhat disappointing. But still, we are very confident that the issues are going to be resolved, either amicably by \u2013 or by using the dispute resolution provisions that are in the contract. So that\u2019s kind of where we are. How long it\u2019s going to take to get it resolved, I can\u2019t say at this stage. But we are ready to sit down again and continue discussions, and there have been a number of meetings and discussions over the past couple of months. We are ready to continue these discussions as soon as the imposed production constraints are lifted.","Bill Herbert","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.","DavidAnderson","Thanks. Paal, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the weakness in the Middle East you saw this quarter. It was mentioned a few times in the release, and I guess the pricing pressure wasn\u2019t a huge surprise. But the activity reduction did stand out to me. I was just wondering, is there a specific country that\u2019s experiencing this? And do you think this comes back later in the year? Or is it more of an adjustment to the drilling programs? I just wondered if you could just provide a little bit more color on the GCCs.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. So I wouldn\u2019t use the word weakness, David. I think the \u2013 we have a slight decline in overall activity and revenue in the Middle East. Obviously all declines in Asia that weighs in on the overall EMEA numbers. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that concerns or so worries us that should concern or worry you. But we are not seeing any significant growth in the coming quarters. We are slightly down, like I said, sequentially [indiscernible]. This is more around, I would say, project mix\u2026","David Anderson","Okay.","Paal Kibsgaard","\u2026priorities and so forth, right? So I would say the underlying business in the Middle East is very resilient. There are strong and clear plans in each of the countries we operate here. And so no major worries. It\u2019s just that there is no, I would say, significant steady sequential growth either in Q1 or in the coming quarters, just a very steady resilient base business.","David Anderson","Okay, thanks. And just a follow-up would be on the offshore side. Seems like IOC just doesn\u2019t seem eager to invest offshore. We haven\u2019t really seen much on the step-out and tieback front. I was just wondering if you could maybe elaborate. We talked in the past about maybe 5 to 8 big projects potentially being announced in the back part of the year. Has your views on kind of offshore kind of shifted a little bit? I was just wondering if you could help us, kind of what is the road map you think to recovery in offshore? Is this kind of, again, pushed out maybe more to an 2018 event when we start seeing some of these projects awarded.","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes, we see the same as you. And so there hasn\u2019t \u2013 so far of significant FIDs, plans being discussed of the things going on offshore. We \u2013 if you look at jack-up utilization, I think there is a slight uptick on it. So I think there\u2019s probably some early signs that we\u2019ll get some light work coming our way as an industry in the next couple of quarters. But in terms of bigger projects, I agree with you, we haven\u2019t seen anything yet. So I think the main thing here is, I think for the IOC customers to basically get a better medium-term view on oil prices, and obviously, the positive uptick we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of quarters is a good thing.","But I would assume that I\u2019m also looking for what the floor could be and maybe awaiting potentially what OPEC is going to do as we go into the May \u2013 the late May meeting around whether they extend the production cuts or not. So I agree with you. I think the increase in offshore activity or shallow water activity is probably more going to be a second half of the year event, leading into 2018. So with that, though, it\u2019s still very important for us as a company to at least secure the work that is coming out of projects that are being FID-ed. And that\u2019s why we are very happy and excited, the fact that we landed the Mad Dog 2 project, for instance.","David Anderson","Great. Thank you, Paul.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Jim Wicklund","Good morning, guys.","Paal Kibsgaard","Good morning, Jim","Jim Wicklund","A lot of questions asked, so if I could drill down a little bit on North America. Patrick, you made comments about the increased vertical participation in sand and additional sand mines. Can you tell us what you guys have done here in the last couple of quarters in terms of assuring capacity, delivery and making a little extra money, I guess, too, in North America in sand?","Patrick Schorn","Yes, I\u2019ll cover that, Jim. So what we have done, we basically started this vertical integration investment program towards the back end of 2014. And we have made a number of investments in sand mines, which are now starting to come on production. And in addition to that, we obviously also invested further into owning railcars, owning transloading facilities. And we also are now \u2013 we have established our own trucking fleet, where we are now hiring people into manning the trucks that we have bought and that we are currently buying. So \u2013 but just to be clear, we are not looking to fully vertically integrate.","We will have a certain amount of our capacity in it. We will do a fair bit of it, but we are still going to rely on the long-term suppliers that we\u2019ve had both in upturn as well as in the \u2013 in future downturns. But we see the investments that we make into this, with the rapid cost inflations that you typically see starting at this part of the cycle, as a very good investment and a way to insulate ourselves from the massive supply chain inflation that we saw in the previous cycle, right? So it\u2019s going to be a balancing between vertical integration, 100% owned by us, as well as using the supply chain capabilities that we have in the open market.","Jim Wicklund","Okay. And my follow-up in kind of the same vein, you talk about the completion capacity and what it would brings in OneStim. I know that 80% of the completions that we do in the U.S., 80% plus what \u2013 are plug-and-perf. And sliding sleeves, this has been marginalized. I know that Weatherford does both plug-and-perf and sliding sleeves. What is Schlumberger\u2019s view of how those 2 technologies are going to develop? And is everything going to be plugged and parked in a couple of years? Or can you talk about where that technology is going to go? We don\u2019t really know a whole lot of details about the breakdown of Weatherford stations both, frankly, and yours in that regard. So if you could give us some guidance on where the market is headed, that would be appreciated.","Paal Kibsgaard","Okay. Well, I think first of all, the multistage completion offering that Weatherford brings into the JV and also combined with ours will have a complete range of both open-hole and cased-hole solutions. Now if you look at where the market has been heading, I would say in the last 3, 4, 5 years, it has been gradually moving more and more to plug-and-perf with less, I would say, open-hole completions and sliding sleeves. There\u2019s still more of that type of completions in Canada compared to what you have in U.S. land.","So I would say that we are basically set up for \u2013 if the market continues the current trend towards more plug-and-perf in cased hole or whether there is a reemergence of the open hole, right? So I think we have a very good balance, and we can go either way. I think it\u2019s going to come down to well performance productivity and completion costs in terms of what\u2019s going to govern this, but we are adjusted well in either way, Jim.","Jim Wicklund","Okay. Thank you guys very much.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead","Hey, good afternoon. Where you are?","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you very much.","Kurt Hallead","Great. Awesome information flow so far. So I figured I\u2019d kind of get right to the crux of probably what a lot of people are trying to gauge from all this great information, is how do you feel about the progression on The Street numbers as we look out into the second quarter?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, there \u2013 and there, the question came. That\u2019s good. Well, I would say that in the second quarter, first of all, at the high level, we are expecting to see a continuation of the main trends that we saw in the first quarter. And then if you break our North America and international, for North America, we expect solid top line growth in Q3. And this is going to be driven, again, by what we saw in Q1 as well: further growth in the rig activity; for us, additional pricing and market share gains in directional drilling; and also, as we talked about earlier on the call, an acceleration of the capacity reactivation in fracking.","Now underlying incremental margins, as I commented on earlier, should be solid. But in Q2 and probably Q3 as well, they\u2019re going to be partly offset by some of these onetime start-up costs that we are having. And also, in the second quarter, we are as usual also footing the cost of the Canadian breakup. But overall, I would say strong top line growth and decent earnings growth for us in North America in the second quarter, with some small headwinds around the start-up costs.","Internationally, as I said earlier, we have reached bottom in all markets. But for the second quarter, we only see, at this stage, flat underlying activity in Q2. So the \u2013 really, the only growth that we are going to see in the second quarter is going to be limited to the seasonal recovery in the North Sea, Russia and China.","Now on the Cameron side, revenue is also expected to be more or less flat, where we are seeing solid growth in the short-cycle businesses of surface and V&M. But this is going to be offset by the slowing decline now in the long-cycle businesses of OneSubsea and drilling. So if you combine all of these, I believe that a sequential EPS growth of around 15% to 20% between Q1 and Q2 is a reasonable expectation.","Kurt Hallead","Great, that\u2019s fantastic. Now based on your commentary about pricing pressures in the international market, and \u2013 it sounded like recovery still at hand in the second half of the year internationally than it would \u2013 I guess we can assume that the first quarter is going to be the low point for earnings of the year, and then you get sequential growth throughout the year. Is that kind of how you see it setting up?","Paal Kibsgaard","Yes. In principle, yes. I would say, like I said, the underlying activity internationally, Q2 isn\u2019t showing any great signs of improving. But we will have at least the seasonal recovery in some of the key markets to help us. In terms of the pricing, we are still seeing continued pricing pressure on new tenders, but at the same time, some of this, we are looking to offset by exiting our unsustainable contracts. We still have some of these contracts that we are looking to resolve either by shutting the contract down or by getting the pricing increases that we need in order to make this a viable business proposition for us.","So yes, I would say in principle, the Q1 should be the low end of earnings for the year in international market, with still only limited growth in Q2 but more of an acceleration in the second half of the year.","Kurt Hallead","Okay, great. Thank you. And then maybe quick follow-up here just on your commentary about the investing alongside your customers in the YPF deal and Borr Drilling and so on. So Paal, you guys have indicated in the past that all your SPM investments have effectively been margin and returns accretive in aggregate compared to the corporate average. As you\u2019re making more and more investments in the year, like, what is the criteria, right? How should we think about it? If you\u2019re going to invest, say, $200 million in Borr Drilling, how do we think about that in terms of incremental revenue or incremental profitability? Could you give us just some general gauge on how to assess that?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, the investments in the equity of Borr Drilling should bring a return on investment or capital employed, which is accretive to the company. That\u2019s why we made the company \u2013 that\u2019s why we made the investments. And for future investments, that\u2019s, again, what we are going to look for when we spend cash on this type of investments. Hand in hand with that is also obviously the revenue opportunity that this brings. And with this, like I said, we\u2019re going to focus in on two things. With that big fleet of jack-ups, this is a very good market potential for Cameron drilling, but even more importantly, what we are really driving at here is to introduce performance drilling in the offshore markets. So this is just one example. But when we make these investments, there will be synergies and business opportunities and revenue opportunities associated with them. The investments will stand on their own 2 feet, and we aim for them to be accretive to our return on capital employed for the company. But they all need to be associated with the business opportunities for the rest of the company.","Kurt Hallead","Okay, that\u2019s great. I appreciate that color. Thank you so much.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Waqar Syed","Thank you for taking my question. My question relates to Cameron, some of the recent projects that you\u2019ve entered into, Mad Dog and others. How should we look \u2013 think about long-term margins for these new projects versus what OneSubsea has been generating before?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, obviously, if you look at the commercial environment at this stage versus the commercial environment three years ago when the project that we are currently executing were bid, it\u2019s obviously more challenging. So to think that we can, I would say, achieve the exactly same margins on these latest projects that we are currently delivering on OneSubsea, that might be challenging. But I would say for all the bids that we are making and the contracts that we ultimately secure, we have very clear return expectations on them, somewhat lower than what OneSubsea is currently operating at.","But we are still looking for this to be a very good business for us going forward, and continuous improvement \u2013 for instance, OneSubsea is showing and the plans they have in place going forward as well to even further improve the way they execute projects. There should also be opportunities for the projects we bid and secure at this phase to have potentially margin upsides as we go forward. So it\u2019s a tough business, but I would say I\u2019m very pleased with how OneSubsea is navigating the commercial environment and also executing and delivering on the projects that we take on.","Waqar Syed","And then just my follow-up question on integration-related expenses. When do you think you\u2019re going to stop reporting those?","Paal Kibsgaard","Well, we \u2013 as we said earlier, we will continue to be reporting them, announcing them separately for the year. But starting next year, we will drop this. This is normally our style. For the first year after the acquisition, we continue to incur them and announce them. And from there on, they become part of our ongoing run rate of cost.","Waqar Syed","Thank you very much.","Paal Kibsgaard","Thank you, Waqar. So just before we close this morning, I\u2019d like to summarize the three most important points that we\u2019ve discussed. First, the only region in the world showing clear signs of increased E&P investments in 2017 is North America land, where activity has been growing for the last few quarters. And in line with our profitable growth strategy, we have begun redeploying our idle capacity in pressure pumping, and we will accelerate this in the second quarter. Through the organic and inorganic investments we had made in our North America land business over the past seven years, we are very well positioned to take a leading customers as they expand their activity in the coming year.","Second, the performance of our international areas in the first quarter confirmed our belief that activity has now reached bottom in all regions. And although we see positive signs in many countries, both on land and offshore, we expect only moderate sequential growth over the coming quarters. The slower speed of recovery, together with the lingering pricing pressure, means that we expect another challenging year in the international markets in 2017 before a clearer acceleration of activity in 2018.","And third, as we continue to carefully navigate the current industry landscape, we remain confident and optimistic about the future of Schlumberger, knowing very well that beyond the current market challenges lies a wealth of opportunity for the industry players that are ready to think new and to act new. Thank you very much for listening in.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.","Simon Farrant - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. Welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Second Quarter 2016 Results Conference Call. Today's call is being hosted from London following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Rowe, President, Cameron Group. Scott will join the earnings call through the fourth quarter this year to provide an update on the Cameron Group business integration and synergies.","Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon, Scott and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results, then Scott will provide the Cameron update, and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.","However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involves risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings.","Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our second quarter press release, which is on our website. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements. Please make your questions concise and limit them to one related follow-up.","I'll now turn the call over to Simon.","Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.23. This represents decreases of $0.17 sequentially and $0.65 when compared to the same quarter last year. During the second quarter, we recorded $2.9 billion of pre-tax charges. This consisted of $1.9 billion of asset impairments, $646 million relating to workforce reductions, and $355 million of merger and integration charges associated with the acquisition of Cameron which closed on April 1, 2016. The asset impairments are a result of the challenging market condition that continued to deteriorate during the first half of 2016. These impairments will not result in any cash outflows.","As we indicated last quarter, we continued to tailor our resources to activity levels, unfortunately, this resulted in additional workforce reductions. The $335 million of merger and integration charges consists of $150 million non-cash inventory-related purchase accounting item, with the balance relating to transaction costs as well as a dedicated integration team and other costs to achieve synergies. We will continue to incur merger and integration charges for the rest of 2016 and into 2017.","Our second-quarter revenue was $7.2 billion. This included a full quarter of activity from Cameron which added $1.5 billion to our top line. Excluding the impact of Cameron, revenue decreased 14% sequentially reflecting continued activity declines, pricing pressure and a reduction of activity in Venezuela to better match cash collections.","Pre-tax operating margins, including the effects of Cameron, decreased 404 basis points, sequentially, to 10.4%. Cameron was accretive to Schlumberger's pre-tax operating margin as well as earning per share and cash flow.","Highlights by product group were as follows. Second quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 9% sequentially, while margin decreased 228 basis points to 16.7%. These decreases were largely driven by Wireline and Testing Services activity declines across all of the international areas, most notably in Latin America. Drilling Group revenue of $2 billion decreased 18% sequentially while margin declined 649 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by significant rig count reductions and pricing pressure across all areas, the largest declines were experienced in Latin America and North America.","Production Group revenue of $2.1 billion decreased 11% sequentially and margins fell by 459 basis points, primarily on lower pressure pumping activity and further pricing pressure in North America land. Latin America also saw significant activity declines.","As previously mentioned, the Cameron Group contributed revenue of $1.5 billion while generating pre-tax operating margin of 15.8%. On a pro forma basis, this represents a 6% sequential revenue decline and 130 basis points margin improvement.","The decrease in revenue was largely driven by a declining project backlog as well as the further slowdown in U.S. land that impacted the shorter cycle businesses. The margin improvement was driven by strong project execution, offset in part by the effects of the activity decline in U.S. land.","Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. Our corporate and other expense line has increased $69 million sequentially. This increase is driven by the $63 million of the quarterly amortization expense from the intangible assets recorded in connection with the Cameron purchase accounting. The Schlumberger effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 16% in the second quarter essentially the same as Q1.","As I highlighted last quarter with these reduced overall levels of pre-tax income that we are experiencing, relatively small changes in our tax line will have a disproportionate impact on our ETR potentially resulting in volatility going forward. Our tax rate will continue to be very sensitive to the overall geographic mix of earnings.","We generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations. This is despite paying approximately $285 million in severance and $100 million in one-off transaction related fees during the quarter.","Our net debt increased $3.4 billion during the quarter to $10 billion. This expected increase was driven by the $2.8 billion of cash we paid the Cameron shareholders and the $785 million of net debt we assumed in connection with the transaction. We ended the quarter with total cash and investment of $11.6 billion.","During the quarter, we spent $31 million to repurchase 428,000 shares at an average price of $72.77. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included approximately $450 million on CapEx, $130 million of SPM investments, $170 million of multiclient and $630 million of dividend payments.","Our CapEx on a year-to-date basis was $1 billion, which includes one quarter of Cameron. CapEx for the second half of 2016 is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion. These amounts do not include investment in SPM or multiclient.","And now I will turn the conference call over to Scott.","Robert Scott Rowe - President - Cameron Group, Schlumberger Limited","Thanks, Simon, and hello, everyone. This is the first earnings conference call that I have participated in since the announcement of Schlumberger and Cameron combination in August of last year. So I'm going to provide an update on Cameron's key developments in 2016 and provide you with some color on how the integration is progressing.","The Cameron business has continued perform well in light of current market conditions. The margin progression journey that we started in 2014 has continued in our long cycle businesses with strong execution of our backlog in our Drilling, OneSubsea and Process Systems business units.","We have continued to deliver our backlog while driving cost out of the system, generating enhanced margins through the cycle. For example, drilling margins were significantly accretive, and subsea margins were at the Cameron Group margin level.","As you can imagine, our shorter cycle businesses, Surface and Valves & Measurement are being impacted by both volume and significant pricing pressure. Despite these pressures, both Valves & Measurement and Surface have positive operating income and are delivering solid cash flow.","Overall, the Cameron Group was able to deliver healthy cash flow and operating margins of 15.8% in the quarter, which is nearly an all-time high for Cameron. However, the Cameron Group is not immune to the downturn, as you can see in our second quarter book to bill ratio of 0.68x. This will have a continued impact on revenue in 2017 as our longer cycle businesses continue to move downward and our backlog reduced to $3.7 billion in these businesses at the end of the quarter.","Let's switch to our business unit level detail starting with OneSubsea. OneSubsea continues to build on the vision that we created when forming the venture in 2013. In fact, we've just been awarded Woodside's Greater Enfield development, which is truly the first award that brings together the full capabilities that OneSubsea has to offer. This will be booked in July.","We have been working closely with Woodside since we were awarded their subsea frame agreement in 2014. Our success in the frame agreement evolved to an integrated FEED study which led to project award. In this project we used our integrated solutions expertise, including flow assurance capabilities, our systems engineering to best configure the seafloor architecture, our seafloor boosting capabilities, our standardized horizontal SpoolTree, and subsea landing string. We are very pleased to be working with Woodside and finding cost-effective solutions to move deepwater developments from concept to reality.","With these engagements, the OneSubsea team continues to move up the learning curve on how to find deepwater solutions that are one, cost enabling; two, deliver more production at a higher recovery factor; three, bring projects to market significantly faster; and ultimately, improve the financial returns of deepwater developments.","We are also working on the SPS and SURF interface where we believe there are cost and efficiency gains. We now have three paid FEED studies for our OneSubsea and Subsea 7 alliance, and we're working on another 20-plus engagements currently.","Other recent activities include the six tree award for Pterobel's Zohr gas development in Egypt, which utilized a quick FEED approach and a supplier-led solution to meet a very aggressive timeline at a significantly reduced cost.","Additionally, OneSubsea has successfully commissioned two boosting systems in the Gulf of Mexico. OneSubsea continues to have 100% of the working seafloor boosting systems in the world. Our leadership and history in boosting positions OneSubsea extremely well to capitalize on the smaller developments that tie back to existing infrastructure and whose facilities. Our unique offering of a single well-boosting system combined with a standard subsea tree works perfectly for this growing market.","Each of the Cameron businesses are handling this cycle well in executing on our downturn playbook which focused on cost reduction, market share preservation and price optimization. As we move into Schlumberger, we are sharpening our focus on our service offering to capitalize on our large global installed base of equipment, and we continue to enhance our portfolio with a renewed commitment to technology. I can't tell you how proud I am of the Cameron employees as we continue to perform exceptionally well despite the industry's worst downturn and while executing a major corporate integration.","Now, I'd like to turn to the integration of Cameron into Schlumberger. To start, I think it can be best summarized as a successful continuation of the collaboration and partnership that we started in OneSubsea. The Cameron and Schlumberger teams continue to work together in an impressive manner, and I'm happy to report that the progress in the first three months has exceeded all of our expectations. In the second quarter, we booked $125 million of synergy-related business, which was significantly ahead of our original plan. We are also on track to deliver the $300 million of synergies in the first 12 months from closing.","We continue to find unexpected opportunities across all of the Cameron businesses, including Valves & Measurement and Processing, as we leverage the substantial capabilities of Schlumberger's vast geographic organization. Additionally, we continue to build on the concept of integrating the subsurface capabilities of Schlumberger with the surface pressure control and processing capabilities of Cameron. We started this in OneSubsea and we are now seeing opportunities in drilling, unconventional production and production and processing facilities. Finally, we have started over 30 new technology development programs as part of the integration and we are confident that these programs will deliver significant revenue synergies and growth opportunities when the markets do recover.","Overall, the integration is progressing very well and the combination and collaboration has been positively received by the Cameron employees, the Schlumberger employees and our customers.","Now, I'll turn it over to Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, market condition worsened further in most parts of our global operations. But in spite of the continuing operational and commercial headwinds, we have now reached the bottom of the cycle. In line with the previous six quarters of this downturn, we continue to navigate the challenging environment with an unwavering focus on protecting the overall financial health of the company. This enabled us to generate a positive operating income of $747 million, excluding credits and charges; maintain operating margins north of 10%; and, more importantly, produce a positive operating cash flow of $1.6 billion. This solid financial performance came as a result of strong execution and in some cases at the expense of revenue, as we now have started to shift focus onto recovering our pricing concessions and high-grading our contract portfolio.","Second quarter revenue increased 10% sequentially, boosted by the inclusion of a full quarter's activity for the Cameron Group, which amounted to $1.5 billion. However, activity for all groups decreased in the quarter as E&P budgets were further reduced. The revenue headwinds were most pronounced in North America and further exacerbated by a decision to reduce our operations in Venezuela to fall in line with cash collections, which had a significant impact on our Latin America results. In terms of pre-tax operating income, close to 75% of our sequential drop was caused by North America and Venezuela.","As I review the second quarter geographical trends, I will use pro forma numbers for the sequential comparison while I focus my comments on the Characterization, Drilling and Production Groups as Scott has already covered the Cameron Group in detail.","In North America, revenue declined 20% sequentially against an average drop in the U.S. land rig count to 25%, as the activity slide now have reached bottom. The doubling in the WTI oil price since the lows seen in January of this year has also led some customers to start moving drilled but uncompleted shale wells out of inventory and into production, with the associated increase in hydraulic fracturing activity.","In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, activity was weaker as additional deepwater exploration rigs were released and the move to development activity slowed. Pricing remained under massive pressure in all land and offshore markets in North America. However, signs have started to emerge of customers recognizing that pricing levels have now fallen to unsustainable levels, leading to a growing risk of destroying capabilities and capacity required in the future.","Within our North America business, the Drilling Group was the hardest hit in the second quarter with Drilling & Measurements, Bits and Drilling Tools, and M-I SWACO seeing the greatest activity decline.","In Reservoir Characterization, however, lower revenue for Wireline and Testing Services was partly offset by sequentially stronger WesternGeco work in both Canada and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.","In the international markets customer budget cuts, activity disruptions, seasonal variations and persisting pricing pressure impacted our results in most basins and market segments around the world.","In Latin America, revenue declined 26% sequentially as activity in Venezuela fell significantly following our decision to reduce operations to fall in line with cash collections. This program is managed in close coordination with all customers in the country and operations are continuing for the Faja IOC joint ventures and for some specific PDVSA operations.","Activity also decreased in Mexico and Brazil as customer budgets were curtailed further, leaving the remaining activity rig count in these two countries at very low levels. From a technology standpoint, the Drilling Group saw the largest drop in revenue with significant reductions in all product lines.","In the Production Group, lower revenue from our traditional product lines was offset by robust integration-related performance with all our projects in the region progressing well.","In Reservoir Characterization our multiclient seismic program in Mexico continued in advance of the upcoming deepwater license rounds.","So far we have delivered more than 40,000 square kilometers of high resolution wide-azimuth seismic data, and early evaluation of the data is already leading to clearer identification on new exploration plays in the Golfo Campeche (sic) [Golfo de Campeche] Basin.","Revenue in Europe, CIS and Africa declined 7% sequentially as widespread activity reductions throughout our Sub-Saharan Africa operations had a significant impact on our results. Nigeria and the Gulf of Guinea saw the largest fall, but the rig count in Angola also fell sharply together with Central\/West Africa where key exploration campaign was completed.","In the North Sea, rig-related activity in the UK increased while revenue was lower in Norway as seasonal shutdowns and a changing job mix impacted results. These negative factors affected all parts of our business in the area and particularly the Drilling and Production Groups. Within Reservoir Characterization, lower revenue for Wireline and Testing Services was partially offset by improving seismic revenues from WesternGeco.","In Russia, revenue increased as the summer season ramped up in line with expectations and was further supported by the appreciation of the Russian ruble. Activity was strongest for Drilling & Measurements and Well Services, driven by solid drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity both on land and shallow offshore.","In the Middle East and Asia, revenue declined by 2% sequentially as lower activity in Asia more than offset strong activity in the Middle East. In Asia, activity was weakest in the Malaysia and Australia GeoMarkets as projects were canceled or completed and the offshore rig count dropped further. The Drilling Group was most affected by this through lower demand for Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO technologies, while Reservoir Characterization was also lower on weaker wireline exploration activity.","In the Middle East, strength in the GCC countries offset weakness in the Iraq, Oman and Egypt GeoMarkets. In Kuwait, increased rig count, continued progress on the early production facilities we are building for the Jurassic project, together with higher artificial lift and completions product sales drove revenue higher. While in Saudi Arabia, activity also increased driven by market share gains from the latest rig allocations as well as higher hydraulic fracturing activity.","I would now like to turn to the state of our industry and also how we continue to position Schlumberger in the forefront of a challenging and evolving operating environment. We are now seven quarters into the most severe industry downturn on record, which saw oil prices tumbling to $27 this January. Since then, we have seen a slow but steady increase in oil prices as the market data continues to show a tightening of the supply and demand balance, and with the outlook clearly suggesting that these trends will further accelerate going forward.","While the current level of oil prices have created unprecedented turmoil throughout our industry, the financial challenges that have now become very visible are really nothing new. For some time, there has been a growing shortfall of both profits and cash flow for many oil producers around the world, as the cost of developing increasingly complex oil resources has outgrown the value created, which could be seen even when oil prices were at $100 per barrel. The dramatic restructuring of the supply side we are currently experiencing has just accelerated and amplified the cost, quality and efficiency problems of the industry and led to a more acute cash and profitability crisis.","The operators have reacted to this crisis by initiating a massive reduction in oilfield activity and by sending unsustainable pricing shock throughout the entire oil industry supply chain. In addition, there is currently also a widespread high-grading of activity taking place in the industry aimed at maximizing short-term production and cash flow.","Adding up all of this, the current cost per barrel for the oil producers now appears to be significantly lower than what was the case seven quarters ago. However, this should not be confused with a permanent improvement in the underlying industry performance as there has been little to no fundamental change in technology, quality or efficiency, no major step change in industry collaboration and no general transformation of the industry business model.","What has taken place over the past 21 months is, instead, a redistribution of the profit and cash flow shortfall from previously sitting mostly with the oil producers to now representing an unsustainable burden for the supplier industry even after a massive reduction of costs and capacity.","So where does this lead the industry? First of all, assuming that we continue to see a steady growth in demand, we are heading towards a significant global supply deficit as the E&P spend rate now is down by more than 50%. The effect of the reduced E&P spend is already clearly visible in the 2016 non-OPEC production numbers, which are set to drop by 900,000 barrels per day versus last year, and can also be seen by the weakness in the OPEC production outside of the Gulf countries. And as the opportunities for activity high-grading are exhausted, we should see a further acceleration in the global production decline.","In addition, the market is also underestimating the potential reaction from the supplier industry, which has temporarily accepted financially unviable contracts to support the operators and to keep their options open as the downturn has deepened and extended into uncharted territory. This is seen by the service industry profit levels and also from their ballooning receivables balances caused by operators who are unable or unwilling to provide timely payments.","It also means that, inevitably, service industry pricing has to recover and as it does, this will consume a large part of the E&P investment increases intended for additional activity which will further amplify the pending oil supply deficit.","So how are we navigating this challenging industry environment? To start with, we believe that the chronic shortfall in profits and cash flow throughout the oil industry value chain can only be permanently addressed by a dramatic step change in industry performance. This has to begin with the transformation of the intrinsic quality and efficiency of each industry player but it also requires the design of much broader technology systems, including both innovative hardware as well as high-level software control systems.","In addition, we believe that the future industry winners will be the companies that can more effectively integrate the entire industry value chain through an open and collaborative business model with much better commercial alignment between the key contributing parties. After seven quarters of managing our business in an increasingly complex industry environment where we have made a series of strategic and tactical moves, we are well advanced in shaping and positioning our company for future success as can be seen by the following facts.","First, our balance sheet remains strong with more than $11 billion in cash and short-term investments. And we are also one of the few companies in the industry that still generates a positive free cash flow after actively reinvesting in our business and steadily returning cash to our shareholders in form of dividends and stock buybacks.","Second, we have an unprecedented global technology offering that we have significantly expanded in past 21 months through the purchase of a number of smaller technology companies as well as the major acquisition of Cameron.","Third, the addition of the Cameron Group to our technology portfolio will enable the development of major integrated technology systems including our land drilling system and future hydraulic fracturing system and a new surface production system that combines processing, measurements and control.","Fourth, we have established a range of tiered integration business models that enable us to evolve our customer engagements as well as the type of contracts we take on. And last, the benefits we are seeing from our transformation program are creating a significant and long-term competitive advantage to a steady improvement in our internal intrinsic performance.","In Schlumberger, we continue to have a stated goal of serving all customers in all basins and countries around the world, provided it is permissible by local and international law, that it's safe for our people and assets, and that it is financially viable.","And as oil prices have doubled since the lows in January, we have now shifted our focus from decremental margins and increasing our tender win rates over to our contract portfolio, where we are looking to recover the temporary pricing concessions we have made or renegotiate those contracts which, at present, show no promise of becoming financially viable.","As we now enter a new phase of the cycle, oilfield activity has to increase in most countries around the world for the industry to meet the growing supply deficit. The sustainability of this activity recovery will be defined by the financial viability of the entire oil industry value chain, which will vary significantly from country to country. And in places where the total value chain remains in a chronic financial shortfall, the increase in activity will not be sustainable.","A key question in this respect is the sustainability of a North American land recovery where the cumulative industry earnings and free cash flow was negative over the last cycle. And given the resulting financial state of the value chain in this commoditized market, a large wave of cost inflation from every part of the supplier industry is now building, which the E&P companies will have to absorb in parallel with implementing their activity growth plans.","As we now enter the next phase of the cycle, the breadth and depth of our technology offering, together with our geographical scale and our knowledge of the financial viability of the industry value chain in each operating country will clearly set us apart and further enable us to deliver differentiated financial results going forward.","In preparation for the next phase, we have already reenergized our management team and formulated detailed plans for how we will navigate this new environment. And as part of this, we have set ourselves a companywide goal on delivering incremental margins higher than 65% on the forthcoming activity growth.","The combination of the tactical and strategic moves we have made and are continuing to make has enabled us to navigate the challenging industry environment better than most, and above all, will ensure that Schlumberger continues to remain at the absolute forefront of an industry that is set to undergo significant change in the coming years.","That concludes my remarks. We will now open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. And one moment, please, for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning, guys. Paal, after...","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, James.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","...after that discussion on the future of the global industry, which was nothing short of very impressive, I feel bad asking such pedestrian questions as I have but I'll give it a shot. You talk about pricing and sustainability and the unsustainable pricing that we have, investor focus today seems definitely to be on North America because the expectation it's going to recover first. And in North America, the biggest concern still seems to be on pressure pumping. And historically, you guys would improve your margins by increasing utilization of equipment, and that would be the first big run in improving your margins and then pricing would follow at some point in the future as utilization got higher.","You talk about how things are different this time. Can you talk about your outlook for what happens in the U.S. pressure pumping market, how fast pricing comes back, how you will be able to get pricing and what will cause that pricing improvement ahead of some of your peers? I guess that's more of a technology versus commodity discussion. But can you walk us through, just on a regional basis, if you would, your outlook on how pressure pumping utilization and pricing evolve over the next year or two?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that's quite a broad question, Jim, but I would say that we are clear that we have reached the bottom of activity in North America land, and that activity will increase not in a V shape dramatic fashion but I think there will be a steady increase in rig counts and associated frac activity, both from the rigs as from wells coming out of the DUC inventory.","Now again, I think the activity will be more slow and steady. And obviously, with higher utilization, there is some contribution to margins. But margins are deeply negative and I would say at this stage, more activity at the current margin level is just going to be dilutive to earnings. So I think most companies now will be looking for price increases and, in fact, significant price increases actually to bring profitability back to breakeven and into positive territory before that activity is particularly attractive in terms of driving earnings back to previous year's levels.","So how do we get the pricing? I think, obviously, technology, efficiency, managing supply chain is going to be important, but I think overall, the entire value chain in North America is highly stressed. As I indicated, in the previous cycle, it's cumulatively negative both on profits and free cash flow so I don't think there is an open-ended dramatic improvement at hand without doing anything.","I think technology has to play a very important role in this. We've said in many foras that if you look at the cost per well, I think we are in late innings, but in terms of production per well, we are in very early innings. And if you want to drive down cost per barrel, we have to look at ways of getting more production out of each well. But \u2013 although utilization will help but given the pain that the entire industry value chain is in, there's going to be a mounting wave of cost inflation from every supplier in that chain, which I think is going to put significant pressure on how quickly activity can recover.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's very helpful. And my follow-up if I could, you mentioned Canada and the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Mexico in terms of WesternGeco, exploration has been in the ditch for the last two and a half years and from the sound of it, WesternGeco appeared to have a very good quarter. Should we see this as the beginning of some level of recovery in seismic and in exploration overall?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I would love to say yes to that but I think it's unfortunately premature. I would complement WesternGeco on actually doing a very good job in gaining market share and getting projects which are financially viable, driven again by technology and how well they execute. They've also been good at positioning ourselves in terms of multiclient activity where we continue to get good pre-funding. But I would say there is no immediate, I would say, dramatic comeback in exploration or in seismic in particular, but within the context of a very depressed market, WesternGeco is actually performing quite well","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Paal, thank you. Impressive presentation. Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jim.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.","J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, thanks. Good morning. So Paal, during the downturn one of the concerns is that if you lose pricing internationally, you never get it back. But clearly, you're quite confident recouping much of the pricing concessions. I guess once again \u2013 sorry asking a dumb question \u2013 but what makes the difference this time. Is it the repricing triggers you have in your contracts? Is it the competitive dynamics have clearly shifted here or is it the oil prices giving you the confidence to recoup those pricings?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","If you compare it to the previous downturn in 2009, at that stage, the industry came off a massive price increase period of four years, five years. And at that stage, pricing came down and it basically has not come back since then. So we are in a very different situation industrywide at this stage where the service industry hasn't had a price increase in the period in between now and 2009, so there isn't that much to give. Profitability for the more profitable companies have come through internal transformations and through significant investments in technology, like in our case. So we have not gained any pricing so we have very little pricing to give up.","Now in a dramatic downturn as we have been experiencing over the past seven quarters, there is a need to align with the customer base, which obviously has immediate oil price exposure, and we have done that, and the vast majority of the pricing concessions we have made to existing and valid contracts are temporary in nature, they're either time bound or they are linked to some kind of oil price trigger. And that's why we have aligned with our customers on the down of the cycle and we now expect that, that would be returned to us as oil prices start to increase. So it is quite a different situation today than the previous downturn that we were facing in 2009 and 2010.","J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And I guess \u2013 perhaps you could just expand a little bit on the increased activity you were talking about in the Middle East, particularly in the GCC. You've been talking about Kuwait's getting a little better, you talked about some increases in Saudi. Is there any talk over there about perhaps expansion projects or maybe a renewed focus on improving recovery rates that have a greater technology component for you? Any shift along those lines?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think there is a constant discussion within all of these large producers in the core part of OPEC or in the GCC around how they maintain or even increase production, right. So it varies by country and we leave it up to the country to, I would say, formalize and state those plans. But I would say Saudi has an active program to maintain their maximum sustainable production level which is widely known, while there are also very active programs in both the UAE and Kuwait to increase production. This includes both drilling of wells, seismic activity, as well as fracking and even surface facilities. So we are very actively involved in all aspects of this, our technology is very central to all of these projects and we are extremely well placed to continue to take our share of the growth in activity in this part of the world.","J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks a lot. I wonder whether you could talk a bit about the opportunity for Schlumberger to drive better pricing and margins through integration and technology. Is this an opportunity that's best presented in North America or is it in certain international markets? Can you talk a little bit more specific about when and where exactly we should expect you to sign for this first?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, as you know, Ole, we have a broad range of integration capabilities, which ranges all the way from project coordination to integrated drilling, integrated production and all the way up to SPM. And I think those four models are applicable in pretty much every country and basin around the world, depending on the state of the customer, the interest of the customer and what kind of resources they're developing, right. But we see a general, I would say, adaptation of all aspects of integration taking place all around the world.","The least impact of integration so far, if I just look at the high level, has been in North America where it's still rather fragmented in between the rig and the various parts of the drilling process as well as in the production and completion part of the work. So we are continuing to drive forward our offering around creating a total drilling system and a total completion system, including fracking, for the land markets. And I'm quite optimistic that these should have significant uptake even in places like U.S. land or some of the other unconventional basins around the world, but the general adaptation of more integration we are seeing, and we continue to invest into that both from a hardware and software process control standpoint.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. And then when it comes to the when and where, you addressed the where but the when part, is there something we should start to see already now in the third quarter, some evidence that \u2013 some of the initiatives you're rolling out actually translates to higher margins if it does look at what you're doing internally and isolate away the broader cycle?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, in terms of margins, I think \u2013 we are looking to get margins in the base business as well right, because that's where we have made the largest pricing concessions and that's where we also want to get back some of the temporary concessions we've made. But I think all the integration-related business offerings we have is executed well and well aligned with the customer, brings value in terms of higher profitability to us but also lower cost per barrel for our customers, right.","So in terms of timing of it, Ole, it's difficult to say that you're going to see some kind of major impact in one particular quarter. I think the level of integration-related activity has held up well, I would say, during this downturn. It is down in percentage terms, which you would expect, but it has held up well as well as our new technology sales has held up well also during the cycle. So I think we're very well positioned. And as activity starts to increase and resources, both on the customer side as well as on the service industry side, becomes shorter, then I think the multi-skilling and presenting one package with simpler interfaces is going to be quite appealing to the customer base.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Makes sense. My follow-up with you, Scott. If you could give us a little bit more detail on the Greater Enfield, where it seems to be quite a few firsts there in terms of integration of reservoir management and flow assurance to the hardware side. And if you could talk just a little bit through what exactly is it that's new in terms of what you achieved with this contract.","Robert Scott Rowe - President - Cameron Group, Schlumberger Limited","Yeah, good.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","What does it entail?","Robert Scott Rowe - President - Cameron Group, Schlumberger Limited","Yeah, absolutely, Ole. Look, this is a flagship win for the OneSubsea team and, as you know, we've been working with Woodside for a long time to first win their frame agreement then indeed to move this project forward. But as Paal just discussed, right, this is a big technology play and it allows us to preserve some pricing because we can uniquely differentiate ourselves from anybody else.","But what we've done here is essentially provide relatively standard horizontal trees combined with the boosting system and then the real technology is with the Unified Controls System that will span both the boosting system and the subsea architecture as well as the completion with the landing string. And so now, we've got a Unified Controls System that controls all aspects that sit on the seafloor, and you could imagine the cost savings for the customer when you bring all of that together. So, again, we've worked real hard with Woodside. We're very excited to move this project forward with them and we think it's a great example of the true capabilities of OneSubsea.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ole.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Good afternoon, gentlemen.","Robert Scott Rowe - President - Cameron Group, Schlumberger Limited","Good morning.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","So maybe as a quick follow-up on the Cameron question for Scott. Very impressive margins in the quarter. Can you give us your thoughts about margins moving forward into the back half of the year and maybe even 2017, and also discuss what your order outlook is out there, what you're hearing and seeing as far as opportunities for OneSubsea.","Robert Scott Rowe - President - Cameron Group, Schlumberger Limited","Sure. It's a broad question but we can provide some general guidance here. Look. The 15.8% that we were able to achieve in the quarter was exceptional. And as you know, it's one of the highest quarters we've ever had. The forward look is a little bit complicated because what's happening is we've got really strong execution in both Drilling, OneSubsea and Process systems, and those are our bigger backlog and longer-cycle businesses, and those are going to start to come down. And now, you've got a lot of pricing pressure that we've seen in 2015 start to come into the mix.","And so we think 15.8% is a very high level, that will start to taper down here in the quarters to come. And then where we really start to see some uplift and it's a matter of timing here, but as Paal described, right, we do believe we're going to get pricing in the shorter-cycle businesses, so both Surface and Valves & Measurement. And then in addition to that, you start to layer in the synergies from the integration itself. And so I don't expect us to exceed the 15.8% here in the short term. I think that comes down steadily over time. But then as we get pricing traction and those short-cycle businesses begin to pick up, we could indeed see those margins come back up into a higher territory.","And in terms of booking outlook, I'll start with deepwater. And what I'll say is it is in a very bad state in terms of progressing and moving projects forward. And we're very fortunate to work with Woodside and get one past FID, but we don't see any major projects here for the remainder of the year. In fact, our estimates for trees this year are less than 100. There are a few projects out there next year that are relatively large in size. We feel good about our ability to work with operators and achieve those, but at the same time, the industry has got significant capacity, and those are going to be incredibly competitive.","And so I'm a little concerned about the outlook with deepwater. Now, however, the counter to that is we have a very strong belief in what we're doing with OneSubsea. And like I described in the opening comments, right, the ability to tie the reservoir to what we're doing, drive cost out of the system through our standardized approach and then get more out of production, we feel very good about that.","On the other businesses, Surface and V&M are tied to rig count and they have a significant North American exposure and, as Paal described, we think those markets start to increase here going forward. And so that's going to be the big kind of flux position for us, if you will, if those start to come back faster, then our outlook starts to look pretty good.","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. Very, very helpful Scott. And then one more for Paal is, when we think of Schlumberger in the past and we think about revenue growth, we used to think through it on a GeoMarket basis and you guys have done a very good job in recent presentations giving the incremental margin opportunities across your product lines. So when you think about now your product segments and the rank order of revenue growth coming out of the trough, is it fair to think that Production and Drilling has the largest revenue opportunities out of the bottom followed by Cameron and Characterization? And any thoughts on magnitude of difference would be helpful.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So I think that's a reasonable assumption, Angie. We believe that the activity increase that we are going to see in the coming quarters is going to be very closely associated with production. And that's either linked to that drilling or the completion part of production. So our Drilling Group and our Production Group, I think, are the ones that will see the quickest impact of higher E&P investments.","Now with that said, at some stage, the industry will need to start exploring again, and the level of exploration-related activity is at an unprecedented low. So obviously a huge growth runway for our Characterization Group going forward when that starts to kick in, but I think you're right in assuming that that will be after the initial uptick in well-related development type of activity. And I think Scott has described very well the impact on Cameron, the long-cycle businesses, I think, will follow after the short cycle ones. So I think that's a good set of assumptions.","Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Fair enough. Thanks. I'll turn it over.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good afternoon where you are.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So Paal, I wanted to follow up here on comments on incremental margin goal of 65%. And I was hoping that you could provide a little additional color around that target vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. market and the international market, and then I have additional follow-up after that.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. So first of all, I didn't say 65% I said north of 65%.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I got it.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not ready to sort of break it down for you in any more geographical granularity other than it is a high level goal, it's an ambitious goal, but there is a logic behind it. I think first of all, our decrementals for 2015 and so far in 2016 is in the range of 30% to 32%. And if you can double the incremental from that decremental rate, that means that you should be able to restore 2014 earnings, which is the place we want to be as quickly as possible to continue to deliver on the plan we laid out in the 2014 investor conference, we can actually recover 2014 earnings by only a 50% recovery in the revenue drops that we've seen since 2014.","Now there is a lot of work behind the number in terms of how achievable it is. But as an example, in 2014 in the international market, on a pretty low revenue growth rate of 3%, 4%, we actually delivered 69% incrementals without any price in the international markets. So we have a precedence for doing it, it's obviously going to be challenging to do that also in North America, in particular North America land, but with the impact, we will have to have from price on this, we are for sure going to try to deliver incrementals north of 65%, yes.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then the follow up on that is regards to timing. So is the target of north of 65% incrementals by the end of 2016, is it for full year 2017? Can you just give us some general, might be hard to give the specifics, but some general views on when you're pushing to get that done?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think I would look at it in the following way. I would say that activity growth associated with some pricing recovery should \u2013 we are aiming to deliver north of 65% on that. So I think as we now navigate the bottom and we aren't expecting a uniform V shaped recovery here. Like I said, it's going to be in slow and steady recovery. Some of countries that we operate in will stay flat longer. Some of them might go down a little bit further. But overall, we believe we are at bottom and when we see consistent growth in any geography, this is the incremental that we are looking for. And as the entire company gets back into a more solid growth mode, that's when we should approach the companywide 65%. But we are targeting 65% incrementals on the growth that we are seeing going forward.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great color. Thanks, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons. Please go ahead.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International","Thanks. Paal, if we could just talk a little bit about the near term, if you will. You waxed optimistic here with regard to the industry bottoming and focusing more on market share strengthening versus, I guess, protecting decrementals and pricing recapture and high-grading of contracts. And yet, we just had a significant pre-tax charge, your rightsizing continues to be pretty assertive, and we've laid off 16,000 people in the first half. So I'm trying to reconcile those two, the challenges you see in the near term. And specifically, can we talk about Q3 in terms of what the sequential headwinds and tailwinds are and whether you think earnings per share, flat, up or down quarter-on-quarter?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So in terms of the charge that we've taken, this is basically catching up and finalizing the resizing of the company, which has now been dropping in activity levels over the past seven quarters. So this charge is linked to a number of things that we have been executing in the second quarter. And should bring the company into the shape where we are well positioned to navigate the bottom of the market and also well positioned to start growing again going forward. So we put a lot of details and scrutiny into any kind of impairment charge that we take and we have done so as well in the charge for Q2, which is sizable, but we believe this is prudent, this is right and it's justified to do what we've done and that's why we did it.","Now in terms of the outlook, like I said, we are at the bottom but we are not expecting an immediate and sharp recovery. If you look at North America versus international and some of the moving parts going into Q3, North America still has significant overcapacity at this stage in terms of services. And the low barrier to entry is also going to continue to be a major headwind, right. So we expect modest increase in land activity but this is going to be partially offset by lower offshore work. We are significantly down in Alaska, in Eastern Canada, as well as in the Gulf of Mexico.","We expect some improvement in pricing but it's going to be way short of the level required to breakeven into Q3. So we don't expect any major positive earnings improvement from North America in Q3 but it shouldn't get much worse either, right. So fairly, fairly stable earnings for North America in the third quarter. And fairly similar international markets, there's less overcapacity there due to the higher barrier entry and it's also quite a narrowing competitive landscape. So in principle, it should be easier to recover some of the temporary pricing concessions that we have made which, in most cases, in international market is also time bound or linked to the oil price. But given the limited increase in activity we see for Q3, again, we don't expect any significant positive sequential earnings contribution from international. So overall, we expect flattish EPS in Q3.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International","Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, I'm just curious with regard to the discussion that you're having with resource holders and especially domestic resource holders, just given the evisceration and impairment of the oil service value chain on the one hand, and the desire on the part of resource holders to preserve the efficiencies that they've won and earned over the course of this downturn, is there a recognition on their part that there are probably less than a handful of companies who possess both the operational and financial flexibility to in fact preserve those efficiencies for them?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, if you talk about efficiencies, are you talking about their current cost per barrel? Because that is to a large extent driven by very low service pricing, right. So I think there's no company in North America that is able to continue for a long period of time to operate at these pricing levels. But if you talk about the technical performance of how efficient we drill and how efficient we frac...","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International","Yeah.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","...I agree with you. There's a handful of companies that can do that and I think that number is shrinking. And unless there is some pricing recovery and some ways to create more financially viable contracts for even these limited number of companies, that number is going to shrink further, yes.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International","All right. Thank you, sir.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Simon Farrant - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay. So we see that there are a number of questions still remaining and we're going to extend the call another 5 minutes to 10 minutes. So operator, please can you give us the next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","James C. West - Evercore ISI","Hey, good morning, guys.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","James C. West - Evercore ISI","Paal, clearly the strategy of the company has changed. You're switching to offense from playing defense with decrementals. This was obviously not a new strategy or you wouldn't be telling us about it today, it's not happening today. So I'm curious with this shift, when did you start, what's guidance you've given to your management team, and what has the customer response been so far to this trend of we're going to regain pricing and we will not work at these kind of pricing levels going forward?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So we've started this dialogue and this engagement, first of all, internally with our senior management team during the second quarter. This is not a \u2013 it's not a surprising playbook. At some stage when you do approach bottom, this is the shift that you need to make.","James C. West - Evercore ISI","Right.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But we have, I would say, done this in a concerted fashion during the second quarter. We have had very good discussions with the senior management team and laid our plans for how are we going to now shift the focus and how we navigate the next phase.","And as I said earlier on, the understanding of the viability and state of the industry value chain in each of the 80 countries we operate in is extremely important to make sure that you are optimally positioned to capture the market in the countries which we believe are going to see a sustainable increase in activity, where we can also generate sustainable earnings going forward, right. So we spend a lot of time internally with the team to lay out these plans and put this methodology in place, so we are in good shape there. We're already in execution mode of it. And in terms of the engagement with the customers, it's started. It's still at a fairly, I would say, low frequency but that is now what we will do much more widespread as we enter the third quarter here.","But obviously, a lot of these discussions are going to be challenging. There's not a lot of surplus in any situation but we believe that the temporary concessions we have made, at least part of that will need to be returned to us. But in return for that, we are very open to engage in different types of collaborations where we through a better management of the interface and better commercial alignment and together drive unnecessary costs out of the system, so that we can make a more or the industry value chain viable in many countries around the world. So that's certainly the objective.","James C. West - Evercore ISI","And that would mean increasing your scope or adding performance-based metrics to the contracts?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely. Both of those are aspects that we believe will generate total value that then can be shared between the supplier and the E&P companies, and also back to what we talked about earlier in the call, all around the integration offering that we have and that we continue to invest into.","James C. West - Evercore ISI","Right. Okay. And then a follow-up from me on the market share. You commented in your press release about market share gains or tender wins in recent quarters. How much of this is due to, perhaps, technology or how much of this is due to just the fact that there's really only you and one other \u2013 globally now \u2013 that participate in the market and you've seen a lot of your competitors just drop out?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think the narrowing competitive environment has some impact on this. And also I think if you look at margin performance over the past 18 months in the international market in between several of the large players, some of these players are already in the red, in which case their room to take on contracts which they might feel is challenging is very, very limited. So the position we have in terms of strength, both in footprint, scale, local knowledge as well as the overall contract portfolio we have, allows us to be quite competitive in these tenders. And I think very importantly as well is to look at the difference between the contract portfolio and maybe the immediate revenue translation of these contracts.","In the international market, it's very important to have the contracts, and we have a range of contracts today that we have won with very little activity in them, but they have potential for significant increases in activity in terms of rig additions and so forth going forward. So what is very important over the past year, which we have had a lot of focus on, has been the tender win rate and then having the contracts and then being able to translate that into revenue in the coming one to two years.","James C. West - Evercore ISI","Thanks, Paal.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks. Paal, if I could follow up on your comment that the industry needs to improve efficiencies through I think you said innovative hardware and high-level software control systems. In the press release, there's an anecdote noting a pretty big drop in pump and blender NPT and R&M expense through the use of RCM technology and predictive analytics. I was wondering how scalable these types of applications are and whether or not the deployment depends on the introduction of the next generation frac spread or can it be rolled out on the legacy fleet?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So for that particular application, it is being rolled out on the legacy fleet. These are measurements that we are currently recording and we have been for quite a while. And this is one example of what we can do by being able to first organize our data in a way where it's accessible and then building the right analytic applications on top of it and then providing that to our fleet operations.","So over the past 18 months or so, we have undertaken a massive reorganization of the entire database we have and the data we record on a daily basis from our operations into a cutting-edge data lake, which is then accessible for these type of applications. And we've also established a new applications group which then has the ability to build these analytics and tap into the data lake and provide this type of information for our operations.","So the example you refer to in pressure pumping is one, we have a multitude of similar type of applications being built and which are going to be deployed in the near future with a similar type of impact on the operation, and this is all part of the transformation program that we've been talking about for several years.","Robert Scott Rowe - President - Cameron Group, Schlumberger Limited","If I could just add, this is a big part of the Cameron integration as well, right. So in Cameron, we really didn't progress the ability to collect data on our equipment and what we're doing is tapping in to the expertise here at Schlumberger. And in fact, more than half of our 30 integrated technology programs are around the theme of controls and predictive maintenance and reliability.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And just so I understand the quantitative impact, this $30 million reference of three-year cost savings, that was just with respect to that one test fleet?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Correct.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And if I could ask a follow-up quickly for Simon, in terms of the working capital management during the downturn, it's obviously been remarkable here. So, first of all, kudos. But my question really is how the transformation initiatives will work in recovery when working capital actually becomes a use of cash?","Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Michael, as you mentioned, we performed well in second quarter despite some exceptional payments. And the transformation program is helping us quite a bit, it's on the CapEx side on some of the cost elements, collection of receivables. I mean the transformation program is across the board on most of our activity and processes. So it is going to \u2013 we're looking forward to not to consume as much cash in the upturn because first, we do have excess equipment, and we don't think the CapEx is going to turn around in a major way. And, yes, the transformation program will continue to contribute as it contributed in the downturn.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Michael, just one clarification. So you asked me about the savings. So the savings we quoted was for all the test fleets we had in South Texas. It was not just one fleet.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Not just one. Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sorry, did I get the concern you have or the answer that you're looking for?","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes, you did, Simon. I was really sort of thinking about inventory and I guess the excess equipment has a big impact on that, so thank you.","Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Inventory is a big part of it as well, yes. That's what I meant by managing the material and supplies as well.","Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah. Excellent. Thank you, guys.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of Dan Boyd with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Thanks for squeezing me on. So, Paal, you've been very clear that international is going to be the driver of earnings getting back to the 2015 or 2014 level, but some of your comments on North America have been a little bit more mixed, so just trying to understand what you're saying there about how the transformation program will pay dividends in the future. But are you also implying there that you can get back to peak margins in North America on a significantly lower rig count than what we saw previously?","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, so just to clarify, so I'm saying that obviously our international business and the state of that and the state of the international industry value chain is in much better shape than what the North American value chain is, in which case the basis for sustainable earnings growth at this stage is much higher and better internationally.","Now in North America, I think you've got to separate the industry view from just how Schlumberger navigates in the system, and I think the industry, I think there are some questions and challenges to be asked, right. How is the industry in the next upcoming cycle going to be able to operate where the entire value chain ends up being cash flow and profit-positive as we enter into a complete new cycle? That was not the case in the previous cycle, and I don't think we can go on for many cycles in a similar type of fashion.","Now there is a part of North America land which is viable, even at lower prices, but how big that is and how much you can step up from the core acreage, I think, is to be seen. Now how we operate in that, we are aiming to be very competitive on efficiency and, in addition to that, continue to bring new technology into play which can help our customers and drive up production per well. And we have a very good offering already in place for that.","So we will continue to operate the way we have been with a focus in both these dimensions. But I think at this stage, if you look at the state of the industry value chain, I can't tell you that we are going to get back to previous peak margins in North America or North America land because at this stage, I just don't see how that can be funded in the entire value chain.","Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thanks, and then one last one for Simon. Lots of free cash flow generation, but buybacks pretty much slowed to a trickle this quarter. So what happened there and what's the plan going forward?","Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good question. So, look. We always said that we'll be opportunistic on our buyback, and we use excess cash or remaining cash, normally, after the business needs, to return it through buybacks. The $11.6 billion that we have in cash obviously do reflect excess cash. But excess cash should not be looked at on a one given period, we have to project several quarters in advance.","And during the quarter, there were major cash movements in relation to the Cameron acquisition. The cash we paid to the shareholders, we bought back some of the debt of Cameron. So we took a decision to slow down the buyback, sit back, reassess our need of cash, given all the opportunities we have in front of us, and we will go back into the market. We're always in the market. Our policy will continue to be in the market, but it is not going to be evenly spread going forward.","Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. Thanks a lot.","Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And it is an exceptional period during the quarter due to the acquisition and basically a reassessment of how we're going to use the cash, but buyback will always be a part of our plan.","Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you. So before we close this morning, I would like to summarize the four most important points that we discussed. First, we believe that we've reached the bottom of the cycle and that E&P investments now have to increase in order for the industry to meet the growing supply deficit. As E&P investment starts growing, a large part will initially have to be consumed on supplier industry price increases in order for capacity and capabilities to be available and for operating standards to be met.","Second, most basins around the world are today at unprecedented low levels of activity and we expect to see a broad-based increase in investments going forward funded by higher oil prices. The magnitude and sustainability of the investment increase will, however, be a function of the financial viability of the entire oil industry value chain in each basin and country which will vary significantly.","Third, our deep local knowledge, the breadth and depth of our technology offering together with our geographical scale will clearly set us apart and further enable us to deliver differentiated financial results going forward.","And fourth, the shortfall in profits and cash flow throughout the entire industry value chain can only be permanently addressed by a dramatic step change in industry performance, including intrinsic quality and efficiency, technology system innovations, and more aligned and collaborative business models, and Schlumberger is and will remain at the absolute forefront of this industry transformation.","That concludes today's call. Thank you for participating.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference. You may now disconnect."]}}
